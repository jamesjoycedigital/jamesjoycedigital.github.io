<br>
<p> Urbane, to comfort them, the quaker librarian purred:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And we have, have we not, those priceless pages of
<i>Wilhelm Meister</i>? A great poet on a great brother poet. A hesitating soul
taking arms against a sea of troubles, torn by conflicting doubts, as one sees in real life.</p>
<p> He came a step a sinkapace forward on neatsleather creaking and a step backward a sinkapace on the solemn floor.</p>
<p> A noiseless attendant, setting open the door but slightly, made him a noiseless beck.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Directly, said he, creaking to go, albeit lingering. The
beautiful ineffectual dreamer who comes to grief against hard facts. One always
feels that Goethe&apos;s judgments are so true. True in the larger analysis.</p>
<p> Twicreakingly analysis he corantoed off. Bald, most zealous by the door he
gave his large ear all to the attendant&apos;s words: heard them: and was gone.</p>
<p> Two left.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Monsieur de la
Palice<a target="foot" id="fkk0001">&ordm;</a>, Stephen sneered, was alive fifteen minutes before his death.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Have you found those
<a name="jn1046b" href="../../FF/unbs/jn1all.htm#jn1046b">six brave medicals,
John Eglinton asked with elder&apos;s gall, to write <i>Paradise
Lost</i></a><a target="foot" id="fkk0002">&ordm;</a>
<a name="jn1046b" href="../../FF/unbs/jn1all.htm#jn1046b">at your dictation</a>?
<a name="un4011c" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4011c"><i>The Sorrows of

<p> Smile. Smile Cranly&apos;s smile. </p>
<p class="set"><i>First he tickled her</i>
<br> <i>Then he patted her

<br> Jolly old medi</i>&nbsp;&hellip;
<br><font color="green">{u22, 177}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I feel you would need one more for <i>Hamlet</i>. Seven is
dear to the mystic mind. The shining seven W.&nbsp;B. calls them.</p>
<p> Glittereyed, his rufous skull close to his greencapped desklamp sought the
face, bearded amid darkgreener shadow, an ollav, holyeyed. He laughed low: a
sizar&apos;s laugh of Trinity: unanswered.</p>
<p class="set"><i>Orchestral Satan, weeping many a rood
<br> Tears such as angels weep</i>.
<br> <i>Ed egli avea del cul fatto trombetta</i>.</p>
<p> He holds my follies hostage.</p>
<p> Cranly&apos;s eleven true Wicklowmen to free their sireland. Gaptoothed
Kathleen, her four beautiful green fields, the stranger in her house. And one
more to hail him: <i>ave, rabbi</i>. The Tinahely twelve. In the shadow of the
glen he cooees for them. My soul&apos;s youth I gave him, night by night. Godspeed. Good hunting.</p>
<p> Mulligan has my telegram.</p>
<p> Folly. Persist.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Our young Irish bards, John Eglinton censured, have yet to
create a figure which the world will set beside Saxon Shakespeare&apos;s Hamlet
though I admire him, as old Ben did, on this side idolatry.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; All these questions are purely academic, Russell oracled
out of his shadow. I mean, whether Hamlet is Shakespeare or James I or Essex.
Clergymen&apos;s discussions of
<a name="un1014e" href="../../FF/unbs/un1all.htm#un1014e">the historicity of
Jesus</a>. Art has to reveal to us ideas, formless spiritual essences. The
supreme question about a work of art is out of how deep a life does it spring.
The painting of Gustave Moreau is the painting of ideas. The deepest poetry of
Shelley, the words of Hamlet bring our
mind<a target="foot" id="fkk0004">&ordm;</a> into contact with the eternal
wisdom, Plato&apos;s world of ideas. All the rest is the speculation of schoolboys for schoolboys. </p>
<p> A.&nbsp;E. has been telling some yankee interviewer. Wall, tarnation strike me!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The schoolmen were schoolboys first, Stephen said
superpolitely. Aristotle was once Plato&apos;s schoolboy.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And has remained so, one should hope, John Eglinton
sedately said. One can see him, a model schoolboy with his diploma under his arm.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 178}</font> </p>
<p> He laughed again at the now smiling bearded face.</p>

<p> Mr Best entered, tall, young, mild, light. He bore in his hand with grace a notebook, new, large, clean, bright.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That model schoolboy, Stephen said, would find
Hamlet&apos;s musings about the afterlife of his princely soul, the improbable,
insignificant and undramatic monologue, as shallow as Plato&apos;s.</p>
<p> John Eglinton, frowning, said, waxing wroth:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Upon my word it makes my blood boil to hear anyone compare Aristotle with Plato.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Which of the two, Stephen asked, would have banished me from his commonwealth?</p>
<p> Unsheathe your dagger definitions.
<a name="un4011bi" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4011bi">Horseness is the
whatness of allhorse.</a> Streams of tendency and eons they worship. God: noise
 in the street: very peripatetic. Space: what you damn well have to see. Through
spaces smaller than red globules of man&apos;s blood they creepycrawl after
Blake&apos;s buttocks into eternity of which this vegetable world is but a
shadow. Hold to the now, the here, through which all future plunges to the past.</p>
<p> Mr Best came forward, amiable, towards his colleague.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Haines is gone, he said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Is he?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I was showing him Jubainville&apos;s book. He&apos;s quite
enthusiastic, don&apos;t you know, about Hyde&apos;s <i>Lovesongs of
Connacht.</i> I couldn&apos;t bring him in to hear the discussion. He&apos;s gone to Gill&apos;s to buy it.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 179}</font> </p>
<p class="set"><i>Bound thee forth, my booklet, quick</i>
<br> <i>To greet the callous public.</i>
<br> <i>Writ, I ween, &apos;twas not my wish</i>
<br> <i>In lean unlovely English.</i></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The peatsmoke is going to his head, John Eglinton opined.</p>
<p> We feel in England. Penitent thief. Gone. I smoked his baccy. Green
twinkling stone. An emerald set in the ring of the sea.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; People do not know how dangerous lovesongs can be, the
auric egg of Russell warned occultly. The movements which work revolutions in
the world are born out of the dreams and visions in a peasant&apos;s heart on
the hillside. For them the earth is not an exploitable ground but the living
mother. The rarefied air of the academy and the arena produce the sixshilling
novel, the musichall song.<a target="foot" id="fkk0006">&ordm;</a> France
produces the finest flower of corruption in Mallarm&eacute; but the desirable
life is revealed only to the poor of heart, the life of Homer&apos;s
Phaeacians<a target="foot" id="fkk0007">&ordm;</a>.</p>
<p> From these words Mr Best turned an unoffending face to Stephen.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Mallarm&eacute;, don&apos;t you know, he said, has written
those wonderful prose poems Stephen MacKenna used to read to me in Paris. The
one about <i>Hamlet</i>. He says: <i>il se prom&egrave;ne, lisant au livre de
lui-m&ecirc;me</i>, don&apos;t you know, <i>reading the book of himself</i>. He
describes <i>Hamlet</i> given in a French town, don&apos;t you know, a provincial town. They advertised it.</p>
<p> His free hand graciously wrote tiny signs in air. </p>
<p class="center"><i>Hamlet</i></p>
<p class="center"><i>ou</i></p>
<p class="center"><i>Le Distrait</i></p>
<p class="center"><i>Pi&egrave;ce de Shakespeare</i></p>
<p> He repeated to John Eglinton&apos;s newgathered frown:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>Pi&egrave;ce de Shakespeare</i>, don&apos;t you know.
It&apos;s so French, the French point of view. <i>Hamlet ou</i>&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The absentminded beggar, Stephen ended.</p>
<p> John Eglinton laughed.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, I suppose it would be, he said. Excellent people, no
doubt, but distressingly shortsighted in some matters.</p>
<p> Sumptuous and stagnant exaggeration of murder.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 180}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A deathsman of the soul Robert Greene called him, Stephen
said. Not for nothing was he a butcher&apos;s
son,<a target="foot" id="fkk0008">&ordm;</a> wielding the sledded poleaxe and
spitting in his palm<a target="foot" id="fkk0009">&ordm;</a>. Nine lives are
taken off for his father&apos;s one.<a target="foot" id="fkk0010">&ordm;</a>
<a name="un5016e" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5016e"></a>Our Father who art
in purgatory<a target="foot" id="fkk0011">&ordm;</a>. Khaki Hamlets don&apos;t
hesitate to shoot. The bloodboltered shambles in act five is a forecast of the
concentration camp sung by Mr Swinburne.</p>
<p> Cranly, I his mute orderly, following<a target="foot" id="fkk0012">&ordm;</a> battles from afar.</p>
<p class="set"><i>Whelps and dams of murderous foes whom none
<br> But we had spared</i>&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> <a name="un4011an" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4011an">Between the
Saxon smile and yankee yawp. The devil and the deep sea.</a></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He will have it that <i>Hamlet</i> is a ghoststory, John
Eglinton said for Mr Best&apos;s behoof. Like the fat boy in Pickwick he wants to make our flesh creep.</p>
<p class="set"><i>List! List! O list!</i></p>
<p> My flesh hears him: creeping, hears.</p>
<p class="set"><i>If thou didst ever</i>&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What is a ghost? Stephen said with tingling energy. One
who  has faded into impalpability through death, through absence, through change
of manners. Elizabethan London lay as far from Stratford as corrupt Paris lies
from virgin Dublin. Who is the ghost from <i>limbo patrum</i>, returning to the
world that has forgotten him? Who is king Hamlet?</p>
<p> John Eglinton shifted his spare body, leaning back to judge.</p>
<p> Lifted.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It is this hour of a
<a name="un4011ca" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4011ca">day in mid June</a>,
Stephen said, begging with a swift glance their hearing. The flag is up on the
playhouse by the bankside. The bear Sackerson growls in the pit near it, Paris
garden. Canvasclimbers<a target="foot" id="fkk0013">&ordm;</a> who sailed with
Drake chew their sausages among the groundlings.</p>
<p> Local colour. Work in all you know. Make them accomplices.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Shakespeare has left the huguenot&apos;s house in Silver
street and walks by the swanmews along the riverbank. But he does not stay to
feed the pen chivying her game of cygnets towards the rushes. The swan of Avon has other thoughts.</p>
<p> Composition of place.
<a name="gn1005a" href="../../FF/unbs/gn1all.htm#gn1005a">Ignatius Loyola, make haste to help me!</a>
<br><font color="green">{u22, 181}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The play begins. A player comes on under the shadow, made
up in the castoff mail of a court buck, a wellset man with a bass voice. It is
the ghost, the king,
<a name="un5016am" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5016am">a</a><a target="foot" id="fkk0014">&ordm;</a>
<a name="un5016am" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5016am">king and no
king,</a> and the player is Shakespeare
<a name="un4011ad" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4011ad">who has studied
<i>Hamlet</i> all the years of his life which were not vanity in order to play
the part of the spectre</a>. He speaks the words to Burbage, the young player
who stands before him beyond the rack of cerecloth, calling him by a name:</p>
<p class="set"><i>Hamlet, I am thy father&apos;s spirit</i></p>
<p class="flush">bidding him list. To a son he speaks, the son of his soul, the
prince, young Hamlet and to the son of his body, Hamnet Shakespeare, who has
died in Stratford that his namesake may live for ever.</p>
<p> Is<a target="foot" id="fkk0015">&ordm;</a> it possible that that player
Shakespeare, a ghost by absence, and in the vesture of buried Denmark, a ghost
by death, speaking his own words to his own son&apos;s name (had Hamnet
Shakespeare lived he would have been prince Hamlet&apos;s twin) is it possible,
I want to know,  or probable that he did not draw or foresee the logical
conclusion of those premises:
<a name="jn2007h" href="../../FF/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2007h">you are the
dispossessed</a><a target="foot" id="fkk0016">&ordm;</a>
<a name="jn2007h" href="../../FF/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2007h">son</a>: I am the
murdered father: your mother is the guilty queen, Ann Shakespeare, born Hathaway?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; But this prying into the family life of a great man, Russell began impatiently.</p>
<p> Art thou there, truepenny?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Interesting only to the parish clerk. I mean, we have the
plays. I mean when we read the poetry of <i>King Lear</i> what is it to us how
the poet lived? As for living, our servants can do that for us, Villiers de
l&apos;Isle has said. Peeping and prying into greenroom gossip of the day, the
poet&apos;s drinking, the poet&apos;s debts. We have <i>King Lear</i>: and it is immortal.</p>
<p> Mr Best&apos;s face,<a target="foot" id="fkk0017">&ordm;</a> appealed to, agreed.</p>
<p class="set"><i>Flow over them with your waves and with your waters, Mananaan,

<p> A. E. I. O. U.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Do you mean to fly in the face of the tradition of three
centuries? John Eglinton&apos;s carping voice asked. Her ghost at least has been
laid for ever. She died, for literature at least, before she was born.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; She died, Stephen retorted, sixtyseven years after she was
born. She saw him into and out of the world. She took his first embraces. She
bore his children and she laid pennies on his eyes to keep his eyelids closed when he lay on his deathbed.</p>
<p> Mother&apos;s deathbed. Candle. The sheeted mirror. Who brought me into this
world lies there, bronzelidded, under few cheap flowers. <i>Liliata rutilantium</i>.</p>
<p> I wept alone.</p>
<p> John Eglinton looked in the tangled glowworm of his lamp.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The world believes that Shakespeare made a mistake, he
said, and got out of it as quickly and as best he could.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Bosh! Stephen said rudely. A man of genius makes no
mistakes. His errors are volitional and are the portals of discovery.</p>
<p> Portals of discovery opened to let in the quaker librarian, softcreakfooted, bald, eared and assiduous.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A shrew, John Eglinton said shrewdly, is not a useful
portal of discovery, one should imagine. What useful discovery did Socrates learn from Xanthippe?
<br><font color="green">{u22, 183}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Dialectic, Stephen answered: and from his mother how to
bring thoughts into the world. What he learnt from
<a name="un6009h" href="../../FF/unbs/un6all.htm#un6009h">his other wife
Myrto</a> (<i>absit nomen!</i>),<a target="foot" id="fkk0019">&ordm;</a>
<a name="un6009i" href="../../FF/unbs/un6all.htm#un6009i">Socratididion&apos;s
Epipsychidion</a>, no man, not a woman, will ever know. But neither the
midwife&apos;s lore nor the caudlelectures saved him from the archons of Sinn Fein and their naggin of hemlock.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; But Ann Hathaway? Mr Best&apos;s quiet voice said
forgetfully. Yes, we seem to be forgetting her as Shakespeare himself forgot her.</p>
<p> His look went from brooder&apos;s beard to carper&apos;s skull, to remind,
to  chide them not unkindly, then to the baldpink lollard costard,
guiltless<a target="foot" id="fkk0020">&ordm;</a> though maligned.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He had a good groatsworth of wit, Stephen said, and no
truant memory. He carried a memory in his wallet as he trudged to Romeville
whistling <i>The girl I left behind me</i>. If the earthquake did not time it we
should know where to place poor Wat, sitting in his form,
<a name="un4011av" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4011av">the cry of
hounds,</a> the studded bridle and her blue windows. That memory, <i>Venus and
Adonis</i>, lay in the bedchamber<a target="foot" id="fkk0021">&ordm;</a> of
every light-of-love in London. Is Katharine the shrew illfavoured? Hortensio
calls her young and beautiful. Do you think the writer of <i>Antony and
Cleopatra</i>, a passionate pilgrim, had his eyes in the back of his head that
he chose the ugliest doxy in all Warwickshire to lie
withal?<a target="foot" id="fkk0022">&ordm;</a> Good: he left her and gained the
world of men. But his boywomen are the women of a boy. Their life, thought,
speech are lent them by males. He chose badly? He was chosen, it seems to me. If
others have their will Ann hath a way. By cock, she was to blame. She put the
comether on him, sweet and twentysix. The
<a name="un5016b" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5016b">greyeyed</a> goddess
who bends over the boy Adonis,
<a name="un4011i" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4011i">stooping to
conquer</a>, as prologue to the swelling act, is a boldfaced Stratford wench who
tumbles in a cornfield a lover younger than herself.</p>
<p> And my turn? When?</p>
<p> Come!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ryefield, Mr Best said brightly, gladly, raising his new book, gladly, brightly.</p>
<p> He murmured then with blond delight for all:</p>
<p class="diset">&mdash; <i>Between</i><a target="foot" id="fkk0023">&ordm;</a> <i>the acres of the rye

<p> Whither away? Exploitable ground.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Are you going, John Eglinton&apos;s active eyebrows asked.
Shall we see you at Moore&apos;s tonight? Piper is coming. </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Piper! Mr Best piped. Is Piper back?</p>
<p> Peter Piper pecked a peck of pick of peck of pickled pepper.</p>

librarian said, friendly and earnest. Mr Russell, rumour has it, is gathering
together a sheaf of our younger poets&apos; verses. We are all looking forward anxiously.</p>
<p> Anxiously he glanced in the cone of lamplight where three faces, lighted, shone.</p>
<p> See this. Remember.</p>
<p> Stephen looked down on a wide headless caubeen, hung on his ashplanthandle
over his knee. <a name="gn1016d" href="../../FF/unbs/gn1all.htm#gn1016d">My
casque and sword.</a> Touch lightly with two index fingers.

<p> Listen.</p>
<p> Young Colum and Starkey. George Roberts is doing the commercial part.
Longworth will give it a good puff in the <i>Express</i>. O, will he? I liked
Colum&apos;s <i>Drover</i>. Yes, I think he has
<a name="jn1034q" href="../../FF/unbs/jn1all.htm#jn1034q">that queer thing,
genius</a>. Do you think he has genius really? Yeats admired his line: <i>As in wild earth a Grecian vase.</i> Did he?
<br><font color="green">{u22, 185}</font>
<br> I hope you&apos;ll be able to come tonight. Malachi  Mulligan is coming
too. Moore asked him to bring Haines. Did you hear Miss Mitchell&apos;s joke
about Moore and Martyn? That Moore is Martyn&apos;s wild oats? Awfully clever,
isn&apos;t it? They remind one of don Quixote and Sancho Panza. Our national
epic has yet to be written,
<a name="un6009e" href="../../FF/unbs/un6all.htm#un6009e">Dr Sigerson</a> says.
Moore is the man for it. A knight of the rueful countenance here in Dublin. With
a saffron kilt? O&apos;Neill Russell? O, yes, he must speak the grand old
tongue. And his Dulcinea? James Stephens is doing some clever sketches. We are becoming important, it seems.</p>
<p> Cordelia. <i>Cordoglio</i>. Lir&apos;s loneliest daughter.</p>
<p> Nookshotten. Now your best French polish.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Thank you very much, Mr Russell, Stephen said, rising. If
you will be so kind as to give the letter to Mr Norman&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O, yes. If he considers it important it will go in. We have so much correspondence.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I understand, Stephen said. Thanks.</p>
<p> God ild you. The pigs&apos; paper. Bullockbefriending.</p>
<p> Synge<a target="foot" id="fkk0024">&ordm;</a> has promised me an article for
<i>Dana</i> too. Are we going to be read? I feel we are. The Gaelic league wants
something in Irish. I hope you will come round tonight. Bring Starkey.</p>
<p> Stephen sat down.</p>
<p> The quaker librarian came from the leavetakers. Blushing<a target="foot" id="fkk0025">&ordm;</a> his mask said:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Mr Dedalus, your views are most illuminating.</p>
<p> He creaked to and fro, tiptoing up nearer heaven by the altitude of a
chopine, and, covered by the noise of outgoing, said low:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Is it your view, then, that she was not faithful to the poet?</p>
<p> Alarmed face asks me. Why did he come? Courtesy or an inward light?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Where there is a reconciliation, Stephen said, there must have been first a sundering.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes.</p>
<p> Christfox in leather trews, hiding, a runaway in
<a name="un1032bs" href="../../FF/unbs/un1all.htm#un1032bs">blighted
treeforks</a> from hue and cry. Knowing no vixen, walking lonely in the chase.
 Women he won to him, tender people, a whore of Babylon, ladies of justices,
bully tapsters&apos; wives. Fox and geese. And in New place a slack dishonoured
body that once was comely, once as sweet, as fresh as cinnamon, now her leaves
falling, all, bare, frighted of the narrow grave and unforgiven.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes. So you think&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> The door closed behind the outgoer.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 186}</font> </p>
<p> Rest suddenly possessed the discreet vaulted cell, rest of warm and brooding air.</p>
<p> A vestal&apos;s lamp.</p>
<p> Here he ponders things that were not: what
Caesar<a target="foot" id="fkk0028">&ordm;</a> would have lived to do had he
believed the soothsayer: what might have been:
<a name="jn1012i" href="../../FF/unbs/jn1all.htm#jn1012i">possibilities of the
possible as possible</a>: things not known: what name Achilles bore when he lived among women.</p>
<p> Coffined thoughts around me, in mummycases, embalmed in spice of words.
Thoth, god of libraries, a birdgod, moonycrowned. And I heard the voice of that
Egyptian highpriest. <i>In painted chambers loaded with tilebooks</i>.</p>
<p> They are still. Once quick in the brains of men. Still: but an itch of death
is in them, to tell me in my ear a maudlin tale, urge me to wreak their will.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Certainly, John Eglinton mused, of all great men he is the
most enigmatic. We know nothing but that he lived and suffered. Not even so
much. Others abide our question. A shadow hangs over all the rest.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; But <i>Hamlet</i><a target="foot" id="fkk0029">&ordm;</a>
is so personal, isn&apos;t it? Mr Best pleaded. I mean, a kind of private paper,
don&apos;t you know, of his private life. I mean I don&apos;t care a button,
don&apos;t you know, who is killed or who is guilty&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> He rested an innocent book on the edge of the desk, smiling his defiance.
His private papers
<a name="un5016af" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5016af">in the original</a>.
<i>Ta an bad ar an tir. Taim imo shagart</i>. Put beurla<a target="foot" id="fkk0030">&ordm;</a> on it, littlejohn.</p>
<p> Quoth littlejohn Eglinton:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I was prepared for paradoxes from what Malachi Mulligan
told us but I may as well warn you that if you want to shake my belief that
Shakespeare is Hamlet you have a stern task before you. </p>
<p> Bear with me.</p>
<p> Stephen withstood the bane of miscreant eyes, glinting stern under wrinkled
brows. <a name="gn1015a" href="../../FF/unbs/gn1all.htm#gn1015a">A basilisk.
<i>E quando vede l&apos;uomo l&apos;attosca</i>. Messer Brunetto, I thank thee for the word.</a></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; As we, or mother Dana,
<a name="un1032ec" href="../../FF/unbs/un1all.htm#un1032ec">weave and unweave
our bodies</a>, Stephen said, from day to day, their molecules shuttled to and
fro, so does the artist
<a name="un1032ec" href="../../FF/unbs/un1all.htm#un1032ec">weave and unweave
his image</a>. And as the mole on my right breast is where it was when I was
born, though all my body has been woven of new stuff time after time, so through
the ghost of the unquiet father the image of the unliving son looks forth. In
the intense instant of imagination, when the mind, Shelley says, is a fading
coal,<a target="foot" id="fkk0031">&ordm;</a> that which I was is that which I
am and that which in possibility I may come to be. So in the future, the sister of the past, I may see
<br><font color="green">{u22, 187}</font>
<br> myself as I sit here now but by reflection from that which then I shall be.</p>
<p> Drummond of Hawthornden helped you at that stile.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, Mr Best<a target="foot" id="fkk0032">&ordm;</a> said
youngly.<a target="foot" id="fkk0033">&ordm;</a> I feel Hamlet quite young. The
bitterness might be from the father but the passages with Ophelia are surely from the son.</p>
<p> Has the wrong sow by the lug.
<a name="un5016i" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5016i">He is in my father. I am in his son.</a></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That mole is the last to go, Stephen said, laughing.</p>
<p> John Eglinton made a nothing pleasing mow.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; If that were the birthmark of genius, he said, genius
would be a drug in the market. The plays of Shakespeare&apos;s later years which
Renan admired so much breathe another spirit.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The spirit of reconciliation, the quaker librarian breathed.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There can be no reconciliation, Stephen said, if there has not been a sundering.</p>
<p> Said that.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; If you want to know what are the events which cast their
shadow over the hell of time of <i>King Lear</i>, <i>Othello</i>,
<i>Hamlet</i>,<a target="foot" id="fkk0034">&ordm;</a> <i>Troilus and
Cressida</i>,<a target="foot" id="fkk0035">&ordm;</a> look to see when and how
the shadow lifts. What softens the heart of a man, shipwrecked in storms dire,
Tried, like another Ulysses, Pericles, prince of Tyre?</p>
<p> Head, redconecapped, buffeted, brineblinded. </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A child, a girl placed in his arms, Marina.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The leaning of sophists towards the bypaths of apocrypha
is a constant quantity, John Eglinton detected. The highroads are dreary but they lead to the town.</p>
<p> Good Bacon: gone musty. Shakespeare Bacon&apos;s wild
oats.<a target="foot" id="fkk0036">&ordm;</a> Cypherjugglers going the
highroads. <a name="un4011p" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4011p">Seekers on

<p class="set"><i>How many miles to Dublin?
<br> Three score and ten, sir.
<br> Will we be there by candlelight?</i></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Mr Brandes accepts it, Stephen said, as the first play of the closing period.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Does he? What does Mr Sidney Lee, or Mr Simon Lazarus, as some aver his name is, say of it?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Marina, Stephen said, a child of storm, Miranda, a wonder,
Perdita, that which was lost. What was lost is given back to him: his daughter&apos;s child.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 188}</font>
<br> <i>My dearest wife</i>, Pericles says, <i>was like this maid</i>. Will any
man love the daughter if he has not loved the mother?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The art of being a grandfather, Mr Best gan murmur.
<i>L&apos;art d&apos;&ecirc;tre grandp</i>&nbsp;&hellip;<a target="foot" id="fkk0038">&ordm;</a></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; His own image to a man with
<a name="jn1034q" href="../../FF/unbs/jn1all.htm#jn1034q">that queer thing
genius</a> is the standard of all experience, material and moral. Such an appeal
will touch him. The
<a name="gn1010b" href="../../FF/unbs/gn1all.htm#gn1010b">images of other males
of his blood will repel him. He will see in them grotesque attempts of nature to foretell</a> or repeat himself.</p>
<p> The benign forehead of the quaker librarian enkindled rosily with hope.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I hope Mr Dedalus will work out his theory for the
enlightenment of the public. And we ought to mention another Irish commentator,
Mr George Bernard Shaw. Nor should we forget Mr Frank Harris. His articles on
Shakespeare in the <i>Saturday Review</i> were surely brilliant. Oddly enough he
too draws for us an unhappy relation with the dark  lady of the sonnets. The
favoured rival is William Herbert, earl of Pembroke. I own that if the poet must
be rejected<a target="foot" id="fkk0039">&ordm;</a> such a rejection would seem
more in harmony with &mdash; what shall I say? &mdash; our notions of what ought not to have been.</p>
<p> Felicitously he ceased and held a meek head among them, auk&apos;s egg, prize of their fray.</p>
<p> He thous and thees<a target="foot" id="fkk0040">&ordm;</a> her with grave
husbandwords. Dost love, Miriam? Dost love thy man?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That may be too, Stephen said. There is a saying of
Goethe&apos;s which Mr Magee likes to quote. Beware of what you wish for in
youth because you will get it in middle life. Why does he send to one who is a
<i>buonaroba</i>, a bay where all men ride, a maid of honour with a scandalous
girlhood, a lordling to woo for him? He was himself a lord of language and had
made himself a coistrel gentleman and had written <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>. Why?
Belief in himself has been untimely killed. He was overborne in a cornfield
first (a<a target="foot" id="fkk0041">&ordm;</a> ryefield, I should say) and he
will never be a victor in his own eyes after nor play victoriously the game of
laugh and lie down. Assumed dongiovannism will not save him. No later undoing
will undo the first undoing.
<a name="un4011aa" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4011aa">The tusk of the boar
has wounded him there where love lies ableeding.</a> If the shrew is worsted yet
there remains to her woman&apos;s invisible weapon. There is, I feel in the
words, some goad of the flesh driving him into a new passion, a darker shadow of
the first, darkening even his own understanding of himself. A like fate awaits
him and the two rages commingle in a whirlpool.</p>
<p> They list. And in the porches of their ears I pour.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The soul has been before stricken mortally, a poison poured in the
<br><font color="green">{u22, 189}</font>
<br> porch of a sleeping ear. But those who are done to death in sleep cannot
know the manner of their quell unless their Creator endow their souls with that
knowledge in the life to come. The poisoning and the beast with two backs that
urged it king Hamlet&apos;s ghost could not know of were he not endowed with
knowledge by his creator. That is why the speech (his lean unlovely English) is
always turned elsewhere, backward. Ravisher and ravished, what he would but
would not, go with him from Lucrece&apos;s bluecircled ivory globes to
Imogen&apos;s breast,  bare, with its mole cinquespotted. He goes back, weary of
the creation he has piled up to hide him from himself, an old dog licking an old
sore. But, because loss is his gain, he passes on towards eternity in
undiminished personality, untaught by the wisdom he has written or by the laws
he has revealed. His beaver is up. He is a ghost, a shadow now, the wind by
Elsinore&apos;s rocks or what you will, the sea&apos;s voice, a voice heard only
in the heart of him who is the substance of his shadow, the son consubstantial with the father.</p>

blithe in motley, towards the greeting of their smiles. My telegram.</p>

<p> He lifts his hands. Veils fall. O, flowers! Bells with bells with bells aquiring.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, indeed, the quaker librarian said. A most instructive
discussion. Mr Mulligan, I&apos;ll be bound, has his theory too of the play and
of Shakespeare. All sides of life should be represented.</p>
<p> He smiled on all sides equally.</p>
<p> Buck Mulligan thought, puzzled:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Shakespeare? he said. I seem to know the name.</p>
<p> A flying sunny smile rayed in his loose features.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; To be sure, he said, remembering brightly. The chap that writes like Synge.</p>
<p> Mr Best turned to him:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Haines missed you, he said. Did you meet him? He&apos;ll
see you after at the D.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;C. He&apos;s gone to Gill&apos;s to buy
Hyde&apos;s <i>Lovesongs of Connacht</i>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I came through the museum, Buck Mulligan said. Was he here?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The bard&apos;s fellowcountrymen, John Eglinton answered,
are rather tired perhaps of our brilliancies of theorising. I hear that an
actress played Hamlet for the fourhundredandeighth time last night in Dublin.
Vining held that the prince was a woman. Has no-one made him out to be an
Irishman? <a name="un4011br" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4011br">Judge
Barton, I believe, is searching for some clues.</a> He swears (His Highness not His Lordship) by saint Patrick.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The most brilliant of all is that story of Wilde&apos;s,
Mr Best said, lifting his brilliant notebook. That <i>Portrait of Mr W.H.</i>
where he proves that the sonnets were written by a Willie Hughes, a man all hues.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; For Willie Hughes, is it not? the quaker librarian asked.</p>
<p> Or Hughie Wills.
<a name="un5016n" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5016n">Mr William Himself.</a> W.&nbsp;H: who am I?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I mean, for Willie Hughes, Mr Best said, amending his
gloss easily. Of course it&apos;s all paradox, don&apos;t you know, Hughes and
hews and hues the colour, but it&apos;s so typical the way he works it out.
It&apos;s the very essence of Wilde, don&apos;t you know. The light touch.</p>
<p> His glance touched their faces lightly as he smiled, a blond ephebe. Tame essence of Wilde. </p>
<p> You&apos;re darned witty. Three drams of usquebaugh you drank with Dan Deasy&apos;s ducats.</p>
<p> How much did I spend? O, a few shillings.</p>
<p> For <a name="un1032dn" href="../../FF/unbs/un1all.htm#un1032dn">a plump of</a> pressmen. Humour wet and dry.</p>

<p class="di">&mdash; Do you think it is only a paradox, the quaker librarian
was asking. The mocker is never taken seriously when he is most serious.</p>
<p> They talked seriously of mocker&apos;s seriousness.</p>
<p> Buck Mulligan&apos;s again heavy face eyed Stephen awhile. Then, his head
wagging, he came near, drew a folded telegram from his pocket. His mobile lips read, smiling with new delight.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Telegram! he<a target="foot" id="fkk0044">&ordm;</a> said.
Wonderful inspiration! Telegram! A papal bull!</p>
<p> He sat on a corner of the unlit desk, reading aloud joyfully:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without
incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done.</i> Signed: Dedalus. Where
did you launch it from? The kips? No. College Green. Have you drunk the four

<p> Joyfully he thrust message and envelope into a pocket but keened in querulous brogue:</p>

it&apos;s queer and sick we were, Haines and myself, the time himself brought it

<p> He wailed:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And we to be there, mavrone, and you to be unbeknownst
sending us your conglomerations the way we to have our tongues out a yard long
like the drouthy clerics do be fainting for a pussful. </p>
<p> Stephen laughed.</p>
<p> Quickly, warningfully Buck Mulligan bent down:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The tramper Synge is looking for you, he said, to murder
you. He heard you pissed on his halldoor in Glasthule. He&apos;s out

Troy in whom a score of heroes slept</a>, and handed it to poor Penelope. Twenty
years he lived in London and, during part of that time, he drew a salary equal
to that of the lord chancellor of Ireland. His life was rich. His art, more than
the art of feudalism,<a target="foot" id="fkk0062">&ordm;</a> as Walt Whitman
called it, is the art of surfeit. Hot herringpies, green mugs of sack,

<p> Buck Mulligan rapped John Eglinton&apos;s desk sharply.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Whom do you suspect? he challenged.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Say that he is the spurned lover in the sonnets. Once
spurned twice spurned. But the court wanton spurned him for a lord, his dearmylove.</p>
<p> Love that dare not speak its name.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; As an Englishman, you mean, John sturdy Eglinton put in, he loved a lord.</p>
<p> Old wall where sudden lizards flash. At Charenton I watched them.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It seems so, Stephen said, when he wants to do for him,
and for all other and singular uneared wombs, the holy office an ostler does for
the stallion. Maybe, like Socrates, he had a midwife to mother as he had a shrew
to wife. But she, the giglot wanton, did not break a bedvow. Two deeds are rank
in that ghost&apos;s mind: a broken vow and  the dullbrained yokel on whom her
favour has declined,

take it, was hot in the blood. Once a wooer twice a wooer.</p>
<p> Stephen turned boldly in his chair.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The burden of proof is with you not with me, he said,
frowning. If you deny that in the fifth scene of <i>Hamlet</i> he has branded
her with infamy, tell me why there is no mention of her during the thirtyfour
years between the day she married him and the day she buried him. All those
women saw their men down and under: Mary, her goodman John, Ann, her

Susan&apos;s daughter, Elizabeth, to use granddaddy&apos;s words, wed her second, having killed her first.</p>
<p> O,<a target="foot" id="fkk0066">&ordm;</a> yes, mention there is. In the

<p> He faced their silence.</p>
<p> To whom thus Eglinton:</p>

observed, as they have still if our peasant plays are true to type.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He was a rich countrygentleman, Stephen said, with a coat
of arms and landed estate at Stratford and a house in Ireland yard, a capitalist
shareholder, a bill promoter, a tithefarmer. Why did he not leave her his best
bed if he wished her to snore away the rest of her nights in peace?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It is clear that there were two beds, a best and a secondbest, Mr Secondbest Best said finely.</p>

Stephen said, who when dying in exile frees and endows his slaves, pays tribute
to his elders, wills to be laid in earth near the bones of his dead wife and
bids his friends be kind to an old mistress (don&apos;t forget Nell Gwynn Herpyllis) and let her live in his villa.

<p class="di">&mdash; Do you mean he died so? Mr Best asked with slight concern. I mean&nbsp;&hellip; </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He died dead drunk, Buck Mulligan capped. <i>A quart of

<p class="di">&mdash; What? asked Besteglinton.</p>
<p> William Shakespeare and company, limited. The people&apos;s William. For

<p class="di">&mdash; Lovely! Buck Mulligan suspired amorously. I asked him what
he thought of the charge of pederasty brought against the bard. He lifted his
hands and said: <i>All we can say is that life ran very high in those days.</i> Lovely!</p>

<p> Steadfast John replied severe:</p>

so?</a> Will they wrest from us, from me,<a target="foot" id="fkk0071">&ordm;</a> the palm of beauty?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And the sense of property, Stephen said. He drew Shylock
out of his own long pocket. The son of a maltjobber and moneylender he was
himself a cornjobber and moneylender with ten tods of corn hoarded in the famine
<a name="un4011cc" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4011cc">riots</a>. His
borrowers are no doubt those divers of worship mentioned by Chettle Falstaff who
reported his uprightness of dealing. He sued a fellowplayer for the price of a
few bags of malt and exacted his pound of flesh in interest for every money
lent. How else could Aubrey&apos;s ostler and callboy get rich quick? All events
brought grist to his mill. Shylock chimes with the jewbaiting that followed the
hanging and quartering of the queen&apos;s leech Lopez, his jew&apos;s heart
being plucked forth while the sheeny was yet alive: <i>Hamlet</i> and
<i>Macbeth</i> with the coming to the throne of a Scotch philosophaster with a
turn for witchroasting. The lost armada is his jeer in <i>Love&apos;s Labour
Lost</i>. His pageants, the histories, sail fullbellied on a tide of Mafeking
enthusiasm. Warwickshire jesuits are tried and we have a porter&apos;s theory of
equivocation. The <i>Sea Venture</i> comes home from Bermudas and the play Renan

<a name="un5016af" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5016af">reading in the
original</a>, writing of incest from a standpoint different from that of the new
Viennese school Mr Magee spoke of, likens it in his wise and curious way to an
avarice of the emotions. He means that the love so given to one near in blood is
covetously withheld from some stranger who, it may be, hungers for it. Jews,
whom christians tax with avarice, are of all races the most given to
intermarriage. Accusations are made in anger. The christian laws which built up
the hoards of the jews (for whom, as for the lollards, storm was shelter) bound
their affections too with hoops of steel. Whether these be sins or virtues old
Nobodaddy will tell us at doomsday leet. But a man who holds so tightly to what
he calls his rights over what he calls his debts will hold tightly also to what
he calls his rights over  her whom he calls his wife. No sir smile neighbour

a necessary evil. He wrote the play in the months that followed his
father&apos;s death. If you hold that he, a greying man with two marriageable
daughters, with thirtyfive years of life, <i>nel mezzo del cammin di nostra
vita</i>, with fifty of experience is the beardless undergraduate from
Wittenberg<a target="foot" id="fkk0081">&ordm;</a> then you must hold that his
seventyyear old mother is the lustful queen. No. The corpse of John Shakespeare
does not walk the night. From hour to hour it rots and rots. He rests,
<br><font color="green">{u22, 199}</font>
<br> disarmed of fatherhood, having devised that mystical estate upon his son.
Boccaccio&apos;s Calandrino was the first and last man who felt himself with
child. Fatherhood, in the sense of conscious begetting, is unknown to man. It is
a mystical estate, an apostolic succession, from only begetter to only begotten.
On that mystery and not on the madonna which the cunning Italian intellect flung

<p class="di">&mdash; What is that, Mr Dedalus? the quaker librarian asked. Was it a celestial phenomenon?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="un3015i" href="../../FF/unbs/un3all.htm#un3015i">A star by night,
Stephen said, a pillar of the cloud by day</a>.</p>
<p> What more&apos;s to speak?</p>
<p> Stephen looked on his hat, his stick, his boots.</p>
<p> <i>Stephanos</i>, my crown. My sword. His boots are spoiling the shape of my
feet. Buy a pair. Holes in my socks. Handkerchief too.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You make good use of the name, John Eglinton allowed. Your
own name is strange enough. I suppose it explains your fantastical humour.</p>
<p> Me, Magee and Mulligan.</p>
<p> Fabulous artificer, the hawklike man. You flew. Whereto? Newhaven-Dieppe,
steerage passenger. Paris and back. Lapwing. Icarus. <i>Pater, ait</i>.
Seabedabbled, fallen, weltering. Lapwing you are. Lapwing be.</p>
<p> Mr Best eagerquietly lifted his book to say:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That&apos;s very interesting because that brother motive,
don&apos;t you know, we find also in the old Irish myths. Just what you say. The
three brothers Shakespeare. In Grimm too, don&apos;t you know, the fairytales.
The third brother that always<a target="foot" id="fkk0090">&ordm;</a> marries
the sleeping beauty and wins the best prize.</p>
<p> Best of Best brothers. Good, better, best.</p>
<p> The quaker librarian springhalted near.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I should like to know, he said, which brother
you&nbsp;&hellip; I understand you to suggest there was misconduct with one of
the brothers&nbsp;&hellip; But perhaps I am anticipating?</p>
<p> He caught himself in the act: looked at all: refrained.</p>
<p> An attendant from the doorway called:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Mr Lyster! Father Dineen<a target="foot" id="fkk0091">&ordm;</a> wants&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O! Father Dineen! Directly.</p>
<p> Swiftly rectly creaking rectly rectly he was rectly gone.</p>
<p> John Eglinton touched the foil.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Come, he said. Let us hear what you have to say of Richard
and Edmund. You kept them for the last, didn&apos;t you? </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; In asking you to remember those two noble kinsmen nuncle Richie
<br><font color="green">{u22, 203}</font>
<br> and nuncle Edmund, Stephen answered, I feel I am asking too much perhaps. A
brother is as easily forgotten as an umbrella.</p>
<p> Lapwing.</p>
<p> Where is your brother? Apothecaries&apos; hall. My
<a name="jn2008f" href="../../FF/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2008f">whetstone</a>. Him,
then Cranly, Mulligan: now these. Speech, speech. But act. Act speech. They mock to try you. Act. Be acted on.</p>
<p> Lapwing.</p>
<p> I am tired of my voice, the voice of Esau.
<a name="un5016ai" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5016ai">My kingdom for a drink.</a></p>
<p> On.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You will say those names were already in the chronicles
from which he took the stuff of his plays. Why did he take them rather than
others? Richard, a
<a name="un5016ae" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5016ae">whoreson</a>
crookback, misbegotten, makes love to a widowed Ann (what&apos;s in a name?),
woos and wins her, a whoreson
<a name="un4011j" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4011j">merry widow</a>.
Richard the conqueror, third brother, came after William the conquered. The
other four acts of that play hang limply from that first. Of all his kings
Richard is the only king unshielded by Shakespeare&apos;s reverence, the angel
of the world. Why is the underplot of <i>King Lear</i> in which Edmund figures
lifted out of Sidney&apos;s <i>Arcadia</i> and spatchcocked on to a Celtic legend older than history?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That was Will&apos;s way, John Eglinton defended. We
should not now combine a Norse saga with an excerpt from a novel by George
Meredith. <i>Que voulez-vous?</i> Moore would say. He puts Bohemia on the
seacoast and makes Ulysses quote Aristotle.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Why? Stephen answered himself. Because the theme of the
false or the usurping or the adulterous brother or all three in one is to
Shakespeare, what the poor is not, always with him. The note of banishment,
banishment from the heart, banishment from home, sounds uninterruptedly from
<i>The Two Gentlemen</i><a target="foot" id="fkk0092">&ordm;</a> <i>of
Verona</i> onward till Prospero breaks his staff, buries it certain fathoms in
the earth and drowns his book. It doubles itself in the middle of his life,
reflects itself in another, repeats itself,
<a name="un4011bf" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4011bf">protasis, epitasis,
catastasis, catastrophe</a>. It repeats itself again when he is near the grave,
when his married daughter Susan, chip of the old block, is accused of adultery.
But it  was the original sin that darkened his understanding, weakened his will
and left in him a strong inclination to evil. The words are those of my lords
bishops of Maynooth &mdash; an<a target="foot" id="fkk0093">&ordm;</a> original
sin and, like original sin, committed by another in whose sin he too has sinned.
It is between the lines of his last written words, it is petrified on his
tombstone under which her four bones are not to be laid. Age has not withered
it. Beauty and peace have not done it away. It is in
<br><font color="green">{u22, 204}</font>
<br> infinite variety everywhere in the world he has created, in <i>Much Ado
about Nothing</i>, twice in <i>As You
Like</i><a target="foot" id="fkk0094">&ordm;</a> <i>It</i>, in <i>The
Tempest</i>, in <i>Hamlet</i>, in <i>Measure for Measure</i> &mdash;
and<a target="foot" id="fkk0095">&ordm;</a> in all the other plays which I have not read.</p>
<p> He laughed to free his mind from his mind&apos;s bondage.</p>
<p> Judge Eglinton summed up.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The truth is midway, he affirmed. He is the ghost and the prince. He is all in all.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He is, Stephen said. The boy of act one is the mature man
of act five. All in all. In <i>Cymbeline</i>, in <i>Othello</i> he is bawd and
cuckold. He acts and is acted on.
<a name="un4011bn" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4011bn">Lover of an ideal or
a perversion, like Jos&eacute; he kills the real Carmen.</a> His unremitting
intellect is the hornmad Iago ceaselessly willing that the moor in him shall suffer.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuck Mulligan clucked lewdly. O word of fear!</p>
<p> Dark dome received, reverbed.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And what a character is Iago! undaunted John Eglinton
exclaimed. When all is said Dumas fils (or is it Dumas p&egrave;re?) is right.
After God Shakespeare has created most.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Man delights him not nor woman neither, Stephen said. He
returns after a life of absence to that spot of earth where he was born, where
he has always been,
<a name="un6009b" href="../../FF/unbs/un6all.htm#un6009b">man and boy</a>, a
silent witness and there, his journey of life ended, he plants his mulberrytree
in the earth. Then dies. The motion is ended. Gravediggers bury Hamlet
<i>p&egrave;re</i> and Hamlet <i>fils</i>. A king and a prince at last in death,
with incidental music. And, what though murdered and betrayed, bewept by all
frail tender hearts for, Dane or Dubliner, sorrow for the dead is the only
husband from whom they refuse to be divorced. If you like the epilogue  look
long on it: prosperous Prospero, the good man rewarded, Lizzie, grandpa&apos;s
lump of love, and nuncle Richie, the bad man taken off by poetic justice to the
place where the bad niggers go. Strong curtain. He found in the world without as
actual what was in his world within as possible. Maeterlinck says: <i>If
Socrates leave his house today he will find the sage seated on his doorstep,
If</i><a target="foot" id="fkk0099">&ordm;</a> <i>Judas go forth tonight it is
to Judas his steps will tend</i>. Every life is many days, day after day. We
walk through ourselves, meeting robbers, ghosts, giants, old men, young men,
wives, widows,
<a name="un6009j" href="../../FF/unbs/un6all.htm#un6009j">brothers-in-love</a>,<a target="foot" id="fkk0100">&ordm;</a>
but<a target="foot" id="fkk0101">&ordm;</a> always meeting ourselves. The
playwright who wrote the folio of this world and wrote it badly (He gave us
light first and the sun two days later), the lord of things as they are whom the
most Roman of catholics call <i>dio boia</i>, hangman god, is doubtless all in
all in all of us, ostler and butcher, and would be bawd and
<br><font color="green">{u22, 205}</font>
<br> cuckold too but that in the economy of heaven, foretold by Hamlet, there
are no more marriages, glorified man, an
<a name="un4011be" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4011be">androgynous angel</a>, being a wife unto himself.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>Eureka!</i><a target="foot" id="fkk0102">&ordm;</a> Buck Mulligan cried. <i>Eureka!</i></p>
<p> Suddenly happied he jumped up and reached in a stride John Eglinton&apos;s desk.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; May I? he said. The Lord has spoken to Malachi.</p>
<p> He began to scribble on a slip of paper.</p>
<p> Take some slips from the counter going out.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Those who are married, Mr Best,
douce<a target="foot" id="fkk0103">&ordm;</a> herald, said, all save one, shall
live. The rest shall keep as they are.</p>
<p> He laughed, unmarried, at Eglinton Johannes, of arts a bachelor.</p>
<p> Unwed, unfancied, ware of wiles, they fingerponder nightly each his variorum
edition of <i>The Taming of the Shrew</i>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You are a delusion, said roundly John Eglinton to Stephen.
You have brought us all this way to show us a French triangle. Do you believe your own theory?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; No, Stephen said promptly.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Are you going to write
it?<a target="foot" id="fkk0104">&ordm;</a> Mr Best asked. You ought to make it
a dialogue, don&apos;t you know, like the Platonic dialogues Wilde wrote.</p>
<p> John Eclecticon<a target="foot" id="fkk0105">&ordm;</a> doubly smiled. </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Well, in that case, he said, I don&apos;t see why you
should expect payment for it since you don&apos;t believe it yourself. Dowden
believes there is some mystery in <i>Hamlet</i> but will say no more. Herr
Bleibtreu, the man Piper met in Berlin, who is working up that Rutland theory,
believes that the secret is hidden in the Stratford monument. He is going to
visit the present duke, Piper says, and prove to him that his ancestor wrote the
plays. It will come as a surprise to his grace. But he believes his theory.</p>
<p> I believe, O Lord, help my unbelief. That is, help me to believe or help me
to unbelieve? Who helps to believe? <i>Egomen</i>. Who to unbelieve? Other chap.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You are the only contributor to <i>Dana</i> who asks for
pieces of silver. Then I don&apos;t know about the next number. Fred Ryan wants space for an article on economics.</p>
<p> Fraidrine. Two pieces of silver he lent me. Tide you over. Economics.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; For a guinea, Stephen said, you can publish this interview.</p>
<p> Buck Mulligan stood up from his laughing scribbling, laughing: and then gravely said, honeying malice:
<br><font color="green">{u22, 206}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I called upon the bard Kinch at his summer residence in
upper Mecklenburgh street and found him deep in the study of the <i>Summa contra
Gentiles</i> in the company of two gonorrheal ladies, Fresh Nelly and Rosalie, the coalquay whore.</p>
<p> He broke away.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Come, Kinch. Come, wandering Aengus<a target="foot" id="fkk0106">&ordm;</a> of the birds.</p>
<p> Come, Kinch, you have eaten all we left. Ay. I will serve you your orts and offals.</p>
<p> Stephen rose.</p>
<p> Life is many days. This will end.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; We shall see you tonight, John Eglinton said. <i>Notre
ami</i> Moore says Malachi Mulligan must be there.</p>
<p> Buck Mulligan flaunted his slip and panama.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Monsieur Moore, he said, lecturer on French letters to the
youth of Ireland. I&apos;ll be there. Come, Kinch, the bards must drink. Can you walk straight? </p>
<p> Laughing he&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> Swill till eleven. Irish nights entertainment.</p>
<p> Lubber&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> Stephen followed a lubber&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> One day in the national library we had a discussion. Shakes. After his lub
back I followed. I gall his <a name="un4011ar" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4011ar">kibe</a>.</p>
<p> Stephen, greeting, then all amort, followed a lubber jester, a wellkempt
head, newbarbered, out of the vaulted cell into a shattering daylight of no thoughts.</p>
<p> What have I learned? Of them? Of me?</p>
<p> <a name="un1011k" href="../../FF/unbs/un1all.htm#un1011k">Walk like Haines now.</a></p>
<p> The constant readers&apos; room. In the readers&apos; book Cashel Boyle
O&apos;Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell parafes his polysyllables. Item: was
Hamlet mad? The quaker&apos;s pate godlily with a priesteen in booktalk.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O please do, sir&nbsp;&hellip; I shall be most pleased&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> Amused Buck Mulligan mused in pleasant murmur with himself, selfnodding:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <a name="un5016ad" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5016ad">A pleased bottom.</a></p>
<p> The turnstile.</p>

<br><font color="green">{u22, 207}</font> </p>
<p> Puck Mulligan, panamahelmeted, went step by step, iambing, trolling:</p>

<a name="un3011a" href="../../FF/unbs/un3all.htm#un3011a"><i>John Eglinton, my
jo, John,</i></a><a target="foot" id="fkk0111">&ordm;</a>
<br> <i>Why won&apos;t you wed a wife?</i></p>
<p> He spluttered to the air:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O, the chinless Chinaman! Chin Chon Eg Lin Ton. We went
over to their playbox, Haines and I, the plumbers&apos; hall.
<a name="un6009l" href="../../FF/unbs/un6all.htm#un6009l">Our players</a> are
creating a new art for Europe like the Greeks or M. Maeterlinck. Abbey theatre!
I smell the pubic<a target="foot" id="fkk0112">&ordm;</a> sweat of monks.</p>
<p> He spat blank.</p>
<p> Forgot: any more than he forgot the whipping lousy Lucy gave him. And left
the <i>femme de trente ans</i>. And why no other children born?
<a name="un4011d" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4011d">And his first child a girl?</a> </p>
<p> Afterwit. Go back.</p>
<p> The dour recluse still there (he has his cake) and the douce youngling,
minion of pleasure, Phedo&apos;s toyable fair hair.</p>
<p> Eh&nbsp;&hellip; I just eh&nbsp;&hellip; wanted&nbsp;&hellip; I
forgot&nbsp;&hellip; eh&nbsp;&hellip;<a target="foot" id="fkk0113">&ordm;</a></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Longworth and M&apos;Curdy Atkinson were there&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> Puck Mulligan footed featly, trilling:</p>
<p class="diset">&mdash;<a target="foot" id="fkk0114">&ordm;</a> <i>I hardly hear the purlieu cry</i>
<br> <i>Or a Tommy talk as I pass one by</i>
<br> <i>Before my thoughts begin to run</i>
<br> <i>On F. M&apos;Curdy Atkinson,</i>
<br> <i>The same that had the wooden leg</i>
<br> <i>And that filibustering filibeg</i><a target="foot" id="fkk0115">&ordm;</a>

<p> Jest on. Know thyself.</p>
<p> Halted below me, a quizzer looks at me. I halt.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Mournful mummer, Buck Mulligan moaned. Synge has left off
wearing black to be like nature. Only crows, priests and English coal are black.</p>
<p> A laugh tripped over his lips.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 208}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Longworth is awfully sick, he said, after what you wrote
about that old hake Gregory. O you inquisitional drunken
jewjesuit<a target="foot" id="fkk0116">&ordm;</a>! She gets you a job on the
paper and then you go and slate her drivel to Jaysus. Couldn&apos;t you do the
Yeats<a target="foot" id="fkk0117">&ordm;</a> touch?</p>
<p> He went on and down, mopping, chanting with waving graceful arms:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The most beautiful book that has come out of our country
in my time. <a name="un6009m" href="../../FF/unbs/un6all.htm#un6009m">One thinks</a> of Homer.</p>
<p> He stopped at the stairfoot.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I have conceived a play for the mummers, he said solemnly.</p>
<p> The pillared Moorish hall, shadows entwined. Gone the nine men&apos;s morrice with caps of indices. </p>
<p> In sweetly varying voices Buck Mulligan read his tablet:</p>
<p class="center"><i>Everyman His Own Wife</i></p>
<p class="center"><i>or</i></p>
<p class="center"><i>A Honeymoon in the Hand</i></p>
<p class="center">(<i>a national immorality in three orgasms</i>)</p>
<p class="center"><i>by</i></p>
<p class="center"><i>Ballocky Mulligan</i></p>
<p> He turned a happy patch&apos;s
<a name="un1032fd" href="../../FF/unbs/un1all.htm#un1032fd">smirk</a> to Stephen, saying:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The disguise, I fear, is thin. But listen.</p>
<p> He read, <i>marcato</i>:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Characters:</p>
<p class="set"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Toby</span>
<span style="font-variant:small-caps">Tostoff</span> (a ruined Pole)<a target="foot" id="fkk0118">&ordm;</a>

<br> <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Medical Dick</span>
<br> and

<br> <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Mother Grogan</span> (a watercarrier)<a target="foot" id="fkk0121">&ordm;</a>
<br> <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Fresh Nelly</span>
<br> and
<br> <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Rosalie</span> (the coalquay whore).</p>
<p> He laughed, lolling a to and fro head, walking on, followed by Stephen: and
mirthfully he told the shadows, souls of men:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O, the night in the Camden hall when the daughters of Erin had to lift
<br><font color="green">{u22, 209}</font>
<br> their skirts to step over you as you lay in your mulberrycoloured, multicoloured, multitudinous vomit!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The most innocent son of Erin, Stephen said, for whom they ever lifted them.</p>
<p> About to pass through the doorway, feeling one behind, he stood aside.</p>
<p> Part. The moment is now. Where then? If Socrates leave his house today, if
Judas go forth tonight. Why? That lies in space which I in time must come to, ineluctably. </p>
<p> My will: his will that fronts me. Seas between.</p>
<p> A man passed out between them, bowing, greeting.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Good day again, Buck Mulligan said.</p>
<p> The portico.</p>
<p> Here I watched the birds for augury.
Aengus<a target="foot" id="fkk0122">&ordm;</a> of the birds. They go, they come.
Last night I flew. Easily flew. Men wondered. Street of harlots after. A
creamfruit melon he held to me. In. You will see.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The wandering jew, Buck Mulligan whispered with
clown&apos;s awe. Did you see his eye? He looked upon you to lust after you. I
fear thee, ancient mariner. O, Kinch, thou art in peril. Get thee a breechpad.</p>
<p> Manner of Oxenford.</p>
<p> Day. Wheelbarrow sun over arch of bridge.</p>
<p> A dark back went before them, step<a target="foot" id="fkk0123">&ordm;</a>
of a pard, down, out by the gateway, under portcullis barbs.</p>
<p> They followed.</p>
<p> Offend me still. Speak on.</p>
<p> Kind air defined the coigns of houses in Kildare street. No birds. Frail
from the housetops two plumes of smoke ascended, pluming, and in a flaw of softness softly were blown.</p>
<p> Cease to strive. Peace of the druid priests of Cymbeline, hierophantic: from wide earth an altar.</p>
<p class="set"><i>Laud we the gods</i>
