<p> Yes because he never did a thing
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">a</span></span> like that before
as ask to get his breakfast in bed with a couple of eggs since the City Arms
hotel when he used to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his
highness to make himself interesting for that old faggot Mrs Riordan that never
left us a farthing all for masses for herself. and her talk about Mr Riordan
here and Mr Riordan there I suppose he was glad to get shut of her and her dog
smelling my and always edging to get up under my petticoats if ever he got
anything really serious the matter with him it&apos;s much better for them to go
into a hospital where everything is clean yes because
<a name="s18013ai" href="../../FF/unbs/s18all.htm#s18013ai">they&apos;re so weak
and puling when they&apos;re sick</a> father was the same besides I hate
bandaging and dosing when he cut his toe with the razor paring his corns afraid
he&apos;d get blood poisoning<a target="foot" id="ftz0020">&ordm;</a> yes he
came somewhere I&apos;m sure by his appetite anyway love it&apos;s not or
he&apos;d be off his feed thinking of her so either it was one of those night
women if it was down there he was really and the hotel story he made up a pack
of lies to hide it only for I hate having a long wrangle in bed or else
<a name="un6020h" href="../../FF/unbs/un6all.htm#un6020h">if it&apos;s not that
it&apos;s</a> some little bitch or other he got in with somewhere or picked up
on the sly if they only knew him as well as I do yes because the day Dignam died
he was writing a letter when I came into the front room
<a name="un4035bb" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4035bb">for the matches</a>
as <a name="un4035bf" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4035bf">if something</a>
told me and he covered it up with the blottingpaper pretending to be thinking
about business so very probably that was it to somebody who thinks she has a
softy in him because all men get a bit like that at his age especially getting
on to forty he is now so as to wheedle any money she can out of him no fool like
an old fool and then the usual kissing my bottom was to hide it not that I care
two straws now who he does it with or knew before that way though I&apos;d like
to find out so long as I don&apos;t have the two of them under my nose all the
time like that slut, that Mary, we had in
<a name="s18013ab" href="../../FF/unbs/s18all.htm#s18013ab">Ontario terrace</a>
padding out her false bottom to excite him bad enough to get the smell of those
painted women off him once or twice I had a suspicion by getting him to come
near me without that one it was all his fault of course ruining servants then
proposing that she could eat at our table on Christmas day O no thank you not in
my house stealing my potatoes and the oysters 2/6 a dozen going out to see her
aunt, if you please, common robbery so it was
<br><font color="green">{ms, 2}</font>
<br> it takes me to find out a thing like that he said you have no proof it was
her proof O yes her aunt was very fond of oysters but I told her what I thought
of her I couldn&apos;t even touch him if I thought he was with a dirty liar and
sloven like that one singing about the place in the W.C. too because she knew
she was too well off yes because he couldn&apos;t possibly do without it that
long so he must do it somewhere and the last time he came on my bottom when was
it the night Boylan gave my hand a great squeeze going along by the Tolka
singing the young May moon she&apos;s beaming
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span> love because he
has an idea about him and me he&apos;s not such a fool though I&apos;m not going
to <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">f</span></span> give him the
satisfaction in any case God knows he&apos;s a change in a way not to be always
wearing the same hat doing that frigging drawing out the thing by the hour
question and answer would you do this that and the other with the coalman yes
with a bishop yes I would because I told him about some dean or bishop was
sitting beside me in the jews temples gardens a stranger to Dublin what place
was it and so on about the monuments and he tired me out with statues
encouraging him making him worse than he is who is in your mind now tell me who
are you thinking of who is it tell me his name who tell me who the german
emperor is it yes imagine I&apos;m him think of him can you feel him he ought to
give it up now at this age of his life simply ruination for any woman and no
satisfaction in it pretending to like it and comes and then finish it off myself
anyway and it makes your lips pale anyhow it&apos;s done now with all the talk
of the world <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">people</span></span>
about it people make it&apos;s only the first time after that it&apos;s just the
ordinary why can&apos;t you kiss a man you sometimes love to wildly when you
feel that way so nice all over you you can&apos;t help yourself then I hate that
confession when I used to go to Father Corrigan he touched me father where and I
said on the canal bank like a fool but whereabouts on your person on the leg
behind high up was it yes rather high up was it where you sit down yes O lord
couldn&apos;t he say bottom right out and have done with it
<a name="s18013i" href="../../FF/unbs/s18all.htm#s18013i">I wonder was he
satisfied</a> with me
<a name="s18013p" href="../../FF/unbs/s18all.htm#s18013p">one thing I
didn&apos;t like his slapping me behind going away in the hall though I laughed
I&apos;m not a horse or an ass am I I suppose he was thinking of his fathers</a>
I wonder is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am I in it he smelt of some kind of drink not
<br><font color="green">{ms, 3}</font>
<br> <a name="un4035bk" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4035bk">whisky</a> or
stout some liqueur <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">I</span></span>
<a name="s18011h" href="../../FF/unbs/s18all.htm#s18011h">I&apos;d like</a>
<a name="s18011h" href="../../FF/unbs/s18all.htm#s18011h">those richlooking
green and yellow expensive drinks</a> those
<a name="s18001bt" href="../../FF/unbs/s18all.htm#s18001bt">stagedoor
johnnies</a> drink with the opera hats he had all he could do to keep himself
from falling asleep after the last time after we took the potted meat and claret
yes because I feel sound asleep myself the moment I popped into bed till that
thunder woke me up God be merciful to us when I lit the lamp yes because he must
have come 3 or 4 times with that tremendous big brute of a thing he has I
thought the vein or whatever they call it was going to burst after I took off
all my things after my hour&apos;s dressing like iron or some kind of a thick
crowbar standing all the time no I never in all my life felt anyone had one the
size of that to <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">fill</span></span>
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">you</span></span> make you feel
full up what&apos;s the idea
<a name="s18013ak" href="../../FF/unbs/s18all.htm#s18013ak">making us like that
with a big hole</a> in us or like a stallion driving it up into you because
that&apos;s all they want out of you with that determined vicious look in his
eyes still he hasn&apos;t such an amount of spunk in him considering how big it
is so much the better in case any of it wasn&apos;t washed out properly the last
time I let him finish it in me nice invention they made for women for him to get
all the pleasure but if someone gave them a touch of it themselves they&apos;d
know what I went through with Rudy nobody would believe and Mina Purefoy&apos;s
husband give us a swing out of your whiskers filling her up with a child or
twins once a year as regular as the clock supposed to be healthy supposing I
risked having another not off him though
<a name="s18019j" href="../../FF/unbs/s18all.htm#s18019j">still if he was
married I&apos;m sure he&apos;d have a fine strong child</a> but I don&apos;t
know <a name="un4050bg" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4050bg">Poldy</a> has
more spunk in him I suppose it was meeting Josie Powell and the funeral and
thinking about me and Boylan set him off I know they were spooning a bit when I
came on the scene he was dancing and sitting out with her the night of Georgina
Simpson&apos;s housewarming and then
<a name="s18010au" href="../../FF/unbs/s18all.htm#s18010au">he wanted to ram it
down my neck</a> it was on account of not liking to see her a wallflower that
was why we had the standup row over politics when he said about Our Lord being a
carpenter and the first socialist still he knows a lot of mixedup things
especially about the body and the inside after that he made me the present of
Byron&apos;s poems and the three pairs of gloves so that finished that I could
quite easily get him to make it up any time I know how I&apos;d even supposing
he got in with her again and was going out to see her somewhere I&apos;d know if he refused to eat the
<br><font color="green">{ms, 4}</font>
<br> onions I know several ways then let him go to her she of course would only
be too delighted she used to be always embracing me Josie whenever he was there
meaning him of course I don&apos;t wonder in the least because he was very
handsome at that time trying to look like Lord Byron I said I liked and he was a
little before we got engaged afterwards though she didn&apos;t like it so much
the day I was laughing about
<a name="s18006l" href="../../FF/unbs/s18all.htm#s18006l">all my hairpins
falling out one after another</a> you&apos;re always in great humour she said
yes because it grigged because she knew what it meant but that wasn&apos;t my
fault I wonder what she&apos;s like now after living with that dotty husband of
hers she had <a name="s18019b" href="../../FF/unbs/s18all.htm#s18019b">her face
beginning to look drawn</a> the last time I saw her what was it she told me O
yes that sometimes he used to go to bed with his muddy boots when the maggot
takes him just imagine having to get into bed with a thing like that that might
murder you any moment what a man well it&apos;s not the one way everyone goes
and now he&apos;s going about in his slippers to look for &pound;10,000 for a
postcard U.p: up O sweetheart May wouldn&apos;t a thing like that simply bore
you stiff to extinction actually too stupid even to take his boots off now what
could you make of a man like that I&apos;d rather die 20 times over than marry
another of them of course he&apos;d never find another woman like me to put up
with him the way I do and he knows that too take that Mrs Maybrick that poisoned her husband for what I wonder.</p>
<p> They&apos;re all so different Boylan talking about the shape of my foot he
noticed at once now how did that excite him
<a name="s18012aa" href="../../FF/unbs/s18all.htm#s18012aa">I made Poldy</a>
<a name="un4050aj" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4050aj">spend once with my
foot</a> when he used to ask
<a name="s18010g" href="../../FF/unbs/s18all.htm#s18010g">to take off my
stockings</a> in Lombard street west but of course he&apos;s not natural that I
what did he say I could give nine points in ten to Kattie Lanner and beat her
what does that mean I asked him I forget what he said because the stop press
edition just passed and the man with the curly hair in the Maypole dairy
that&apos;s so polite I noticed him when I was tasting the butter so I took my
time Bartell d&apos;Arcy too that he used to make fun of when he kissed me on
the choir stairs after I sang Gounod&apos;s Ave Maria he was pretty hot too my
low notes he said if you can believe him then he said wasn&apos;t it terrible to
do that there in a place like that I don&apos;t see anything so terrible about
it I&apos;ll tell him about that some day not now and surprise
<br><font color="green">{ms, 5}</font>
<br> him he was much worse himself begging me to give him a tiny bit cut off my
drawers that was the evening coming along Kenilworth square he
kissed<a target="foot" id="ftz0021">&ordm;</a> in the eye of my glove and I had
to take it off asking me questions is it permitted to enquire so I let him keep
it as if I forgot it to think of me when I saw him slip it into his pocket of
course he&apos;s mad on the subject of drawers that&apos;s plain to be seen when
he saw me from behind following in the rain I saw him before he saw me however
standing at the corner of the Harold&apos;s cross road with a new raincoat on
him and the brown hat looking as sly as ever what was he doing there we&apos;re
not to ask any questions but they want to know where were you where are you
going <a name="s18001at" href="../../FF/unbs/s18all.htm#s18001at">I could feel
him coming</a> after me his eyes on my neck pestered me to say yes he said my
openwork sleeves were too cold for the rain anything for an excuse to put his
hand near me <a name="un5013cm" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5013cm">drawers
drawers</a> all the time he did look a big fool
<a name="s18013n" href="../../FF/unbs/s18all.htm#s18013n">splendid set of teeth
he had made me hungry to look at them</a> and wanted me to lift the orange
petticoat I had on with the sunray pleats that there was nobody he said
he&apos;d kneel down in the wet if I didn&apos;t you never know what freak
they&apos;d take alone with you if anyone was passing so I touched his trousers
outside the way I used to Gardner
<a name="un4035cg" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4035cg">to keep him from
doing worse</a> he was
<a name="s18013g" href="../../FF/unbs/s18all.htm#s18013g">shaking like a jelly
all over</a> then he wrote me that letter with all those words in it how could
he have the face to any woman after his company manners making it so awkward
after when we met asking me have I offended you and if I knew what it meant of
course I had to say no for form sake and wasn&apos;t it natural so it is of
course it used to be written up with a picture of a woman&apos;s
<a name="un4035ai" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4035ai">on that wall in
Gibraltar</a> then writing every morning a letter sometimes twice a day I liked
the way he made love then he knew the way to take a woman the night he kissed my
heart at Dolphin&apos;s barn it makes you feel like nothing on earth but he
never knew how to embrace well like Gardner I hope he&apos;ll come on Monday as
he said at the same time four I hate people who come at all hours answer the
door you think it&apos;s the vegetables then it&apos;s somebody and you all
undressed or <a name="s18013f" href="../../FF/unbs/s18all.htm#s18013f">the door
of the filthy kitchen open</a> the day old Goodwin called about the concert in
Lombard street nobody to say you&apos;re out you have to peep out through the
blind I was just beginning to yawn with nerves when I knew his
<a name="s18013bj" href="../../FF/unbs/s18all.htm#s18013bj">tattarrattat</a> at
the door he must have been a bit late because it was after
<br><font color="green">{ms, 6}</font>
<br> three when I saw the two Dedalus girls coming from school when I threw the
penny to that lame sailor and I hadn&apos;t even put on my clean shift then this
day week we&apos;re to go to Belfast just as well Poldy has to go to Ennis his
father&apos;s anniversary the 27<sup>th</sup> it wouldn&apos;t be pleasant if he
did suppose our rooms at the hotel were beside each other and any fooling went
on I couldn&apos;t tell him to stop and not bother me with him in the next room
then he&apos;d never believe the next day we didn&apos;t do something it&apos;s
all very well a husband but
<a name="s18019as" href="../../FF/unbs/s18all.htm#s18019as">you can&apos;t fool
a lover</a> after me telling him we never did anything no it&apos;s better
he&apos;s going where he is besides
something<a target="foot" id="ftz0022">&ordm;</a> always happens with him the
time going to the Cork concert at Maryborough ordering
<a name="s18001av" href="../../FF/unbs/s18all.htm#s18001av">boiling soup</a> for
the two of us then the bell rang out he walks down the platform with the soup
splashing about taking spoonfuls of it and the waiter after him making a show of
us screeching and confusion for the engine to start but
<a name="un4035bu" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4035bu">he wouldn&apos;t pay
till he finished it the two gentlemen in the carriage said he was quite
right</a> so he was too he&apos;s so pigheaded sometimes when he gets a thing
into his head a <a name="s18010ba" href="../../FF/unbs/s18all.htm#s18010ba">good
job he was able to open the carriage door with his knife</a> or they&apos;d have
taken us on to Cork I suppose that was done out of revenge on him
<a name="un4034aj" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4034aj">I love jaunting in a
train or a car</a> I wonder
<a name="s18014m" href="../../FF/unbs/s18all.htm#s18014m">will he take a
firstclass for me he might want to do it in the train</a> by tipping the guard
well O I suppose there&apos;ll be the usual idiots of men gaping at us
<a name="s18014ab" href="../../FF/unbs/s18all.htm#s18014ab">one or two
tunnels</a> perhaps then
<a name="un4050bp" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4050bp">you have to look out
of the window</a> all the nicer then coming back suppose I
<a name="s18013bc" href="../../FF/unbs/s18all.htm#s18013bc">never came back</a>
what would they say
<a name="un4035cw" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4035cw">eloped</a> with him
that gets you on on the stage the last concert I sang at where it&apos;s over a
year ago when was it S. Teresa&apos;s hall Clarendon St slips of girls they have
now singing Kathleen Kearney and her like on account of father being in the army
and Poldy not Irish enough was it him managed it this time
<a name="un4037g" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4037g">I wouldn&apos;t put it
past him</a> he was going about with some of them
Sinn<a target="foot" id="ftz0023">&ordm;</a> Fein or whatever they call
themselves talking his usual
<a name="un6017af" href="../../FF/unbs/un6all.htm#un6017af">trash and
nonsense</a> still it must have been him he knew there was a boycott
<a name="s18004av" href="../../FF/unbs/s18all.htm#s18004av">I hate the mention
of their politics after the war</a> that Pretoria and Ladysmith

with their kilts in time or the Dublins his father made his money over selling
the horses for the cavalry well he could buy me a nice present up in Belfast after what I gave him they&apos;ve lovely
<br><font color="green">{ms, 7}</font>
<br> linen up there or one of those nice kimono things it would be exciting
going round with him shopping buying those things in a new city better leave
this ring behind want to keep turning and turning to get it over the knuckle
there or they might bell it round the town in their papers or tell the police on
me but they&apos;d think we&apos;re married O let them all go and smother
themselves for all I care he has plenty of money and he&apos;s not a marrying
man so someone better get it out of him if I could find out whether he likes me
I looked a bit washy of course a mirror never gives you the expression besides
lying on me like that all the time with his big hipbones he&apos;s heavy too for
this heat lovely stuff in that blue suit he had on and stylish tie and silk
socks he&apos;s certainly well off but he was like a devil for a few minutes
after he came back with the stop press because he lost 20 quid he said he lost
over that outsider that won and half he put on for me on account of
Lenehan&apos;s tip always hanging out of them for money in a restaurant we have
to be thankful for our cup of tea even as a great compliment the way the world
is divided in any case if it&apos;s going to go on I want at least two other
good chemises and but I don&apos;t know what kind of drawers he likes none at
all I think didn&apos;t he say then the second pair of silkette stockings is
laddered after one day&apos;s wear I could have brought them back to
Sparrow&apos;s this morning and made them change them only not to run the risk
of walking into him and spoiling everything and one of those kidfitting corsets
I&apos;d want advertised cheap in the Gentlewoman with elastic gores on the hips
<a name="un4034ba" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4034ba">he saved the one I
have</a> but that&apos;s no good what did they say they give a delightful figure
line 11/6 obviating that unsightly broad appearance about the lower back garters
that much I have the violet pair I wore today that&apos;s all he bought me out
of the cheque he got on the first O no there was the face lotion I finished
yesterday that made my skin like new I told him
<a name="s18013e" href="../../FF/unbs/s18all.htm#s18013e">get that made up in
the same place and don&apos;t forget it</a> God knows whether he did

bottle</a> anyway and the four paltry handkerchiefs about 6/- in all sure you
can&apos;t get on in this world without clothes the men won&apos;t look at you
and women try to walk on you for the four years more I have of life up to 35 no
I&apos;m what am I I&apos;ll be thirtythree in September O well look at that Mrs Galbraith she&apos;s much
<br><font color="green">{ms, 8}</font>
<br> older than me I saw her when I was out last week her beauty&apos;s on the
wane she was a lovely woman head of hair on her down to her waist
<a name="s18013s" href="../../FF/unbs/s18all.htm#s18013s">like Kitty
O&apos;Shea</a> in Grantham street

about the jealous old husband what was it at all and an oyster knife he went no
he made her wear a kind of a tin thing round her and the prince of Wales yes he
had the oyster knife can&apos;t be true a thing like that because how could she
go to the chamber when she wanted to and she a
<a name="un6020ba" href="../../FF/unbs/un6all.htm#un6020ba">rich lady</a> he
ought to chuck that Freeman with the paltry few shillings he knocks out of it
and go into an office or something where he&apos;d get regular money of course
he prefers hanging about the house so you can&apos;t stir with him or pretending
to be mooching about for advertisements when he could have been in Mr
Cuffe&apos;s still only for what he did then sending me to try and patch it up I
could have got him promoted there to be the manager he gave me a great eye once
or twice first he was as stiff as the mischief
<a name="s18014h" href="../../FF/unbs/s18all.htm#s18014h">really and truly Mrs
Bloom</a> only I felt rotten simply with the old rubbishy dress that I lost the
lead out of the tails with no cut in it but they&apos;re coming into fashion
again I bought it simply to please him pity I changed my mind of going to Todd
and Burns as I said and not M<SUP><small>c</small></SUP>Birney&apos;s rummage
sale a lot of trash he thinks he knows a great lot about a woman&apos;s dress if
I went by his advices every blessed hat I put on does that suit me yes take that
on pins and needles about the shopgirl in that place in Grafton street I had the
misfortune to bring him into and she as insolent as could be with her smirk
saying <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">if</span></span> I&apos;m
afraid we&apos;re giving you too much trouble what she&apos;s there for but I
stared it out of her yes he was awfully stiff and no wonder but he changed the
second time he looked Poldy pigheaded as usual like the soup but I could see him
looking very hard at my chest I&apos;m extremely
<br><font color="green">{ms, 9}</font>
<br> sorry Mrs Bloom believe me without making it too marked the first time
after him being insulted and me being supposed to be his wife I know my chest
was out that way at the door when he said I&apos;m extremely sorry and I&apos;m sure you were.</p>
<p> I think he made them a bit firmer sucking them like that so long he made me

he&apos;d be much use still better than nothing the night I thought I heard
burglars in the kitchen and he went down in his shirt with a candle and a poker
as white as a sheet frightened out of his wits making as much noise as he
possibly could for their benefit there isn&apos;t much to steal indeed the Lord
knows still it&apos;s the feeling especially now with Milly away such an idea
for him to send the girl down there to learn to take photographs only he&apos;d
do a thing like that all the same on account of me and Boylan that&apos;s why he
did it I&apos;m certain the way he plots and plans everything out I
couldn&apos;t turn round with her in the place lately gave me the fidgets coming
in without knocking first when I put the chair against the door just as I was
washing myself there with the glove get on your nerves then doing the loglady
all day wouldn&apos;t even teem the potatoes for you of course she&apos;s right
not to ruin her hands I noticed he was always talking to her lately at the table
explaining things in the paper and she pretending to understand sly of course
that comes from his side of the house he can&apos;t say I pretend things can he
I&apos;m too honest as a matter of fact I suppose he thinks I&apos;m finished

too with Tom Devan&apos;s two sons imitating me whistling with those romps of
Murray girls calling for her can Milly come out please she&apos;s in great
demand to pick what they can out of her round in Nelson street riding Harry

dress when I was biting off the thread of the button I sewed
<br><font color="green">{ms, 18}</font>
<br> on to the bottom of her jacket she couldn&apos;t hide much from me only I
oughtn&apos;t to have stitched it and it on her it brings a parting and the last
plumpudding too split in 2 halves see it comes out no matter what they say her
tongue is too long for my taste your blouse is open too low she says to me and I
had to tell her not to cock her legs up like that on show on the windowsill

at the Only Way in the Theatre royal take your foot away out of that I hate

near two stylishdressed ladies outside Switzer&apos;s window at the same little
game I recognised him on the moment but he didn&apos;t remember me yes and she
didn&apos;t even want me to kiss her at the Broadstone going away well I hope
she&apos;ll get someone to dance attendance on her the way I did where&apos;s
this and where&apos;s that of course she can&apos;t feel anything deep yet only
the usual girls&apos; nonsense and giggling that Conny Connolly writing to her
in white ink on black paper sealed with sealingwax though she clapped when the
curtain came down because he looked so handsome then we had Martin Harvey for
breakfast dinner and supper I thought to myself afterwards it must be real love
if a man gives up his life for her that way for nothing I suppose there are a
few men like that left it&apos;s hard to believe in it though unless it really
happened to me the majority of them with not a particle of love in their natures
to find two people like that nowadays full up of each other they&apos;re usually
<br><font color="green">{ms, 19}</font>
<br> a bit foolish in the head she&apos;s always making love to my things too
the few old rags I have wanting to put her hair up at fifteen she&apos;s time
enough for that all her life after of course she&apos;s restless knowing
she&apos;s pretty I was too but there&apos;s no use going to the fair with the
thing answering me like a fishwoman when I asked to go for a till I gave her a
damn fine crack on the ear for herself she had me that exasperated that was the
last time she turned on the teartap I was just like that myself they
daren&apos;t order me about the place it&apos;s his fault of course having the
two of us slaving here instead of getting in a woman long ago am I ever going to
have a proper servant again that old Mrs Fleming you have to be walking round
after her putting the things into her hands sneezing and farting into the pots
well of course she&apos;s old she can&apos;t help it a good job I found that
rotten old smelly rag behind the dresser I knew there was something and opened
the window to let out the smell bringing in his friends to entertain them
especially Simon Dedalus&apos; son his father such a criticiser with his glasses
in the dirty old kitchen now is he right in his head I ask my old pair of
drawers might have been hanging up too on the line for exhibition for all
he&apos;d ever care with the ironmould mark the stupid old bundle burned on them
he might think was something else and she never even rendered down the fat I
told her and now she&apos;s going such as she was on account of her paralysed
husband getting worse

we met when I was living in Rehoboth terrace we stood staring at one another for
about 10 minutes he used to amuse the things he said with the half sloothering

parliament O wasn&apos;t it the fool to believe all his blather about home rule
and the land league sending me that long strool of a song out of the Huguenots

show one wet Sunday in the museum in Kildare street all yellow in a pinafore
lying on his side on his hand with his ten toes sticking out that he said was a
bigger religion than the jews and Our Lord&apos;s together all over Asia
imitating him as he&apos;s always imitating everybody I suppose he used to sleep
at the foot of the bed too with his big square feet up in his wife&apos;s mouth
damn this stinking thing anyway where&apos;s this those napkins are ah yes I
know I hope the old press doesn&apos;t creak ah I knew it would he&apos;s

he has to pay for it from her O this nuisance of a thing I hope they&apos;ll

forlornlooking spectacle you couldn&apos;t call him a husband yes it&apos;s some

is the fruits of Mr Paddy Dignam yes they were all in great style at the grand
funeral in the paper Boylan brought in L. Boom and Tom Kernan, that drunken

especially Jack Power keeping that barmaid he does of course his wife is always
sick or going to be sick or getting better of it and he&apos;s a goodlooking man
still though he&apos;s getting a bit grey over the ears they&apos;re a nice lot
all of them well they&apos;re not going to get my husband again into their
clutches if I can help it making fun of him then behind his back I know well
when he goes on with his idiotics because he has sense enough not to squander
every penny piece he earns down their gullets goodfornothings poor Paddy Dignam
all the same I&apos;m sorry in a way for him what are his wife and five children
going to do unless he was insured comical little teetotum wasn&apos;t he yes he
was at the Glencree dinner and Ben Dollard base barreltone the night he borrowed
the swallowtail to sing out of in Holles street squeezed and squashed into them
and grinning all over his big Dolly face didn&apos;t he look a balmy ballocks
sure enough that must have been a spectacle on the stage imagine paying 5/- in
the preserved seats for that and Simon Dedalus too he was always turning up half
screwed singing the second verse first so sweetly sang the maiden on the
hawthorn bough he was always on for flirtyfying too when I sang Maritana with
him at Freddy Mayers private opera he had a delicious voice

he pretended to understand it all probably he told him he was out of Trinity
college he&apos;s very young to be a professor I hope he&apos;s not a professor
like Goodwin was they all write about some woman in their poetry well I suppose
he won&apos;t find many like me where softly sighs of love the light guitar

can&apos;t we all remain friends over it instead of quarrelling her husband
found it out well and if he did can he undo it and then he going to the other
mad extreme about the wife in Fair Tyrants of course the man never even casts a

wants and he gets her what else were we given all those desires for I&apos;d
like to know I can&apos;t help it if I&apos;m young still can I it&apos;s a
wonder I&apos;m not an old shrivelled hag before my time living with him so cold
never embracing me except sometimes when he&apos;s asleep the wrong end of me
not knowing I suppose who he has any man that&apos;d kiss a woman&apos;s bottom
I&apos;d throw my hat at him after that unnatural

of course a woman wants to be embraced 20 times a day almost to make her look
young no matter by who so long as to be in love or loved by somebody if the
fellow you want isn&apos;t there sometimes by God I was thinking would I go
around by the quays there some dark evening where nobody&apos;d know me and pick
up a sailor off the sea that&apos;d be hot on for it and not care a pin whose I
was only do it off up in a gate somewhere what they do themselves the fine
gentlemen in their silk hats that K.C. lives up somewhere this way coming out of
Hardwicke lane the night he gave us the fish supper
<a name="s18011d" href="../../FF/unbs/s18all.htm#s18011d">on account of winning

will I indeed I&apos;d just like to see myself at it I don&apos;t care what
anybody says it&apos;d be much better for the world to be governed by women in
it you wouldn&apos;t see women going and killing one another and slaughtering
when do you ever see women rolling around drunk like they do or gambling every
penny they have and losing it on horses yes because a woman whatever she does
she knows where to stop sure they wouldn&apos;t be in the world at all only for
us they don&apos;t know what it is to be a woman and a mother how could they
where would they all of them be if they hadn&apos;t all a mother to look after
them that&apos;s why I suppose he&apos;s running wild now out at night away from
his books and studies and not living at home on account of the usual rowy house
I suppose you see those that have a fine son like that they&apos;re not
satisfied and I none was he not able to make one that disheartened me altogether
I suppose I oughtn&apos;t to have buried him in that little woolly jacket I
knitted but give it to some poor child but I knew well I&apos;d never have
another O I&apos;m not going to think myself into the glooms about that any more
I wonder why he wouldn&apos;t stay the night I felt all the time it was somebody
strange he brought in instead of roving around the city meeting God knows who
nightwalkers and pickpockets his poor mother wouldn&apos;t like that if she was
alive ruining himself for life perhaps he could easy have slept in there on the
sofa I suppose he was as shy as a boy he being so young hardly 20 of me in the
next room he&apos;d have heard me on the chamber arrah what harm Dedalus I
wonder it&apos;s like those names in Gibraltar Delapaz Delagracia they had the
devil&apos;s queer names there father Vilaplana of Santa Maria that gave me the

Rubio lent me by Valera with the questions in it all upside down the two ways I
can tell him the Spanish and he tell me the Italian then he&apos;ll see I&apos;m
not so ignorant what a pity he didn&apos;t stay I&apos;m sure the poor fellow
wanted a good sleep badly I could have brought him in his breakfast in bed with
a bit of toast so as I didn&apos;t do it on the knife for bad luck or if the
woman was going her rounds with the watercress and ground ivy something nice and
tasty I could do the criada the room looks all right since I changed it the
other way you see something was telling me all the time I&apos;d have to
introduce myself not knowing me from Adam very funny wouldn&apos;t it I&apos;m
his wife or pretend we were in Spain with him half awake without a God&apos;s
notion where he is dos huevos estrellados se&ntilde;or Lord the cracked things
come into my head sometimes it&apos;d be great fun supposing he stayed with us
why not there&apos;s the room upstairs empty and Milly&apos;s bed in the back
room I&apos;m sure I&apos;m not going to take in lodgers off the street I&apos;d
love to have a long talk with an intelligent welleducated person I&apos;d have
to get a nice pair of red slippers like those
<a name="un6022dh" href="../../FF/unbs/un6all.htm#un6022dh">Turks</a> with the
<a name="un6022dg" href="../../FF/unbs/un6all.htm#un6022dg">fez</a> used to sell
or yellow and a nice semitransparent morning gown that I badly want I&apos;ll
just give him one more chance I&apos;ll get up early in the morning I&apos;m
sick of Cohen&apos;s old bed in any case then I&apos;ll throw him up his eggs
and tea I know what I&apos;ll do I&apos;ll go about rather gay not too much
singing a bit now and then mi fa pieta Masetto then I&apos;ll start dressing
myself to go out presto non son pi&ugrave; forte I&apos;ll put on my best shift
and drawers let him have a good eyeful out of that to make him stand I&apos;ll
let him know if that&apos;s what he wanted that his wife is fucked and damn well
fucked too not by him 4 or 5 times running serve him right it&apos;s all his own
fault if I am an adulteress as the thing in the gallery said O much about it if
that&apos;s all the
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext"><font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">unread</span></font></span></span>
harm ever we did in this
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">world</span></span> vale of tears
God knows it&apos;s not much I suppose that&apos;s what a woman is supposed to
be there for or He wouldn&apos;t have made us the way He did then if he wants to
kiss my bottom I&apos;ll stick it out in his face as large as life then
I&apos;ll tell him I want &pound;1 or perhaps 30/- I&apos;ll tell him I want to
buy underclothes then if he gives me that well he won&apos;t be too bad
I&apos;ll let him do it off on me behind provided he doesn&apos;t smear all my good drawers O I suppose that
<br><font color="green">{ms, 4}</font>
<br> can&apos;t be helped I&apos;ll do the indifferent one or two questions
I&apos;ll know by the answers when he&apos;s like that he can&apos;t keep a
thing back I&apos;ll tighten my bottom well and let out a few
<a name="un4035dc" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4035dc">smutty words</a>
then I&apos;ll suggest about yes O wait now my turn is coming I&apos;ll be quite
gay and friendly over it O but I was forgetting this bloody pest of a thing
pfooh no I&apos;ll have to wear the old things so much the better it&apos;ll be
more pointed he&apos;ll never know whether he did it or not there that&apos;s
good enough for you any old thing at all then I&apos;ll wipe him off me just
like a business then I&apos;ll go out I&apos;ll have eying up at the ceiling
where is she gone now I&apos;ll go to Lambe&apos;s there beside Findlater&apos;s
and get them to send us some flowers to put about the place in case he brings
him home tomorrow today I mean no no Friday&apos;s an unlucky day first I want
to do the place up someway then we can have music and cigarettes those fairy
cakes in Lipton&apos;s at 7&frac12; d a lb or the other ones with the cherries
in them and the pinky sugar 11 d a couple of lbs of those a nice plant for the
middle of the table I&apos;d get that cheaper in wait where&apos;s I saw them
not long ago I love flowers I&apos;d love to have the whole place swimming in
roses there&apos;s nothing like nature the wild mountains then the sea and the
waves rushing then the beautiful country with the fields of oats and wheat and
all kinds of things and all the fine cattle going about that would do your heart
good to see rivers and lakes and flowers all sorts of shapes and smells and
colours springing up even out of the
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">dit</span></span> ditches
primroses and violets nature it is as for them saying there&apos;s no God I
wouldn&apos;t give a snap of my two fingers for all their learning why
don&apos;t they go and create something I often asked him atheists or whatever
they call themselves go and wash the cobbles off themselves first then they go
howling for the priest and they dying and why why because they&apos;re afraid ah
yes I know them well who was the first person in the universe before there was
anybody that made it all that they don&apos;t know neither do I so there you are
they might as well try to stop the sun from rising the sun shines for you he
said the day we were lying among the rhododendrons on Howth head the day I got
him to propose to me and it was leapyear like now sixteen years ago my God after
that long kiss I near lost my breath yes he said I was a flower of the mountain yes so we are
<br><font color="green">{ms, 5}</font>
<br> flowers all a woman&apos;s body yes that was one true thing he said in his
life and the sun shines for you today yes that was why I liked him
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">he</span></span> because I saw he
understood or felt what a woman is and I knew I could always get round him and I
gave him all the pleasure I could leading him on till he asked me to say yes and
I wouldn&apos;t answer first only looked
<a name="s18007ac" href="../../FF/unbs/s18all.htm#s18007ac">out over the sea and
the sky</a> I was thinking of so many things he didn&apos;t know of Mulvey and
Mr Stanhope and Hester and father and old captain Groves and the Alameda gardens
and Gibraltar as a girl where I was a flower of the mountain and how he kissed
me under the Moorish wall and I thought well as well him as another and then I
asked him with my eyes to ask again and then he asked me would I to say yes my
mountain flower and first I put my arms around him and drew him down to me so he
could feel my breasts all perfume and I said I will yes. </p>
