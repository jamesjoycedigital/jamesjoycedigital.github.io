<p> Martin Cunningham, first, poked his silkhatted head into the creaking
carriage and, entering deftly, seated himself. Mr Power stepped in after him, curving his height with care.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Come on, Simon.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; After you, Mr Bloom said.</p>
<p> Mr Dedalus covered himself quickly and got in, saying:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, yes.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Are we all here now? Martin Cunningham asked. Come along, Bloom.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom entered and sat in the vacant place. He pulled the door to after
him and slammed it twice till it shut tight. He passed an arm through the
armstrap and looked seriously from the open carriage window at the lowered
blinds of the avenue. One dragged aside: an old woman peeping. Nose
whiteflattened against the pane. Thanking her stars she was passed over.
Extraordinary the interest they take in a corpse.

<p> All waited. Nothing was said. Stowing in the wreaths probably. I am sitting
on something hard. Ah, that soap in my hip pocket. Better shift it out of that. Wait for an opportunity.</p>
<p> All waited. Then wheels were heard from in front,
turning<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">:</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>
then nearer: then horses&apos; hoofs. A jolt. Their carriage began to move, creaking and swaying.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 85}</font>
<br> Other hoofs and creaking wheels started behind. The blinds of the avenue
passed and number ten with its craped knocker, door ajar. At walking pace.</p>
<p> They waited still, their knees jogging, till they had turned and were
passing along the tramtracks. Tritonville road. Quicker. The wheels rattled
rolling over the cobbled causeway and the crazy glasses shook rattling in the doorframes.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What way is he taking us? Mr Power asked of both windows.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Through Irishtown, Martin Cunningham said. Ringsend. Brunswick street.</p>
<p> Mr Dedalus nodded, looking out.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That&apos;s a fine old custom, he said. I am glad to see it has not died out.</p>
<p> All watched awhile through their windows caps and hats lifted by passers.
Respect. The carriage swerved from the tramtrack to the smoother road. Mr Bloom
at gaze saw a lithe young man, clad in mourning, a wide hat.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There&apos;s a friend of yours gone by, Dedalus, he said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who is that?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Your son and heir.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Where is he? Mr Dedalus said, stretching over across.</p>
<p> The carriage lurched round the corner and, swerving back to the tramtrack,
rolled on noisily with chattering wheels. Mr Dedalus fell back, saying:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Was that Mulligan cad with him? His <i>fidus Achates</i>!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; No, Mr Bloom said. He was alone.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Down with his aunt Sally, I suppose, Mr Dedalus said, the
Goulding faction and the drunken little costdrawer and Crissie, papa&apos;s
little lump of dung, the wise child that knows her own father.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom smiled joylessly on Ringsend road. Wallace Bros. The bottleworks. Dodder bridge.

ironing his back. Thinks he&apos;ll cure it with pills. All breadcrumbs they are. About six hundred per cent profit.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He&apos;s in with a lowdown crowd, Mr Dedalus snarled.
That Mulligan is a contaminated bloody doubledyed ruffian by all accounts. His name stinks all

to his mother or his aunt or whatever she is that will open her eye as wide as a
gate. I&apos;ll tickle his catastrophe, believe you me.</p>
<p> He cried above the clatter of the wheels.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I won&apos;t have her bastard of a nephew ruin my son. A
counterjumper&apos;s son. Selling tapes in my cousin, Peter Paul M&apos;Swiney&apos;s. Not likely.</p>
<p> He ceased. Mr Bloom glanced from his angry moustache to Mr Power&apos;s mild
face and Martin Cunningham&apos;s eyes and beard, gravely shaking. Noisy
selfwilled man. Full of his son. He is right. Something to hand on. If little
Rudy had lived. See him grow up. Hear his voice in the house. Walking beside
Molly

with the rip she never stitched. Give us a touch, Poldy. God, I&apos;m dying for it. How life begins.</p>
<p> Got big then. Had to refuse the Greystones concert. My son inside her. I
could have helped him on in life. I could. Make him independent. Learn German too.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Are we late? Mr Power asked.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ten minutes, Martin Cunningham said, looking at his watch.</p>

<p> The carriage heeled over and back, their four trunks swaying.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Corny might have given us a more commodious yoke, Mr Power said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He might, Mr Dedalus said, if he hadn&apos;t that squint troubling him. Do you follow me?</p>
<p> He closed his left eye. Martin Cunningham began to brush away crustcrumbs from under his thighs.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What is this, he said, in the name of God? Crumbs?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Someone seems to have been making a picnic party here lately, Mr Power said.</p>
<p> All raised their thighs and eyed with disfavour the mildewed buttonless
leather of the seats. Mr Dedalus, twisting his nose, frowned downward and said:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Unless I&apos;m greatly mistaken. What do you think, Martin?
<br><font color="green">{u22, 87}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It struck me too, Martin Cunningham said.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom set his thigh down. Glad I took that bath. Feel my feet quite
clean. But I wish Mrs Fleming had darned these socks better.</p>
<p> Mr Dedalus sighed resignedly.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; After all, he said, it&apos;s the most natural thing in the world.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Did Tom Kernan turn up? Martin Cunningham asked, twirling the peak of his beard gently.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, Mr Bloom answered. He&apos;s behind with Ned Lambert and Hynes.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And Corny Kelleher himself? Mr Power asked.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; At the cemetery, Martin Cunningham said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I met M&apos;Coy this morning, Mr Bloom said. He said he&apos;d try to come.</p>
<p> The carriage halted short.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What&apos;s wrong?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; We&apos;re stopped.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Where are we?
<br><font color="green">{u21, 102}</font> </p>
<p> Mr Bloom put his head out of the window.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The grand canal, he said.</p>
<p> Gasworks. Whooping cough they say it cures. Good job Milly never got it.
Poor children! Doubles them up black and blue in convulsions. Shame really. Got
off lightly with illnesses compared. Scarlatina, influenza epidemics. Canvassing
for death. Don&apos;t miss this chance. Dogs&apos; home over there. Poor old
Athos! Be good to Athos, Leopold, is my last wish.

dots over the grey flags. Apart. Curious. Like through a colander. I thought it
would. My boots were creaking I remember now.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The weather is changing, he said quietly.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A pity it did not keep up fine, Martin Cunningham said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Wanted for the country, Mr Power said. There&apos;s the sun again coming out.</p>
<p> Mr Dedalus, peering through his glasses towards the veiled sun, hurled a mute curse at the sky.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It&apos;s as uncertain as a child&apos;s bottom, he said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; We&apos;re off again.</p>
<p> The carriage turned again its stiff wheels and their trunks swayed gently.
Martin Cunningham twirled more quickly the peak of his beard.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 88}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Tom Kernan was immense last night, he said.

<p class="di">&mdash; O draw him out, Martin, Mr Power said eagerly. Wait till
you hear him, Simon, on Ben Dollard&apos;s singing of <i>The Croppy Boy</i>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Immense, Martin Cunningham said pompously. <i>His singing
of that simple ballad, Martin, is the most trenchant rendering I ever heard in
the whole course of my experience.</i></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Trenchant, Mr Power said laughing. He&apos;s dead nuts on
that. And the retrospective arrangement.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Did you read Dan Dawson&apos;s speech? Martin Cunningham asked.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 103}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I did not then, Mr Dedalus said. Where is it?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; In the paper this morning.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom took the paper from his inside pocket. That book I must change for her.</p>

<p class="di">&mdash; How do you do? Martin Cunningham said, raising his palm to his brow in salute.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He doesn&apos;t see us, Mr Power said. Yes, he does. How do you do?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who? Mr Dedalus asked.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Blazes Boylan, Mr Power said. There he is airing his quiff.</p>
<p> Just that moment I was thinking.</p>
<p> Mr Dedalus bent across to salute. From the door of the Red Bank the white
disc of a straw hat flashed reply: passed.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom reviewed the nails of his left hand, then those of his right hand.
The nails, yes. Is there anything more in him that they she sees? That keeps him
alive. They sometimes feel what a person is. Instinct. But a type like that. My
nails. I am just looking at them: well pared. And after: thinking alone. Body
getting a bit softy. I would notice that from remembering. What causes that? I
suppose the skin can&apos;t contract quickly enough when the flesh falls off.
But the shape is there. The shape is there still. Shoulders. Hips. Plump. Night
of the dance dressing. Shift stuck between the cheeks behind.</p>
<p> He clasped his hands between his knees and, satisfied, sent his vacant glance over their faces.</p>
<p> Mr Power asked:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; How is the concert tour getting on, Bloom?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O very well, Mr Bloom said. I hear great accounts of it.
It&apos;s a good idea, you see&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Are you going yourself?
<br><font color="green">{u22, 90}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Well no, Mr Bloom said. I am not sure, that is. You see
the idea is to tour the chief towns. What you lose on one you can make up the other.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Quite so, Martin Cunningham said. Mary Anderson is up there now. Have you good artists?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Louis Werner is touring her, Mr Bloom said. O yes,
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">we</span></span>

<p> Mr Bloom unclasped his hands in a gesture of soft politeness and clasped
them. The carriage wheeling by Smith O&apos;Brien&apos;s statue united noiselessly their unresisting knees.</p>
<p> Oot: a dullgarbed old man from the curbstone tendered his wares, his mouth opening: oot.</p>

<p> Martin Cunningham nudged Mr Power.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Of the tribe of Reuben, he said.</p>
<p> A tall blackbearded figure, bent on a stick, stumping round the corner of
Elvery&apos;s elephant house showed them a curved hand open on his spine.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 91}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; In all his pristine beauty, Mr Power said.</p>
<p> Mr Dedalus looked after the stumping figure and said mildly:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The devil break the hasp of your back!</p>
<p> Mr Power, collapsing in laughter, shaded his face from the carriage window.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; We have all been there, Martin Cunningham said broadly.</p>
<p> His eyes met Mr Bloom&apos;s eyes. He caressed his beard, adding:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Well, nearly all of us.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom began to speak with sudden eagerness to his companions&apos; faces.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That&apos;s an awfully good one that&apos;s going the rounds about Reuben J. and the son.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; About the boatman? Mr Power asked.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes. Isn&apos;t it awfully good?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What is that? Mr Dedalus asked. I didn&apos;t hear it.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There was a girl in the case, Mr Bloom began, and he
determined to send him to the isle of Man out of harm&apos;s way but when they were both&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What? Mr Dedalus asked. That

<p class="di">&mdash; Drown Barabbas! Mr Dedalus cried. I wish to Christ he did!</p>
<p> Mr Power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; No, Mr Bloom said, the son himself&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> Martin Cunningham thwarted his speech rudely:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Reuben J. and the son were piking it down the quay next
the river on their way to the isle of Man boat and the young chiseller suddenly
got loose and over the wall with him into the Liffey.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 107}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; For God&apos; sake! Mr Dedalus exclaimed in fright. Is he dead?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Dead! Martin Cunningham cried. Not he! A boatman got a
pole and fished him out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to the
father on the quay

decisively. We must take a charitable view of it.</p>

it be more decent than galloping two abreast?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Well, there&apos;s something in that, Mr Dedalus granted.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And, Martin Cunningham said, we wouldn&apos;t have scenes
like that when the hearse capsized round Dunphy&apos;s and upset the coffin on to the road.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That was terrible, Mr Power&apos;s shocked face said, and
the corpse fell about the road. Terrible!</p>

<p> They drove on. Near it now.</p>

<p> The carriage steered left for Finglas road.</p>
<p> The stonecutter&apos;s yard on the right. Last lap. Crowded on the spit of

<p> The high railings of Prospect rippled past their gaze. Dark poplars, rare
white forms. Forms more frequent, white shapes thronged amid the trees, white
forms and fragments streaming by mutely, sustaining vain gestures on the air.</p>
<p> The felly harshed against the curbstone: stopped. Martin Cunningham put out
his arm and, wrenching back the handle, shoved the door open with his knee. He
stepped out. Mr Power and Mr Dedalus followed.</p>
<p> Change that soap now. Mr Bloom&apos;s hand unbuttoned his hip pocket swiftly
and transferred the paperstuck soap to his inner handkerchief pocket. He stepped
out of the carriage, replacing the newspaper his other hand still held.</p>
<p> Paltry funeral: coach and three carriages. Beyond the hind carriage a hawker
stood by his barrow of cakes and fruit. Simnel cakes those are, stuck together:
cakes for the dead. Who ate them? Mourners coming out.</p>
<p> He followed his companions. Mr Kernan and Ned Lambert followed, Hynes
walking after them. Corny Kelleher stood by the opened hearse and took out the
two wreaths. He handed one to the boy.</p>
<p> Where is that child&apos;s funeral disappeared to?
<br><font color="green">{u21, 114}</font> </p>
<p> Coffin now. Got here before us, dead as he is. Horse looking round at it
with his plume skeowways. Dull eye: collar tight on his neck, pressing on a
bloodvessel or something. Do they know what they cart out here every day? Must
be twenty or thirty funerals every day. Then Mount Jerome for the protestants.
Funerals all over the world everywhere every minute. Shovelling them under by

<p> Mourners came out through the gates: woman and a girl. Leanjawed harpy, hard
woman at a bargain, her bonnet awry. Girl&apos;s face stained with dirt and
tears, holding the woman&apos;s arm, looking up at her for a sign to cry. Fish&apos;s face, bloodless and livid.</p>
<p> The mutes shouldered the coffin and bore it in through the gates. So much

<p> He glanced behind him to where a face with dark thinking eyes followed. Speaking.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Was he insured? Mr Bloom asked.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I believe so, Mr Kernan answered, but the policy was
heavily mortgaged. Martin is trying to get the youngster into Artane.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; How many children did he leave?

<p class="di">&mdash; Five. Ned Lambert says he&apos;ll try to get one of the girls into Todd&apos;s.</p>

<p class="di">&mdash; A great blow to the poor wife, Mr Kernan added.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Indeed yes, Mr Bloom agreed.</p>

him.

<p class="di">&mdash; Martin is going to get up a whip for the youngsters, Ned
Lambert said, pointing ahead. A few bob a skull. Just to keep them going till the insurance is cleared up.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, yes, Mr Dedalus said dubiously. Is that the eldest boy in front?
<br><font color="green">{u21, 116}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, Ned Lambert said, with the wife&apos;s brother. John
Henry Menton is behind. He put down his name for a quid.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I&apos;ll engage he did, Mr Dedalus said. I often told
poor Paddy he ought to mind that job. John Henry is not the worst in the world.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; How did he lose it? Ned Lambert asked. Liquor, what?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Many a good man&apos;s fault, Mr Dedalus said with a sigh.</p>
<p> They halted about the door of the mortuary chapel. Mr Bloom stood behind the
boy with the wreath, looking down at his sleekcombed hair and at the slender
furrowed neck inside his brandnew collar. Poor boy! Was he there when the
father?

<p> After a moment he followed the others in, blinking in the screened light.
The coffin lay on its bier before the chancel, four tall yellow candles at its
corners. Always in front of us. Corny Kelleher, laying a wreath at each fore
corner, beckoned to the boy to kneel. The mourners knelt here and there in
praying desks. Mr Bloom stood behind near the font and, when all had knelt,
dropped carefully his unfolded newspaper from his pocket and knelt his right
knee upon it. He fitted his black hat gently on his left knee and, holding its brim, bent over piously.</p>
<p> A server, bearing a brass bucket with something in it, came out through a
door. The whitesmocked priest came after him, tidying his stole with one hand,
balancing with the other a little book against his toad&apos;s belly. Who&apos;ll read the book? I, said the rook.</p>
<p> They halted by the bier and the priest began to read out of his book with a fluent croak.

Chilly place this. Want to feed well, sitting in there all the morning in the
gloom kicking his heels waiting for the next please. Eyes of a toad too. What
swells him up that way? Molly gets swelled after cabbage. Air of the place
maybe. Looks full up of bad gas. Must be a lot of bad gas round the place.
Butchers for instance: they get like raw beefsteaks. Who was telling me? Mervyn
Browne. Down in the vaults of saint Werburgh&apos;s lovely old organ hundred and
fifty they have to bore a hole in the coffins sometimes to let out the bad gas
and burn it. Out it rushes: blue. One whiff of that and you&apos;re a doner.</p>
<p> My kneecap is hurting me. Ow. That&apos;s better.</p>
<p> The priest took a stick with a knob at the end of it out of the boy&apos;s
bucket and shook it over the coffin. Then he walked to the other end and shook
it again. Then he came back and put it back in the bucket. As you were before
you rested. It&apos;s all written down: he has to do it.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>Et ne nos inducas in tentationem</i>.</p>
<p> The server piped the answers in the treble. I often thought it would be
better to have boy servants. Up to fifteen or so. After that of course&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> Holy water that was, I expect. Shaking sleep out of it. He must be fed up
with that job, shaking that thing over all the corpses they trot up. What harm
if he could see what he was shaking it over. Every mortal day a fresh batch:
middleaged men, old women, children, women dead in childbirth, men with beards,
baldheaded business men, consumptive girls with little sparrows&apos; breasts.
All the year round he prayed the same thing over them all and shook water on top of them: sleep. On Dignam now.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>In paradisum.</i></p>
<p> Said he was going to paradise or is in paradise. Says that over everybody.
Tiresome kind of a job. But he has to say something.</p>
<p> The priest closed his book and went off, followed by the server. Corny

into the mild grey air. Mr Bloom came last, folding his paper again into his
pocket. He gazed gravely at the ground till the coffincart wheeled off to the
left. The metal wheels ground the gravel with a sharp grating cry and the pack
of blunt boots followed the barrow along a lane of sepulchres.</p>
<p> The ree the ra the ree the ra the roo. Lord, I mustn&apos;t lilt here.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The O&apos;Connell circle, Mr Dedalus said about him.</p>
<p> Mr Power&apos;s soft eyes went up to the apex of the lofty cone.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He&apos;s at rest, he said, in the middle of his people,
old Dan O&apos;. But his heart is buried in Rome. How many broken hearts are buried here, Simon!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Her grave is over there, Jack, Mr Dedalus said. I&apos;ll
soon be stretched beside her. Let Him take me whenever He likes.</p>
<p> Breaking down, he began to weep to himself quietly, stumbling a little in his walk. Mr Power took his arm.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; She&apos;s better where she is, he said kindly.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I suppose so, Mr Dedalus said with a weak gasp. I suppose
she is in heaven if there is a heaven.</p>
<p> Corny Kelleher stepped aside from his rank and allowed the mourners to plod by.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Sad occasions, Mr Kernan began politely.

Mr Bloom closed his eyes and sadly twice bowed his head.</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The others are putting on their hats, Mr Kernan said. I
suppose we can do so too. We are the last. This cemetery is a treacherous place.</p>
<p> They covered their heads.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The reverend gentleman read the service too quickly,
don&apos;t you think? Mr Kernan said with reproof.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom nodded gravely, looking in the quick bloodshot eyes. Secret eyes,
secret searching eyes. Mason, I think: not sure. Beside him again. We are the
last. In the same boat. Hope he&apos;ll say something else.</p>
<p> Mr Kernan added:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The service of the Irish church, used in Mount Jerome, is simpler, more impressive, I must say.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 119}</font> </p>
<p> Mr Bloom gave prudent assent. The language of course was
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">different</span></span>
<font color="black">another thing</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>.</p>
<p> Mr Kernan said with solemnity:
<br><font color="green">{u22, 102}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>I am the resurrection and the life.</i> That touches a man&apos;s inmost heart.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It does, Mr Bloom said.</p>
<p> Your heart perhaps but what price the fellow in the six feet by two? No
touching that. Seat of the affections. Broken heart. A pump after all, pumping
thousands of gallons of blood every day. One fine day it gets bunged up and
there you are. Lots of them lying around here: lungs, hearts, livers. Old rusty
pumps: damn the thing else. The resurrection and the life. Once you are dead you
are dead. That last day idea. Knocking them all up out of their graves. Come
forth, Lazarus! And he came fifth and lost the job. Get up! Last day! Then every
fellow mousing around for his liver and his lights and the rest of his traps.
Find damn all of himself that morning. Pennyweight of powder in a skull. Twelve
grammes one pennyweight. Troy measure.</p>
<p> Corny Kelleher fell into step at their side.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Everything went off A 1, he said. What?
<br><font color="green">{u21, 120}</font> </p>
<p> He looked on them from his drawling eye. Policeman&apos;s shoulders. With your tooraloom tooraloom.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; As it should be, Mr Kernan said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What? Eh? Corny Kelleher said.</p>
<p> Mr Kernan assured him.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who is that chap behind with Tom Kernan? John Henry Menton asked. I know his face.</p>
<p> Ned Lambert glanced back.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Bloom, he said. Madam Marion Tweedy that was,
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">is, I
mean,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font> the soprano. She&apos;s his wife.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O, to be sure, John Henry Menton said. I haven&apos;t seen
her for some time. She was a finelooking woman. I danced with her, wait,
fifteen, seventeen golden years ago, at Mat Dillon&apos;s, in Roundtown. And a good armful she was.</p>
<p> He looked behind through the others.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What is he? he asked. What does he do? Wasn&apos;t he in
the stationery line? I fell foul of him one evening, I remember, at bowls.</p>
<p> Ned Lambert smiled.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, he was, he said, in Wisdom Hely&apos;s. A traveller for blotting paper.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; In God&apos;s name, John Henry Menton said, what did she
marry a coon like that for? She had plenty of game in her then.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Has still, Ned Lambert said. He does some canvassing for ads.</p>
<p> John Henry Menton&apos;s large eyes stared ahead.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 103}</font> </p>
<p> The barrow turned into a side lane. A portly man, ambushed among the
grasses, raised his hat in homage. The gravediggers touched their caps.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; John O&apos;Connell, Mr Power said, pleased. He never forgets a friend.</p>
<p> Mr O&apos;Connell shook all their hands in silence. Mr Dedalus said:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I am come to pay you another visit.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; My dear Simon, the caretaker answered in a low voice. I don&apos;t want your custom at all.</p>
<p> Saluting Ned Lambert and John Henry Menton he walked on at Martin
Cunningham&apos;s side, puzzling two long keys at his back.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Did you hear that one, he asked them, about Mulcahy from the Coombe?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I did not, Martin Cunningham said.</p>
<p> They bent their silk hats in concert and Hynes inclined his ear. The
caretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and spoke in a discreet tone to their vacant smiles.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; They tell the story, he said, that two drunks came out
here one foggy evening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs. They asked
for Mulcahy from the Coombe and were told where he was buried. After traipsing
about in the fog they found the grave sure enough. One of the drunks spelt out
the name: Terence Mulcahy. The other drunk was blinking up at a statue of our Saviour the widow had got put up.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 121}</font> </p>
<p> The caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed. He resumed:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
And<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>
after blinking up at the sacred
figure<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>
<i>Not a bloody bit like the man</i>, says he. <i>That&apos;s not Mulcahy</i>, says he, <i>whoever done it</i>.</p>
<p> Rewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with Corny Kelleher, accepting the
dockets given him, turning them over and scanning them as he walked.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That&apos;s all done with a purpose, Martin Cunningham explained to Hynes.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I know, Hynes said, I know that.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; To cheer a fellow up, Martin Cunningham said. It&apos;s pure goodheartedness: nothing else.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom admired the caretaker&apos;s prosperous bulk.

<p> We are praying now for the repose of his soul.</p>
<p> Does he ever think of the hole waiting for himself? They say you do when you
shiver in the sun. Someone walking over it. Mine over there towards Finglas, the
plot I bought. Mamma, poor mamma, and little Rudy.</p>
<p> The gravediggers took up their spades and flung heavy clods of clay in on
the coffin. Mr Bloom turned his face. And if he was alive all the time? Whew! By
Jingo, that would be awful! No, no: he is dead, of course. Of course he is dead.
Monday he died.

<p> The caretaker moved away a few paces and put on his hat. Had enough of it.
The mourners took heart of grace, one by one, covering themselves without show.
Mr Bloom put on his hat and saw the portly figure make its way deftly through
the maze of graves. Quietly, sure of his ground, he traversed the dismal fields.</p>
<p> Hynes jotting down something in his notebook. Ah, the names. But he knows them all. No: coming to me.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I am just taking the names, Hynes said below his breath.
What is your christian name? I&apos;m not sure.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; L, Mr Bloom said. Leopold. And you might put down M&apos;Coy&apos;s name too. He asked me to.</p>

<p> He moved away, looking about him.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; No, Mr Bloom began, turning and stopping. I say, Hynes!</p>
<p> Didn&apos;t hear. What? Where has he disappeared to? Not a sign. Well of all the. Good Lord, what became of him?</p>
<p> A seventh gravedigger came beside Mr Bloom to take up an idle spade.</p>

<p> He stepped aside nimbly.</p>
<p> Clay, brown, damp, began to be seen in the hole. It rose. Nearly over. A
mound of damp clods rose more, rose, and the gravediggers rested their spades.
All uncovered again for a few instants. The boy propped his wreath against a
corner: the brother-in-law his on a lump. The gravediggers put on their caps and
carried their earthy spades towards the barrow. Then knocked the blades lightly
on the turf: clean. One bent to pluck from the

brother-in-law, turning away, placed something in his free hand. Thanks in
silence. Sorry, sir: trouble. Headshake. I know that. For yourselves just.</p>
<p> The mourners moved away slowly without aim, by devious paths, staying awhile to read a name on a tomb.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Let us go round by the chief&apos;s grave, Hynes said. We have time.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 127}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Let us, Mr Power said.</p>
<p> They turned to the right, following their slow thoughts. With awe Mr Power&apos;s blank voice spoke:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Some say he is not in that grave at all. That the coffin
was filled with stones. That one day he will come again.</p>
<p> Hynes shook his head.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Parnell will never come again, he said.
