<a name="s16001ai" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001ai">as the evidence went
to show</a> and there was a tattoo mark too
<a name="s16001aj" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001aj">in Indian ink, lord
Bellew</a> was it, as he might very easily have picked up the details from some
pal on board ship and then introduce himself with: Excuse me, my name is So and
So or <a name="un4055n" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4055n">some such</a>
commonplace<a target="foot" id="frz0078">&ordm;</a> remark. A more prudent
course, as Bloom said to the
<a name="s16013c" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16013c">not over effusive</a>
in fact like the distinguished personage under discussion beside him, would have
been <a name="s16021dl" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16021dl">to sound the lie of the land first</a>.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That bitch, that English whore, did for him, the shebeen
proprietor commented. She put the first nail in his coffin<a target="foot" id="frz0079">&ordm;</a></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Fine lump of a woman all the same, the
<a name="un5017dm" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5017dm">soidisant</a> town
clerk Henry Campbell remarked, and plenty of her. She
<a name="s16014bj" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16014bj">loosened many a
man&apos;s thighs</a>. I seen her picture in a shop. The husband was a captain or an officer.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ay, Skin the Goat said, he was and a cottonball one.</p>
<p> This occasioned a fair amount of laughter among his
<a name="s16014ak" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16014ak">entourage</a>. As
regards Bloom he reflected upon the
<a name="s16001au" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001au">historic</a> story
<a name="s16001aa" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001aa">which had aroused
extraordinary interest at the time</a> when
<a name="s16001cf" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001cf">the facts</a>,

worse</a>, <a name="s16001cf" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001cf">were made
public</a> with the usual

letters <a name="s16001ab" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001ab">that passed
between them</a>

downfall</a> though the thing was

Since <a name="s16005am" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16005am">their names

to</a> the <a name="s16011i" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16011i">lubric</a>
a little, coined money out of. Whereas it was simply a case of the husband
<a name="s16009be" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16009be">not being up to
much</a>, with <a name="s16010f" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16010f">nothing

<br> to the verge of weakness</a>,
<a name="s16009e" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16009e">falling a victim to
her charms</a> and forgetting
<a name="s16010c" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16010c">home ties</a>, the
usual <a name="s16011j" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16011j">sequel</a>,
<a name="s16006aa" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16006aa">to bask in the loved

order</a>, as compared with the other military supernumerary that is which she
of course, woman, quickly perceived as likely to
<a name="s16007h" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16007h">carve his way to
fame</a> which he almost did till the priests and the evicted tenants in the
<a name="s16005f" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16005f">rural parts</a> of the
country very
<a name="s16005i" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16005i">effectually cooked his
goose</a>. Looking back now in a retrospective kind of arrangement all seemed a
kind of dream. And then coming back was
<a name="un4030i" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030i">the worst thing you
ever did</a> because it went without saying you would feel out of place as
things always <a name="un4031ck" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031ck">moved
with the times</a>. Why, as he reflected,
<a name="un4031ak" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031ak">Irishtown</a>
strand, <a name="un4031al" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031al">a locality

since, as it happened, he went to live on the
<a name="un4031am" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031am">north side. North or
south, however, it was a case of hot passion, pure and simple,</a> and just bore
out what he was saying as she also was
<a name="s16027m" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16027m">Spanish</a> or half
so, types that wouldn&apos;t do things by halves,
<a name="s16027l" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16027l">passionate</a> abandon
of the south, casting every shred of decency to the winds.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Just bears out what I was saying, he, with glowing bosom
said to Stephen, about blood and the sun. And if I don&apos;t greatly mistake she was Spanish too.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The King of Spain&apos;s daughter, Stephen answered.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Was she? Bloom said, surprised though not astonished by
any means, I never heard that rumour before.</p>
<p> Possible, especially there, it was, as she lived there. So, Spain,

<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do you consider,
<a name="un4030dh" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030dh">by the by</a>, he
said, thoughtfully selecting a faded photo which he laid on the table, that a Spanish type.</p>
<p> Stephen, obviously addressed, looked down on the photo showing
<a name="s16007aa" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16007aa">a large sized
lady</a> <a name="s16010l" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16010l">with her
charms on evidence in an open fashion</a> as she was in the
<a name="s16013bh" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16013bh">full</a>
<a name="s16013bh" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16013bh">bloom of
womanhood</a> in evening dress cut low to give a
<a name="s16013bi" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16013bi">liberal display</a>
of bosom, with more than visions of breasts, her full lips parted and some
perfect teeth, standing near, ostensibly with gravity, a piano on the rest of
which was <a name="un4030ag" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030ag"><u>In Old
Madrid</u></a>, a ballad, pretty in its way, which was then all the vogue. Her
(the lady&apos;s) eyes, dark, large, looked at Stephen, about to smile about
something to be admired, Lafayette and Son, Dublin.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; My wife, Bloom indicated. Taken a few years since. In or
about ninety six. Very like her then.</p>
<p> Beside the young man he looked also of
<a name="s16022ac" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16022ac">the photo of the
lady now his wife</a>.

was a speaking likeness</a> in expression but
<a name="un6015dv" href="../../FF/unbs/un6all.htm#un6015dv">it did not do
justice to</a> her figure which did not come out to the best advantage in that

without difficulty, he said, have posed for the ensemble</a>, not to dwell on
