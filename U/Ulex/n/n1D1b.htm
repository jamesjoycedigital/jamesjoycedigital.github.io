<p> The milkwhite Dolphin tossed his Mane and, rising in
<br><font color="green">{ms, 14}</font>
<br> the golden Poop the Helmsman spread the glorious Sail upon the Wind. A many
comely Nymphs drew nigh to starboard and to Larboard and linked their shining
forms as doth the cunning Wheelwright when he fashions about the Heart of his
Wheel the equidistant Rays whereof each one is Sister to the next and he binds
them all with an outer Ring and giveth Speed to the Feet of Men
<a name="un4052ah" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4052ah">whenas</a> they ride
to an Hosting or contend for a Prize. Even so did they come and set them, those
willing nymphs, foamwhite sisters. And they laughed sporting in a Circle of
their Foam: and the bark <a name="s12003aj" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12003aj">clave</a> the Waves.</p>

<p> Martin and Jack Power did their level best to keep him quiet but Bloom
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">w</span></span> had his rag out.
All the ragamuffins
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">of</span></span> and guttersnipes
of the place were jeering round the car and says one of the fishgirls</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ay, mister. Look at your hat, mister!</p>
<p> What was it but Cusack
<br><font color="green">{ms, 15}</font>
<br> had stuck two of the bloody betting tickets in the front of Bloom&apos;s
topper and what was on it but: W.C. 13.
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">And</span></span> Terry, the
curate, and Alf Bergan were doubled up laughing:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, mister! Look at what&apos;s on your hat, mister.</p>
<p> Arra sure Bloom didn&apos;t know what was up till Jack stood up and took off
the tickets and all the sluts began to yell:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Eh, mister, give us a speech!</p>
<p> A large and appreciative gathering of friends and acquaintances assembled to
bid farewell to Mr Leopold Bloom on the occasion of his departure. The ceremony
which was characterised by the most affecting cordiality was rendered all the
more picturesque by the presence of numerous delegates from all parts of the
provinces whose traditional national costumes lent a welcome note of colour to
the scene. An illuminated address, the work of Irish artists, was presented to
the distinguished orientalist on behalf of a large section of the community and
was accompanied by the gift of a silver casket, tastefully executed in the style
of ancient Celtic ornament, a work which reflects every credit on the makers,
<a name="s12004l" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004l">Messrs Jacob and
Jacob</a>. The departing guest was the recipient of a hearty ovation, many of
those present being visibly moved when the select orchestra of Irish pipes
<br><font color="green">{ms, 17}</font>
<br> <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">played</span></span>
struck<a target="foot" id="fnz0003">&ordm;</a> up the wellknown strains of
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">th</span></span> <u>Come Back to
Erin</u> as a sendoff.
<a name="un4036be" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4036be">To the echoing
cheers</a> of the multitude the vessel slowly moved away, saluted by a final
floral tribute from the emissaries of the fair sex who were present in large numbers. Gone but not forgotten!</p>
<p> It was the mercy of God the sun was in his eyes. Anyway he made a swipe in
the air and let fly. God, he near sent it into the county Longford. The bloody
fell on the cobblestones with a crash that would waken the dead. You know
he&apos;s a powerful fellow Cusack.
<a name="s12007ah" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12007ah">Best man in Ireland
in his time at putting the fiftysix pound shot.</a> That&apos;s a fact. He won
prizes and cups and medals. O, Cusack was a famous man in his day, faith.</p>
<p> Well you should have heard the yells of the crowd and the horse took fright
and off with him and all the ragtag and bobtail after the car, warhooping.</p>
<p> The explosion was terrific and instantaneous in its effect. The observatory
of Dunsink registered in all eleven shocks and there is no record of a similar
seismic disturbance in our island since the great earthquake of &mdash;. The
epicentre appears to have been that part of the metropolis which constitutes the
Inn&apos;s Quay Ward and parish of saint
<br><font color="green">{ms, 18}</font>
<br> Michan. All the palatial residences in the immediate vicinity of the palace
of justice were demolished and the noble edifice itself is literally a mass of
ruins beneath which, it is only to be feared, all the occupants have been buried
alive. From the reports of eyewitnesses it would seem that the seismic waves
were accompanied by a violent atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic character. An
article of headgear, since ascertained to belong to the much respected clerk of
the crown and peace, Mr George Fottrell, and a silk umbrella with gold handle
with the engraved initials, crest, coat of arms and genealogical tree of the
worshipful recorder of Dublin, sir Frederick Falkiner, were discovered by search
parties in remote parts of the island respectively, the former on the third
basaltic ridge of
<a name="s12006ba" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12006ba">the Giant&apos;s
causeway</a> in Antrim, the latter embedded to the extent of one foot three
inches in the sandy beach beneath the old head of Kinsale, latitude 64',
longitude, 17. Other eyewitnesses state that they observed an incandescent
object of huge volume hurtling through the atmosphere in a trajectory directed
southwest by west. Messages of condolence and sympathy are being hourly received
from all parts of <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the</span></span> various continents
<br><font color="green">{ms, 19}</font>
<br> and the sovereign pontiff has been graciously pleased to order that a
special <u>missa pro defunctis</u> shall be celebrated simultaneously by the
ordinaries of all parish churches of all dioceses subject to the spiritual
authority of the holy see in suffrage of the souls of those faithful departed
who have been so unexpectedly called away from our midst. The work of salvage
and of removal of debris, human remains etc has been entrusted to Messrs Michael
Meade and Son, 4 Great Brunswick street and to Messrs T. and C Martin, 18 North
Wall, assisted by the men and officers of the Duke of Cornwall&apos;s light
infantry under the general supervision of rear admiral sir Heracles Hannibal
Blitzblank Anderson, K.G., K.P., K.T., P.C., K.C.B., M.P., J.P., M.S., D.S.O.,
M.F.H., M.R.I.A, B.L., Mus. Doc., P.L.G, F.R.C.S.I. and F.R.C.P.I.</p>
<p> Tare and ouns it was the grandest sight you ever seen
<a name="un3014a" href="../../FF/unbs/un3all.htm#un3014a">in all your born
puff</a>. Bloom up on the bloody car trying to blather out of him, and the
mudlarks yelling like old boots and the bloody tin bursting open and the horse
galloping like mad man, and the sparks flying out of his hoofs. |xUproar &amp;
holy murder!|x* God, if he got that tin on the head he would have been carted
off to Jervis street and, by God, Cusack would have been pulled for
<a name="s12004bc" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004bc">assault</a>
<a name="s12004bc" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004bc">and battery</a>. The
jarvey saved his life as sure as God made
<br><font color="green">{ms, 20}</font>
<br> little apples. What? O, he did, faith. Where is he?, says he. Did I kill
him<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">?</span></span> or what? Terry
and little Alf Bergan took him by the arm to drag him in
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">and the last we saw</span></span>
but he kept shouting to the bloody dog. After him, Garryowen. After him, boy.
And the last we saw was the car turn the corner and the bloody dog after it for all he was worth.</p>
<p> When, lo, there came about them all a great brightness and they beheld the
golden chariot, which held Him ascend to heaven. And they beheld Him therein,
clothed upon in the glory of the Brightness,
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Wi</span></span> with Raiment as
of the Sun, fair as the Moon and terrible that they durst not look upon him. And
there came a Voice out of Heaven, saying Elijah! Elijah
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">ben Reuben</span></span>! And He
answered, Abba, Abba. And they beheld Him in His Glory ascend to Him Who the
Heaven in the direction of a beeline over Hogan&apos;s in Little Green Street.</p> </p>  </main>
