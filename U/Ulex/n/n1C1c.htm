<p class="pdi">&mdash; He has shares in the <u>Tivoli</u>, &mdash; said, and it
was he got up that Keogh-Bennett boxing match. I heard he made a hundred quid
over it, laying the odds. He spread the report Myler was on the beer and by God
he was training all the time. Did you see that match?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I did not.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Myler dusted the floor with him.

was only a fool to it. A grand sight it was, to see the little chap standing up
to him not up to his navel, and the big fellow swiping. Jesus, he gave him one
puck in the wind right in the navel
<a name="s12003au" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12003au">Queensberry
rules</a> and all, made him puke what he never ate.</p>
<p> It was a memorable
<a name="s12003ah" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12003ah">battle</a>.
Handicapped as he was by lack of poundage Dublin&apos;s pet lamb made up for it
by superlative skill in ringcraft. The final round was a gruelling for both
champions. Bennett had tapped some
<a name="s12003an" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12003an">lively</a>
<a name="s12003an" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12003an">claret</a> in the
previous <a name="s12003ap" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12003ap">bout of
fireworks</a> and Myler came on looking groggy. The soldier
<br><font color="green">{ms, 11}</font>
<br> got to business, leading off with a powerful left
<a name="s12003af" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12003af">jab</a> to which
Myler retaliated by shooting out a
<a name="s12003af" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12003af">stiff one</a> to
Bennett&apos;s face. The latter ducked but the Dubliner lifted him with a left
hook, the punch being a fine one. The men came to grips and the bout ended with
Bennett on the ropes and Myler punishing him. The Englishman was well drenched
with water and when the whistle went came on gamey and full of pluck. It was a
fight to a finish. The men fought like tigers and the excitement was terrific.
After a rapid exchange of blows during which a clever upper cut of the military
man brought blood freely from his opponent&apos;s mouth the lamb suddenly landed
a terrific left to Bennett&apos;s stomach which floored him flat.
<a name="s12003ag" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12003ag">It was a knockout
clean &amp; clever.</a> Amid tense excitement the Shropshire boy was counted out
and Myler declared the winner amid the frenzied plaudits of the public who broke
through the ringropes and fairly mobbed him with delight.
<p class="spbr"><font color="green">(U84 845-849)</font></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I wouldn&apos;t like to see that, &mdash; said. And those
<a name="s12003al" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12003al">butting matches</a>
they have in California, going for each heads down like a bull at a gate.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And bullfighting, Mr B&mdash;, and cockfighting all those
sports are terribly inhuman and hare hunting
<br><font color="green">{ms, 12}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, yes, of course&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What about bughunting, &mdash; asked with a grin.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;

<p class="pdi">&mdash; Isn&apos;t it what you call brain versus brawn</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; They are simply disgusting, Bloom said. Brutal.</p>
<p> He walked to&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Did you twig the one I gave him? &mdash; said, about the buggy jews?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Still and all, &mdash; said, he&apos;s a humane chap.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He is that, &mdash; said sourly.
<a name="s12006bt" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12006bt">He&apos;d shove a
soft hand under a hen.</a> But I&apos;d like to see him in the nine acres in a hurley scrap.

lays her egg she is so glad. Gara klooklooklook. Then comes good uncle Leo. She
puts his hand under black Liz and takes her fresh egg. Gara klooklooklook.

<p> He sang the P&aelig;an of the Games of the Gael: he sang the Deeds of his
Prowess. Youthful he drove the Wolf and the Boar: in the Chace he led the
Knights of Uladh. From his godlike Shoulder sped the Stone: terrible, swift as the Glance of Balor.

<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ay, that&apos;s a fact, &mdash; bore out. He was. How many feet could you put it?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And that&apos;s what we want in Ireland today. Fine open
air games. Irish games. Irish strength and skills. Hurley, Gaelic, soccer. Racy
of the soil. That&apos;s what&apos;ll build up men Ireland a nation once again.</p>
<p> A most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of &mdash;
under the auspices of Cumann na Gadhael on the revival of ancient Gaelic sports
and the importance of physical culture, as understood in
<br><font color="green">{ms, 13}</font>
<br> ancient Greece and Rome and Ireland, for the development of the race. The
venerable president of the ancient order of hibernians brother Michael Cusack
was in the chair and
<a name="s12010l" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12010l">the attendance was of
large dimensions</a>. After an instructive discourse by the chairman a most
interesting and instructive discussion
<a name="s12004h" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004h">ensued</a> as to the
desirability of revivability the ancient games and sports of our old ancient
Irish forefathers. The wellknown &amp; highly respected worker in the cause of
our old tongue, Mr Joseph M<sup><small>c</small></sup>Carthy Hynes made an
eloquent appeal for the resuscitation of ancient Gaelic sports and pastimes as
calculated to revive the best
<a name="s12004k" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004k">racy of the soil</a>
traditions of manly strength and prowess handed down to us from ancient times. L
Bloom having
<a name="s12002ag" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12002ag">espoused the
negative</a> the chairman brought the discussion to a close and, in response to
repeated requests <a name="s12009j" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12009j">and
hearty plaudits</a> from all parts of the house, by a remarkably noteworthy
rendering of Thomas Osborne Davis&apos;s immortal <u>A Nation Once Again</u> in
the execution of which the veteran patriot champion may be said without fear of
contradiction to have fairly
<a name="s12004ad" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004ad">excelled
himself</a>. The venerable patriot champion&apos;s stentorian notes were heard
to the greatest advantage in the grand old song and both the timehonoured anthem
itself and the superb
<a name="s12010m" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12010m">highclass vocalism</a>
were vociferously applauded by the large audience among whom were to be noticed
many prominent members of the clergy as well as representatives of the press and
the bar and of the other learned professions.
<a name="s12002bc" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12002bc">The proceedings then terminated.</a></p> </p>  </main>
