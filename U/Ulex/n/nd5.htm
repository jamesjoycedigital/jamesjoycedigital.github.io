<p> I was just passing the time of day with old Troy of the D.M.P. at the corner
of Arbour hill there and be damned but a bloody sweep came along and he near
drove his gear into my eye. I turned around to let him have the weight of my
tongue when who should I see dodging along Stony Batter only Joe Hynes.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Lo, Joe, says I. How are you blowing? Did you see that
bloody chimneysweep near shove my eye out with his brush?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Soot&apos;s luck, says Joe. Who&apos;s the old ballocks you were talking to?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Old Troy, says I, was in the force. I&apos;m on two minds
not to give that fellow in charge for obstructing the thoroughfare with his brooms and ladders.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What are you doing round those parts? says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Devil a much, says I. There&apos;s a bloody big foxy thief
beyond by the garrison church at the corner of Chicken lane &mdash; old Troy was
just giving me a wrinkle about him &mdash; lifted any God&apos;s quantity of tea
and sugar to pay three bob a week said he had a farm in the county Down off a
hop of my thumb by the name of Moses Herzog over there near Heytesbury street.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Circumcised? says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ay, says I. A bit off the top. An old plumber named
Geraghty. I&apos;m hanging on to his taw now for the past fortnight and I can&apos;t get a penny out of him.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That the lay you&apos;re on now? says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ay, says I. How are the mighty fallen! Collector of bad and
<br><font color="green">{u21, 326}</font>
<br> doubtful debts. But that&apos;s the most notorious bloody robber you&apos;d
meet in a day&apos;s walk and the face on him all pockmarks would hold a shower
of rain. <i>Tell him</i>, says he, <i>I dare him</i>, says he, <i>and I
doubledare him to send you round here again, or if he does</i>, says he,
<i>I&apos;ll have him summonsed up before the court, so I will, for trading</i>
<br><font color="green">{u22, 281}</font>
<br> <i>without a licence</i>. And he after stuffing himself till he&apos;s fit
to burst! Jesus I had to laugh at the little jewy getting his shirt out. <i>He
drink me my teas. He eat me my sugars. Why he no pay me my moneys?</i></p>
<p> For nonperishable goods bought of Moses Herzog, of 13 Saint Kevin&apos;s
parade in the city of Dublin, Wood quay ward, merchant, hereinafter called the
vendor, and sold and delivered to Michael E. Geraghty, esquire, of 29 Arbour
hill in the city of Dublin, Arran quay ward, gentleman, hereinafter called the
purchaser, videlicet, five pounds avoirdupois of first choice tea at three
shillings per pound avoirdupois and three stone avoirdupois of sugar, crushed
crystal, at threepence per pound avoirdupois, the said purchaser debtor to the
said vendor of one pound five shillings and sixpence sterling for value received
which amount shall be paid by said purchaser to said vendor in weekly
instalments every seven calendar days of three shillings and no pence sterling:
and the said nonperishable goods shall not be pawned or pledged or sold or
otherwise alienated by the said purchaser but shall be and remain and be held to
be the sole and exclusive property of the said vendor to be disposed of at his
good will and pleasure until the said amount shall have been duly paid by the
said purchaser to the said vendor in the manner herein set forth as this day
hereby agreed between the said vendor, his heirs, successors, trustees and
assigns, of the one part and the said purchaser, his heirs, successors, trustees and assigns of the other part.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Are you a strict t.t.? says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Not taking anything between drinks, says I.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What about paying our respects to our friend? says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who? says I. Sure, he&apos;s out in John of God&apos;s off his head, poor man.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Drinking his own stuff? says Joe.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 327}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ay, says I. Whisky and water on the brain.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Come around to Barney Kiernan&apos;s, says Joe. I want to see the citizen.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Barney mavourneen&apos;s be it, says I. Anything strange or wonderful, Joe?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Not a word, says Joe. I was up at that meeting in the City Arms.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What was that, Joe? says I.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Cattle traders, says Joe, about the foot and mouth
disease. I want to give the citizen the hard word about it.</p>
<p> So we went around by the Linenhall barracks and the back of the courthouse
talking of one thing or another. Decent fellow Joe when he has it but sure like
that he never has it. Jesus, I couldn&apos;t get over that bloody foxy

<p> In Inisfail the fair there lies a land, the land of holy Michan. There rises
a watchtower beheld of men afar. There sleep the mighty dead as in life they
slept, warriors and princes of high renown. A pleasant land it is in sooth of
murmuring waters, fishful streams where sport the gurnard, the plaice, the
halibut, the flounder the pollock and other denizens of the acqueous kingdom too
numerous to be enumerated. In the mild breezes of the west and of the east the
lofty trees wave in different directions their firstclass foliage, the sycamore,
the Lebanonian cedar, the exalted planetree, the eucalyptus and other ornaments
of the arboreal world with which that region is thoroughly well supplied. Lovely
maidens sit in close proximity to the roots of the lovely trees singing the most
lovely songs while they play with all kinds of lovely objects as for example
golden ingots, silvery fishes,

<p> So we turned into Barney Kiernan&apos;s and there sure enough was the
citizen as large as life up in the corner having a great confab with himself and that
<br><font color="green">{u21, 329}</font>
<br> bloody mangy mongrel, Garryowen, and he waiting for what the sky would drop in the way of drink.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There he is, says I, in his
<font color="red"><sup><small>(5</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">glory
hole</span></span>
<font color="black">gloryhole</font><font color="red"><sup><small>5)</small></sup></font>,
with his load of papers, working for the cause.</p>
<p> The bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps. Be a
corporal work of mercy if someone would take the life of that bloody dog.
I&apos;m told for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off a constabulary
man in Santry that came round one time with a blue paper about a licence.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Stand and deliver, says he.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That&apos;s all right, citizen, says Joe. Friends here.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Pass, friends, says he.</p>
<p> Then he rubs his hand in his eye and says he:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What&apos;s your opinion of the times?</p>
<p> Doing the rapparee. But, begob, Joe was equal to the occasion.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I think the markets are on a rise, says he, sliding his hand down his fork.</p>
<p> So begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Foreign wars is the cause of it.</p>
<p> And says Joe, sticking his thumb in his pocket:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It&apos;s the Russians wish to tyrannise.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Arrah, give over your bloody codding, Joe, says I,
I&apos;ve a thirst on me I wouldn&apos;t sell for half a crown.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Give it a name, citizen, says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Wine of the country, says he.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What&apos;s yours? says Joe.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 284}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ditto MacAnaspey, says I.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Three pints, Terry, says Joe. And how&apos;s the old heart, citizen? says he.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Never better, <i>a chara</i>, says he. What Garry? Are we going to win? Eh?</p>
<p> And with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck and, by Jesus, he near throttled him.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 330}</font> </p>
<p> The figure seated on a large boulder was that of a broadshouldered,
deepchested, stronglimbed, frankeyed, redhaired, freely freckled, shaggybearded,
widemouthed, largenosed, longheaded, deepvoiced, barekneed, brawnyhanded,
hairylegged, ruddyfaced, sinewyarmed hero. From shoulder to shoulder he measured
several ells and his rocklike knees were covered, as was likewise the rest of
his body wherever visible, with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair in hue and
toughness similar to the mountain gorse (<i>Ulex Europeus</i>). The widewinged
nostrils, from which bristles of the same tawny hue projected, were of such
capaciousness that within their cavernous obscurity the fieldlark might easily
have lodged her nest. The eyes in which a tear and a smile strove ever for the
mastery were of the dimension of a goodsized cauliflower. A powerful current of
warm breath issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his mouth
while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations of his
formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground and the lofty walls of the cave to vibrate and tremble.</p>
<p> He wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to the
knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a girdle of plaited
straw and rushes. Beneath this he wore trews of deerskin, roughly stitched with
gut. His nether extremities were encased in high buskins dyed in lichen purple,
the feet being shod with brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of
the same beast. From his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled at every
movement of his portentous frame and on these were graven with rude yet striking
art the tribal images of many heroes of antiquity, Cuchulin, Conn of hundred
battles, Niall of nine hostages, Brian of Kincora, the ardri Malachi, Art Mac
Murragh, Shane O&apos;Neill, Father John Murphy, Owen Roe, Patrick Sarsfield,
Red Hugh O&apos;Donnell, Don Philip O&apos;Sullivan Beare. A spear of acuminated
granite rested by him while at his feet reposed a savage animal of the canine
tribe whose stertorous gasps announced that he was sunk in uneasy slumber, a
supposition confirmed by hoarse growls and spasmodic movements which his master
repressed from time to time by tranquilising blows of a mighty cudgel rudely fashioned out of paleolithic stone.</p>
<p> So anyhow Terry brought the three pints Joe was standing and begob the sight
nearly left my eyes when I saw him land out a quid. O, as true as I&apos;m telling you. A goodlooking sovereign.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And there&apos;s more where that came from, says he.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Were you robbing the poorbox, Joe? says I.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Sweat of my brow, says Joe. &apos;Twas the prudent member gave me the wheeze.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I saw him before I met you, says I, sloping around by Pill
lane with his cod&apos;s eye counting up all the guts of the fish.</p>
<p> Who comes through Michan&apos;s land, bedight in sable armour?
<br><font color="green">{u21, 332}</font>
<br> O&apos;Bloom, the son of Rory: it is he. Impervious to fear is Rory&apos;s son: he of the prudent soul.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; For the old woman of Prince&apos;s street, says the
citizen, the subsidised organ. The pledgebound party on the floor of the house.
And look at this blasted rag, says he.
<font color="red"><sup><small>(5</small></sup></font><font color="black">&uArr;</font><font color="red"><sup><small>5)</small></sup></font>
Look at this, says he. <i>The Irish Independent</i>, if you please, founded by
Parnell to be the workingman&apos;s friend. Listen to the births and deaths in
the <i>Irish all for Ireland Independent</i> and I&apos;ll thank you, and the marriages.</p>
<p> And he starts reading them out:
<br><font color="green">{u22, 286}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Gordon, Barnfield crescent, Exeter; Redmayne of Iffley,
Saint Anne&apos;s on Sea, the wife of William T. Redmayne, of a son. How&apos;s
that, eh? Wright and Flint, Vincent and Gillett to Rotha Marion daughter of Rosa
and the late George Alfred Gillett, 179 Clapham road, Stockwell, Playwood and
Ridsdale at Saint Jude&apos;s Kensington by the very reverend Dr Forrest, dean
of Worcester, eh? Deaths. Bristow, at Whitehall lane, London: Carr, Stoke
Newington of gastritis and heart disease: Cockburn, at the Moat house, Chepstow&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I know that fellow, says Joe, from bitter experience.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Cockburn. Dimsey, wife of David Dimsey, late of the
admiralty: Miller, Tottenham, aged eightyfive: Welsh, June 12, at 35 Canning
street, Liverpool, Isabella Helen. How&apos;s that for a national press, eh?
How&apos;s that for Martin Murphy, the Bantry jobber?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ah, well, says Joe, handing round the boose. Thanks be to
God they had the start of us. Drink that, citizen.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I will, says he, honourable person.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Health, Joe, says I.
<font color="red"><sup><small>(5</small></sup></font><font color="black"><a name="un4017bb" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4017bb">And
all down the form.</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>5)</small></sup></font></p>
<p> Ah! Ow! Don&apos;t be talking! I was blue mouldy for the want of that pint.
Declare to God I could hear it hit the pit of my stomach with a click.</p>
<p> And lo, as they quaffed their cup of joy, a godlike messenger came running
in, radiant as the eye of heaven, a comely youth and behind him there passed an
elder of noble gait and countenance, bearing the sacred scrolls of law and with
him his lady wife, a dame of peerless lineage, fairest of her race.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 333}</font> </p>
<p> Little Alf Bergan popped in round the door and hid behind Barney&apos;s
snug, squeezed up with the laughing, and who was sitting up there in the corner
that I hadn&apos;t seen snoring drunk, blind to the world, only Bob Doran. I
didn&apos;t know what was up and Alf kept making signs out of the door. And
begob what was it only that bloody old pantaloon Denis Breen in his bath
slippers, with two bloody big books tucked under his oxter and the wife hotfoot
after him, unfortunate wretched woman trotting like a poodle. I thought Alf would split.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Look at him, says he. Breen. He&apos;s traipsing all round
Dublin with a postcard someone sent him with U. p: up on it to take a li&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> And he doubled up.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Take a what? says I.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Libel action, says he, for ten thousand pounds.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O hell! says I.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 287}</font> </p>
<p> The bloody mongrel began to growl seeing something was up but the citizen
gave him a kick in the ribs. Begob, he wakened Bob Doran anyhow.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>Bi i dho husht</i>, says he.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who? says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Breen, says Alf. He was in John Henry Menton&apos;s and
then he went round to Colles and Ward&apos;s and then Tom Rochford met him and
sent him round to the subsheriff&apos;s for a lark. O God, I&apos;ve a pain
laughing. U. p: up. The long fellow gave him an eye as good as a process and now
the bloody old lunatic is gone round to Green street to look for a G man.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; When is that long John going to hang that fellow in Mountjoy? says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Bergan, says Bob Doran, waking up. Is that Alf
Bergan<font color="red"><sup><small>(5</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span><font color="black">?</font><font color="red"><sup><small>5)</small></sup></font></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, says Alf. Hanging? Wait till I show you. Here, Terry,
give us a pony of stout. That bloody old fool! Ten thousand pounds. You should
have seen long John&apos;s eye. U. p&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> And he started laughing.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who are you laughing at? says Bob Doran. Is that Bergan?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Hurry up, Terry boy, says Alf, with the stout.</p>
<p> Terence O&apos;Ryan heard him and straightway brought him a crystal cup
<br><font color="green">{u21, 334}</font>
<br> full of the foaming ebon ale which the noble twin brothers Bungiveagh and
Bungardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats, cunning as the sons of deathless
Leda. For they garner the succulent berries of the hop and mass and sift and
bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour juices and bring the must to
the sacred fire and cease not night or day from their toil, those cunning brothers, lords of the vat.</p>
<p> Then did you, Terence, hand forth, as to the manner born, that nectarous
beverage and you offered the crystal cup to him that thirsted, in beauty akin to the immortals.</p>
<p> But he, the young chief of the O&apos;Bergan&apos;s, could ill brook to be
outdone in generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious gesture a testoon of
costliest bronze. Thereon embossed in excellent smithwork was seen the image of
a queen of regal port,

<p class="di">&mdash; What&apos;s that? says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Here you are, says Alf, chucking out the rhino. Talking
about hanging, I&apos;ll show you something you never saw. Hangmen&apos;s letters. Look at here.</p>
<p> So he took a bundle of wisps of letters and envelopes out of his pocket.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Are you codding? says I.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Honest injun, says Alf. Read them.</p>
<p> So Joe took up the letters.</p>

<p class="di">&mdash; I don&apos;t know, says Alf. I saw him just now in Capel
street with Paddy Dignam. Only I was running after that&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You what? says Joe, throwing down the letters. With who?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; With Dignam, says Alf.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Is it Paddy? says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, says Alf. Why?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Don&apos;t you know he&apos;s dead? says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Paddy Dignam dead? says Alf.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ay, says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Sure I&apos;m after seeing him not five minutes ago, says Alf, as plain as a pikestaff.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who&apos;s dead? says Bob Doran.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You saw his ghost then, says Joe, God between us and harm.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What? says Alf. Good Christ, only five&nbsp;&hellip;
What?&nbsp;&hellip; and Willie Murray with him, the two of them there near what
do you call him&apos;s&nbsp;&hellip; What? Dignam dead?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What about Dignam? says Bob Doran. Who&apos;s talking about&nbsp;&hellip;?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Dead! says Alf. He&apos;s no more dead than you are.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Maybe so, says Joe. They took the liberty of burying him this morning anyhow.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Paddy? says Alf.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ay, says Joe. He paid the debt of nature, God be merciful to him.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Good Christ! says Alf.</p>
<p> Begod he was what you might call flabbergasted.

he stated that he was now on the path of pralaya or return but was still
submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty entities on the lower
astral levels. In reply to a question as to his first sensations beyond he
stated that previously he had seen as in a glass darkly but that those who had
passed over had summit possibilities of atmic development opened up to them.
Interrogated as to whether life there resembled our experience in the flesh he
stated that he had heard from more favoured beings that their abodes were
equipped with every modern comfort and that the highest adepts were steeped in
waves of volupcy of the very purest nature. Having requested a quart of
buttermilk this was brought and evidently afforded relief. Asked if he had any
message for the living he exhorted all who were still at the wrong side of Maya
to acknowledge the true path for it was reported in devanic circles that Mars
and Jupiter were out for mischief on the eastern angle where the ram has power.
It was then queried whether there were any special desires on the part of the
defunct and the reply was: <i>Mind C.&nbsp;K. doesn&apos;t pile it on.</i> It
was ascertained that the reference was to Mr Cornelius Kelleher, manager of
Messrs H.&nbsp;J. O&apos;Neill&apos;s popular funeral establishment, a personal
friend of the defunct who had been responsible for the carrying out of the
interment arrangements. Before departing he requested that it should be told to
his dear son Patsy that the other boot which he had been looking for was at
present under the commode in the return room and that the pair should be sent to
Cullen&apos;s to be soled only as the heels were still good. He stated that this
had greatly perturbed his peace of mind in the other region and earnestly
requested that his desire should be made known.</p>

Assurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was intimated that this had given satisfaction.</p>
<p> He is gone from mortal haunts: O&apos;Dignam, sun of our morning. Fleet was

<p> Little Alf was knocked bawways. Faith, he was.</p>

<p> And says Bob Doran, with the hat on the back of his poll, lowest blackguard
in Dublin when he&apos;s under the influence.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who said Christ is good?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I beg your parsnips, says Alf.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Is that a good Christ, says Bob Doran, to take away poor little Willie Dignam?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ah, well, says Alf, trying to pass it off. He&apos;s over all his troubles.</p>
<p> But Bob Doran shouts out of him.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He&apos;s a bloody ruffian, I say, to take away poor little Willie Dignam.</p>
<p> Terry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet, that they didn&apos;t
want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises. And Bob Doran starts

<br> round the door.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Come in, come on, he won&apos;t eat you, says the citizen.</p>
<p> So Bloom slopes in with his cod&apos;s eye on the dog and he asks Terry was Martin Cunningham there.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O, Christ Mackeon, says Joe, reading one of the letters. Listen to this, will you?
<br><font color="green">{u22, 291}</font> </p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too, says the citizen.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And the dirty scrawl of the wretch, says Joe. Here, says
he, take them to hell out of my sight, Alf. Hello, Bloom, says he, what will you have?</p>
<p> They started arguing about the point, Bloom saying he wouldn&apos;t and he
couldn&apos;t and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well
he&apos;d just take a cigar. Gob, he&apos;s a prudent member and no mistake.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 339}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Give us one of your prime stinkers, Terry, says Joe.</p>
<p> And Alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with a black border round it.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; They&apos;re all barbers, says he, from the black country
that would hang their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses.</p>
<p> And he was telling us they chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob each.</p>
<p> In the dark land they bide, the vengeful knights of the razor. Their deadly
coil they grasp: yea, and therein they lead to Erebus whatsoever wight hath done
a deed of blood for I will on nowise suffer it even so saith the Lord.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 292}</font> </p>
<p> So they started talking about capital punishment and of course Bloom comes
out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the business and the
old dog smelling him all the time I&apos;m told those jewies have a sort of
queer odour coming off them for dogs about I don&apos;t know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There&apos;s one thing it hasn&apos;t a deterrent effect on, says Alf.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What&apos;s that? says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The poor bugger&apos;s tool that&apos;s being hanged, says Alf.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That so? says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; God&apos;s truth, says Alf. I heard that from the head
warder that was in Kilmainham when they hanged Joe Brady, the invincible. He
told me when they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like a poker.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ruling passion strong in death, says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That can be explained by science, says Bloom. It&apos;s
only a natural phenomenon, don&apos;t you see, because on account of the&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> And then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and
this phenomenon and the other phenomenon.</p>
<p> The distinguished scientist Herr Professor Luitpold Blumenduft tendered
medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the cervical
vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would, according to the best approved tradition of medical science,
<br><font color="green">{u21, 340}</font>
<br> be calculated to produce in the human subject a violent ganglionic stimulus
of the nerve centres
<font color="red"><sup><small>(5</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">of
the genital apparatus, thereby causing the elastic</span></span>
<font color="black">of

pores of the <i>corpora cavernosa</i> to rapidly dilate in such a way as to
facilitate the flow of blood to that part of the human anatomy known as the
penis or male organ resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by
the faculty a morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenetive erection <i>in
articulo mortis per diminutionem capitis</i>.</p>
<p> So of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and he
starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and who fears to speak of
ninetyeight and Joe with him about all the fellows that were hanged for the
cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new Ireland and new this that and the
other. Talking about new Ireland he ought to go and get a new dog so he ought.
Mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all round the place and scratching
his scabs and round he goes to Bob Doran that was standing Alf a half one
sucking up for what he could get. So of course Bob Doran starts doing the bloody fool with his:
<br><font color="green">{u22, 293}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Give us the paw! Give the paw, doggy! Good old doggy! Give the paw here! Give us the paw!</p>
<p> Arrah, bloody end to the paw he&apos;d give and Alf trying to keep him from
tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking all
kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and intelligent
dog: give you the bloody pip. Then he starts scraping a few bits of old biscuit
out of the bottom of a Jacobs&apos; tin he told Terry to bring. Gob, he golloped
it down like old boots and his tongue hanging out for more. Near ate the tin and all, hungry bloody mongrel.</p>
<p> And the citizen and Bloom having an argument about the point, Robert Emmet
and die for your country, the Tommy Moore touch about Sarah Curran and
she&apos;s far from the land. And Bloom, of course, with his knock me down cigar
putting on swank with his lardy face. Phenomenon! The fat heap he married is a
nice old phenomenon <font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black">with

<p class="di">&mdash; The memory of the dead, says the citizen taking up his pintglass and glaring at Bloom.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ay, ay, says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You don&apos;t grasp my point, says Bloom. What I mean is&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>Sinn Fein!</i> says the citizen. <i>Sinn fein
amhain!</i> The friends we love are by our side and the foes we hate before us.</p>
<p> The last farewell was affecting in the extreme. From the belfries far and
near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the gloomy
<br><font color="green">{u22, 294}</font>
<br> precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums punctuated
by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance. The deafening claps of thunder and
the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the ghastly scene testified that
the artillery of heaven had lent its supernatural pomp to the already gruesome
spectacle. A torrential rain poured down from the floodgates of the angry
heavens upon the bared heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the
lowest computation five hundred thousand persons. The learned prelate who
administered the last comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr

a most christian spirit in a pool of rainwater, his cassock above his hoary
head, and offered up to the throne of grace fervent prayers of supplication.
Hard by the block stood the grim figure of the executioner, his visage being
concealed in a ten gallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through
which his eyes glowered furiously. As he awaited the fatal signal he tested the
edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or decapitated
in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been provided by the admirers of
his fell but necessary office. On a handsome mahogany table near him were neatly
arranged the quartering knife, the various finely tempered disembowelling

they both laughed heartily, all the spectators, including the venerable pastor,

shamrock the excitement knew no bounds. Nay, even the stern provostmarshal,
lieutenant-colonel Tomkin-Maxwell Frenchmullen Tomlinson, who presided on the
sad occasion, he who had blown a considerable number of sepoys from the
cannonmouth without flinching, could not now restrain his natural emotion. With
his mailed gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard by those
privileged burghers who happened to be in his immediate <i>entourage</i>, to
murmur to himself in a faltering undertone:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; God blimey if she aint a clinker, that there bleeding
tart. Blimey it makes me kind of cry, straight, it does, when I sees her cause I
thinks of my old mashtub what&apos;s waiting for me down Limehouse way.</p>
<p> So then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and the
corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that can&apos;t speak their
own language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a quid and Bloom
putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he cadged off Joe and
<br><font color="green">{u22, 298}</font>
<br> talking about the Gaelic league and the antitreating league and drink, the
curse of Ireland. Antitreating is about the size of it. Gob, he&apos;d let you
pour all manner of drink down his throat till the Lord would call him before
you&apos;d ever see the froth of his pint. And one night I went in with a fellow
into one of their musical evenings, song and dance and there was a fellow with a
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black"><a name="un5018o" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5018o">Ballyhooly
blue ribbon</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font>
badge spiffing out of him in Irish and a lot of colleen bawns going about with
temperance beverages and selling medals.
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black"><a name="un4016af" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4016af">Ireland
sober is Ireland
free.</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font> And then
an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all shuffling their feet to
the tune the old cow died of. And one or two sky pilots having an eye around
that there was no goings on with the females, hitting below the belt.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 347}</font> </p>
<p> So
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black"><a name="un6011ag" href="../../FF/unbs/un6all.htm#un6011ag">howandever</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font>,
as I was saying, the old dog seeing the tin was empty starts mousing around by
Joe and me. I&apos;d train him by kindness, so I would, if he was my dog. Give
him a rousing fine kick now and again where it wouldn&apos;t blind him.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Afraid he&apos;ll bite you? says the citizen, jeering.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; No, says I. But he might take my leg for a lamppost.</p>
<p> So he calls the old dog over.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What&apos;s on you, Garryowen? says he.</p>
<p> Then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in Irish and the old
towser growling, letting on to answer, like a duet in the opera. Such growling
you never heard as they let off between them. Someone that has nothing better to
do ought to write a letter <i>pro bono publico</i> to the papers about the
muzzling order for a dog the like of that. Growling and grousing and his eye all
bloodshot and the hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws.</p>
<p> All those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the lower
animals (and their name is legion) should make a point of not missing the really
marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the famous animal Garryowen. The
exhibition, which is the result of years of training by kindness and a carefully
thought out dietary system, comprises, among other achievements, the recitation
of verse. Our phonetic experts have left no stone unturned in their efforts to
delucidate and compare the verse recited and have found it bears a striking resemblance
<br><font color="green">{u22, 299}</font>
<br> to the ranns of ancient Celtic bards. We are not speaking so much of those
delightful lovesongs with which the writer who conceals his identity under the
title of the &lsquo;little sweet branch&rsquo; has familiarised the bookloving
world but rather
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black">(as

the harsher and more personal note which is found in the satirical effusions of
the famous Raftery and of Donal MacConsidine. We subjoin a specimen which has
been rendered into English by an eminent scholar whose name for the moment we
are not at liberty to disclose though we believe that our readers will find the
topical allusion rather more than an indication. The metrical system of the
canine original, which recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules
of the Welsh englyn, is infinitely more complicated but we believe our readers
will agree that the spirit has been well caught. Perhaps it should be added that
the effect is greatly increased if the verse be spoken somewhat slowly and
indistinctly in a tone suggestive of suppressed rancour.</p>
<p class="set"><i>The curse of my curses</i>
<br> <i>Seven days every day</i>
<br> <i>And seven dry Thursdays</i>
<br> <i>On you, Barney Kiernan,</i>
<br> <i>Has no sup of water</i>
<br> <i>To cool my courage,</i>
<br> <i>And my guts red roaring</i>
<br> <i>After Lowry&apos;s lights.</i></p>
<p> So he told Terry to bring some water for the dog and, gob, you could hear
him lapping it up a mile off. And Joe asked him would he have another.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I will, says he, to show there&apos;s no ill feeling.</p>
<p> Gob, he&apos;s not as green as he&apos;s cabbagelooking. Arsing around from
one pub to another with a dog and getting fed up by the ratepayers. Entertainment for man and beast. And says Joe:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Could you make a hole in another pint?
<br><font color="green">{u22, 300}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Could a swim duck? says I.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Same again, Terry, says Joe. Are you sure you won&apos;t
have anything in the way of liquid refreshment? says he.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Thank you, no, says Bloom. As a matter of fact I just
wanted to meet Martin Cunningham, don&apos;t you see, about this insurance of
Dignam&apos;s. Martin asked me to go to the house. You see, he, Dignam,
<br><font color="green">{u21, 349}</font>
<br> I mean, didn&apos;t serve any notice of the assignment on the company at
the time and really under the act the mortgagee can&apos;t recover on the policy.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">That&apos;s
a good one, by God</span></span>
<font color="black"><a name="un4017df" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4017df">Holy
Wars</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font>, says Joe,
laughing,
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black">that&apos;s
a good one</font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font> if old
Bridgeman is landed. So the wife comes out top dog, what?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Well, that&apos;s a point, says Bloom, for the wife&apos;s admirers.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Whose admirers? says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The wife&apos;s advisers, I mean, says Bloom.</p>
<p> Then he starts all confused mucking it up about the mortgagor under the act
and for the benefit of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other
hand that Dignam owed the money and if now the wife or the widow contested the
mortgagee&apos;s right till he near gave me a pain in my head with his mortgagor
under the act. He was bloody safe he wasn&apos;t run in himself under the act
that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a friend in court. Selling bazaar
tickets or what do you call it royal Hungarian privileged lottery. O, commend me
to an israelite! Royal and privileged Hungarian robbery.</p>
<p> So Bob Doran comes lurching around asking Bloom to tell Mrs Dignam he was
sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and to tell her
that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was never a truer, a
finer than poor little Willie that&apos;s dead to tell her. Choking with bloody
foolery. And shaking Bloom&apos;s hand doing the tragic to tell her that. Shake
hands, brother. You&apos;re a rogue and I&apos;m another.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Let me, said he, so far presume upon our acquaintance
which, however slight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time, is
founded, as I hope and believe, on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to request of
you this favour. But, should I have overstepped the limits of reserve let the
sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; No, rejoined the other, I appreciate to the full the
motives which actuate your conduct and I shall discharge the office you entrust
to me consoled by the reflection that, though the errand be one of sorrow,
<br><font color="green">{u21, 350}</font>
<br> this proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness of the cup.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 301}</font>
</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Then suffer me to take your hand, said he. The goodness of
your heart, I feel sure, will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the
expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose poignancy, were I
to give vent to my feelings, would deprive me even of speech.</p>
<p> And off with him and out trying to walk straight. Boosed at five
o&apos;clock. Night he was near being lagged only Paddy Leonard knew the bobby.
Boosed up in a shebeen in Bride street after closing time
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black"><a name="un4017bt" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4017bt">fornicating</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font>
with two shawls and a bully on guard drinking porter out of teacups. And calling
himself a Frenchy for the shawls, Joseph Manuo, and talking against the catholic
religion, who wrote the new testament and the old testament and hugging and
smugging. And the two shawls killed with the laughing, picking his pockets, the
bloody fool and he spilling the porter all over the bed and the two shawls
screeching laughing at one another. <i>How is your testament? Have you got an
old testament?</i> Only Paddy was passing there, I tell you what. Then see him
of a Sunday with his little

wagging her tail up the aisle of the chapel with her patent boots on her, no

rooms to street couples. Gob, Jack made him toe the line. Told him if he
didn&apos;t patch up the pot, Jesus, he&apos;d kick the shite out of him.</p>
<p> So Terry brought the three pints.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Here, says Joe, doing the honours. Here, citizen.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>Slan leat</i>, says he.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Fortune, Joe, says I. Good health, citizen.</p>
<p> Gob, he had his mouth half way down the tumbler already. Want a small fortune to keep him in drinks.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty, Alf? says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Friend of yours, says Alf.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 351}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Nan Nan? says Joe.

<p class="di">&mdash; I won&apos;t mention any names, says Alf.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I thought so, says Joe. I saw him up at that meeting now
with William Field, M.P., the cattle traders.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Hairy Iopas, says the citizen,

<p> So Joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease and the
cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen sending them all

Perhaps only Mr Field is going. I couldn&apos;t phone. No. You&apos;re sure?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Nan Nan&apos;s going too, says Joe. The league told him to ask a
<br><font color="green">{u21, 352}</font>
<br> question tomorrow about the commissioner of police forbidding Irish games
in the park. What do you think of that, citizen? The <i>Sluagh na h-Eireann</i>.</p>
<p> Mr Cowe Conacre (Multifarnham. Nat.): Arising out of the question of my
honourable friend may I ask the right honourable gentleman whether the
government has issued orders that these animals shall be slaughtered though no
medical evidence is forthcoming as to their pathological condition?</p>
<p> Mr Allfours (Tamoshant. Con.): Honourable members are already in possession
of the evidence. The answer to the honourable member&apos;s question is in the affirmative.</p>
<p> Mr Orelli O&apos;Reilly (Montenotte. Nat.): Have similar orders been issued
<br><font color="green">{u22, 303}</font>
<br> for the slaughter of human animals who dare to play Irish games in the Phoenix park?</p>
<p> Mr Allfours: The answer is in the negative.</p>
<p> Mr Cowe Conacre: Has the right honourable gentleman&apos;s famous
Mitchelstown telegram inspired the policy of gentlemen on the Treasury bench? (O! O!)</p>
<p> Mr Allfours: I must have notice of that question.</p>
<p> Mr Staylewit (Buncombe. Ind.): Don&apos;t hesitate to shoot.</p>
<p> (Ironical opposition cheers.)</p>
<p> The speaker: Order! Order!</p>

sports revival. There he is sitting there. The man that got away James Stephens.

<p class="di">&mdash; <i>Na bacleis</i>, says the citizen, letting on to be
modest. I was as good as the next fellow anyhow.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You were, says Joe, and a bloody sight better.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Is that really a fact? says Alf.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, says Bloom. That&apos;s well known. Did you not know that?
<br><font color="green">{u21, 353}</font> </p>
<p> So off they started about Irish sports and shoneen games the like of lawn
tennis and about hurley and putting the stone and racy of the soil and building
up a nation once again. And of course Bloom had to have his say too about if a
fellow had a weak heart violent exercise was bad. I declare to

<p> A most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of the
O&apos;Kiernan&apos;s under the auspices of <i>Sluagh na h-Eireann</i>, on the
revival of ancient Gaelic sports and the importance of physical culture, as
understood in ancient Greece and ancient Rome and ancient Ireland, for the
development of the race. The venerable president of the noble order was in the
chair and the attendance was of large dimensions. After an instructive discourse

hear he&apos;s running a concert tour now up in the north.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He is, says Joe. Isn&apos;t he?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who? says Bloom. Ah, yes. That&apos;s quite true. Yes, a
kind of summer tour, you see. Just a holiday.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Mrs B. is the bright particular star, isn&apos;t she? says Joe.</p>

grew she to peerless beauty where loquat and almond scent the air. The gardens
of Alameda knew her step: the garths of olives knew and bowed. The chaste spouse
of Leopold is she: Marion of the bountiful bosoms.</p>
<p> And lo, there entered one of the clan of the O&apos;Molloy&apos;s, a comely
hero of white face yet withal somewhat ruddy, his majesty&apos;s counsel learned
in the law and with him the prince and heir of the noble line of Lambert.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Hello, Ned.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Hello, Alf.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Hello, Jack.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Hello, Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; God save you, says the citizen.</p>

Stubbs&apos;s. Playing cards, hobnobbing with flash toffs, drinking fizz and he
half smothered in writs and garnishee orders. Gob, he&apos;ll come home by
weeping cross one of these days, I&apos;m thinking.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Did you see that bloody lunatic Breen round there? says Alf. U. p: up.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, says J.J. Looking for a private detective.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ay, says Ned, and he wanted right go wrong to address the
court only Corny Kelleher got round him telling him to get the handwriting examined first.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ten thousand pounds, says Alf, laughing. God, I&apos;d
give anything to hear him before a judge and jury.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Was it you did it, Alf? says Joe. The truth, the whole
truth and nothing but the truth, so help you Jimmy Johnson.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Me? says Alf. Don&apos;t cast your nasturtiums on my character.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Whatever statement you make, says Joe, will be taken down in evidence against you.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Of course an action would lie, says J.J. It implies that
he is not <i>compos mentis</i>. U. p: up.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>Compos</i> what? says Alf, laughing. Do you know that
he&apos;s balmy? Look at his head. Do you know that some mornings he has to get his hat on with a shoehorn.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, says J.J., but the truth of a libel is no defence to
an indictment for publishing it in the eye of the law.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ha ha, Alf, says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Still, says Bloom, on account of the poor woman, I mean his wife.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 358}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Pity about her, says the citizen. Or any other woman marries a half and half.</p>

breastplates bidding defiance to the world.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And moreover, says J.J., a postcard is publication. It was
held to be sufficient evidence of malice in the testcase Sadgrove v. Hole. In my opinion an action might lie.</p>
<p> Six and eightpence, please. Who wants your opinion? Let us drink our pints
in peace. Gob, we won&apos;t be let even do that much.</p>

clap him in the dock the other day for suing poor little Gumly that&apos;s
minding stones for the corporation there near Butt bridge.</p>
<p> And he starts taking off the old recorder letting on to cry:</p>

<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, your worship. And my wife has the typhoid.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And the wife with typhoid fever! Scandalous! Leave the

tribe of Conn and of the tribe of Oscar and of the tribe of Fergus and of the

tribe of Kevin and of the tribe of Caolte and of the tribe of Ossian, there
being in all twelve good men and true. And he conjured them by Him who died on
rood that they should well and truly try and true deliverance make in the issue
joined between their sovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the bar and
true verdict give according to the evidence so help them God and kiss the book.
And they rose in their seats, those twelve of Iar, and they swore by the name of Him Who is

<br> from everlasting that they would do His rightwiseness. And straightway the
minions of the law led forth from their donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of
justice had apprehended in consequence of information received. And they
shackled him hand and foot and would take of him ne bail ne mainprise but
preferred a charge against him for he was a malefactor.</p>

he needn&apos;t trouble about that little matter till the first but if he would
just say a word to Mr Crawford. And so Joe swore high and holy he&apos;d do the devil and all.</p>

<p class="di">&mdash; The European family, says J.J.&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; They&apos;re not European, says the citizen. I was in
Europe with Kevin Egan of Paris. You wouldn&apos;t see a trace of them or their
language anywhere in Europe except in a <i>cabinet d&apos;aisance</i>.</p>
<p> And says John Wyse:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Full many a flower is born to blush unseen.</p>
<p> And says Lenehan, that knows a bit of the lingo:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>Conspuez les anglais! Perfide Albion!</i>
<br><font color="green">{u22, 312}</font> </p>
<p> Then lifted he in his rude great brawny strengthy hands the medher of dark
strong foamy ale and he drank to the undoing of his foes, a race of mighty
valorous heroes, rulers of the waves, who sit on thrones of alabaster silent as the deathless gods.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 363}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What&apos;s up with you, says I to Lenehan. You look like
a fellow that had lost a bob and found a tanner.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Gold cup, says he.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who won, Mr Lenehan? says Terry.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>Throwaway</i>, says he, at twenty to one. A rank outsider.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And Bass&apos;s mare? says Terry.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Still running, says he. We&apos;re all in a cart. Boylan
plunged two quid on my tip <i>Sceptre</i> for himself and a lady friend.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I had half a crown myself, says Terry, on <i>Zinfandel</i>
that Mr Flynn gave me. Lord Howard de Walden&apos;s.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Twenty to one, says Lenehan. Such is life in an outhouse.
<i>Throwaway</i>, says he. Takes the biscuit, and talking about bunions. Frailty, thy name is <i>Sceptre</i>.</p>
<p> So he went over to the biscuit tin Bob Doran left to see if there was
anything he could lift on the nod the old cur after him backing his luck with
his mangy snout up. Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Not there, my child, says he.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Keep your pecker up, says Joe. She&apos;d have won the money only for the other dog.</p>
<p> And J.J. and the citizen arguing about law and history with Bloom sticking in an odd word.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Some people, says Bloom, can see the mote in others&apos;
eyes but they can&apos;t see the beam in their own.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>Raimeis</i>, says the citizen. Where are the twenty
millions of Irish should be here today instead of four? And our potteries and
textiles, the finest in the world! And the beds of the Barrow and Shannon they
won&apos;t deepen with a million acres of marsh and bog to make us all die of consumption?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; As treeless as Portugal we&apos;ll be soon, says John
Wyse, if something is not to reafforest the land. Larches, firs, all the trees
of the conifer family are going fast. I was reading a report &nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Save them, says the citizen, save the trees of Ireland for
the future men of Ireland on the fair hills of Eire, O.</p>

<p class="di">&mdash; Hear, hear to that, says John Wyse. What will you have?</p>

<p class="di">&mdash; Half one, Terry, says John Wyse, and a hands up. Terry! Are you asleep?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, sir, says Terry. Small whisky and bottle of Allsopp. Right, sir.</p>
<p> Hanging over the bloody paper with Alf looking for spicy bits instead of
attending to the general public. Picture of a butting match, trying to crack their
<br><font color="green">{u22, 315}</font>
<br> bloody skulls, one chap going for the other with his head down like a bull
at a gate. And another one: <i>Black Beast Burned in Omaha</i>. <i>Ga</i>. A lot
of Deadwood Dicks in slouch hats and they firing at a Sambo strung up on a tree
with his tongue out and a bonfire under him. Gob, they ought to drown him in the
sea after and electrocute and crucify him to make sure of the job.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; But what about the fighting navy, says Ned, that keeps our foes at bay?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I&apos;ll tell you what about it, says the citizen. Hell
upon earth it is. Read the revelations that&apos;s going on in the papers about
flogging on the training ships at Portsmouth. A fellow writes that calls himself <i>Disgusted One</i>.</p>
<p> So he starts telling us about corporal punishment and about the crew of tars
and officers and rearadmirals drawn up in cocked hats and the parson with his
protestant bible to witness punishment and a young lad brought out, howling for
his ma, and they tie him down on the buttend of a gun.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A rump and dozen, says the citizen, was what that old
ruffian sir John Beresford called it but the modern God&apos;s Englishman calls it caning on the breech.</p>
<p> And says John Wyse:
<br><font color="green">{u21, 367}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; &apos;Tis a custom more honoured in the breech than in the observance.</p>
<p> Then he was telling us the master at arms comes along with a long cane and
he draws out and he flogs the bloody backside off of the poor lad till he yells meila murder.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That&apos;s your glorious British navy, says the citizen,
that bosses the earth. The fellows that never will be slaves, with the only
hereditary chamber

and their land in the hands of a dozen gamehogs and cottonball barons.
That&apos;s the great empire they boast about of drudges and whipped serfs.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; On which the sun never rises, says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And the tragedy of it is, says the citizen, they believe
it. The unfortunate Yahoos believe it.</p>
<p> They believe in rod, the scourger almighty, creator of hell upon earth, and
in Jacky Tar, the son of a gun, who was conceived of unholy boast, born of the
fighting navy, suffered under rump and dozen, was scarified, flayed and curried,
yelled like bloody hell, the third day he arose again from the bed, steered into
haven, sitteth on his beamend till further orders when he shall come to drudge for a living and be paid.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; But, says Bloom, isn&apos;t discipline the same
everywhere. I mean wouldn&apos;t it be the same here if you put force against force?
<br><font color="green">{u22, 316}</font> </p>
<p> Didn&apos;t I tell you? As true as I&apos;m drinking this porter if he was
at his last gasp he&apos;d try to downface you that dying was living.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; We&apos;ll put force against force, says the citizen. We
have our greater Ireland beyond the sea. They were driven out of house and home
in the black &apos;47. Their mudcabins

But the Sassenach tried to starve the nation at home while the land was full of
crops that the British hyenas bought and sold in Rio de Janeiro. Ay, they drove
out the peasants in hordes. Twenty thousand of them died in the coffin ships.
But those that came to the land of the free remember the land of bondage. And they will come

<p> Bloom was talking and talking with John Wyse and he quite excited with his old plumeyes rolling about.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Persecution, says he, all the history of the world is full
of it. Perpetuating national hatred among nations.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; But do you know what a nation means? says John Wyse.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, says Bloom.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What is it? says John Wyse.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A nation? says Bloom. A nation is the same people living in the same place.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; By God, then, says Ned, laughing, if that&apos;s so
I&apos;m a nation for I&apos;m living in the same place for the past five years.</p>
<p> So of course everyone had a laugh at Bloom and says he, trying to muck out of it:</p>

<p> That&apos;s an almanac picture for you. Old lardyface standing up to the

twisting around all the opposite, as limp as a wet rag.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; But it&apos;s no use, says he. Force, hatred, history, all
that. That&apos;s not life for men and women, insult and hatred. And everybody
knows that it&apos;s the very opposite of that that is really life.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What? says Alf.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Love, says Bloom. I mean the opposite of hatred. I must go

<p class="di">&mdash; Widow woman, says Ned, I wouldn&apos;t doubt her. Wonder
did he put that bible to the same use as I would.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Same only more so, says Lenehan. And thereafter in that
fruitful land the broadleaved mango flourished exceedingly.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Is that by Griffith? says John Wyse.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; No, says the citizen. It&apos;s not signed Shanganagh. It&apos;s only initialled: P.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And a very good initial too, says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That&apos;s how it&apos;s worked, says the citizen. Trade follows the flag.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Well, says J.J., if they&apos;re any worse than those
Belgians in the Congo Free State they must be bad. Did you read that report by a man what&apos;s this his name is?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Casement, says the citizen. He&apos;s an Irishman.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, that&apos;s the man, says J.J. Raping the women and
girls and flogging the natives on the belly to squeeze all the red rubber they can out of them.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I know where he&apos;s gone, says Lenehan, cracking his fingers.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who? says I.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 321}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Bloom, says he. The courthouse is a blind. He had a few
bob on <i>Throwaway</i> and he&apos;s gone to gather in the shekels.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Is it that kaffir, says the citizen, that never backed a horse in anger in his life?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That&apos;s where he&apos;s gone, says Lenehan. I met
Bantam Lyons going to back that horse only I put him off it and he told me Bloom
gave him the tip. Bet you what you like he has a hundred shillings to five on.
He&apos;s the only man in Dublin has it. A dark horse.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He&apos;s a bloody dark horse himself, says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Mind, Joe, says I. Show us the entrance out.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There you are, says Terry.</p>
<p> So I just went round the back of the yard to pumpship and begob (hundred
shillings to five) while I was letting off my (<i>Throwaway</i> twenty to)
letting off my load gob says I to myself I knew he was uneasy in his (two pints
off Joe and one in Slattery&apos;s off) in his mind to get off the mark to (hundred shillings
<br><font color="green">{u21, 374}</font>
<br> is five quid) and when they were in the (dark horse) Pisser Burke told me
card party and letting on the child was sick (gob, must have done about a
gallon) flabbyarse of a wife speaking down the tube <i>she&apos;s better</i> or
<i>she&apos;s</i> (ow!) all a plan so he could vamoose with the pool if he won

he&apos;s like Lanty MacHale&apos;s goat that&apos;d go a piece of the road with every one.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Well, it&apos;s a fact, says John Wyse. And there&apos;s
the man now that&apos;ll tell you all about it, Martin Cunningham.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 322}</font> </p>
<p> Sure enough the castle car drove up with Martin on it and Jack Power with
him and a fellow named Crofter or Crofton pensioner out of the collector
general&apos;s an orangeman Blackburn has on the registration and he drawing his
pay or Crawford jaunting around the country at the king&apos;s expense.</p>
<p> Our travellers reached the rustic hostelry and alighted from their palfreys.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ho, varlet! cried he, who by his mien seemed the leader of the party. Saucy knave! To us!</p>
<p> So saying he knocked loudly with his swordhilt upon the open lattice.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 375}</font> </p>
<p> Mine host came forth at the summons, girding him with his tabard.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Give you good den, my masters, said he with an obsequious bow.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Bestir thyself, sirrah! cried he who had knocked. Look to
our steeds. And for ourselves give us of your best for ifaith we need it.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Lackaday, good masters, said the host, my poor house has
but a bare larder. I know not what to offer your lordships.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; How now, fellow? cried the second of the party, a man of
pleasant countenance, so
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">serve
you</span></span> <font color="black">servest
thou</font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font> the king&apos;s messengers, master Taptun?</p>
<p> An instantaneous change overspread the landlord&apos;s visage.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Cry you mercy, gentlemen, he said humbly. An you be the
king&apos;s messengers (God shield his majesty!) you shall not want for aught.
The king&apos;s friends (God bless his majesty!) shall not go afasting in my house I warrant me.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Then about! cried the traveller who had not spoken, a
lusty trencherman by his aspect. Hast aught to give us?</p>
<p> Mine host bowed again as he made answer:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What say you, good masters, to a cold pigeon pasty, a
boar&apos;s head with pistachios and a flagon of old Rhenish?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Gadzooks! cried the last speaker. That likes me well. Pistachios!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Aha! cried he of the pleasant countenance. A poor
house<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font>
and a bare larder, quotha! &apos;Tis a merry rogue.</p>
<p> So in comes Martin asking where was Bloom.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Where is he? says Lenehan. Defrauding widows and orphans.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Isn&apos;t that a fact, says John Wyse, what I was telling
the citizen about Bloom and the Sinn Fein?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That&apos;s so, says Martin. Or so they allege.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who made those allegations? says Alf.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 323}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I, says Joe. I&apos;m the alligator.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And after all, says John Wyse, why can&apos;t a jew love his country like the next fellow?
<br><font color="green">{u21, 376}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Why not? says J.J., when he&apos;s quite sure which country it is.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Is he a jew or a gentile or what the hell is he? says Ned.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He&apos;s a perverted jew, says Martin, from a place in
Hungary and it was he drew up all the plans according to the Hungarian system. We know that in the castle.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Isn&apos;t he a cousin of Bloom the dentist? says Jack Power.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Not at all, says Martin. His name was Virag, the
father&apos;s name that poisoned himself. He changed it by deedpoll, the father did.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That&apos;s the new Messiah for Ireland! says the citizen. Island of saints and sages!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Well, they&apos;re still waiting for their redeemer, says Martin. For that matter so are we.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, says J.J., and every male that&apos;s born they think
it may be their Messiah. And every jew is in a tall state of excitement, I
believe, till he knows if he&apos;s a father or a mother.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Expecting every moment will be his next, says Lenehan.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O, by God, says Ned, you should have seen Bloom before
that son of his that died was born. I met him one day in the south city markets
buying a tin of Neave&apos;s food six weeks before the wife was delivered.</p>

Augustine, Brigittines, Premonstratesians, Servi, Trinitarians, and the children

<br> healing the halt and the blind, discovering various articles which had been

And last, beneath a canopy of cloth of gold came the reverend Father
O&apos;Flynn attended by Malachi and Patrick. And when all had reached the
appointed place the celebrant blessed the house and censed and sprinkled the
lintels thereof with blessed water and prayed that God would bless that house as
he had blessed the house of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and make the angels of

<p> The catastrophe was terrific and instantaneous in its effect. The
observatory of Dunsink registered in all eleven shocks and there is no record
extant of a similar seismic disturbance in our island since the earthquake of
1534, the year of the rebellion of Silken Thomas. The epicentre appears to have
been that part of the metropolis which constitutes the Inn&apos;s Quay

acres, two roods and one square pole or
perch</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font>. All the
lordly residences in the vicinity of the palace of justice were demolished and
that noble edifice itself, in which at the time of the catastrophe, important
legal debates were in progress, is literally a mass of ruins beneath which it is
to be feared all the occupants have been buried alive. From the reports of
eyewitnesses it transpires that the seismic waves were accompanied by a violent
atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic character. An article of headgear since
ascertained to belong to the much respected clerk of the crown and peace Mr
George Fottrell and a silk umbrella with gold handle with the engraved initials,
crest, coat of arms and house number of the erudite and worshipful chairman of
quarter sessions sir Frederick Falkiner, recorder of Dublin, have been
discovered by search parties in remote parts of the island respectively, the
former on the third basaltic ridge of the giant&apos;s causeway, the latter
embedded to the extent of one foot three inches in the sandy beach of Holeopen
bay near the old head of Kinsale. Other eyewitnesses depose that they observed
an incandescent object of enormous proportions hurtling through the atmosphere
at a terrifying velocity in a trajectory directed southwest by west. Messages of
condolence and sympathy are being hourly received from all parts of the
different continents and the sovereign pontiff has been graciously pleased to
decree that a special <i>missa pro defunctis</i> shall be celebrated simultaneously by the ordinaries

the side of his poll he&apos;d remember the gold cup, so he would, but begob the

there came about them all a great brightness and they beheld the chariot wherein
he stood ascend to heaven. And they beheld him in the chariot, clothed upon in
the glory of the brightness, having raiment as of the sun, fair as the moon and
terrible that for awe they durst not look upon him. And there came a voice out
of heaven, calling: <i>Elijah! Elijah!</i> And he answered with a main cry:
<i>Abba! Adonai!</i> And they beheld him even him, ben Bloom Elijah, amid clouds
of angels ascend to the glory of the brightness at an angle of fortyfive degrees
