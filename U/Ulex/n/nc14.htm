<p> I was just passing the time of day with old Troy of the D.M.P. at the corner
of Arbour hill there and be damned but a bloody sweep came along and he near
drove his gear into my eye. I turned around to let him have
<a name="s12003aa" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12003aa">the weight of my
tongue</a> when who should I see dodging along Stony<a target="foot" id="fnn0001">&ordm;</a> Batter only Joe Hynes.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Lo, Joe, says I. How are you blowing? Did you see that
bloody chimneysweep near shove my eye out with his brush?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Soot&apos;s luck, says Joe. Who&apos;s the old ballocks
you were talking<a target="foot" id="fnn0002">&ordm;</a> to?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Old Troy, says I, was
<a name="s12002bt" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12002bt">in the force</a>.
I&apos;m on two minds not to give that fellow in charge for obstructing the
thoroughfare with his brooms and ladders.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What are you doing round those parts? says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Devil a much, says I.
There&apos;s<a target="foot" id="fnn0003">&ordm;</a> a bloody big foxy thief
beyond by the garrison church at the corner of Chicken
lane<a target="foot" id="fnn0004">&ordm;</a> &mdash; old Troy was just giving me
a wrinkle about him &mdash; lifted any God&apos;s quantity of tea and sugar to
pay three bob a week said he had a farm in the county Down off a hop of my
thumb<a target="foot" id="fnn0005">&ordm;</a> by the name of Moses Herzog over there near Heytesbury street.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Circumcised?<a target="foot" id="fnn0006">&ordm;</a> says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ay, says I. A bit off the top. An old plumber named
Geraghty. I&apos;m hanging on to his taw now for the past fortnight and I can&apos;t get a penny out of him.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That the lay you&apos;re on now? says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ay, says I. How are the mighty fallen! Collector of
<a name="jn1039q" href="../../FF/unbs/jn1all.htm#jn1039q">bad and  doubtful
debts</a>. But that&apos;s the most notorious bloody robber you&apos;d meet in a
day&apos;s walk and the face on him all pockmarks would hold a shower of rain.
<i>Tell him</i>,<a target="foot" id="fnn0007">&ordm;</a> says he, <i>I dare
him</i>,<a target="foot" id="fnn0008">&ordm;</a> says
he,<a target="foot" id="fnn0009">&ordm;</a> <i>and I doubledare him to send you
round here again</i> <i>or if he
does</i>,<a target="foot" id="fnn0010">&ordm;</a> says he, <i>I&apos;ll have him
summonsed up before the court, so I will, for trading</i>
<br><font color="green">{u22, 281}</font>
<br> <i>without a licence</i>. And he after stuffing himself till he&apos;s fit
to burst!<a target="foot" id="fnn0011">&ordm;</a> Jesus, I had to laugh at the
little jewy getting his shirt out. <i>He drink me my teas. He eat me my sugars. Because he no pay me my moneys?</i></p>

<p class="di">&mdash; Are you a strict t.t.? says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Not taking anything between drinks, says I.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What about paying our respects to our friend? says Joe.</p>

<p class="di">&mdash; Cattle traders, says Joe, about the foot and mouth

<a name="s12004p" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004p">the hard word</a> about it.</p>
<p> So we went around by the Linenhall barracks and the back of the courthouse
talking of one thing or another. Decent fellow Joe when he has it but sure like
that he never has it. Jesus, I couldn&apos;t get over that bloody foxy Geraghty,

<p class="di">&mdash; There he is, says I,

<p> The bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps. Be a
corporal work of mercy if someone would take the life of that bloody dog.
I&apos;m told for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off a constabulary

<p class="di">&mdash; Stand and deliver, says he.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That&apos;s all right, citizen, says Joe. Friends here.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Pass, friends, says he.</p>

<p class="di">&mdash; Three pints, Terry, says Joe. And how&apos;s the old heart, citizen? says he.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Never better, <i>a

<p> And with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck and, by Jesus, he near throttled him. </p>
<p> The figure seated on a large boulder
<a name="un7025br" href="../../FF/unbs/un7all.htm#un7025br">at the foot of a
round tower</a> was that of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed
redhaired freely freckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosed longheaded
deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged
ruddyfaced<a target="foot" id="fnn0041">&ordm;</a> sinewyarmed hero. From
shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his rocklike
<a name="un5001ai" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5001ai">mountainous</a>
knees were covered, as was likewise the rest of his body wherever visible, with
a strong growth of tawny prickly hair in hue and toughness similar to the
mountain gorse (<i>Ulex Europeus</i>). The widewinged nostrils, from which
bristles of the same tawny hue projected, were of such capaciousness that within
their cavernous obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest. The
eyes in which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the
dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower. A powerful current of warm breath issued
at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his mouth while in rhythmic
resonance the loud strong hale reverberations of his formidable heart thundered
rumblingly causing the ground, the summit of the lofty tower and the still
loftier walls of the cave to vibrate and tremble.</p>
<p> He wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to the
knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a girdle of plaited
straw and rushes. Beneath this he wore trews of deerskin, roughly stitched with
gut. His nether extremities were encased in high
<a name="un7025bp" href="../../FF/unbs/un7all.htm#un7025bp">Balbriggan</a>
buskins dyed in lichen purple, the feet being shod with

on the lower astral levels</a>. In reply to a question as to his first
sensations in the

beyond he stated that previously he had seen as in a glass darkly but that those
who had passed over had summit possibilities of atmic development opened up to
them. Interrogated as to whether life there resembled our experience in the
flesh he stated that he had heard from more favoured beings
<a name="un4045al" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4045al">now in the
spirit</a> that their abodes were equipped with every modern home comfort such
as

w&#257;t&#257;kl&#257;s&#257;t</a> and that the highest adepts were steeped in
waves of volupcy of the very purest nature. Having requested a quart of
buttermilk this was brought and evidently afforded relief. Asked if he had any
message for the living he exhorted all who were still at the wrong side of
M&#257;y&#257; to acknowledge the true path for it was reported in devanic
circles that <a name="s12015h" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12015h">Mars and
Jupiter were out for mischief on the eastern angle where the ram has power</a>.
It was then queried whether there were any special desires on the part of the
defunct and the reply was:

ascertained that the reference was to Mr Cornelius Kelleher, manager of Messrs
H.&nbsp;J. O&apos;Neill&apos;s popular funeral establishment, a personal friend
of the defunct, who had been responsible for the carrying out of the interment
arrangements. Before departing he requested that it should be told to his dear
son Patsy that the other boot which he had been looking for was at present under
the commode in the return room and that the pair should be sent to Cullen&apos;s
to be soled only as the heels were still good. He stated that this had greatly
perturbed his peace of mind in the other region and earnestly requested that his desire should be made known.</p>
<p> Assurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was
intimated that this had given satisfaction.</p>
<p> He is gone from mortal haunts: O&apos;Dignam, sun of our morning. Fleet was

<a name="un4017p" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4017p">physog</a> do a peep in and then slidder off again.</p>
<p> Little Alf was knocked bawways. Faith, he was.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Good Christ! says he. I could have sworn it was him.</p>
<p> And says Bob Doran, with the hat on the back of his poll, lowest blackguard
in Dublin when he&apos;s under the influence.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who said Christ is good?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I beg your parsnips, says Alf.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="s12001g" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12001g">Is that a good
Christ,</a> says Bob Doran,
<a name="s12001g" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12001g">to take away poor little Willy Dignam?</a></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ah, well, says Alf, trying to pass it off.
<a name="s12014u" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12014u">He&apos;s over all his troubles.</a></p>
<p> But Bob Doran shouts out of him.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He&apos;s a bloody ruffian, I say, to take away poor little Willy Dignam.</p>
<p> Terry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet, that they didn&apos;t
want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises. And Bob Doran starts
doing the weeps about Paddy Dignam, true as you&apos;re there.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The finest man, says he, snivelling, the finest purest character.</p>
<p> <a name="un4017r" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4017r">The tear is bloody
near your eye.</a> Talking through his bloody hat. Fitter for him to go home to

<a name="s12004cf" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004cf">without a stitch on

<p class="di">&mdash; The noblest, the truest, says he. And he&apos;s gone, poor

<p> And mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the

<p> Old Garryowen started growling again at Bloom that was skeezing  round the door.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Come in, come on, he won&apos;t eat you, says the citizen.</p>
<p> So Bloom slopes in with his cod&apos;s eye on the dog and he asks Terry was Martin Cunningham there.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O, Christ M&apos;Keown, says Joe, reading one of the letters. Listen to this, will you?
<br><font color="green">{u22, 291}</font> </p>
<p> And he starts reading out one.</p>
<p class="deep"><i>7, Hunter Street,</i></p>
<p class="deep"><i>Liverpool.</i></p>
<p class="set"><i>To the High Sheriff of Dublin,</i>
<br> <i>Dublin.</i></p>
<p> <i>Honoured sir i beg to offer my services in the abovementioned painful
case i hanged Joe Gann in Bootle jail on the 12 of Febuary 1900 and i hanged</i>&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Show us, Joe, says I.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; &hellip; <i>private Arthur Chace for fowl murder of Jessie

<p class="di">&mdash; Jesus, says I.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; &hellip; <i>Billington executed the awful murderer Toad Smith</i>&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> The citizen made a grab at the letter.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Hold hard, says Joe, <i>i have a special nack of putting
the noose once in he can&apos;t get out hoping to be favoured i remain, honoured sir, my terms is five ginnees.</i></p>
<p class="deep"><i>H. Rumbold,</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="deep"><i>Master Barber</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And a
<a name="s12002an" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12002an">barbarous</a> bloody
barbarian he is too, says the citizen.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And the dirty scrawl of the wretch, says Joe. Here, says
he, take them to hell out of my sight, Alf. Hello, Bloom, says he, what will you have?</p>
<p> So they started arguing about the point, Bloom saying he wouldn&apos;t and
he<a target="foot" id="fnn0072">&ordm;</a> couldn&apos;t and excuse him no
offence and all to that and then he said well he&apos;d just take a cigar. Gob,
he&apos;s a prudent member and no mistake. </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Give us one of your prime stinkers, Terry, says Joe.</p>
<p> And Alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with a black border round it.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; They&apos;re<a target="foot" id="fnn0073">&ordm;</a> all
barbers, says he, from the black country that would hang their own fathers for
five quid down and travelling expenses.</p>
<p> And he was telling us
<a name="un4017ag" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4017ag">there&apos;s two
fellows waiting below to pull his heels down when he gets the drop</a> and choke
him properly and then they chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull.</p>
<p> In the dark land they bide, the vengeful
<a name="un5015b" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5015b">knights of the
razor</a>. Their deadly coil they grasp: yea, and therein they lead to Erebus
whatsoever wight hath done a deed of blood for I will on nowise suffer it even so saith the Lord.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 292}</font> </p>
<p> So they started talking about capital punishment and of course Bloom comes
out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the business and the
old dog smelling him all the time I&apos;m told those
jewies<a target="foot" id="fnn0074">&ordm;</a> does have a sort of a queer odour
coming off them for dogs about I don&apos;t know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There&apos;s one thing it hasn&apos;t a deterrent effect on, says Alf.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What&apos;s that? says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="s12014bm" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12014bm">The poor
bugger&apos;s tool that&apos;s being hanged</a>, says Alf.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That so? says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; God&apos;s truth, says Alf. I heard that from the head
warder that was in Kilmainham when they hanged Joe Brady, the invincible. He
told me when they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like a poker.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ruling passion strong in death, says Joe, as someone said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That can be explained by science, says Bloom. It&apos;s
only a natural phenomenon, don&apos;t you see, because on account of the&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> And then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and
this phenomenon and the other phenomenon.</p>
<p> The distinguished scientist Herr Professor Luitpold Blumenduft tendered
medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the cervical
vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would, according to the
best approved tradition<a target="foot" id="fnn0075">&ordm;</a> of medical
science,  be
<a name="un1032ab" href="../../FF/unbs/un1all.htm#un1032ab">calculated to</a>
inevitably produce in the human subject a violent ganglionic stimulus of the
nerve centres,<a target="foot" id="fnn0076">&ordm;</a> causing
the<a target="foot" id="fnn0077">&ordm;</a>
pores<a target="foot" id="fnn0078">&ordm;</a> of the <i>corpora cavernosa</i> to
rapidly dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood
to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ resulting in
the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a morbid upwards and
outwards philoprogenetive erection <i>in articulo mortis per diminutionem capitis</i>.</p>
<p> So of course the citizen was only waiting for the
<a name="un5018m" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5018m">wink of the word</a>
and he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the
<a name="un4045k" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4045k">old guard</a> and
<a name="un4045l" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4045l">the men of
sixtyseven</a> and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and Joe with him about all
the fellows that were hanged,
<a name="un4045cl" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4045cl">drawn and
transported</a> for the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new Ireland and new
this, that and the other. Talking about new Ireland he ought to go and get a new
dog so he ought. Mangy ravenous brute
sniffing<a target="foot" id="fnn0080">&ordm;</a> and sneezing all round the
place and <a name="un1001b" href="../../FF/unbs/un1all.htm#un1001b">scratching
his scabs</a> and round he<a target="foot" id="fnn0081">&ordm;</a> goes to Bob
Doran that was standing Alf a half one sucking up for what he could get. So of
course Bob Doran starts doing the bloody fool with his<a target="foot" id="fnn0082">&ordm;</a>:
<br><font color="green">{u22, 293}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Give us the paw! Give the paw, doggy! Good old
doggy!<a target="foot" id="fnn0083">&ordm;</a>
Give<a target="foot" id="fnn0084">&ordm;</a> the paw here! Give us the paw!</p>
<p> Arrah,<a target="foot" id="fnn0085">&ordm;</a> bloody end to the paw
he&apos;d paw and Alf trying to keep him from tumbling off the bloody stool atop
of the bloody old dog and he talking all kinds of drivel about
training<a target="foot" id="fnn0086">&ordm;</a> by kindness and thoroughbred
dog and intelligent dog: give you the bloody pip. Then he starts scraping a few
bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a
<a name="s12004l" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004l">Jacobs&apos;</a><a target="foot" id="fnn0087">&ordm;</a>
<a name="s12004l" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004l">tin</a> he told Terry
to bring. Gob, he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging out of
him a yard long for more. Near ate the tin and all, hungry bloody mongrel.</p>
<p> And the citizen and Bloom having an argument about the point,
<a name="un6011cm" href="../../FF/unbs/un6all.htm#un6011cm">the brothers
Sheares</a> and Wolfe Tone beyond on Arbour Hill and Robert Emmet and die for
your country, the Tommy Moore touch about Sara Curran and she&apos;s far from
the land. And Bloom, of course, with his knockmedown cigar putting on swank with
his lardy face. Phenomenon! The fat heap he married is a nice old phenomenon
with  a <a name="un4017n" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4017n">back on her
like a ballalley</a>. Time they were stopping up in

Burke told me there was an old one there with a cracked

<a name="s12002ap" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12002ap">playing

<a name="s12007ag" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12007ag">and not eating meat
of a Friday</a> because the old one was always thumping her craw and taking the
lout out for a walk. And one time he led him the rounds of Dublin and,

<a name="un5018k" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5018k">if the three women
didn&apos;t near roast him it&apos;s a queer story</a>, the old one,

and <i>but on the other hand</i>. And sure,

lout I&apos;m told was in Power&apos;s after, the blender&apos;s, round in Cope
street going home footless in a cab five times in the week
<a name="un6011c" href="../../FF/unbs/un6all.htm#un6011c">after drinking his way
through all the samples in the bloody establishment</a>. Phenomenon!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The memory of the dead, says the citizen taking up his pintglass and glaring at Bloom.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ay, ay, says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You don&apos;t grasp my point, says Bloom. What I mean is&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p> The last farewell was affecting in the extreme. From the belfries far and
near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the gloomy
<br><font color="green">{u22, 294}</font>
<br> precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums punctuated
by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance. The deafening claps of thunder and
the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the ghastly scene testified that
the artillery of heaven had lent its supernatural pomp to the already gruesome
spectacle. A torrential rain poured down from the floodgates of the angry
heavens upon the bared heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the
lowest computation five hundred thousand persons.

themselves in the strongest possible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless
barbarity which they had been called upon to witness. An animated altercation
(in which all took part) ensued among the F.&nbsp;O.&nbsp;T.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I. as
to whether the eighth or the ninth of March was the correct date of the birth of
Ireland&apos;s patron saint. In the course of the argument cannonballs,
scimitars, boomerangs, blunderbusses, stinkpots, meatchoppers, umbrellas,
catapults, knuckledusters, sandbags, lumps of pig iron were resorted to and
blows were freely exchanged. The baby policeman, Constable MacFadden, summoned
by special courier from Booterstown, quickly restored order and with lightning
promptitude proposed the seventeenth of the month as a solution equally
honourable for both contending parties. The readywitted ninefooter&apos;s
suggestion at once appealed to all and was unanimously accepted. Constable
MacFadden was heartily congratulated by all the
F.&nbsp;O.&nbsp;T.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;I.,<a target="foot" id="fnn0099">&ordm;</a>
several of whom were bleeding profusely. Commendatore Beninobenone having been
extricated from underneath the presidential armchair, it was explained by his
legal adviser Avvocato Pagamimi that the various articles secreted in his
thirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during the affray from the pockets
of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing them to their senses. The
objects (which included several hundred ladies&apos; and gentlemen&apos;s gold
and silver watches) were promptly restored to their rightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme.</p>
<p> Quietly, unassumingly Rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless
morning dress and wearing his favourite flower the <i>Gladiolus Cruentus</i>. He
announced his presence by that gentle Rumboldian cough which so many have tried
(unsuccessfully) to imitate &mdash; short, painstaking yet withal so
characteristic of the man. The arrival of the worldrenowned headsman was greeted
by a <a name="un7025al" href="../../FF/unbs/un7all.htm#un7025al">roar of
acclamation</a> from the huge concourse, the viceregal ladies waving their

the last comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when about

penalty</a> knelt in a most christian spirit in a pool of rainwater, his cassock
above his hoary head, and offered up to the throne of grace fervent prayers of
supplication. Hard<a target="foot" id="fnn0101">&ordm;</a> by the block stood
the grim figure of the executioner, his visage being concealed in a tengallon
pot with two circular perforated apertures through which his eyes glowered
furiously. As he awaited the fatal signal he tested the edge of his horrible
weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or decapitated in rapid succession a
flock of sheep which had been provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary
office. On a handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the

<a name="un4016cn" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4016cn">done to a
nicety,</a> delicious hot breakfast rolls and invigorating tea had been
considerately provided by the authorities for the consumption of the central
figure of the tragedy who was
<a name="un6011bn" href="../../FF/unbs/un6all.htm#un6011bn">in capital
spirits</a> when
<a name="un5015br" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5015br">prepared for
death</a> and
<a name="s12002ce" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12002ce">evinced</a> the
<a name="un6011ap" href="../../FF/unbs/un6all.htm#un6011ap">keenest interest in
the proceedings</a> from  beginning to end but he, with an abnegation rare in
<a name="un6012bl" href="../../FF/unbs/un6all.htm#un6012bl">these our times</a>,
<a name="un6011n" href="../../FF/unbs/un6all.htm#un6011n">rose nobly to the
occasion</a> and expressed the dying wish (immediately acceded to) that the meal
should be divided in aliquot parts among the members of
<a name="s12014v" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12014v">the sick and indigent
roomkeepers&apos;</a> association as a token of his regard and esteem. The
<i>nec</i> and <i>non plus ultra</i> of emotion were reached when the blushing
bride elect burst her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung
herself upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be
<a name="un5018t" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5018t">launched into
eternity</a> for her sake. The hero folded her willowy form in a loving embrace
murmuring fondly <i>Sheila, my own</i>. Encouraged by this use of her christian
name she kissed passionately all the various suitable areas of his person which
the decencies of prison garb permitted her ardour to reach. She swore to him as
they mingled the salt streams of their tears that she would
cherish<a target="foot" id="fnn0104">&ordm;</a> his memory, that she would never
<br><font color="green">{u22, 297}</font>
<br> forget her hero boy who went to his
<a name="un7025cc" href="../../FF/unbs/un7all.htm#un7025cc">death with a song on
his lips</a> as if he were but going to a hurling match in Clonturk park. She
brought back to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood together
on the banks of Anna Liffey when they had indulged in the innocent pastimes of
the young and, oblivious of the dreadful present, they both laughed heartily,
all the spectators, including the venerable pastor, joining in the general
merriment. That monster
<a name="un4017dm" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4017dm">audience simply</a>
<a name="un4016aw" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4016aw">rocked with
delight</a>. But anon they were overcome with grief and clasped their hands for
the last time. A fresh torrent of tears burst from their lachrymal ducts and the
vast concourse of people, touched to the inmost core, broke into
<a name="un4017dn" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4017dn">heartrending</a>
sobs,<a target="foot" id="fnn0105">&ordm;</a> not the least affected being the
aged prebendary himself.
<a name="un4016ck" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4016ck">Big strong men</a>,
<a name="un4016do" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4016do">officers of</a>
<a name="un5001bu" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5001bu">the peace</a> and
genial giants of the royal Irish constabulary,
<a name="un4016ck" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4016ck">were making frank
use of their handkerchiefs</a> and it is safe to say that
<a name="un6011l" href="../../FF/unbs/un6all.htm#un6011l">there was not a dry
eye in that</a>
<a name="un6011aq" href="../../FF/unbs/un6all.htm#un6011aq">record</a>
<a name="un6011l" href="../../FF/unbs/un6all.htm#un6011l">assemblage</a>. A most
romantic incident occurred when a handsome young Oxford
<a name="un5018ae" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5018ae">graduate</a>, noted
for his chivalry towards the fair sex, stepped forward and, presenting his
visiting card, bankbook and genealogical
tree,<a target="foot" id="fnn0106">&ordm;</a> solicited the hand of the hapless
young lady, requesting her
<a name="un5018ab" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5018ab">to name the day</a>,
and was accepted on the spot.
<a name="un6011be" href="../../FF/unbs/un6all.htm#un6011be">Every lady in the
audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the  occasion</a> in the
shape of a<a target="foot" id="fnn0107">&ordm;</a> skull and crossbones brooch,
a timely and generous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion: and when the
gallant young Oxonian (the bearer, by the way, of one of the most timehonoured
names in Albion&apos;s history) placed on the finger of his blushing
<i>fianc&eacute;e</i> an expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in the form
of a <a name="un4016f" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4016f">fourleaved</a>
shamrock the<a target="foot" id="fnn0108">&ordm;</a> excitement knew no bounds.
Nay, even the stern provostmarshal<a target="foot" id="fnn0109">&ordm;</a>,
lieutenantcolonel<a target="foot" id="fnn0110">&ordm;</a> Tomkin-Maxwell
ffrenchmullan Tomlinson, who presided on the sad occasion, he who had blown a
considerable number of sepoys from the cannonmouth without flinching, could not
now restrain his natural emotion. With his mailed gauntlet he brushed away a
furtive tear and was overheard<a target="foot" id="fnn0111">&ordm;</a> by those
privileged burghers who happened to be in his immediate <i>entourage</i> to
murmur to himself in a faltering undertone:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; God blimey if she aint a clinker, that there bleeding
tart. Blimey<a target="foot" id="fnn0112">&ordm;</a> it makes me kind of
bleeding cry, straight, it does, when I sees her cause I thinks of my old
mashtub what&apos;s waiting for me down Limehouse way.</p>
<p> So then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and the
<a name="s12005bh" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12005bh">corporation
meeting</a> and all to that and the shoneens that can&apos;t speak their own
language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a quid and Bloom
putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he cadged off of Joe and
<br><font color="green">{u22, 298}</font>
<br> talking about the Gaelic league and the antitreating league and drink, the
curse of Ireland. Antitreating is about the size of it. Gob, he&apos;d let you
pour all manner of drink down his throat till the Lord would call him before
you&apos;d ever see the
<a name="un1032bk" href="../../FF/unbs/un1all.htm#un1032bk">froth of his
pint</a>. And one night I went in with a fellow into one of their musical
evenings, <a name="un4015aa" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4015aa">song and
dance</a><a target="foot" id="fnn0113">&ordm;</a> about she could get up
<a name="un5015h" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5015h">on a truss of hay she
could my Maureen Lay</a> and there was a fellow with a
<a name="un5018o" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5018o">Ballyhooly blue
ribbon</a> badge spiffing out of him in Irish and a lot of colleen bawns going
about with temperance beverages and selling medals and oranges and lemonade and
a few old dry buns, gob,
<a name="un4017ak" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4017ak">flahoolagh</a>
entertainment, don&apos;t be talking.
<a name="un4016af" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4016af">Ireland sober is
Ireland free.</a> And then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and
all the <a name="un5018y" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5018y">gougers</a>
shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of. And one or two sky pilots
having an eye around that there was no goings on with the females, hitting below the belt. </p>
<p> So
<a name="un6011ag" href="../../FF/unbs/un6all.htm#un6011ag">howandever</a>, as I
was saying, the old dog seeing the tin was empty starts mousing around by Joe
and me. I&apos;d train him by kindness, so I would, if he was my dog. Give him a
rousing fine kick now and again where it wouldn&apos;t blind him.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Afraid he&apos;ll bite you? says the citizen, jeering<a target="foot" id="fnn0114">&ordm;</a>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; No, says I. But he might take my leg for a lamppost.</p>
<p> So he calls the old dog over.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="s12004cb" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004cb">What&apos;s on
you</a>, <a name="un4016df" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4016df">Garry</a>? says he.</p>
<p> Then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in Irish and the old
towser growling, letting on to answer, like a duet in the opera. Such growling
you never heard as they let off between them. Someone that has nothing better to
do ought to write a letter <i>pro bono publico</i> to the papers about the
muzzling order for a dog the like of that. Growling and grousing and his eye all
bloodshot from the
<a name="un5001ci" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5001ci">drouth</a> is in it
and the hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws.</p>
<p> All those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the lower
animals (and their name is legion) should make a point of not missing the really
marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the famous old Irish red setter
wolfdog<a target="foot" id="fnn0115">&ordm;</a> formerly known by the
<i>sobriquet</i> of Garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of
friends and acquaintances Owen Garry. The
exhibition,<a target="foot" id="fnn0116">&ordm;</a> which is the result of years
of training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system, comprises,
among other achievements, the recitation of verse. Our greatest living phonetic
expert (<a name="un6012cd" href="../../FF/unbs/un6all.htm#un6012cd">wild horses
shall not drag it from us!</a>) has left no stone unturned in his efforts to
delucidate and compare the verse recited and has found it bears a <i>striking</i> resemblance
<br><font color="green">{u22, 299}</font>
<br> (<a name="un7025ch" href="../../FF/unbs/un7all.htm#un7025ch">the italics
are ours</a>) to the ranns of ancient Celtic bards. We are not speaking so much
of those delightful lovesongs with which the writer who conceals his identity
under the graceful pseudonym of the Little Sweet
Branch<a target="foot" id="fnn0117">&ordm;</a> has familiarised the bookloving
world but rather (as
<a name="un6011bo" href="../../FF/unbs/un6all.htm#un6011bo">a contributor</a>
D.O.C. points out in an interesting communication published by
<a name="un6011bu" href="../../FF/unbs/un6all.htm#un6011bu">an evening
contemporary</a>) of the harsher and more personal note which is found in the
satirical effusions of the famous Raftery and of
Donal<a target="foot" id="fnn0118">&ordm;</a> MacConsidine to say nothing of a
more modern lyrist at present  very much in the public eye. We subjoin a
specimen which has been rendered into English by an eminent scholar whose name
for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though we believe that our
readers will find the topical allusion rather more than an indication. The
metrical system of the canine original, which recalls the intricate alliterative
and isosyllabic rules of the Welsh englyn, is infinitely more complicated but we
believe our readers will agree that the spirit has been well caught. Perhaps it
should be added that the effect is greatly increased if Owen&apos;s verse be
spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive of suppressed rancour.</p>
<p class="set"><i>The curse of my curses</i>

<p> So he told Terry to bring some water for the dog and, gob, you could hear
him lapping it up a mile off. And Joe asked him would he have another.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I will, says he,
<a name="un7025bl" href="../../FF/unbs/un7all.htm#un7025bl"><i>a
chara</i>,</a><a target="foot" id="fnn0119">&ordm;</a> to show there&apos;s no ill feeling.</p>
<p> Gob, he&apos;s not as green as he&apos;s cabbagelooking. Arsing around from
one pub to another,
<a name="un5001ce" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5001ce">leaving it to your

<a name="s12004ap" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004ap">Entertainment for man and beast.</a> And says Joe:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Could you make a hole in another pint?
<br><font color="green">{u22, 300}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Could a swim duck? says I.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Same again, Terry, says Joe. Are you sure you won&apos;t
have anything in the way of liquid refreshment? says he.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Thank you, no, says Bloom. As a matter of fact I just
wanted to meet Martin Cunningham, don&apos;t you see, about this insurance of
poor Dignam&apos;s. Martin asked me to go to the house. You see, he, Dignam,  I
mean, didn&apos;t serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time
and <a name="un7025bd" href="../../FF/unbs/un7all.htm#un7025bd">nominally</a>
under the act the mortgagee can&apos;t recover on the policy.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="un4017df" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4017df">Holy Wars</a>, says
Joe,<a target="foot" id="fnn0120">&ordm;</a> laughing, that&apos;s a good one if
old Shylock is landed. So the wife comes out top dog, what?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Well, that&apos;s a point,
<a name="s12001ai" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12001ai">says Bloom, for the wife&apos;s admirers</a>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Whose admirers? says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The wife&apos;s advisers, I mean, says Bloom.</p>
<p> Then he starts all confused mucking it up about
the<a target="foot" id="fnn0121">&ordm;</a> mortgagor under the act like
<a name="un7025e" href="../../FF/unbs/un7all.htm#un7025e">the lord
chancellor</a> giving it out on the bench and for the benefit of the wife and
that a trust is created but on the other hand that Dignam owed Bridgeman the
money and if now the wife or the widow contested the mortgagee&apos;s right till
he near <a name="un5015av" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5015av">had the head
of me addled</a> with his mortgagor under the act. He was bloody safe he
wasn&apos;t run in himself under the act that time as a
<a name="s12007m" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12007m">rogue and vagabond</a>
only he had a <a name="s12004ah" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004ah">friend

<p> So Bob Doran comes lurching around asking Bloom to tell Mrs Dignam he was
sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and to tell her
that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was never a truer, a
finer than poor little Willy that&apos;s dead to tell her. Choking with bloody
foolery. And shaking Bloom&apos;s hand doing the tragic to tell her that. Shake
hands, brother. You&apos;re a rogue and I&apos;m another.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Let me, said he, so far presume upon our acquaintance
which, however slight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time, is
founded, as I hope and believe, on a sentiment of mutual
esteem<a target="foot" id="fnn0122">&ordm;</a> as to request of you this favour.
But, should I have overstepped the limits of reserve let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; No, rejoined the other, I appreciate to the full the
motives which actuate your conduct and I shall discharge the office you entrust
to me consoled by the reflection that, though the errand be one of sorrow,  this
proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness of the cup.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 301}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Then suffer me to take your hand, said he. The goodness of
your heart, I feel sure, will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the
expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose poignancy, were I
to give vent to my feelings, would deprive me even of speech.</p>
<p> And off with him and out trying to walk straight. Boosed at five
o&apos;clock. Night he was near being lagged only Paddy Leonard knew the
bobby,<a target="foot" id="fnn0123">&ordm;</a> 14A. Blind to the world up in a
shebeen in Bride street after closing time,
<a name="un4017bt" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4017bt">fornicating</a> with
two shawls and a bully on guard, drinking porter out of teacups. And calling
himself a Frenchy for the shawls, Joseph Manuo, and talking against the
catholic<a target="foot" id="fnn0124">&ordm;</a>
religion,<a target="foot" id="fnn0125">&ordm;</a> and he serving mass in Adam
and Eve&apos;s when he was young with his eyes
shut,<a target="foot" id="fnn0126">&ordm;</a> who wrote the new testament and
the old testament<a target="foot" id="fnn0127">&ordm;</a> and hugging and
smugging. And the two shawls killed with the laughing, picking his
pockets,<a target="foot" id="fnn0128">&ordm;</a> the bloody fool and he spilling
the porter all over the bed and the two shawls screeching laughing at one
another. <i>How is your testament? Have you got an old testament?</i> Only Paddy
was passing there, I tell you what. Then see him of a Sunday with his little
<a name="un4017an" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4017an">concubine</a> of a
wife, and she wagging her tail up the aisle of the
chapel<a target="foot" id="fnn0129">&ordm;</a> with her patent boots on her, no
less, and her violets, nice as pie, doing the little lady. Jack Mooney&apos;s
sister. And the old prostitute of a mother
<a name="un4017ao" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4017ao">procuring</a> rooms
to street couples. Gob, Jack made him toe the line. Told him if he didn&apos;t
patch up the pot, Jesus, he&apos;d kick the shite out of him.</p>
<p> So Terry brought the three pints.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Here, says Joe, doing the honours. Here, citizen.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>Slan leat</i>,<a target="foot" id="fnn0130">&ordm;</a> says he.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Fortune, Joe, says I. Good health, citizen.</p>
<p> Gob, he had his mouth half way down the tumbler already. Want a small fortune to keep him in drinks.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty, Alf? says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Friend of yours, says Alf. </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Nannan<a target="foot" id="fnn0131">&ordm;</a>? says Joe.
<a name="s12002aa" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12002aa">The mimber?</a></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I won&apos;t mention any names, says Alf.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="un4051bj" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4051bj">I thought so</a>,
says Joe. I saw him up at that meeting now with William Field, M.P., the cattle traders.</p>

<p> So Joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease and the
cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen sending them all

<p> So off they started about Irish

<br> The wellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of our old tongue,
Mr Joseph M&apos;Carthy Hynes, made an eloquent appeal for the resuscitation of
the ancient Gaelic sports and pastimes, practised morning and evening by

got to business<a target="foot" id="fnn0165">&ordm;</a> leading off with a
powerful left

a fine one. The men came to handigrips.
<a name="un4017bq" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4017bq">Myler quickly became

<p> So Bloom lets on he heard nothing and he starts talking with Joe, telling
him he needn&apos;t trouble about that little matter till the first but if he
would just say a word to Mr Crawford. And so Joe swore high and holy

<p> And Bloom letting on to be awfully deeply interested in nothing, a
spider&apos;s web in the corner behind the barrel, and the citizen scowling
after him and the old dog at his feet looking up to know who to bite and when.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A dishonoured wife, says the citizen, that&apos;s what the cause of all our misfortunes.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And here she is, says Alf, that was giggling over the

<p> Gob, he near burnt his<a target="foot" id="fnn0255">&ordm;</a> fingers with the butt of his old cigar.</p>

<p class="di">&mdash; Are you talking about the new Jerusalem? says the citizen.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I&apos;m talking about injustice, says Bloom.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 319}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Right, says John Wyse. Stand up to it then with force like men.</p>
<p> That&apos;s an almanac<a target="foot" id="fnn0257">&ordm;</a> picture for

around all the opposite, as limp as a wet rag.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; But it&apos;s no use, says he. Force, hatred, history, all
that. That&apos;s not life for men and women, insult and hatred. And everybody
knows that it&apos;s the very opposite of that that is really life.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What? says Alf.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Love, says Bloom. I mean the opposite of hatred. I must go
now, says he to John Wyse. Just round to the court a moment to see if Martin is
there. If he comes just say I&apos;ll be back in a second. Just a moment.</p>

<p class="di">&mdash; That chap? says the citizen. Beggar my neighbour is his

<p> Love loves to love love. Nurse loves the new chemist. Constable

<p class="di">&mdash; Hurrah, there, says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The blessing of God and Mary and Patrick on you, says the citizen.</p>
<p> And he ups with his pint to wet his whistle.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; We know those canters, says he, preaching and picking your

<br><font color="green">{u22, 320}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What&apos;s that? says Joe.</p>
<p> So the citizen takes up one of his

<p class="di">&mdash; Well, says J.J.,<a target="foot" id="fnn0272">&ordm;</a>
if they&apos;re any worse than those Belgians in the

<p class="di">&mdash; Who? says I.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 321}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Bloom, says he.
The<a target="foot" id="fnn0274">&ordm;</a> courthouse is a blind. He had a few
bob on <i>Throwaway</i> and he&apos;s gone to gather in the shekels.</p>

<p class="di">&mdash; That&apos;s where he&apos;s gone, says Lenehan. I met
Bantam Lyons going to back that horse only I put him off it and he told me Bloom
gave him the tip. Bet you what you like he has a hundred shillings to five on.
He&apos;s the only man in Dublin has it. A dark horse.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He&apos;s a bloody dark horse himself, says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Mind, Joe, says I.
<a name="s12008r" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12008r">Show us the entrance out.</a></p>

<p> <a name="un4045s" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4045s">Goodbye Ireland
I&apos;m going to Gort.</a> So I just went

flabbyarse of a wife speaking down the tube <i>she&apos;s better</i> or

<p class="di">&mdash; Well, it&apos;s a fact, says John Wyse. And there&apos;s
the man now that&apos;ll tell you all about it, Martin Cunningham.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 322}</font> </p>
<p> Sure enough the castle car drove up with Martin on it and Jack Power with
him and a fellow named Crofter or Crofton,
<a name="un4016ce" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4016ce">pensioner</a> out of
the collector general&apos;s, an orangeman Blackburn does have on the
registration and he drawing his pay or Crawford
<a name="un4045ac" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4045ac">gallivanting</a>
around the country at the king&apos;s expense.</p>
<p> Our travellers reached the rustic hostelry and alighted from their palfreys.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ho, varlet! cried he, who by his mien seemed the leader of the party. Saucy knave! To us!</p>
<p> So saying he knocked loudly with his swordhilt upon the open lattice. </p>
<p> Mine host came forth at the summons,<a target="foot" id="fnn0282">&ordm;</a> girding him with his tabard.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Give you good den, my masters, said he with an obsequious bow.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Bestir thyself, sirrah! cried he who had knocked. Look to
our steeds. And for ourselves give us of your best for ifaith we need it.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Lackaday, good masters, said the host, my poor house has
but a bare larder. I know not what to offer your lordships.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; How now, fellow? cried the second of the party, a man of
pleasant countenance, so<a target="foot" id="fnn0283">&ordm;</a> servest thou
the king&apos;s messengers, master<a target="foot" id="fnn0284">&ordm;</a> Taptun?</p>
<p> An instantaneous change overspread the landlord&apos;s visage.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="un5015bl" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5015bl">Cry you mercy</a>,
gentlemen, he said humbly. An you be the king&apos;s messengers
(God<a target="foot" id="fnn0285">&ordm;</a> shield His Majesty!) you shall not
want for aught. The king&apos;s friends (God bless His Majesty!) shall not go afasting in my house I warrant me.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Then about! cried the traveller who had not spoken, a
lusty trencherman by his aspect. Hast aught to give us?</p>
<p> Mine host bowed again as he made answer:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What say you, good masters, to a squab pigeon pasty, some
collops of venison, a saddle of veal, widgeon with crisp hog&apos;s bacon, a
boar&apos;s head with pistachios, a bason of jolly custard, a medlar tansy and a flagon of old Rhenish?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Gadzooks! cried the last speaker. That likes me well. Pistachios!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Aha! cried he of the pleasant countenance. A poor house
and a bare larder, quotha! &apos;Tis a merry rogue.</p>
<p> So in comes Martin asking where was Bloom.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Where is he? says Lenehan. Defrauding widows and orphans.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Isn&apos;t that a fact, says John Wyse, what I was telling
the citizen about Bloom and the Sinn Fein?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That&apos;s so, says Martin. Or so they allege.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who made those allegations? says Alf.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 323}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I, says Joe. I&apos;m the alligator.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And after all, says John Wyse,
<a name="s12006ck" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12006ck">why can&apos;t a jew
love his country like the next fellow?</a> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Why not? says J.J.,
<a name="s12006ck" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12006ck">when he&apos;s quite sure which country it is</a>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Is he a jew or a gentile or a

<p class="di">&mdash; We don&apos;t want him, says Crofter the Orangeman or presbyterian.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="un4016ct" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4016ct">Who is Junius?</a>
says J.J.<a target="foot" id="fnn0286">&ordm;</a></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He&apos;s a perverted jew, says Martin, from a place in
Hungary and it was he drew up all the plans according to the Hungarian system. We know that in the castle.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Isn&apos;t he a cousin of Bloom the dentist? says Jack Power.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Not at all, says Martin. Only namesakes. His name was
Virag, the<a target="foot" id="fnn0287">&ordm;</a> father&apos;s name that
poisoned himself. He changed it by deedpoll, the father did.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That&apos;s the new Messiah for Ireland! says the citizen. Island of saints and sages!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Well, they&apos;re still waiting for their redeemer, says Martin. For that matter so are we.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, says J.J., and

trying to <a name="un4016av" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4016av">peacify him</a>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Let me alone, says he.</p>
<p> And begob he got as far as the door and they holding him and
he<a target="foot" id="fnn0313">&ordm;</a> bawls out of him:<a target="foot" id="fnn0314">&ordm;</a></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Three cheers for Israel!</p>
<p> Arrah, sit down on the parliamentary side of your arse for Christ&apos; sake
and don&apos;t be making a public exhibition of yourself. Jesus, there&apos;s
always some bloody clown or other kicking up a bloody murder about bloody
nothing. Gob, it&apos;d turn the porter sour in your guts, so it would.</p>
<p> And all the ragamuffins and sluts of the nation round the door and Martin
telling the jarvey to drive ahead and the citizen bawling and Alf and Joe at him
to whisht and he on his high horse about the jews and the loafers calling for a
speech and Jack Power trying to get him to sit down on the car and hold his
bloody jaw and a loafer with a patch over his eye starts singing <i>If the man
in the moon was a jew, jew, jew</i> and a slut shouts out of her:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Eh, mister! Your fly is open, mister!</p>
<p> And says he:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Mendelssohn was a jew and Karl Marx and
<a name="s12014bt" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12014bt">Mercadante</a> and
Spinoza. And <a name="un7025bk" href="../../FF/unbs/un7all.htm#un7025bk">the
Saviour</a> was a jew and his father was a jew. Your God.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He had no father, says Martin. That&apos;ll do now. Drive ahead.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Whose God?<a target="foot" id="fnn0315">&ordm;</a> says the citizen.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Well, his uncle was a jew, says he. Your God was a jew. Christ was a jew like me.</p>
<p> Gob, the citizen made a plunge back into the shop.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; By Jesus, says he, I&apos;ll brain that bloody jewman for
using the holy name. By Jesus, I&apos;ll crucify him so I will. Give us that biscuitbox here.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Stop! Stop!<a target="foot" id="fnn0316">&ordm;</a> says Joe.</p>
<p> A large and appreciative gathering of friends and acquaintances from the
metropolis and greater Dublin assembled in their thousands to bid farewell to

Virag, <a name="un4016bl" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4016bl">late of
Messrs Alexander Thom&apos;s, printers to His Majesty,</a> on the occasion of
his departure for  the distant clime of
Sz&aacute;zharminczbroj&uacute;guly&aacute;s-Dugul&aacute;s (Meadow of Murmuring
Waters). The ceremony which went off with great <i>&eacute;clat</i> was
characterised by the most affecting cordiality. An illuminated scroll of
<a name="un7025bt" href="../../FF/unbs/un7all.htm#un7025bt">ancient Irish
vellum</a>, the work of Irish artists, was presented to the distinguished
phenomenologist on behalf of<a target="foot" id="fnn0318">&ordm;</a> a large
section of the community and was accompanied by the gift of a silver casket,
tastefully executed in the style of ancient Celtic ornament, a work which
reflects every credit on the makers, Messrs Jacob <i>agus</i> Jacob. The
departing guest was the recipient of a hearty ovation, many of those who were
present being visibly moved when the select orchestra of Irish pipes struck up
the wellknown strains of <i>Come Back to
Erin</i>,<a target="foot" id="fnn0319">&ordm;</a> followed immediately by
<i>Rak&oacute;czsy&apos;s March</i>.
<a name="un5015c" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5015c">Tarbarrels</a> and
<a name="un6012bo" href="../../FF/unbs/un6all.htm#un6012bo">bonfires</a> were
lighted along the coastline of
<a name="un7025bn" href="../../FF/unbs/un7all.htm#un7025bn">the four seas</a> on
the summits of the Hill of Howth, Three Rock Mountain, Sugarloaf, Bray Head, the
mountains of Mourne, the Galtees, the Ox and Donegal and Sperrin peaks, the
Nagles and the Bograghs, the Connemara hills, the

representatives of the fair sex who were present in large numbers while, as it
proceeded down the river, escorted by a flotilla of barges, the flags of the
Ballast office and Custom House
<a name="un6011co" href="../../FF/unbs/un6all.htm#un6011co">were dipped in

<i>Visszontl&aacute;t&aacute;sra, kedv&eacute;s bar&aacute;tom!
Visszontl&aacute;t&aacute;sra!</i> Gone but not forgotten.</p>
<p> Gob, <a name="un5018r" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5018r">the devil
wouldn&apos;t stop him</a> till he got hold of the bloody tin anyhow and out
with him and little Alf hanging on to his elbow and he shouting like a stuck

bloody play</a><a target="foot" id="fnn0321">&ordm;</a> in the Queen&apos;s

<p class="di">&mdash; Where is he till I murder him?</p>
<p> And Ned and J.J.<a target="foot" id="fnn0323">&ordm;</a> paralysed with the laughing.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;

says I, I&apos;ll be <a name="un4017s" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4017s">in for the last gospel</a>.</p>
<p> But as luck would have it the jarvey got the nag&apos;s head round the other way and off with him. </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Hold on, citizen, says Joe. Stop!</p>
<p> Begob he <a name="un5015m" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5015m">drew his
hand</a> and made a swipe and let fly. Mercy of God the sun was in his eyes or
he&apos;d have <a name="un4016bu" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4016bu">left
him for dead</a>. Gob, he near sent it into the county Longford. The bloody nag took fright and the old mongrel after
<br><font color="green">{u22, 329}</font>
<br> the car like
<a name="un5001ah" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5001ah">bloody hell</a> and
all the populace shouting and laughing and the old
tinbox<a target="foot" id="fnn0324">&ordm;</a> clattering along the street.</p>
<p> The catastrophe was terrific and instantaneous in its effect. The
observatory of Dunsink registered in all eleven shocks, all of
<a name="un4017cp" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4017cp">the fifth grade of
Mercalli&apos;s scale</a>, and there is no record extant of a similar seismic
disturbance in our island since the earthquake of
<a name="un2002b" href="../../FF/unbs/un2all.htm#un2002b">1534</a>, the year of
the rebellion of
<a name="un2002d" href="../../FF/unbs/un2all.htm#un2002d">Silken Thomas</a>. The
epicentre appears to have been that part of the metropolis which constitutes the
Inn&apos;s Quay ward and parish of Saint Michan covering a surface of
<a name="un4017h" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4017h">fortyone acres, two
roods and one square pole or perch</a>. All the lordly
residences<a target="foot" id="fnn0325">&ordm;</a> in the vicinity of the palace
of justice were demolished and that noble edifice itself, in which at the time
of the catastrophe important legal debates were in progress, is literally a mass
of ruins beneath which it is to be feared all the occupants have been buried
alive. From the reports of eyewitnesses it transpires that the seismic waves
were accompanied by a violent atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic character. An
article of headgear since ascertained to belong to the much respected clerk of
the crown and peace Mr George Fottrell and a silk umbrella with gold handle with
the engraved initials, crest,<a target="foot" id="fnn0326">&ordm;</a> coat of
arms and house number of the erudite and worshipful chairman of quarter sessions
sir Frederick Falkiner, recorder of Dublin, have been discovered by search
parties in remote parts of the island respectively, the former on the third
basaltic ridge of the
<a name="s12006ba" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12006ba">giant&apos;s
causeway</a>, the latter embedded to the extent of one foot three inches in the
sandy beach of Holeopen bay near the old head of Kinsale. Other eyewitnesses
depose that they observed an incandescent object of enormous proportions
hurtling through the atmosphere at a terrifying velocity in a trajectory
directed southwest by west. Messages of condolence and sympathy are being hourly
received from all parts of the different continents and the sovereign pontiff
has been graciously pleased to decree that a special <i>missa pro defunctis</i>
shall be celebrated simultaneously by the ordinaries  of each and every
cathedral church of all the episcopal dioceses subject to the spiritual
authority of the Holy See in suffrage of the souls of those faithful departed
who have been so unexpectedly called away from our midst. The work of salvage,
removal of <i>d&eacute;bris</i>,<a target="foot" id="fnn0327">&ordm;</a> human
remains etc has been entrusted to Messrs Michael Meade and
Son,<a target="foot" id="fnn0328">&ordm;</a>

<p> You never saw the like of it
<a name="un3014a" href="../../FF/unbs/un3all.htm#un3014a">in all your born
puff</a>. Gob, if he got that
<a name="un5015ah" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5015ah">lottery ticket</a>
on the side of his poll he&apos;d remember the gold cup, he would so, but begob
the citizen would have been lagged for
<a name="s12004bc" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004bc">assault and
battery</a> and Joe for
<a name="s12002bv" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12002bv">aiding and
abetting</a>. The jarvey saved his life by
<a name="un4016cf" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4016cf">furious driving</a>
as sure as God made Moses. What? O, Jesus, he did. And he let a
<a name="s12007av" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12007av">volley of oaths</a> after him.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Did I kill him, says he, or what?</p>
<p> And he shouting to the bloody dog:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; After him, Garry! After him, boy!</p>
<p> And the last we saw was the bloody car rounding the corner and old
sheepsface on it gesticulating and the bloody mongrel after it with his lugs
back for all he was bloody well worth
<a name="un4016k" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4016k">to tear him limb from
limb</a>. Hundred to five! Jesus, he took the value of it out of him, I promise you.</p>
<p> When, lo, there came about them all a great brightness and they beheld the
chariot wherein
<a name="un7025bj" href="../../FF/unbs/un7all.htm#un7025bj">He</a> stood ascend
to heaven. And they beheld
<a name="un7025bj" href="../../FF/unbs/un7all.htm#un7025bj">Him</a> in the
chariot, clothed upon in the glory of the brightness, having raiment as of the
sun, fair as the moon and terrible that for awe they durst not look upon
<a name="un7025bj" href="../../FF/unbs/un7all.htm#un7025bj">Him</a>. And there
came a voice out of heaven, calling: <i>Elijah! Elijah!</i> And
<a name="un7025bj" href="../../FF/unbs/un7all.htm#un7025bj">He</a> answered with
a <a name="s12004s" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004s">main cry</a>:
