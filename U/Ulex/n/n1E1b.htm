<p class="pdi">&mdash; A distinguished gathering
<a name="s12007q" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12007q">assembled to do honour
to a ruler of Africa</a>, the
<a name="s12007n" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12007n">Alaki of Abekuta</a>.
A delegation from <a name="un2014h" href="../../FF/unbs/un2all.htm#un2014h">the
chief cotton magnates</a> of the district was presented to His Majesty by
<a name="s12007p" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12007p">Gold Stick in Waiting,
Lord Walkup of Walkup on Eggs,</a> and tendered their best thanks to His Majesty
for the facilities afforded to British traders in His Majesty&apos;s dominion.
The negro potentate <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">graciously
acknowledged</span></span>
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">replied</span></span>
<a name="un2018d" href="../../FF/unbs/un2all.htm#un2018d">in the gracious terms
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">and</span></span> speech,
translated by</a> the British chaplain from Alakamekohapth, the reverend Ananias
Praisegod Barebones, emphasised the cordial relations existing between his
people and the British empire and stated that he treasured as one of his dearest
possessions <a name="un2018e" href="../../FF/unbs/un2all.htm#un2018e">an
illuminated bible presented to him by her late Majesty, Queen Victoria</a>. Amid
general applause the Alaki then drank a loving cup to the toast of &ldquo;The
King, God bless him&rdquo; from the skull of his immediate predecessor,
Kakachakachak, surnamed Bull&apos;s Eye. The ceremony was brought to a close by
a musical setting of the versicle <u>I am black but comely</u> excellently
rendered by the royal musicians on native instruments, alligator carapaces
strung with the guts of vanquished Zulu warriors and the thighbones of early christian missionaries, the effect of these
<br><font color="green">{ms, 22}</font>
<br> latter being
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">quite</span></span> remarkably
similar to the dulcet tones of the Italian <a name="un4015dk" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4015dk">ocarina</a>.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Wonder what he did with the bible, says Ned Lambert. I could have put it to a good use.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;
<a name="s12007t" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12007t">The same only more
so</a>, says Lenehan. And thereafter in Abekuta the broadleaved palm flourished exceedingly.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 21v}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is that by Griffith? says &mdash;.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I don&apos;t know, says &mdash;,

<p class="pdi">&mdash; Bloody good initial too, says &mdash;.</a></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, Griffith&apos;s stuff is signed <u>Shanganagh</u>, says O&apos;Madden Burke</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Are you going to write that pantomime? asked &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, by God, I heard about that.
<a name="s12001aq" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12001aq">Brian Boru or Finn MacCool</a> isn&apos;t it? </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do you know it was Bloom gave Griffith
<a name="s12004p" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004p">the hard word</a>
about that Hungarian lay lay he&apos;s on.</p>

<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes and

<p class="pdi">&mdash; Leaders of the Irish people at home and abroad, says &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, isn&apos;t it sensible. If

he says, can pack a jury why can&apos;t you pack the civil service and the police and the constabulary.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And they want to send
<a name="s12014d" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12014d">Irish consuls</a> to the continent to open up direct trade</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What about the kudos? says &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, and wouldn&apos;t
<a name="s12014e" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12014e">Irish Americans put their money into it</a>.

<p> <a name="s12015b" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12015b">Then did you
speak, noble Cusack,</a> and all men heard:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; They were driven out of house and home. Their cabins were
laid low by the <a name="s12014bl" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12014bl">battering rams</a> of the Sassenach.

<br>]And<a target="foot" id="fnz0005">&ordm;</a> the <u>Times</u> rubbed its
hands and told the whitelivered English public that there would soon be as few
Irish in Ireland as redskins in India and suggested to ship off the few of us
that still lived |xpraying for death|x* to the banks of the Ganges.
<br> Twenty thousand of the poor wretches died in the coffinships and the land
full of harvest and the nation of shopkeepers, as Napoleon called them, selling
our harvest of our peasants in rio de Janeiro &amp; hoarded it up in famine time till it rotted1*
<br><font color="green">{ms, 21v}</font>
<br> They departed with tears &amp; wailing for the land of the brave and free
to make up there a greater Ireland beyond the waves. They departed: but they
will come again. And with a vengeance. The sons of
<a name="s12011k" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12011k">Granuaile</a>.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 20v}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; We&apos;re a long time waiting for that, says &mdash; One
time it was <a name="s12004ca" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004ca">the
French have landed at Killala</a>. Then the
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Amer</span></span> Yankees, now it&apos;s the Germans or the Japanese.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 20v}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The French! says &mdash;. Do you know what it is! They
were <a name="s12004bb" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004bb">never worth a
roasted fart</a> to Ireland. Now they&apos;re going to make an alliance with England.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;
<a name="s12015r" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12015r"><u>Conspuez les anglais</u></a>, says Lenehan.</p>
<p> He knows a bit of French he picked up in the
<a name="un2034d" href="../../FF/unbs/un2all.htm#un2034d">smutty</a> papers.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The Germans! says &mdash;. Haven&apos;t we had enough of
them on the throne since George the Elector, and the flatulent old bitch that&apos;s dead.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And Edward the peacemaker, says &mdash;.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;
<a name="s12004au" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004au">Tell that to a
fool</a>, says &mdash;, there&apos;s a bloody sight more pox than pax about him
if you ask me. And when he was over here last year
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">in Maynooth</span></span> what
about the priests and bishops that killed our rightful king, Charles Stewart
Parnell, sticking up pictures of all the horses his jockeys rode. They ought to
have stuck up pictures of all the married women he rode himself</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Considerations of space, says JJ O&apos;M, no doubt influenced their lordships&apos; choice.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; We want no king or crown, says

<br><font color="green">{ms, 19v}</font>
<br> <a name="s12001bv" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12001bv">The Royal Stuarts were as bad.</a></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Strangle the last king with the guts of the last priest. We want neither French nor Germans.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I tell you what it is, says &mdash;, there&apos;s a war
coming for the English and the Germans will give them a hell of a gate of going.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But aren&apos;t you after saying&nbsp;&hellip;? says &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I know what
<a name="s12014bh" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12014bh">I&apos;m after
saying</a>, says &mdash;. But this time, whether they win or lose, they&apos;ll
have to fight their match not naked Zulus to mow them down with machine guns
&amp; Ashantimen with tomahawks in their hands. Not likely! They&apos;ll be up
against an army that&apos;ll kill a man for every man they kill. Wait till you see.</p>
<p> Thus did they laud the prowess of those farfamed races, the lordly Gauls, a
noble nation descended from the gods, nimble of foot, who dwell in the land of
Oui-Oui and of their neighbours, the lordly Teutons a noble race of the seed of
the gods, feasters at the board, whose dwelling is in the land of Ja-Ja.</p> </p>  </main>
