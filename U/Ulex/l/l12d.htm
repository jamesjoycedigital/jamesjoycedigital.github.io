<p class="pStDir">The superior, the very reverend John Conmee S.J. reset his
smooth watch in his interior pocket as he came down the presbytery steps. Five
to three. Just nice time to walk to Artane. What was that boy&apos;s name again?
Dignam. Yes. <u>Vere dignum et iustum est.</u> Brother Swan was the person to
see. Mr Cunningham&apos;s letter. Yes. Oblige him, if possible. Good practical catholic: useful at mission time.</p>
<p> A onelegged sailor, swinging himself onward by lazy jerks of his crutches,
growled some notes. He

short before the convent of the sisters of charity and held out a peaked cap for
alms<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span> towards the
very reverend John Conmee S.J. Father Conmee blessed him in the sun for his purse held, he knew, one silver crown.</p>
<p> Father Conmee crossed to Mountjoy
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">square
and</span></span> <font color="black">square. He thought, but not for long, of
soldiers and sailors whose legs were shot off by cannonballs, of cardinal
Wolsey&apos;s words: If I had served my God as I have served my King He would
not not have abandoned me in my old days.
He</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font> walked by the
treeshade of sunnywinking leaves: and towards him came the wife of Mr David Sheehy MP.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Very well, indeed, father. And you, father?</p>
<p> Father Conmee was wonderfully well indeed. He would go to Buxton probably
for the waters. And her boys, were they getting on well at Belvedere? Was that
so? Father Conmee was very glad indeed to hear that. And Mr Sheehy himself?
Still in London. The house was still sitting, to be sure it was. Beautiful
weather it was, delightful indeed. Yes, it was very probable that Father Bernard
Vaughan would come again to preach. O, yes: a very great success. A wonderful man really.</p>
<p> Father Conmee was very glad to see the wife of Mr David Sheehy M.P. looking
so well and he begged to be remembered to Mr David Sheehy M.P. Yes, he would certainly call.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Good afternoon, Mrs Sheehy.</p>
<p> Father Conmee doffed his silk hat and smiled, as he took leave, at the jet
beads of her mantilla inkshining in the sun. And smiled yet again, in going. He
had cleaned his teeth, he knew, with arecanut paste.</p>
<p> Father Conmee walked and, walking, smiled for he thought on Father Bernard
Vaughan&apos;s droll eyes and cockney voice.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Pilate! Wy don&apos;t you hold back
<br><font color="green">{ms, 002}</font>
<br> that owlin mob?</p>
<p> A zealous man, however. Really he was. And really did great good in his way.
Beyond a doubt. Of good family too would one think it? Welsh, were they not?</p>
<p> O, lest he forget. That letter to Father provincial.</p>
<p> Father Conmee stopped three little schoolboys at the corner of Mountjoy
square. Yes: they were from Belvedere. The little house. Aha. And were they good
boys at school? O. That was very good now. And what was his name? Jack Sohan.
And his name? Ger. Gallaher. And the other little man? His name was Brunny
Lynam. O, that was a very nice name to have.</p>
<p> Father Conmee gave a letter from his breast to Master Jack Sohan and pointed
to the red pillarbox at the corner of Fitzgibbon street.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But mind you don&apos;t post yourself into the box, little man, he said.</p>
<p> The boys sixeyed Father Conmee and laughed:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, sir.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, let me see if you can post a letter, Father Conmee said.</p>
<p> Master Brunny Lynam ran across the road and put Father Conmee letter to
Father provincial into the mouth of the bright red letterbox, Father Conmee
smiled and nodded and smiled and walked along Mountjoy square east.</p>
<p> Was that not Mrs Magennis?</p>
<p> Mrs Magennis, stately, silverhaired, bowed to Father Conmee from the farther

<font color="black">footpath</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>
along which she sailed. And Father Conmee smiled and saluted.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; How do you do?</p>
<p> A fine carriage she has. Like Mary, queen of Scots, something. And to think
that she is a
pawnbroker<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span><font color="black">!</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>
Well, now! Such a&nbsp;&hellip; what should he say?&nbsp;&hellip;.
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><font color="black">such
a</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font> queenly mien.</p>
<p> Father Conmee walked down Great Charles street and glanced at the shutup
free church on his left. The reverend T.R. Greene B.A. The incumbent they call
him. He feels it incumbent on him to say a few words. But one should be
charitable. Invincible ignorance. They acted according to their lights.</p>
<p> Father Conmee turned the corner and walked along the North Circular road. It was a
<br><font color="green">{ms, 003}</font>
<br> wonder that there was no tram line in such an important thoroughfare. Surely, there ought to be.</p>
<p> A band of satchelled schoolboyss crosed from Richmond street. All raised
untidy caps. Father Conmee greeted them more than once benignly. Christian brother boys.</p>
<p> Father Conmee smelt incense on his right hand as he walked. Saint
Joseph&apos;s church, Portland row. For aged and virtuous females. Father Conmee
raised his hat to the Blessed Sacrament. Virtuous: but occasionally they were also badtempered.</p>
<p> Near Aldborough house Father Conmee thought of that spendthrift nobleman. And now it was an office or something.</p>
<p> Father Conmee began to walk along the North Strand road and was saluted by
Mr Peter Gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop. Father Conmee saluted
Mr Peter Gallagher and perceived the odours that came from baconflitches and
ample cools of butter. He passed Grogan&apos;s the tobacconist against which
newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful catastrophe in New York. In America
those things were continually happening. Unfortunate people to die like that,
unprepared. Still, an act of perfect contrition.</p>
<p> Father Conmee went by Daniel Bergin&apos;s publichouse against the window of
which two unlabouring men lounged. They saluted him and were saluted.</p>
<p> He
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><font color="black">Father
Conmee</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font> passed H.J.

smoking and staring at a branch of elm above him. It was idyllic: and Father
Conmee reflected on the providence of the Creator who had made turf to be in
bogs whence men might dig it out and bring it to make fires in the houses of
poor people.</font><font color="red"><sup><small>a|2|</small></sup></font></p>

bridge Father Conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for he disliked to
traverse on foot the dingy way past mud island.</p>
<p> Father Conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar, a blue ticket tucked with care
in the eye of one plump kid glove, while four shillings, a sixpence and five
pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into his purse
<br><font color="green">{ms, 004}</font> </p>
<p> It was a peaceful day. The gentleman with the glasses opposite Father Conmee
had finished explaining and looked down. His wife, Father Conmee supposed.</p>
<p> A tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman with the glasses.
She raised her small gloved fist, yawned ever so gently, tiptapping her small gloved fist on her opening mouth.</p>
<p> Father Conmee perceived her perfume in the car. He perceived also that the
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><font color="black">awkward</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>
man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge of the seat.</p>
<p>
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><font color="black">Father

man who had the shaky head.</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font></p>
<p> At Newcomen bridge the tram halted and, when it was about to go, an old
woman rose suddenly from her place to alight. The conductor pulled the bellstrap
to stay the car for her. She passed out with her basket and a marketnet: and
Father Conmee saw the conductor help her and net and basket down: and Father
Conmee thought that she was one of those good souls who
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">have</span></span>
<font color="black">had</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>
always to be told twice bless you, my child, that they have been absolved, pray
for me. But they had so many worries in life, so many cares, poor creatures.</p>
<p> From the hoardings Mr Eugene Stratton grimaced with thick nigger lips at Father Conmee.</p>
<p> Father Conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men and of
his sermon on saint Peter Claver S.J. and the African
mission<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span> and of the
propagation of the
faith<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span> and of the
millions of black and brown and yellow souls that had not received the baptism
of water. That book by the Belgian jesuit, <u>Le Nombre des Elus</u>, seemed to
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">him</span></span> Father Conmee a
reasonable plea. Those were millions of human souls created by God in His

<font color="black">Own</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>
likeness to whom the faith had not been brought. But they were God&apos;s souls,
created by God. It seemed to Father Conmee a pity that they should all be lost, a waste, if one might say.</p>
<p> At the Howith road stop Father Conmee alighted, was saluted by the conductor and saluted in his turn.</p>
<p> The Malahide road was quiet. It pleased Father
<br><font color="green">{ms, 005}</font>
<br> Conmee, road and name. The joybells were ringing in gay Malahide. Those
were old worldish days, loyal times, in joyous townlands, old times in the barony.</p>
<p> Father Conmee, walking, thought of his little book <u>Old Times in the
Barony</u> and of the book that might be written about jesuit
houses<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span> and of Ellen, first countess of Belvedere.</p>
<p> A listless lady, no more young, walked alone the shore of lough Owel, Ellen,
first countess of Belvedere, listlessly walking in the evening, not startled
when an otter plunged. Who could know the truth? Not the jealous lord Belvedere,
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><font color="black">And</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>
Not her confessor
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">even</span></span> if she had not

<p> It was a charming day.</p>
<p> The lychgate of a field showed Father Conmee breadths of cabbages,
curtseying to him with ample underleaves. The sky showed him a flock of small
white clouds going slowly down the wind. <u>Moutonner</u>, the French said. A

<p> Father Conmee, reading his office, watched a flock of muttoning clouds over
<br><font color="green">{ms, 006}</font>
<br> Rathcoffey. His thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of Clongowes
field. He walked there, reading in the evening, and heard the cries of the

<p class="pdi">&mdash; Hello, Jack, is that yourself? Ned Lambert said, raising
in salute his pliant lath among the flickering arches. Come on. Mind your steps there.</p>
<p> The vesta in the clergyman&apos;s uplifted hand consumed itself in a long

I won&apos;t trespass on your valuable time&nbsp;&hellip;.</p>

<p class="pdi">&mdash; Pleasure is mine, sir, Ned Lambert answered.</p>
<p> He followed his guest to the outlet and then whirled his lath away among the
pillars. With J.J. O&apos;Molloy he came forth slowly into Mary&apos;s abbey where draymen were loading floats.</p>
<p> He stood to read the card in his hand.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The reverend Hugh C Love, the vicarage, Rathcoffey. Nice
young chap he is. He&apos;s writing a book about the Fitzgeralds he told me. He&apos;s well up in history, faith.</p>
<p> The young woman with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I thought you were at a new gunpowder plot, J.J. O&apos;Molloy said.</p>
<p> Ned Lambert cracked his fingers in the air.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; God! he cried. I forgot to tell him
<br><font color="green">{ms, 015}</font>
<br> that one about the earl of Kildare after he set fire to Cashel cathedral.
You know that one? <u>I&apos;m bloody sorry I did it</u>, says he, <u>but I
declare to God I thought the archbishop was inside.</u> He mightn&apos;t like
it, though. What? God, I&apos;ll tell him anyhow. That was the great earl, the
Fitzgerald Mor. Hot members they were all of them, the Geraldines.</p>
<p> The horses he passed started nervously under their slack harness. He slapped
a piebald haunch quivering near him and cried:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Woa, sonny!</p>
<p> He turned to J.J. O&apos;Molloy and asked:</p>

<p class="pdi">&mdash; Drain? Lenehan said. It was down a manhole.</p>

<p> Going down the path of Sycamore street Lenehan showed

like a bloody gaspipe and there was the poor devil stuck down in it, half choked

might damn easy get a nasty fall there coming along tight in the dark.</p>
<p> The gates of the drive opened wide to give egress to the viceregal cavalcade.</p>

<p> They went up the steps and under Merchants&apos; arch. A darkbacked figure
scanned books on the hawker&apos;s cart.</p>

<p class="pdi">&mdash; He&apos;s dead nuts on sales,
M<sup><small>c</small></SUP>Coy said. I was with him one day and he bought a
book from an old one in Liffey street for two bob. There were fine plates in it

<p class="pdi">&mdash; But wait till I tell you, he said, Delahunt of Camden

wine and sherry and curacoa. Cold joints galore and mince pies&nbsp;&hellip;.</p>

<p> Lenehan linked his arm warmly.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But wait till I tell you, he said. We had a midnight
lunch after it too and when we sallied forth it was blue o&apos;clock in the
morning. Coming home it was a gorgeous winter&apos;s night on the featherbed
mountain. Bloom and Chris Callanan were on one side of the car and I was with
the wife on the other. We started singing glees and duets: <u>Lo, the early beam
of morning</u>. She was well primed with a good load of Delahunt&apos;s port
under her bellyband. Every jolt the bloody car gave I had her bumping up against
me. Hell&apos;s delights! She has a fine pair, God bless her. Like that.</p>
<p> He held his caved hands a cubit from his, frowning:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I was tucking the rug under her and settling her boa all the time. Know what I mean?</p>
<p> His hands moulded ample curves of the air. He shut his eyes tight in
delight, his body shrinking, and blew a sweet chirp from his lips.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The lad stood to attention anyhow, he said with a sigh.
She&apos;s a gamey mare and no mistake. Bloom was pointing out all the stars and
the comets in the heavens to Chris Callanan and the jarvey: the Great bear and
Hercules and the dragon<a target="foot" id="flz0004">&ordm;</a> and the whole
jingbang lot. But, by God, I was lost, so to speak, in the milky way. He knew
them all, faith. At last she spotted a weeny one miles away. <u>And what star is
that, Poldy?</u> says she. By God, she had Bloom cornered. <u>That one, is it?</u> says
<br><font color="green">{ms, 019}</font>
<br> Chris Callanan, <u>sure that&apos;s only what you might call a

<p class="pdi">&mdash; I&apos;m weak, he gasped.</p>
<p> M<sup><small>c</small></SUP>Coy&apos;s white face smiled about it at
instants and grew grave. Lenehan walked on again. He lifted his yachtingcap and
scratched his hindhead rapidly. He glanced sideways in the sunlight at M<sup><small>c</small></SUP>Coy.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He&apos;s a cultured chap, Bloom is, he said seriously.
He&apos;s not one of your common or garden&nbsp;&hellip; you know&nbsp;&hellip;

<font color="black">touch</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font> of the artist about Bloom.</p>
<p class="headline">&lowast;&lowast;&lowast;</p>
<p> Mr Bloom turned over idly pages of <u>Maria Monk</u>, then of
Aristotle&apos;s <u>Master piece</u>. Crooked botched print. Plates: infants
cuddled in a ball in bloodred wombs like livers of slaughtered cows. Lots of
them like that at this moment all over the world. All butting with their skulls
to get out of it. Child born every minute somewhere. Mrs Purefoy.</p>
<p> He laid both books aside and glanced at the third: <u>Tales of the Ghetto</u> by Sacher Masoch.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That I had, he said, pushing it by.</p>
<p> The shopman let two volumes fall on the counter.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Them are two good ones, he said.</p>
<p> Onions of his breath came across the counter out of his
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">ruinou</span></span> ruined mouth.
He bent to make a bundle of the other books, hugged them against his unbuttoned
waistcoat and bore them off behind the dingy curtain.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom, alone, looked at the titles. <u>Fair Tyrants</u> by James
<br><font color="green">{ms, 020}</font>
<br> Lovebirch. Know the kind that is.</p>
<p> He opened it. Thought so.</p>
<p> A woman&apos;s voice behind the dingy curtain. Listen: the man</p>
<p> No: she wouldn&apos;t like that much. Got her one once.</p>
<p> He read the other title: <u>Sweets of Sin</u>. More in her line. Let us see.</p>
<p> He read where his finger opened.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; All the dollarbills her husband gave her were spent in
the stores on wondrous gowns and costliest frillies. For him! For Raoul!</p>
<p> Yes. This. Here. Try.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Her mouth glued on his in a luscious voluptuous kiss
while his hands felt for the opulent curves inside her deshabille.</p>
<p> Yes. Take this. The end.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You are late, he

<font color="black">eyeing</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font> her with a suspicious glare.</p>
<p> The beautiful woman threw off her sabletrimmed wrap, displaying her queenly
shoulders and heaving embonpoint. An imperceptible smile played round her perfect lips as she turned to him calmly.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom read
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><font color="black">again</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>:
The beautiful woman&nbsp;&hellip;.</p>
<p> Warmth showered gently over him, cowing his flesh. Flesh yielded amply

whites of eyes swooning up. His nostrils arched themselves for prey. Melting
breast ointments (for him! for Raoul!). Armpits&apos; oniony sweat. Fishgluey
slime. (her heaving embonpoint!) Feel! Press! Chrished! Sulphur dung of lions!</p>
<p> Young! Young!</p>
<p> Phlegmy coughs shook the air of the bookshop, bulging out the dingy
curtains. The shopman&apos;s uncombed grey head came out and his unshaven
reddened face, coughing. He raked his throat rudely,
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">spat</span></span>
<font color="black">puked</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>
phlegm on the floor. He put his boot on what he had spat, wiping his sole along
it, and bent, showing a rawskinned crown, scantily haired.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 021}</font> </p>
<p> Mr Bloom beheld it.</p>
<p> Mastering his troubled breath, he said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I&apos;ll take this one.</p>
<p> The shopman lifted eyes bleared with old rheum.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Sweets of Sin</u>, he said, tapping on it. That&apos;s a good one.</p>
<p class="headline">&lowast;&lowast;&lowast;</p>
<p> The lacquey by the door of Dillon&apos;s auctionrooms shook his handbell
twice again and viewed himself in the chalked mirror of the cabinet.</p>
<p> Dilly Dedalus, loitering by the curbstone, heard the beats of the bells, the
cries of the auctioneer within. Four and nine. Those lovely curtains. Five
shillings. Cosy curtains. Selling new at two guineas. Any advance on five shillings? Going for five shillings.</p>
<p> The lacquey lifted his handbell and shook it:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Barang!</p>
<p>
<font color="red"><sup><small>|s2</small></sup></font><font color="black">Bang

W.E. Wylie, A. Munro and H.T. Gahan, their stretched necks wagging negotiated
the curve by the College library.</font><font color="red"><sup><small>s2|</small></sup></font></p>
<p> Mr Dedalus, tugging a long moustache, came round from William&apos;s row. He halted near his daughter.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It&apos;s time for you, she said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Stand up straight for the love of the lord Jesus, Mr
Dedalus said. Are you trying to imitate your uncle John, the cornetplayer, head upon shoulder?</p>
<p> Dilly shrugged her shoulders. Mr Dedalus placed his hands on them and held them back.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Stand up straight, girl, he said. You&apos;ll get
curvature of the spine. Do you know what you look like?</p>
<p> He let his head sink suddenly down and forward, hunching his shoulders and dropping his underjaw.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Give it up, father, Dilly said. All the people are looking at you.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 022}</font> </p>
<p> Mr Dedalus drew himself upright and tugged again at his moustache.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Did you get any money? Dilly asked.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Where would I get money? Mr Dedalus said. There is no-one in Dublin would lend me fourpence.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You got some, Dilly said, looking in his eyes.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; How do you know that? Mr Dedalus asked, his tongue in his cheek.</p>
<p> Mr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked, walked boldly along Thomas street.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I know you did, Dilly answered. Were you in the Scotch house now?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I was not, then, Mr Dedalus said, smiling. Was it the
little nuns taught you to be so saucy? Here.</p>
<p> He handed her a shilling.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; See if you can do anything with that, he said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I suppose you got five, Dilly said. Give me more than that.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Wait awhile, Mr Dedalus said threateningly. You&apos;re
like the rest of them, are you? An insolent pack of little bitches since your
poor mother died. But wait awhile. You&apos;ll all get a short shrift and a long day from me.</p>
<p> He left her and walked on. Dilly followed quickly and pulled his coat.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, what is it? he said, stopping.</p>
<p> The lacquey rang his bell behind their backs.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Barang!</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Curse your

blatant soul, Mr Dedalus cried, turning on him.</p>
<p> The lacquey, aware of comment, shook the lolling clapper of his bell: but feebly:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Bang!</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You got more than that, father, Dilly said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I&apos;m going to show you a little trick, Mr Dedalus
said. I&apos;ll leave you all where Jesus left the jews. Look, there&apos;s all I have. I got two shillings
<br><font color="green">{ms, 023}</font>
<br> from Jack Power and I spent twopence for a shave for the funeral.</p>
<p> He drew forth a handful of copper coins, nervously:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Can&apos;t you look for some money
somewhere<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><font color="black">?</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>
Dilly said.</p>
<p> Mr Dedalus thought and nodded.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I will, he said gravely. I looked all along the gutter in
O&apos;Connell street. I&apos;ll try this one now.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You&apos;re very funny, Dilly said, grinning.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Here, Mr Dedalus said, handing her two pennies. Get a
glass of milk for yourself and a bun or a something. I&apos;ll be home shortly.</p>
<p> He put the other coins in his pocket and started to walk on.</p>
<p> The viceregal cavalcade passed, greeted by obsequious policemen, out of parkgate.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I&apos;m sure you have another shilling, Dilly said.</p>
<p> The lacquey banged loudly.</p>
<p> Mr Dedalus amid the din walked off, murmuring to himself with a pursing
mincing mouth

<p> He took the coverless book from her hand. Bu&eacute;&apos;s French primer.</p>

<p class="pdi">&mdash; Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.</p>
<p> They clasped handed loudly outside Reddy and Daughter&apos;s. Father Cowley
brushed his moustache often downward with a scooping hand.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What&apos;s the best news? Mr Dedalus said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Why then not much, Father Cowley said. I&apos;m
barricaded up, Simon, with two men prowling around the house trying to effect an entrance.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Jolly, Mr Dedalus said. Who is it?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, Father Cowley said. A certain gombeen man of our acquaintance.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; With a broken back, is it? Mr Dedalus asked.

<p class="pdi">&mdash; The same, Simon, Father Cowley answered. Reuben of that
ilk. I&apos;m just waiting for Ben Dollard. He&apos;s going to say a word to
long John to get him to take those two men off. All I want is a little time.</p>
<p> He looked with vague hope up and down the quay, a big apple bulging in his neck.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I know, Mr Dedalus said, nodding. Poor old bockedy Ben!
He&apos;s always doing a good turn for someone. Hold hard!</p>
<p> He put on his glasses and gazed towards the metal bridge an instant.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 030}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Here he is, by God, he said, arse and pockets.</p>
<p> Ben Dollard&apos;s loose blue cutaway and square hat above large slops
crossed the quay in full gait from the metal bridge. He came towards them at an
amble, scratching actively behind his coattails.</p>
<p> As he came near Mr Dedalus greeted:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Hold that fellow with the bad trousers.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Hold him now, Ben Dollard said.</p>
<p> He stood beside them beaming, on them first and on his roomy clothes from
points of which Mr Dedalus flicked fluff, saying:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; They were made for a man in his health.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Bad luck to the jewman that made them, Ben Dollard said.
Thanks be to God he&apos;s not paid yet.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And how is that <u>basso profondo</u>, Benjamin, Father Cowley asked.</p>

strode past the Kildare street club.</p>
<p> Ben Dollard frowned and, making suddenly a chanter&apos;s mouth, gave forth a deep note.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Aw! he said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That&apos;s the style, Mr Dedalus said,

<p> The tall form of long John Fanning filled the doorway where he stood.</p>

pinching his chin thoughtfully with thumb and forefinger. Now I am speculating
what it would be likely to be. Such persons always have.

Farrell walked as far as Mr Lewis Werner&apos;s cheerful windows, then turned
and strode back along Merrion Square, his stickumbrelladustcoat dangling.</p>
<p> At the corner of Wilde&apos;s house he halted,
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">stared</span></span> frowned at
Elijah&apos;s name announced on the Metropolitan Hall, frowned at the distant
pleasance of duke&apos;s lawn. His eyeglass flashed frowning in the sun.

<br> He stood looking in at the two puckers stripped to their pelts and putting
up their props. From the sidemirrors two mourning Masters Dignam gaped silently.

the blooming thing is all over. He turned to the right and on his right Master
Dignam turned, his cap awry, his collar sticking up. Buttoning it down, his chin
lifted, he saw the image of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, beside the two
puckers. One of them mots that do be in the packets of fags Stoer smokes that
his old fellow welted hell out of him for one time he found out.</p>
<p> Master Dignam got his collar down and dawdled on. The best pucker going for
strength was Fitzsimons. One puck
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">from</span></span> in the wind

listening to what the drunk was telling him and grinning all the time.</p>
<p> No Sandymount tram.</p>
<p> Master Dignam walked along Nassau Street, shifted the porksteaks to his
other hand. His collar sprang up again and he tugged it down. The blooming stud
was too small for the buttonhole of the shirt, blooming end to it. He met
schoolboys with satchels. I&apos;m not going tomorrow either, stay away till
Monday. He met other schoolboys. Do they notice I&apos;m in

<p> His face got all grey instead of being red like it was and there was a fly
walking over it up to his eye. The scrunch that was when they were screwing the
screws into the coffin: and the bumps when they were bringing it downstairs.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 043}</font> </p>
<p> Pa was inside it and ma crying in the parlour and uncle Barney telling the
men how to get it round the bend. A big coffin it was, and high and
heavylooking. How was that? The last night pa was boosed he was standing on the
landing there <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">shou</span></span>
