<p class="center">III</p>
<p class="flush">The swift December dusk had come tumbling clownishly after its
dull day and, as he stared through the dull square of the window of the
schoolroom, he felt his belly crave for its food. He hoped there would be stew
for dinner, turnips and carrots and bruised potatoes and fat mutton pieces to be
ladled out in thick peppered flour-fattened sauce. Stuff it into you, his belly counselled him.</p>
<p> It would be a gloomy secret night. After early nightfall the yellow lamps
would light up, here and there, the squalid quarter of the brothels. He would
follow a devious course up and down the streets, circling always nearer and
nearer in a tremor of fear and joy, until his feet led him suddenly round a dark
corner. The whores would be just coming out of their houses making ready for the night, yawning
<br><font color="green">{ms, 2}</font>
<br> lazily after their sleep and settling the hairpins in their clusters of
hair. He would pass by them calmly waiting for a sudden movement of his own will
or a sudden call to his sin-loving soul from their soft perfumed flesh. Yet as
he prowled in quest of that call, his senses, stultified only by his desire,
would note keenly all that wounded and shamed them; his eyes, a ring of porter
froth on a clothless table or a photograph of two soldiers standing to attention
or a gaudy playbill; his ears, the drawling jargon of greeting:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Hello, Bertie, any good in your mind? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is that you, pigeon? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Number ten. Fresh Nelly is waiting on you &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Good night, husband! Coming in to have a short time? &mdash;</p>
<p> The equation on the page of his scribbler began to spread out a widening
tail, eyed and starred like a peacock&apos;s; and, when the eyes and stars of its
<br><font color="green">{ms, 3}</font>
<br> indices had been eliminated, began slowly to fold itself together again.
The indices appearing and disappearing were eyes opening and closing; the eyes
opening and closing were stars being born and being quenched. The vast cycle of
starry life bore his weary mind outward to its verge and inward to its centre, a
distant music accompanying him outward and inward. What music? The music came
nearer and he recalled the words, the words of Shelley&apos;s fragment upon the
moon wandering companionless, pale for weariness. The stars began to crumble and
a cloud of fine stardust fell through space.</p>
<p> The dull light fell more faintly upon the page whereon another equation
began to unfold itself slowly and to spread abroad its widening tail. It was his
own soul going forth to experience, unfolding itself sin by sin, spreading
<br><font color="green">{ms, 4}</font>
<br> abroad the bale-fire of its burning stars and folding back upon itself,
fading slowly, quenching its own lights and fires. They were quenched: and the cold darkness filled chaos.</p>
<p> A cold lucid indifference reigned in his soul. At his first violent sin he
had felt a wave of vitality pass out of him and had feared to find his body or
his soul maimed by the excess. Instead the vital wave had carried him on its
bosom out of himself and back again when it receded: and no part of body or soul
had been maimed but a dark peace had been established between them. The chaos in
which his ardour extinguished itself was a cold indifferent knowledge of
himself. He had sinned mortally not once but many times and he knew that, while
he stood in danger of eternal damnation for the first sin alone, by every succeeding sin
<br><font color="green">{ms, 5}</font>
<br> he multiplied his guilt and his punishment. His days and works and thoughts
could make no atonement for him, the fountains of sanctifying grace having
ceased to refresh his soul. At most, by an alms given to a beggar whose blessing
he fled from, he might hope wearily to win for himself some measure of actual
grace. Devotion had gone by the board. What did it avail to pray when he knew
that his soul lusted after its own destruction? A certain pride, a certain awe,
withheld him from offering to God even one prayer at night, though he knew it
was in God&apos;s power to take away his life while he slept and hurl his soul
hellward ere he could beg for mercy. His pride in his own sin, his loveless awe
of God, told him that his offence was too grievous to be atoned for in whole or in part by a false
<br><font color="green">{ms, 6}</font>
<br> homage to the All-seeing and All-knowing.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well now, Ennis, I declare you have a head and so has my
stick! Do you mean to say that you are not able to tell me what a surd is? &mdash;</p>
<p> The blundering answer stirred the embers of his contempt of his fellows.
Towards others he felt neither shame nor fear. On Sunday mornings as he passed
the church door he glanced coldly at the worshippers who stood bareheaded, four
deep, outside the church, morally present at the mass which they could neither
see nor hear. Their dull piety and the sickly smell of the cheap hair-oil with
which they had anointed their heads repelled him from the altar they prayed at.
He stooped to the evil of hypocrisy with others, sceptical of their innocence
which he could cajole so lightly.<a target="foot" id="fzz0051">&ordm;</a></p>
<p> On the wall of his bedroom hung an illuminated scroll, the certificate of his
<br><font color="green">{ms, 7}</font>
<br> prefecture in the college of the sodality of the Blessed Virgin Mary. On
Saturday mornings when the sodality met in the chapel to recite the little
office his place was a cushioned kneeling-desk at the right of the altar from
which he led his wing of boys through the responses. The falsehood of his
position did not pain him. If at moments he felt an impulse to rise from his
post of honour and, confessing before them all his unworthiness, to leave the
chapel, a glance at their faces restrained him. The imagery of the psalms of
prophecy soothed his barren pride. The glories of Mary held his soul captive:
spikenard and myrrh and frankincense, symbolizing her royal lineage, her
emblems, the late-flowering plant and late-blossoming tree, symbolizing the age-long gradual growth of her
<br><font color="green">{ms, 8}</font>
<br> cultus among men. When it fell to him to read the lesson towards the close
of the office he read it in a veiled voice, lulling his conscience to its music.</p>
<p> <u>Quasi cedrus exaltata sum in Libanon et quasi cupressus in monte Sion.
Quasi palma exaltata sum in Gades at<a target="foot" id="fzz0052">&ordm;</a>
quasi plantatio rosae in Jericho. Quasi uliva speciosa in campis et quasi
platanus exaltata sum juxta aquam in plateis. Sicut cinnamomum et balsamum
aromatizans odorem dedi et quasi myrrha electa dedi suavitatem odoris.</u></p>
<p> His sin, which had covered him from the sight of God, had led him nearer to
the refuge of sinners. Her eyes seemed to regard him with mild pity; her
holiness, a strange light glowing faintly upon her frail flesh, did not
humiliate the sinner who approached her. If ever he was
<br><font color="green">{ms, 9}</font>
<br> impelled to cast sin from him and to repent the impulse that moved him was
the wish to be her knight. If ever his soul, re-entering her dwelling shyly
after the frenzy of his body&apos;s lust had spent itself, was turned towards
her whose emblem is the morning star, &ldquo;Bright and musical, telling of
heaven and infusing peace&rdquo; it was when her names were murmured softly by
lips whereon there still lingered foul and shameful words, the savour itself of a lewd kiss.</p>
<p> That was strange. He tried to think how it could be. But the dusk, deepening
in the schoolroom, covered over his thought. The bell rang. The master marked
the sums and cuts to be done for the next lesson and went out. Heron, beside Stephen, began to hum tunelessly:</p>
<p class="set"><u>My excellent friend Pombados<a target="foot" id="fzz0053">&ordm;</a>
<br> My dearest and best Patake</u>
<br><font color="green">{ms, 10}</font> </p>
<p> Ennis, who had gone to the yard, came back, saying:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The boy from the house is coming up for the rector &mdash;</p>
<p> A tall boy behind Stephen rubbed his hands and said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That&apos;s game ball. We can scut the whole hour. He
won&apos;t be in till after half two. Then you can ask him questions on the catechism, Dedalus. &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen, leaning back and drawing idly on his scribbler, listened to the
talk about him which Heron checked from time to time by saying:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Shut up, will you. Don&apos;t make such a bally racket! &mdash;</p>
<p> It was strange too that he found an arid pleasure in following up to the end
the rigid lines of the doctrines of the church and penetrating into obscure
silences only to hear and feel the more deeply his own condemnation. The
sentence of saint James which says that he who offends against one commandment becomes
<br><font color="green">{ms, 11}</font>
<br> guilty of all, had seemed to him first a swollen phrase until he had begun
to grope in the darkness of his own state. From the evil seed of lust all other
deadly sins had sprung forth: pride in himself and contempt of others,
covetousness in using money for the purchase of unlawful pleasures, envy of
those whose vices he could not reach to and calumnious murmuring against the
pious, gluttonous enjoyment of food, the dull glowering anger amid which he
brooded upon his longing, the swamp of spiritual and bodily sloth in which his whole being had sunk.</p>
<p> As he sat in his bench gazing calmly at the rector&apos;s shrewd harsh face,
his mind wound itself in and out of the curious questions proposed to it. If a
man had stolen a pound in his youth and had used that pound to amass a huge fortune how
<br><font color="green">{ms, 12}</font>
<br> much was he obliged to give back, the pound he had stolen only or the pound
together with the compound interest accruing upon it or all his huge fortune? If
a layman in giving baptism pour the water before saying the words is the child
baptized? Is baptism with a mineral water valid? How comes it that while the
first beatitude promises the kingdom of heaven to the poor of heart the second
beatitude promises also the meek that they shall possess the land? Why was the
sacrament of the eucharist instituted under the two species of bread and wine if
Jesus Christ be present body and blood, soul and divinity, in the bread alone
and in the wine alone? Does a tiny particle of the
consecrated<a target="foot" id="fzz0054">&ordm;</a> contain all the body and
blood of Jesus Christ or a part only of the body and blood? If the wine change into vinegar and the host crumble into
<br><font color="green">{ms, 13}</font>
<br> corruption after they have been consecrated, is Jesus Christ still present
under their species as God and as man?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Here he is! Here he is! &mdash;</p>
<p> A boy from his post at the window had seen the rector come from the house.
All the catechisms were opened and all heads bent upon them silently. The rector
entered and took his seat on the dais. A gentle kick from the tall boy in the
bench behind urged Stephen to ask a difficult question.</p>
<p> The rector did not ask for a catechism to hear the lesson from. He clasped his hands on the desk and said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The retreat will begin on Wednesday afternoon in honour
of Saint Francis Xavier whose feast day is Saturday. The retreat will go on from
Wednesday to Friday. On Fridays<a target="foot" id="fzz0055">&ordm;</a>
confessions<a target="foot" id="fzz0056">&ordm;</a> will be heard all the
afternoon after beads. If any boys have special confessors perhaps it
<br><font color="green">{ms, 14}</font>
<br> will be better for them not to change. Mass will be on Saturday morning at
nine o&apos;clock and general communion for the whole college. Saturday will be
a free day. But Saturday and Sunday being free days some boys might be inclined
to think that Monday is a free day also. Beware of making that mistake. I think
you, Lawless, are likely to make that mistake.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I sir? Why, sir? &mdash;</p>
<p> A little wave of quiet mirth broke forth over the class of boys from the
rector&apos;s grim smile. Stephen&apos;s heart began slowly to fold and fade with fear like a withering flower.</p>
<p> The rector went on gravely:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You are all familiar with the story of the life of saint
Francis Xavier, I suppose, the patron of your college. He came of an old and illustrious Spanish family and you
<br><font color="green">{ms, 15}</font>
<br> remember that he was one of the first followers of saint Ignatius. They met
in Paris where Francis Xavier was professor of philosophy at the university.
This young and brilliant nobleman and man of letters entered heart and soul into
the ideas of our glorious founder and you know that he, at his own desire, was
sent by saint Ignatius to preach to the Indians. He is called, as you know, the
apostle of the Indies. He went from country to country in the east, from Africa
to India, from India to Japan, baptizing the people. He is said to have baptized
as many as ten thousand idolaters in one month. It is said that his right arm
had grown powerless from having been raised so often over the heads of those whom he
<br><font color="green">{ms, 16}</font>
<br> baptized. He wished then to go to China to win still more souls for God but
he died of fever on the island of Sancian. A great saint, saint Francis Xavier! A great soldier of God! &mdash;</p>
<p> The rector paused and then, shaking his clasped hands before him, went on:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He had the faith in him that moves mountains. Ten
thousand souls won for God in a single month! That is a true conqueror, true to
the motto of our order: <u>ad majoorem Dei gloriam</u>! A saint who has great
power in heaven, remember: power to intercede for us in our grief; power to
obtain whatever we pray for if it be for the good of our souls; power above all
to obtain for us the grace to repent if we be in sin. A great saint, saint
<br><font color="green">{ms, 17}</font>
<br> Francis Xavier! A great fisher of souls! &mdash;</p>
<p> He ceased to shake his clasped hands and, resting them against his forehead,
looked right and left of them keenly at his listeners out of his dark stern eyes.</p>
<p> In the silence their dark fire kindled the dusk into a tawny glow.
Stephen&apos;s heart had withered up like a flower of the desert that feels the simoom coming from afar.</p>
<p class="center">&starf; &starf; &starf;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Remember only thy last things and thou shalt not sin
for ever</u> &mdash; words taken, my dear little brothers in Christ, from the
book of Ecclesiastes, seventh chapter, fortieth verse. In the name of the Father
and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. Amen &mdash;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 18}</font> </p>
<p> Stephen sat in the front bench of the chapel. Father Arnall sat at a table
to the left of the altar. He wore about his shoulders a heavy cloak; his pale
face was drawn and his voice broken with rheum. The figure of his old master, so
strangely re-arisen, brought back to Stephen&apos;s mind his life at Clongowes:
the wide playgrounds, swarming with boys; the square ditch; the little cemetery
off the main avenue of chestnuts<a target="foot" id="fzz0057">&ordm;</a> where
he had dreamed of being buried; the firelight on the wall of the infirmary where
he lay sick; the sorrowful face of Brother Michael. His soul, as these memories
came back to him, became again a child&apos;s soul.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; We are assembled here today, my dear little brothers in
Christ, for one brief moment far away from the busy bustle of the outer world to
celebrate and to honour one of the greatest of saints,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 19}</font>
<br> the apostle of the Indies, the patron saint also of your college, saint
Francis Xavier. Year after year, for much longer than any of you, my dear little
boys, can remember or than I can remember, the boys of this college have met in
this very chapel to make their annual retreat before the feast day of their
patron saint. Time has gone on and brought with it its changes. Even in the last
few years what changes can most of you not remember? Many of the boys who sat in
those front benches a few short years ago are perhaps now in distant lands, in
the burning tropics, or immersed in professional duties or in seminaries, or
voyaging over the vast expanse of the deep or, it may be, already called by the
great God to another life and to the rendering up of their stewardship. And
still as the years roll by, bringing with them changes for good and
<br><font color="green">{ms, 20}</font>
<br> bad, the memory of the great saint is honoured by the boys of this college
who make every year their annual retreat on the days preceding the feast day set
apart by our Holy Mother the Church to transmit to all the ages the name and
fame of one of the greatest sons of catholic Spain.</p>
<p> Now what is the meaning of this word <u>retreat</u> and why is it allowed on
all hands to be a most salutary practice for all who desire to lead before God
and in the eyes of men a truly christian life? A retreat, my dear boys,
signifies a withdrawal for awhile from the cares of our life, the cares of this
workaday world, in order to examine the state of our conscience, to reflect on
the mysteries of holy religion and to understand better why we are here in this
world. During these few days I intend to put before you some thoughts concerning the four last things. They
<br><font color="green">{ms, 21}</font>
<br> are, as you know from your catechism, death, judgement, hell, and heaven.
We shall try to understand them fully during these few days so that we may
derive from the understanding of them a lasting benefit to our souls. And
remember, my dear boys, that we have been sent into this world for one thing and
for one thing alone: to do God&apos;s holy will and to save our immortal souls.
All else is worthless. One thing alone is needful, the salvation of one&apos;s
soul. What doth it profit a man to gain the whole world if he suffer the loss of
his immortal soul? Ah, my dear boys, believe me there is nothing in this
wretched world that can make up for such a loss.</p>
<p> I will ask you, therefore, my dear boys, to put away from your minds during
these few days all worldly thoughts, whether of study or pleasure or
<br><font color="green">{ms, 22}</font>
<br> ambition, and to give all your attention to the state of your souls. I need
hardly remind you that during the days of the retreat all boys are expected to
preserve a quiet and pious demeanour and to shun all loud unseemly pleasure. The
elder boys, of course, will see that this custom is not infringed and I look
especially to the prefects and officers of the sodality of Our Blessed Lady and
of the sodality of the holy angels to set a good example to their fellow-students.</p>
<p> Let us try, therefore, to make this retreat in honour of saint Francis with
our whole heart and our whole mind. God&apos;s blessing will then be upon all
your year&apos;s studies. But, above and beyond all, let this retreat be one to
which you can look back in after years when, may be, you are
<br><font color="green">{ms, 23}</font>
<br> far from this college and among very different surroundings, to which you
can look back with joy and thankfulness and give thanks to God for having
granted you this occasion of laying the first foundation of a pious honourable
zealous christian life. And if, as may so happen, there be at this moment in
these benches any poor soul which has had the unutterable misfortune to lose
God&apos;s holy grace and to fall into grievous sin, I fervently trust and pray
that this retreat may be the turning point in the life of that soul. I pray to
God through the merits of its<a target="foot" id="fzz0058">&ordm;</a> zealous
servant Francis Xavier, that such a soul may be led to sincere repentance and
that the holy communion on saint Francis&apos;s day of
<br><font color="green">{ms, 24}</font>
<br> this year may be a lasting covenant between God and that soul. For just and
unjust, for saint and sinner alike, may this retreat be a memorable one.</p>
<p> Help me, my dear little brothers in Christ. Help me by your pious attention,
by your own devotion, by your outward demeanour. Banish from your minds all
worldly thoughts and think only of the last things, death, judgement, hell, and
heaven. He who remembers these things, says Ecclesiastes, shall not sin for
ever. He who remembers the last things will act and think with them always
before his eyes. He will live a good life and die a good death, believing and
knowing that, if he has sacrificed much in this earthly life, it will be given to him a
<br><font color="green">{ms, 25}</font>
<br> hundredfold and a thousandfold more in the life to come, in the kingdom
without end &mdash; a blessing, my dear boys, which I wish you from my heart,
one and all, in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. Amen. &mdash;</p>
<p> As he walked home with silent companions, a thick fog seemed to compass his
mind. He waited in stupor of mind till it should lift and reveal what it had
hidden. He ate his dinner with surly appetite and when the meal was over and the
grease-strewn plates lay abandoned on the table, he rose and went to the window,
clearing the thick scum from his mouth with his tongue and licking it from his
lips. So he had sunk to the state of a beast that licks his chaps after meat. This was the end; and
<br><font color="green">{ms, 26}</font>
<br> a faint glimmer of fear began to pierce the fog of his mind. He pressed his
face against the pane of the window and gazed out into the darkening street.
Forms passed this way and that way through the dull light. And that was life.
The letters of the name of Dublin lay heavily upon his mind, pushing one another
surlily hither and thither with slow boorish insistence. His soul was fattening
and congealing into a gross grease, plunging ever deeper in its dull fear into a
sombre threatening dusk while the body that was his stood, listless and
dishonoured, gazing out of darkened eyes, helpless, perturbed, and human for a bovine god to stare upon.</p>
<p> The next day brought death and judgement, stirring his soul slowly from its
listless despair. The faint glimmer of fear became a terror of spirit as the
<br><font color="green">{ms, 27}</font>
<br> hoarse voice of the preacher blew death into his soul. He suffered its
agony. He felt the death chill touch the extremities and creep onward towards
the heart, the film of death veiling the eyes, the bright centres of the brain
extinguished one by one like lamps, the last sweat oozing upon the skin, the
powerlessness of the dying limbs, the speech thickening and wandering and
failing, the heart throbbing faintly and more faintly, all but vanquished, the
breath, the poor timid breath, the poor helpless human spirit, sobbing and
sighing, gurgling and rattling in the throat. No help! No help! He, he himself,
his body to which he had yielded was dying. Into the grave with it. Nail it down
into a wooden box, the corpse. Carry it out of the house on the shoulders of
hirelings. Thrust it out of men&apos;s sight into a long
<br><font color="green">{ms, 28}</font>
<br> hole in the ground, into the grave, to rot, to feed the mass of its
creeping worms and to be devoured by scuttling plump-bellied rats.</p>
<p> And while the friends were still standing in tears by the bedside the soul
of the sinner was judged. At the last moment of consciousness the whole earthly
life passed before the vision of the soul and, ere it had time to reflect, the
body had died and the soul stood terrified before the judgement seat. God, who
had long been merciful, would then be just. He had long been patient, pleading
with the sinful soul, giving it time to repent, sparing it yet awhile. But that
time had gone. Time was to sin and to enjoy, time was to scoff at God and at the
warnings of His holy church, time was to defy His majesty, to disobey
<br><font color="green">{ms, 29}</font>
<br> his commands, to hoodwink one&apos;s fellow men, to commit sin after sin
and to hide one&apos;s corruption from the sight of men. But that time was over.
Now it was God&apos;s turn: and He was not to be hoodwinked or deceived. Every
sin would then come forth from its lurking place, the most rebellious against
the divine will and the most degrading to our poor corrupt nature, the tiniest
imperfection and the most heinous atrocity. What did it avail then to have been
a great emperor, a great general, a marvellous inventor, the most learned of the
learned? All were as one before the judgement seat of God. He would reward the
good and punish the wicked. One single instant was enough for the trial of a man&apos;s soul. One single instant after
<br><font color="green">{ms, 30}</font>
<br> the body&apos;s death, the soul had been weighed in the balance. The
particular judgement was over and the soul had passed to the abode of bliss or
to the prison of purgatory or had been hurled howling into hell.</p>
<p> Nor was that all. God&apos;s justice had still to be vindicated before men:
after the particular there still remained the general judgement. The last day
had come. The doomsday was at hand. The stars of heaven were falling upon the
earth like the figs cast by the fig-tree which the wind has shaken. The sun, the
great luminary of the universe, had become as sackcloth of hair. The moon was
blood-red. The firmament was as a scroll rolled away. The archangel Michael, the
prince of the heavenly host, appeared glorious and terrible against the sky. With
<br><font color="green">{ms, 31}</font>
<br> one foot on the sea and one foot on the land he blew from the
arch- angelical trumpet the brazen death of time. The three blasts of the angel
filled all the universe. Time is, time was, but time shall be no more. At the
last blast the souls of universal humanity throng towards the valley of
Jehoshaphat, rich and poor, gentle and simple, wise and foolish, good and
wicked. The soul of every human being that has ever existed, the souls of all
those who shall yet be born, all the sons and daughters of Adam, all are
assembled on that supreme day. And lo, the supreme judge is coming! No longer
the lowly Lamb of God, no longer the meek Jesus of Nazareth, no longer the Man
of Sorrows, no longer the Good Shepherd, He is seen now coming upon the clouds, in great power and majesty, attended by
<br><font color="green">{ms, 32}</font>
<br> nine choirs of angels, angels and archangels, principalities, powers and
virtues, thrones and dominations, cherubim and seraphim, God Omnipotent, God
Everlasting. He speaks: and His voice is heard even at the farthest limits of
space, even In the bottomless abyss. Supreme Judge, from His sentence there will
be and can be no appeal. He calls the just to His side, bidding them enter into
the kingdom, the eternity of bliss prepared for them. The unjust He casts from
Him, crying in His offended majesty: <u>Depart from me, ye cursed, into
everlasting fire which was prepared for the devil and his angels</u>. O, what
agony then for the miserable sinners! Friend is torn apart from friend, children
from their parents, husbands from their wives. The poor sinner holds out his
arms to those who were dear and near to him in this earthly world, to those
<br><font color="green">{ms, 33}</font>
<br> whose simple piety perhaps he made a mock of, to those who counselled him
and tried to lead him on the right path, to a kind brother, to a loving sister,
to the mother and father who loved him so dearly. But it is too late: the just
turn away from the wretched damned souls which now appear before the eyes of all
in their hideous and evil character. O you hypocrites, O, you whited sepulchres,
O you who present a smooth smiling face to the world while your soul within is a
foul swamp of sin, how will it fare with you in that terrible day?</p>
<p> And this day will come, shall come, must come: the day of death and the day
of judgement. It is appointed unto man to die and after death the judgement. Death is certain. The time and manner are
<br><font color="green">{ms, 34}</font>
<br> uncertain, whether from long disease or from some unexpected accident: the
Son of God cometh at an hour when you little expect Him. Be therefore ready
every moment, seeing that you may die at any moment. Death is the end of us all.
Death and judgement, brought into the world by the sin of our first parents, are
the dark portals that close our earthly existence, the portals that open into
the unknown and the unseen, portals through which every soul must pass, alone,
unaided save by its good works, without friend or brother or parents or master
to help it, alone and trembling. Let that thought be ever before our minds and
then we cannot sin. Death, a cause of terror to the sinner, is a blessed moment
for him who has walked in the right path, fulfilling
<br><font color="green">{ms, 35}</font>
<br> the duties of his station in life, attending to his morning and evening
prayers, approaching the holy sacrament frequently and performing good and
merciful works. For the pious and believing catholic, for the just man, death is
no cause of terror. Was it not Addison, the great English writer, who, when on
his deathbed, sent for the wicked young earl of Warwick to let him see how a
christian can meet his end? He it is and he alone, the pious and believing christian, who can say in his heart:</p>
<p class="set"><u>O grave, where is thy victory?
<br> O death, where is thy sting?</u></p>
<p> Every word of it was for him. Against his sin, foul and secret, the whole
wrath of God was aimed. The preacher&apos;s knife had probed deeply into his
disclosed conscience and he felt now that his soul was festering in sin. Yes,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 36}</font>
<br> the preacher was right. God&apos;s turn had come. Like a beast in its lair
his soul had lain down in its own filth but the blasts of the angel&apos;s
trumpet had driven him forth from the darkness of sin into the light. The words
of doom cried by the angel shattered in an instant his presumptuous
piece<a target="foot" id="fzz0059">&ordm;</a> The wind of the last day blew
through his mind, his sins, the jewel-eyed harlots of his imagination, fled
before the hurricane, squeaking like mice in their terror and huddled under a mane of hair.</p>
<p> As he crossed the square, walking homeward, the light laughter of a girl
reached his burning ears. The frail gay sound smote his heart more strongly than
a trumpet blast, and, not daring to lift his eyes, he turned aside and gazed, as
he walked, into the shadows of the tangled shrubs. Shame rose from
<br><font color="green">{ms, 37}</font>
<br> his smitten heart and flooded his whole being. The image of Emma appeared
before him, and under her eyes the flood of shame rushed forth anew from his
heart. If she knew to what his mind had subjected her or how his brute-like lust
had torn and trampled upon her innocence! Was that boyish love? Was that
chivalry? Was that poetry? The sordid details of his orgies stank under his very
nostrils. The soot-coated packet of pictures which he had hidden in the flue of
the fireplace and in the presence of whose shameless or bashful wantonness he
lay for hours sinning in thought and deed; his monstrous dreams, peopled by
ape-like creatures and by harlots with gleaming jewel eyes; the foul long
letters he had written in the joy of guilty confession and carried secretly for days and days only to
<br><font color="green">{ms, 38}</font>
<br> throw them under cover of night among the grass in the corner of a field or
beneath some hingeless door in some niche in the hedges where a girl might come
upon them as she walked by and read them secretly. Mad! Mad! Was it possible he
had done these things? A cold sweat broke out upon his forehead as the foul memories condensed within his brain.</p>
<p> When the agony of shame had passed from him he tried to raise his soul from
its abject powerlessness. God and the Blessed Virgin were too far from him: God
was too great and stern and the Blessed Virgin too pure and holy. But he
imagined that he stood near Emma in a wide land and, humbly and in tears, bent and kissed the elbow of her sleeve.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 39}</font> </p>
<p> In a wide land under a tender lucid evening sky, a cloud drifting westward
amid a pale green sea of heaven, they stood together, children that had erred.
Their error had offended deeply God&apos;s majesty though it was the error of
two children; but it had not offended her whose beauty &ldquo;is not like
earthly beauty, dangerous to look upon, but like the morning star which is its
emblem, bright and musical.&rdquo; The eyes were not offended which she turned
upon him nor reproachful. She placed their hands together, hand in hand, and said, speaking to their hearts:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Take hands, Stephen and Emma. It is a beautiful evening
now in heaven. You have erred but you are always my children. It is one heart
that loves another heart. Take hands together, my dear children, and you will be
happy together and your hearts will love each other &mdash;</p>
<p> The chapel was flooded by the dull scarlet light that filtered through the lowered
<br><font color="green">{ms, 40}</font>
<br> blinds; and through the fissure between the last blind and the sash a shaft
of wan light entered like a spear and touched the embossed brasses of the
candlesticks upon the altar that gleamed like the battle-worn mail armour of angels.</p>
<p> Rain was falling on the chapel, on the garden, on the college. It would rain
for ever, noiselessly. The water would rise inch by inch, covering the grass and
shrubs, covering the trees and houses, covering the monuments and the mountain
tops. All life would be choked off, noiselessly: birds, men, elephants, pigs,
children: noiselessly floating corpses amid the litter of the wreckage of the
world. Forty days and forty nights the rain would fall till the
<br><font color="green">{ms, 41}</font>
<br> waters had covered the face of the earth.</p>
<p> It might be. Why not?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Hell has enlarged its soul and opened its mouth
without any limits</u> &mdash; words taken, my dear little brothers in Christ
Jesus, from the book of Isaias, fifth chapter, fourteenth verse. In the name of
the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. Amen &mdash;</p>
<p> The preacher took a chainless watch from a pocket within his soutane and,
having considered its dial for a moment in silence, placed it silently before him on the table.</p>
<p> He began to speak in a quiet tone.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Adam and Eve, my dear boys, were, as you
<br><font color="green">{ms, 42}</font>
<br> know, our first parents, and you will remember that they were created by
God in order that the seats in heaven left vacant by the fall of Lucifer and his
rebellious angels might be filled again. Lucifer, we are told, was a son of the
morning, a radiant and mighty angel; yet he fell: he fell and there fell with
him a third part of the host of heaven: he fell and was hurled with his
rebellious angels into hell. What his sin was we cannot say. Theologians
consider that it was the sin of pride, the sinful thought conceived in an
instant: <u>non serviam: I will not serve</u>. That instant was his ruin. He offended the majesty of God by the sinful
<br><font color="green">{ms, 43}</font>
<br> thought of one instant and God cast him out of heaven into hell for ever.</p>
<p> Adam and Eve were then created by God and placed in Eden, that lovely garden
resplendent with sunlight and colour, teeming with luxuriant vegetation. The
fruitful earth gave them her bounty: beasts
are<a target="foot" id="fzz0060">&ordm;</a> birds were their willing servants:
they not the ills our flesh is heir to, disease and poverty and death: all that
a great and generous God could do for them was done. But there was one condition
imposed on them by God: obedience to His word. They were not to eat of the fruit of the forbidden tree.</p>
<p> Alas, my dear little boys, they too fell. The devil, once a shining
<br><font color="green">{ms, 44}</font>
<br> angel, a son of the morning, now a foul fiend came to them in the shape of
a serpent, the subtlest of all the beasts of the field. He envied them. He, the
fallen great one, could not bear to think that man, a being of clay, should
possess the inheritance which he by his sin had forfeited for ever. He came to
the woman, the weaker vessel, and poured the poison of his eloquence into her
ear, promising her (O, the blasphemy of that promise!) that if she and Adam ate
of the forbidden fruit they would become as gods, nay as God Himself. Eve
yielded to the wiles of the archtempter. She ate the apple and gave it also to Adam who had not the moral
<br><font color="green">{ms, 45}</font>
<br> courage to resist her. The poison tongue of Satan had done its work. They fell.</p>
<p> And then the voice of God was heard in that garden, calling His creature man
to account: and Michael, prince of the heavenly host, with a sword of flame in
his hand, appeared before the guilty pair and drove them forth from Eden into
the world, the world of sickness and striving, of cruelty and disappointment, of
labour and hardship, to earn their bread in the sweat of their brow. But even
then how merciful was God! He took<a target="foot" id="fzz0061">&ordm;</a> on
our poor degraded first parents and promised that in the fullness of time He would send down from heaven One who
<br><font color="green">{ms, 46}</font>
<br> would redeem them, make them once more children of God and heirs to the
kingdom of heaven: and that One, that Redeemer of fallen man, was to be
God&apos;s only begotten Son, the Second Person of the Most Blessed Trinity, the Eternal Word.</p>
<p> He came. He was born of a virgin pure, Mary the virgin mother. He was born
in a poor cowhouse in Judea and lived as a humble carpenter for thirty years
until the hour of His mission had come. And then, filled with love for men, He
went forth and called to men to hear the new gospel.</p>
<p> Did they listen? Yes, they listened but would not hear. He was seized and
bound like a common criminal, mocked at as a
<br><font color="green">{ms, 47}</font>
<br> fool, set aside to give place to a public robber, scourged with five
thousand lashes, crowned with a crown of thorns, hustled through the streets by
the jewish rabble and the Roman soldiery, stripped of his garments and hanged
upon a gibbet and His side was pierced with a lance and from the wounded body of
our Lord water and blood issued continually.</p>
<p> Yet even then, in that hour of supreme agony, Our Merciful Redeemer had pity
for mankind. Yet even there, on the hill of Calvary, He founded the holy
catholic church against which, it is promised, the gates of hell shall not
prevail. He founded<a target="foot" id="fzz0062">&ordm;</a> upon the rock of
ages, and endowed it with His grace, with sacraments and
<br><font color="green">{ms, 48}</font>
<br> sacrifice, and promised that if men would obey the word of His church they
would still enter into eternal life; but if, after all that had been done for
them, they still persisted in their wickedness, there remained for them an eternity of torment: hell &mdash;</p>
<p> The preacher&apos;s voice sank. He paused, joined his palms for an instant, parted them. Then he resumed:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Now let us try for a moment to realise, as far as we can,
the nature of that abode of the damned which the justice of an offended God has
called into existence for the eternal punishment of sinners. Hell
is<a target="foot" id="fzz0063">&ordm;</a> strait and dark and foul-smelling
prison, an abode of demons and lost souls, filled with fire and smoke. The straitness of this prison-house is
<br><font color="green">{ms, 49}</font>
<br> expressly designed by God to punish those who refused to be bound by His
laws. In earthly prisons the poor captive has at least some liberty of movement,
were it only within the four walls of his cell or in the gloomy yard of his
prison. Not so in hell. There, by reason of the great number of the damned, the
prisoners are heaped together in their awful prison, the walls of which are said
to be four thousand miles thick: and the damned are so utterly bound and
helpless that, as a blessed saint, saint Anselm, writes in his book on
similitudes, they are not even able to remove from the eye a worm that gnaws it.</p>
<p> They lie in exterior darkness. For, remember, the fire of hell gives forth
no light. As, at the command of God, the fire of the Babylonian furnace lost its heat but not its light so
<br><font color="green">{ms, 50}</font>
<br> at the command of God, the fire of hell, while retaining the intensity of
its heat, burns eternally in darkness. It is a never ending storm of darkness,
dark flames and dark smoke of burning brimstone, amid which the bodies are
heaped one upon another without even a glimpse of air. Of all the plagues with
which the land of the Pharaohs were smitten one plague alone, that of darkness,
was called horrible. What name, then, shall we give to the darkness of hell
which is to last not for three days alone but for all eternity.</p>
<p> The horror of this strait and dark prison is increased by its awful stench.
All the filth of the world, all the offal and scum of the world, we are told,
shall run there as to a vast reeking sewer when
<br><font color="green">{ms, 51}</font>
<br> the terrible conflagration of the last day has purged the world. The
brimstone, too, which burns there in such prodigious quantity fills all hell
with its intolerable stench; and the bodies of the damned themselves exhale such
a pestilential odour that, as saint Bonaventure says, one of them alone would
suffice to infect the whole world. The very air of this world, that pure
element, becomes foul and unbreathable when it has been long enclosed. Consider
then what must be the foulness of the air of hell. Imagine some foul and putrid
corpse that has lain rotting and decomposing in the grave, a jelly-like mass of
liquid corruption. Imagine such a corpse a prey to flames, devoured by the fire of burning brimstone and giving
<br><font color="green">{ms, 52}</font>
<br> off dense choking fumes of nauseous loathsome decomposition. And then
imagine this sickening stench, multiplied a millionfold and a millionfold again
from the millions upon millions of fetid carcasses massed together in the
reeking darkness, a huge and rotting human fungus. Imagine all this, and you
will have some idea of the horror of the stench of hell.</p>
<p> But this stench is not, horrible though it is, the greatest physical torment
to which the damned are subjected. The torment of fire is the greatest torment
to which the tyrant has ever subjected his fellow creatures. Place your finger
for a moment in the flame of a candle and you will feel
<br><font color="green">{ms, 53}</font>
<br> the pain of fire. But our earthly fire was created by God for the benefit
of man, to maintain in him the spark of life and to help him in the useful arts,
whereas the fire of hell is of another quality and was created by God to torture
and punish the unrepentant sinner. Our earthly fire also consumes more or less
rapidly according as the object which it attacks is more or less combustible, so
that human ingenuity has even succeeded in inventing chemical preparations to
check or frustrate its action. But the sulphurous brimstone which burns in hell
is a substance which is specially designed to burn for ever and for ever with
<br><font color="green">{ms, 54}</font>
<br> unspeakable fury. Moreover, our earthly fire destroys at the same time as
it burns, so that the more intense it is the shorter is its duration; but the
fire of hell has this property, that it preserves that which it burns, and,
though it rages with incredible intensity, it rages for ever.</p>
<p> Our earthly fire again, no matter how fierce or widespread it may be, is
always of a limited extent; but the lake of fire in hell is boundless, shoreless
and bottomless. It is on record that the devil himself, when asked the question
by a certain soldier, was obliged to confess that if a whole mountain were
thrown into the burning ocean of hell it would be
<br><font color="green">{ms, 55}</font>
<br> burned up in an instant like a piece of wax. And this terrible fire will
not afflict the bodies of the damned only from without, but each lost soul will
be a hell unto itself, the boundless fire raging in its very vitals. O, how
terrible is the lot of those wretched beings! The blood seethes and boils in the
veins, the brains are boiling in the skull, the heart in the breast glowing and
bursting, the bowels a red-hot mass of burning pulp, the tender eyes flaming like molten balls.</p>
<p> And yet what I have said as to the strength and quality and boundlessness of
this fire is as nothing when compared to its
<br><font color="green">{ms, 56}</font>
<br> intensity, an intensity which it has as being the instrument chosen by
divine design for the punishment of soul and body alike. It is a fire which
proceeds directly from the ire of God, working not of its own activity but as an
instrument of Divine vengeance. As the waters of baptism cleanse the soul with
the body, so do the fires of punishment torture the spirit with the flesh. Every
sense of the flesh is tortured and every faculty of the soul therewith: the eyes
with impenetrable utter darkness, the nose with noisome odours, the ears with
yells and howls and execrations, the taste with foul matter, leprous corruption, nameless
<br><font color="green">{ms, 57}</font>
<br> suffocating filth, the touch with redhot goads and spikes, with cruel
tongues of flame. And through the several torments of the senses the immortal
soul is tortured eternally in its very essence amid the leagues
upon<a target="foot" id="fzz0064">&ordm;</a> of glowing fires kindled in the
abyss by the offended majesty of the Omnipotent God and fanned into everlasting
and ever increasing fury by the breath of the anger of the Godhead.</p>
<p> Consider finally that the torment of this infernal prison is increased by
the company of the damned themselves. Evil company on earth is so noxious that
the plants, as if by instinct, withdraw from the company of
<br><font color="green">{ms, 58}</font>
<br> of<a target="foot" id="fzz0065">&ordm;</a> whatsoever is deadly or hurtful
to them. In hell all laws are overturned: there is no thought of family or
country, of ties or relationship. The damned howl and scream at one another,
their torture and rage intensified by the presence of beings tortured and raging
like themselves. All sense of humanity is forgotten. The yells of the suffering
sinners fill the remotest corners of the vast abyss. The mouths of the damned
are full of blasphemies against God and of hatred for their fellow sufferers and
of curses against those souls which were their accomplices in sin. In olden
times it was the custom to punish the parricide, the man who had raised
<br><font color="green">{ms, 59}</font>
<br> his murderous hand against his father, by casting him into the depths of
the sea in a sack in which were placed a cock, a monkey, and a serpent. The
intention of those law-givers who framed such a law, which seems cruel in our
times, was to punish the criminal by the company of hurtful and hateful beasts.
But what is the fury of those dumb beasts compared with the fury of execration
which bursts from the parched lips and aching throats of the damned in hell when
they behold in their companions in misery those who aided and abetted them in
sin, those whose words sowed the first seeds of evil thinking and evil living in their minds,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 60}</font>
<br> those whose immodest suggestions led them on to sin, those whose eyes
tempted and allured them from the path of virtue. They turn upon those
accomplices and upbraid them and curse them. But they are helpless and hopeless: it is too late now for repentance.</p>
<p> Last of all consider the frightful torment to those damned souls, tempters
and tempted alike, of the company of the devils. These devils will afflict the
damned in two ways, by their presence and by their reproaches. We can have no
idea of how horrible these devils are. Saint Catherine of Siena once saw a devil
and she has written that, rather than look again for one single instant on such a frightful
<br><font color="green">{ms, 61}</font>
<br> monster, she would prefer to walk until the end of her life along a track
of red coals. These devils, who were once beautiful angels, have become as
hideous and ugly as they once were beautiful. They mock and jeer at the lost
souls whom they dragged down to ruin. It is they, the foul demons, who are made
in hell the voices of conscience. Why did you sin? Why did you lend an ear to
the temptings of friends? Why did you turn aside from your pious practices and
good works? Why did you not shun the occasions of sin? Why did you not leave
that evil companion? Why did you not give up that lewd
<br><font color="green">{ms, 62}</font>
<br> habit, that impure habit? Why did you not listen to the counsels of your
confessor? Why did you not, even after you had fallen the first or the second or
the third or the fourth or the hundredth time, repent of your evil ways and turn
to God who only waited for your repentance to absolve you of your sins? Now the
time for repentance has gone by. Time is, time was, but time shall be no more!
Time was to sin in secrecy, to indulge in that sloth and pride, to covet the
unlawful, to yield to the promptings of your lower nature, to live like the
beasts of the field, nay worse than the beasts of the field, for they, at
<br><font color="green">{ms, 63}</font>
<br> least, are but brutes and have no reason to guide them: time was, but time
shall be no more. God spoke to you by so many voices, but you would not hear.
You would not crush out that pride and anger in your heart, you would not
restore those ill-gotten goods, you would not obey the precepts of your holy
church nor attend to your religious duties, you would not abandon those wicked
companions, you would not avoid those dangerous temptations. Such is the
language of those fiendish tormentors, words of taunting and of reproach, of
hatred and of disgust. Of disgust, yes! For even they, the very devils, when they sinned, sinned by such a sin as alone
<br><font color="green">{ms, 64}</font>
<br> was compatible with such angelical natures, a rebellion of the intellect:
and they, even they, the foul devils must turn away, revolted and disgusted,
from the contemplation of those unspeakable sins by which degraded man outrages
and defiles the temple of the Holy Ghost, defiles and pollutes himself.</p>
