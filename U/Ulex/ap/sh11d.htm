nations. They were held out to say: We are alone &mdash; come: and the voices
said with them: We are your people: and the air grew thick with their company as
they called to him, their kinsman, making ready to go, shaking the wings of
their exultant and terrible youth.</a><a target="foot" id="fyz0001">&ordm;</a></p>
<p class="SpPar">[CHAPTER XIV part 2: adolescence (adulescentia)]</p>
<p class="SpPar">From the Broadstone to Mullingar is a journey of some fifty
miles across the midlands of Ireland. Mullingar, the chief town of Westmeath, is
the midland capital and there is a great traffic of peasants and cattle between
it and Dublin. This fifty-mile journey is made by the train in about two hours
and you are therefore to conceive Stephen Daedalus packed in the corner of a
third-class carriage and contributing the thin fumes of his cigarettes to the
already reeking atmosphere. The carriage was inhabited by a company of peasants
nearly every one of whom had a bundle tied in a spotted handkerchief. The
carriage smelt strongly of peasants, (an odour the debasing humanity of which Stephen remembered to have
<br><font color="green">{ms, 478}</font>
<br> perceived in the little chapel of Clongowes on the morning of his first
communion) and indeed so pungently that the youth could not decide whether he
found the odour of sweat
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">unpleasant</span></span>
<font color="black">offensive</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
because the peasant sweat is monstrous or because it did not now proceed from
his own body. He was not ashamed to admit to himself that he found it
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">unpleasant</span></span>
<font color="black">offensive</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
for both of these reasons. The peasants played with blackened edgeless cards
from Broadstone onward and whenever it was time for a peasant to leave the
company he took up his bundle and went out heavily through the door of the
carriage, never closing it behind him. The peasants spoke little and rarely
looked at the scene they passed but
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">at</span></span>
<font color="black">when they came
to</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> Maynooth Station
a gentleman dressed in a frock-coat and tall hat who was giving loud directions
to a porter concerning a case of machines attracted their wondering attention for several minutes.</p>
<p> At Mullingar Stephen took his neat little valise down from the rack and
descended to the platform. When he had passed through the claws
<br><font color="green">{ms, 479}</font>
<br> of the ticket-collectors he paused for a few moments in indecision before
he was sighted by the driver of a small dark-green trap. The driver asked was he

young gentleman</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> for
Mr Fulham and on

<font color="black">Stephen&apos;s</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
answering &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; invited him to climb up beside him on the seat. So
they set off easily. The trap
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">which</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
was not very clean
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">and
it</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> jolted a
good deal and Stephen looked once or twice anxiously at
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the</span></span>
<font color="black">his</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
oscillating valise but the driver said he need have no fear. The driver when he
had said this a few times in the same words fell silent a while and then asked
didn&apos;t Stephen come from Dublin. Re-assured on this point he fell silent
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">against</span></span> again and
began <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">to</span></span> with a
deliberate whip to flick flies off the ill-groomed hide between the shafts.</p>
<p> The trap went up the long crooked main street of the town and crossing over
the bridge of the canal made out for the country. Stephen remarked that the
houses were very small but catching sight of a large square building that stood
in grounds closely walled <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">he asked</span></span>
<br><font color="green">{ms, 480}</font>
<br> he asked the driver what building it was. The driver told him it was the
lunatic asylum and added impressively that there were a great many patients in
it. The road wound through heavy pasture lands and in
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">mea</span></span> field after
field Stephen saw herds of cattle fattening. Sometimes these cattle were in the
charge of a drowsy peasant but oftener they were left to themselves and moved
slowly from marsh to dry land and from dry land to marsh as the will took them.
The little cottages along the road were covered with overblown roses and in many
of the doorways there would stand a woman gazing silently over the flat country.
Now and again a peasant plodding along the road would give the driver the time
of day and if he judged Stephen worthy of the honour fumble at his hat.
Proceeding in this manner along the dusty road the trap gradually drew near Mr Fulham&apos;s house.</p>
<p> It was an old irregular house, barely visible from the road, and surrounded
by a fair plantation. It was reached by an untended drive and the ground behind
it thick with clumps of faded rhododendrons sloped down to the shore
<br><font color="green">{ms, 481}</font>
<br> of Lough Owel. The lodge was a whitewashed cottage at the door of which a
little child in a chemise sat eating a big crust of bread. The gate was open and
the trap turned up the drive. After a circular tour of a few hundred yards the
trap reached the door of the old discoloured house.</p>
<p> As the trap drew up to the door a young woman advanced to meet it with a
quiet dignified gait. She was dressed completely in black and her dark hair was
brushed plainly off her temples. She held out her hand:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Welcome, she said. My uncle is in the orchard. We heard the noise of the wheels &mdash;
<br>Stephen touched her hand slightly and bowed.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Dan, leave that valise in the hall for the present and
you, Mr Daedalus, are to come along with me. I hope you are not fatigued by your
journey: it is so tiresome, travelling &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Not in the least &mdash;
<br>She led the way along the hall and through a little glass door into a great
square orchard, the nearer half of which was
<br><font color="green">{ms, 482}</font>
<br> still a sunny region. Here, screened by a broad straw hat Mr Fulham was
discovered sitting in a basket-chair. He greeted Stephen very warmly and made
the usual polite enquiries. Miss Howard had brought out a little tray containing
fruit and milk and the visitor gladly ate and drank for the dust of the roads
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">was</span></span> had invaded his
throat. Mr Fulham asked a great many questions about Stephen&apos;s studies and
tastes while Miss Howard stood beside his chair in silence. At a pause in the
interrogation she took up the tray and carried it into the house. When she came
back she offered to show Stephen the orchard and, Mr Fulham returning at the
same moment to his newspaper, she led the way down a walk of currant-bushes.
Stephen had found his godfather&apos;s questions a somewhat severe ordeal and he
revenged himself on Miss Howard by a counter-fire of questions concerning the
names and seasons and prospects of her plants. She answered all his questions carefully but with the same air of
<br><font color="green">{ms, 483}</font>
<br> indifferent exactness which marked all her acts. Her presence did not awe
him as it had done when he had last met her and he thought that perhaps the
uncontaminated nature which he had then imagined accusing him was no more than
an unusual dignity of manner. He did not find this dignity of hers very
congenial and his new fervour of youth was vitally piqued by her lack of
animation. He decided in favour of some definite purpose of hers
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">against
the</span></span> <font color="black">and against
a</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> mechanical
discharge of duties and said to himself that it would be an intellectual game
for him to discover it. He set this task to himself all the more readily since
he suspected that this purpose guiding her conduct must be inimical to his
present genial impulses and would probably elude him out of instantaneous
distrust and seek natural safety in flight. This fugitive impulse would be prey
for him and at once he summoned all his faculties to the chase.</p>
<p> Dinner was served at half past
<br><font color="green">{ms, 484}</font>
<br> six in a long plainly-furnished room. The table spread under a tall lamp of
elegant silver-work wore an air of chaste elegance. It was a slight trial on
Stephen&apos;s hunger to accept these cold manners and in the warmth of his
relish for food he condemned this strange attitude of human beings as ungrateful
and unnatural. The conversation was also a little mincing and Stephen heard the
words &lsquo;charming&rsquo; and &lsquo;nice&rsquo; and &lsquo;pretty&rsquo; too
often to find them agreeable. He discovered the weak point in Mr Fulham&apos;s
armour very soon; Mr Fulham, like most of his countrymen, was a persuaded
politician. Most of Mr Fulham&apos;s neighbours were primitive types and he, in
spite of the narrowness of his ideas, was regarded by them as a man of ripe
culture. In a discussion which took place over a game of b&eacute;zique Stephen
heard his godfather explain to a more rustic proprietor the nature of the work
done by the missionary fathers in civilising the Chinese people. He sustained
<br><font color="green">{ms, 485}</font>
<br> the propositions that the Church is also the chief repository of secular
culture and that the tradition of learning must derive from the monks. He saw in
the pride of the Church the only refuge of men against a threatening democracy
and said that Aquinas had anticipated all the discoveries of the modem world.
His neighbour was puzzled to discover the whereabouts of the souls of the
Chinese people in the other life but Mr Fulham left the problem at the door of
God&apos;s mercy. At this stage of the discussion Miss Howard, hitherto silent,
said
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">that</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
there were three kinds of baptism and her statement was accepted as a closure.</p>
<p> Stephen was a long time in doubt as to the motive of his godfather&apos;s
patronage. The second day after his arrival as they were driving back from a
tennis-tournament Mr Fulham said to him.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Isn&apos;t Mr Tate your English professor, Stephen? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, sir &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; His people are Westmeath. We often see him during holiday time. He seems to take a
<br><font color="green">{ms, 486}</font>
<br> great interest in you &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, you know him then? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes. He is laid up at present with a bad knee or I&apos;d
write to him to come over here. Perhaps we may drive over to see him one of
these days &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. He is a very well-read man, Stephen &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, said Stephen &mdash;</p>
<p> Tennis-tournaments, military bands, rustic cricket-matches, little
flower-shows were
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">devised</span></span>
<font color="black">resorted
to</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> for
Stephen&apos;s entertainment. At these functions he remarked that his godfather
was very openly humoured and Miss Howard very respectfully courted and he began
to suspect that there was money somewhere in the background. These
entertainments did not amuse the youth; his manner was so quiet that often he
passed unnoticed and remained unintroduced. Sometimes an officer would send a
glance of impolite inquiry at the cheap-looking white shoes he wore but Stephen
always looked his enemy in the face. After a short trial of eyes the youth could
usually procure a truce. He was surprised to find that Miss Howard discharged her
<br><font color="green">{ms, 487}</font>
<br> social duties with such apparent goodwill. He was displeased and
disappointed to hear her make a pun one day &mdash; a pun which
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">though
it</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> was not very
clever
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">but
caused</span></span>
<font color="black">raised</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
a polite laugh from two scrupulous lieutenants. Mr Fulham was old and honoured
enough to allow himself the luxury of admonishing publicly whenever occasion
arose.
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">When</span></span>
<font color="black">One
day</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> an officer told
a humorous story which was intended to poke fun at countrified ideas
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Mr
Fulham said:</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
<br>
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">&mdash;
Our peasants may be ignorant of many things.</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
<br>The story was this. The officer and a friend found themselves one evening
surprised by a heavy shower far out on the Killucan road and forced to take
refuge in a peasant&apos;s cabin. An old man was seated at the side of the fire
smoking a dirty cutty-pipe which he held upside down in the comer of his mouth.
The old peasant invited his visitors to come near the fire as the evening was
chilly and said he could not stand up to welcome them decently as he had the rheumatics. The officer&apos;s friend
<br><font color="green">{ms, 488}</font>
<br> who was a learned young lady observed a figure scrawled in chalk over the
fireplace and asked what it was. The peasant said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Me grandson Johnny done that the time the circus was in
the town. He seen the pictures on the walls and began pesterin&apos; his mother
for fourpence to see th&apos; elephants. But sure when he got in an&apos; all
divil elephant was in it. But it was him drew that there &mdash;
<br>The young lady laughed and the old man blinked his red eyes at the fire and
went on smoking evenly and talking to himself:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I&apos;ve heard tell them elephants is most natural
things, that they has the notions of a Christian &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;.
I wanse seen meself a picture of niggers riding on wan of &apos;em &mdash; aye
and beating blazes out of &apos;im with a stick. Begorra ye&apos;d have more
trouble with the childre is in it now
<font color="red"><sup><small>|s1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">that</span></span>
<font color="black">than</font><font color="red"><sup><small>s1|</small></sup></font>
with one of thim big fellows &mdash;
<br>The young lady
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">who</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
was much amused began to tell the peasant about the
<br><font color="green">{ms, 489}</font>
<br> animals of prehistoric times. The old man heard her out in silence and then said slowly:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Aw, there must be terrible quare craythurs at the latther ind of the world &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen thought that the officer told this story very well and he joined in
the laugh that followed it. But Mr Fulham was not of his opinion and spoke out
against the moral of the story rather sententiously.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It is easy to laugh at the peasant. He is ignorant of
many things which the world thinks important. But we mustn&apos;t forget at the
same time, Captain Starkie, that the peasant
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">is</span></span>
<font color="black">stands</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
perhaps nearer to the true ideal of a Christian life than many of us who condemn him &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I do not condemn him, answered Captain Starkie, but I am amused &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Our Irish peasantry, continued Mr Fulham with conviction,
is the backbone of the nation &mdash;</p>
<p> Backbone or not, it was in the constant observance of the peasantry that Stephen chiefly delighted. Physically
<br><font color="green">{ms, 490}</font>
<br> they were almost Mongolian types, tall, angular and oblique-eyed. Stephen
whenever he walked behind a peasant always looked first for the prominent
cheek-bones that seemed to cut the air and the peasants in their turn must have
recognised metropolitan features for they stared very hard at the youth as if he
were some rare
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">animals</span></span>
<font color="black">animal</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>.
One day Dan was sent into the town to buy some medicine at the druggist&apos;s
and Stephen went in with him. The trap stopped in the main street before the
druggist&apos;s and Dan handed down the order to a ragged boy telling him to
take it into the shop. The ragged boy first showed the paper to an equally
ragged friend and then went into the shop. When they came out they stood at the
door of the shop gazing alternately from Stephen to the horse&apos;s tail and
back again. While they were thus gazing they were confronted by
<a name="jn0022a" href="../../FF/unbs/jn0all.htm#jn0022a">a lame beggar who advanced toward them gripping his stick:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It was yous called out names after me yestherday &mdash;</p>
<p> The two children huddling in the
<br><font color="green">{ms, 491}</font>
<br> doorway, gazed at him and answered:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, sir &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O yes it was, though &mdash;
<br>The beggar thrust his malign face down at their faces and began moving his stick up and down.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But mind what I&apos;m tellin&apos; you. &nbsp;. D&apos;ye see that stick? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, sir &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, if ye call out after me the next time I&apos;ll cut
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">yous</span></span>
<font color="black">yez</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
open with that stick. I&apos;ll cut the livers out of ye</a> &mdash;
<br>He proceeded to explain himself to the frightened children.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; D&apos;ye hear me now? I&apos;ll cut yez open with that
stick, I&apos;ll cut the livers and the lights out of ye &mdash;</p>
<p> This incident was stolidly admired by a few bystanders who made way for the
beggar as he limped along the footpath. Dan, who had watched the scene from the
trap, now descended to the ground and asking Stephen to look to the horse went
into a very dirty public-house. Stephen sat alone in the car thinking of the beggar&apos;s face. He had never before
<br><font color="green">{ms, 492}</font>
<br> seen such evil expressed in a face. He had sometimes watched the faces of
prefects as they &lsquo;pandied&rsquo; boys with a broad leather bat but those
faces had seemed to him less malicious than stupid, dutifully inflamed faces.
The recollection of the beggar&apos;s sharp eyes struck a fine chord of terror
in the youth and he set himself to whistle away the keen throb of it.</p>
<p> After a few minutes a fat young man with a very red head came out of the
druggist&apos;s shop holding two neat parcels. Stephen recognized Nash and Nash
testified that he recognized
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">Stephen</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
by changing complexion very painfully. Stephen could have enjoyed his old
enemy&apos;s discomfiture had he chosen but disdaining to do so he held out his
hand instead. Nash was junior assistant in the shop and when he learned that
Stephen was on a visit to Mr Fulham his manner was tinged with discreet
respectfulness. Stephen, however, soon put him at his ease and when Dan emerged
from the grimy public-house the two were engaged in familiar chat. Nash
<br><font color="green">{ms, 493}</font>
<br> said Mullingar was the last place God made, a God-forgotten hole, and asked Stephen how he could stick it.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I only wish I was back again in Dublin, that&apos;s all I know &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; How do you amuse yourself
here<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span>? asked Stephen &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Amuse yourself! You can&apos;t. There&apos;s nothing here &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But haven&apos;t you concerts sometimes. The first day I
came here I saw some bills up about a concert &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, that&apos;s off. Father Lohan put the boots on that &mdash; the P.P, you know &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Why did he? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, you better ask him that. He says his parishioners
don&apos;t want comic songs and skirt dances. If they want a decent concert, he
says, they can get one up in the
school-house<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">&mdash;</span></span>.
O, he bosses them, I tell you &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, is that the way? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; They&apos;re afraid of their
<font color="red"><sup><small>|s1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">life</span></span>
<font color="black">lives</font><font color="red"><sup><small>s1|</small></sup></font>
of him. If he hears any dancing in a house at night he raps at the window and pouf! out goes the candle &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; By Jove! &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Fact. You know he has a collection of girls&apos; hats &mdash;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 494}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Girls&apos; hats! &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes. Of an evening when the girls go out walking with the
soldiers he goes out too and any girl he catches hold of he snaps off her hat
and takes it back with him to the priest&apos;s house then if the girl goes to
ask him for it he gives her a proper blowing-up &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Good man! &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. Well, we must be off
now. I suppose I&apos;ll see you again &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Come in tomorrow, will you: it&apos;s a short day. And
I&apos;ll tell you I&apos;ll introduce you to a friend of mine here &mdash; very
decent sort &mdash; on the <u>Examiner</u>. You&apos;ll like him &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Very good. Until then! &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; So long! About two o&apos;clock &mdash;</p>
<p> As they drove home together Stephen asked Dan some questions which Dan
pretended not to hear and when Stephen pressed him for answers he gave the
shortest possible answers. It was plain that he did not care to discuss his
spiritual superior and Stephen had to desist.</p>
<p> That evening at dinner Mr Fulham was in genial spirits and began to address
his conversation pointedly to Stephen. Mr Fulham&apos;s method of
&lsquo;drawing&rsquo; his interlocutor was not a very delicate
<br><font color="green">{ms, 495}</font>
<br> method but Stephen saw what was expected of him
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">and
merely waited till he was directly
addressed</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>. A
neighbour had come to dinner, a Mr Heffernan. Mr Heffernan was
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">not</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
at all of his host&apos;s way of thinking and therefore the evening brought out
some lively disputes. Mr Heffernan&apos;s son was learning Irish because he
believed that the Irish people should speak their own language
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">and</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
not the language of their conquerors.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But the people of the United States who are more
emancipated than Ireland is ever likely to be are content to speak English, said Mr Fulham &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The Americans are different. They have no language to revive &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; For my part I am content with my conquerors &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Because you occupy a good position under them. You are
not a labourer. You enjoy the fruits of Nationalist agitation &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Perhaps you are going to tell me that all men are equal, said Mr Fulham satirically &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; In a sense they may be &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Nonsense, my dear sir. Our
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">country
knows</span></span> <font color="black">countrymen
know</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> nothing of the
Reformation, as they call it, and I hope
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">it</span></span>
<font color="black">they</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
will know nothing of the French Revolution
<br><font color="green">{ms, 496}</font>
<br> either &mdash;
<br>Mr Heffernan returned to the charge.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But surely it is no harm for them to know something about
their country &mdash; its traditions, its local history, its language! &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; For those who have leisure it may be good. But you know I
am a great enemy of disloyal movements. Our lot is thrown in with England &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The young generation is not of your opinion. My son, Pat,
is studying in Clonliffe at present and he tells me all the young students
there, those who are to be our priests afterwards, have these ideas &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The Catholic Church, my dear sir, will never incite to
rebellion. But here is one of the young generation. Let him speak &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I care nothing for these principles of nationalism, said
Stephen. I have enough bodily liberty &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But do you feel no duty to your mother-country, no love for her? asked Mr Heffernan &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Honestly, I don&apos;t &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You live then like an animal without reason! exclaimed Mr Heffernan
<br><font color="green">{ms, 497}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; My own mind, answered Stephen, is more interesting to me than the entire country &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Perhaps you think your mind is more important than Ireland! &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I do, certainly &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; These are strange ideas of your godson&apos;s, Mr Fulham.
May I ask did the Jesuits teach you them &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The Jesuits taught me other things, reading and writing &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And religion also? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Naturally. &ldquo;What doth it profit a man to gain the
whole world if he lose his soul?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Nothing, of course. That is quite so. But humanity has
claims on us. We have a duty to our neighbour. We have received a commandment of charity &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I hear so, said Stephen, at Christmas &mdash;
<br>Mr Fulham laughed at this and Mr Heffernan was stung.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I may not have read as much as you, Mr Fulham, or even as
much as you, young man, but I believe that the noblest love a man can
<br><font color="green">{ms, 498}</font>
<br> have, of course after the love of God, is love of his native land &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Jesus was not of your opinion, Mr Heffernan, said Stephen &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You speak very boldly, young man, said Mr Heffernan reprovingly &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I am not afraid to speak openly, answered Stephen, even of the parish priest &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You use the Holy Name glibly for one so young &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Not in execration. I mean what I
say<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">:
the</span></span><font color="black">.
The</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> ideal presented
to mankind by Jesus is one of self-denial, of purity, and of solitude; the ideal
you present to us is of revenge, of passion and of immersion in worldly affairs &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It seems to me that Stephen is right, said Miss Howard &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I can see, said Mr Fulham,
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">that</span></span>
<font color="black">what</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> these movements tend to &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It is impossible for us all to live the lives of hermits!
exclaimed Mr Heffernan desperately &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; We can combine the two lives by living as a Catholic should, doing
<br><font color="green">{ms, 499}</font>
<br> our duty to God first and then the duties of our station in life, said Mr
Fulham, leaning comfortably on the last phrase.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You can be a patriot, Mr Heffernan, said Stephen, without
accusing those who do not agree with you of irreligion &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I never accused &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Come now, said Mr Fulham genially, we all understand each other &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen had enjoyed this little skirmish: it had been a pastime for him to
turn the guns of orthodoxy upon the orthodox ranks and see how they would stand
the fire. Mr Heffernan seemed to him a typical Irishman of the provinces,
assertive and fearful, sentimental and rancourous, idealist in speech and
realist in conduct. Mr Fulham was harder to understand. His championing of the
Irish peasant was full of zealous patronage, his ardour for the Church was
implicit with his respect for feudal distinctions, and his submission to the
Conquest was only his natural submission to what he regarded as the dispenser of
these distinctions. He would enforce his aristocratic notions in a homely way:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Come now, Mr So and So, you
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black"><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">by</span></span>
buy</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> cattle
<br><font color="green">{ms, 500}</font>
<br> on fair-day in the town? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And you go the racecourse and make a bet or two as you fancy? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I must admit I do &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And you pride yourself on knowing a thing or two about coursing? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I think I do &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Then how can you say there is no aristocracy of breed in
men since you know it exists in animals? &mdash;
<br>Mr Fulham&apos;s pride was the pride of the burgher in the costly burdensome
canopy which he has exerted and loves to sustain. He had affection for the
feudal machinery and desired nothing better than that it should crush him
&mdash; a common wish of the human adorer whether he cast himself under
Juggernaut or pray God
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">with
tears of affection</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
to mortify him or swoon under the hand of his mistress. To the sensitive
inferior his charity would have offered intolerable pain of mind and yet the
giver would use neither the air nor the language of the self-righteous. His
conceptions of human relations
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">would</span></span>
<font color="black">might</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
perhaps have passed for a progressive conception in the ages when the earth was
thought to be scaphoid and had he lived then he might have been reputed the
<br><font color="green">{ms, 501}</font>
<br> most
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">tender-hearted</span></span>
<font color="black">enlightened</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
of slave-owners. As Stephen watched the old man gravely handing his snuff-box to
Mr Heffernan,
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">and the
latter</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> perforce
appeased, inserting a large hand therein
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Stephen</span></span>
<font color="black">he</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
thought <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">to</span></span>:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; My godfather is the Papal ambassador to Westmeath &mdash;</p>
<p> Nash was waiting for him at the door of the shop and they walked down the
main street together towards the <u>Examiner</u> office. In the window

could be seen over a dirty brown blind and his intelligent eyes were the only
signs of life in the office. Mr Garvey was sent for and presently sent in word
that his two visitors were to come into the <u>Greville Arms</u>. Mr Garvey was
found sitting at the bar with his hat pushed far back from a glow- ing forehead.
He was &ldquo;chaffing&rdquo; the barmaid but when his visitors entered he stood
up and shook hands with them. Then he insisted on their joining him in a drink.
The barmaid was &ldquo;chaffed&rdquo; again by Mr Garvey and by Nash but always
within limits. She was a genteel young person of a very
<br><font color="green">{ms, 502}</font>
<br> tempting figure. While she was polishing glasses she indulged in flirty,
gossipy conversation with the young men: She seemed to have the life of the town
at her fingers&apos; ends. She reproved Mr Garvey once or twice for levity and
asked Stephen wasn&apos;t it a shame for a married man. Stephen said it was and
began to count the buttons of her blouse. The barmaid said Stephen was a nice
sensible young man not a gadabout fellow and smiled very sweetly over her brisk
napkin. After a while the young men left the bar, first touching the fingertips
of the barmaid and raising their hats.</p>
<p> Mr Garvey whistled the terrier out of the office and they set off for a
walk. Mr Garvey wore heavy boots and he plodded along sturdily in them, tapping
the road with his stick. The road and the actual sultry day had made him
sensible and he gave the younger men some sound advice.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;

Now I&apos;ve a good house, said Mr Garvey, and &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. I go
home in the evening and if I want a drink &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. well, I can
have it. My advice to every young fellow that can afford it is: marry young</a> &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; There&apos;s something in that, said Nash, when you&apos;ve had your fling, that is &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, yes, said Mr Garvey. By the bye I hope you&apos;ll
come and see me some evening and bring your friend. You&apos;ll come, Mr
Daedalus? The missus&apos;ll be glad to see you: she plays a bit, you know &mdash;
<br>Stephen mumbled his thanks and decided that he would endure severe bodily pain rather than visit Mr Garvey.</p>
<p> Mr Garvey began then to tell some press stories. When he heard from Nash
that Stephen was inclined for writing he said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You take my tip: shorthand &mdash;</p>
<p> He told many stories illustrating his own smartness at his business and said
that he had once got a &lsquo;par&rsquo; into a London morning
<br><font color="green">{ms, 504}</font>
<br> paper and got paid well for it by return of post.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; These English chaps, you know, they know how to do business. Pay good money too &mdash;
<br>The day was very hot and the town seemed dozing in the heat but when the
young men came to the canal bridge they noticed a crowd collected some fifty
yards off on the canal bank. A butcher&apos;s boy was telling a circle of workmen about it.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I seen her first. I noticed something &mdash; a
long-looking green thing lying among the weeds and I went for Joe Coghlan. Him
and me tried to get it up but it was too heavy. So then what did we do but I
thought if we could only get the lend of a pole off someone. So Joe and me,
then, went down to the back of Slater&apos;s yard &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &mdash;
<br>A pace or two from the brink of the water a thing was lying on the bank
partly covered by a brown sack. It was the body of a woman: the face was to the
ground and from the thick black hair a pool of water had oozed out. The body was curved upwards
<br><font color="green">{ms, 505}</font>
<br> with legs abroad but over the
<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">unread</span></font>
someone had drawn down the
<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">unread</span></font>
nightdress. The woman had
esca<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps"><sub>unread</sub></span></font>

many criticisms of the nurses.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It&apos;d be fitter for &apos;em mind the patients than
traipsing about with every Tom, Dick and Harry of a doctor &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It&apos;s them has the style &mdash;</p>
<p> Mr Garvey&apos;s dog wanted to sniff the body but Mr Garvey kicked him
heavily and the dog curled up yelping. Then there was silence for some time,
everyone remaining at his post watching the corpse, until a voice said
&lsquo;Here&apos;s the doctor&rsquo;. A stout well-dressed man came down the
path quickly without acknowledging the salutes of the people and after a few
moments Stephen heard him
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">say</span></span>
<font color="black">saying</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
the woman was dead and telling the people to get a cart and have the body taken
away. The three young men then continued their walk but Stephen had to be waited
for and called to. He remained behind gazing into the canal near the feet of the
body, looking at a fragment of paper on which was
<br><font color="green">{ms, 506}</font>
<br> printed: The Lamp, a
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">mazi</span></span> magazine for
&nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. The rest was torn away and several other pieces of paper were floating about in the water.</p>
<p> The afternoon was well advanced before the young men separated. Stephen bade
his friends goodbye, promising to renew acquaintance very soon, and took a path
through the fields. The ground was very treacherous and he slipped often into
bog-water. However he found a broad highway over the bog and here he was as
secure as on the road. The sun was declining and against the deep gold of the
western sky the figures of some bending turf-cutters were outlined. He reached
Mr Fulham&apos;s house by a back road and climbing over the fence came up
through a little wood. As he walked on the soft grass he made no noise. At the
edge of the wood he stood still. Miss Howard was leaning on the high painted
gate facing the sunset. The full glow of the sunset had covered her sombre
vesture with streaks of rust and scattered spangles of rust upon her sombre
hair. Stephen came towards her but when he was a few paces<a target="foot" id="fyz0002">&ordm;</a>
<br><font color="green">{ms, 507}</font> </p>
<p class="flush">[MS SHEETS 507 to 518 ARE MISSING]

<br> anyone spoke to him mingled a too polite disbelief with its expectancy. His
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">stiff</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
coarse brownish hair was combed high off his forehead but there was little order
in its arrangement. <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">The

of the face the eyes were not prominent: they were small light blue eyes which
checked advances. They were quite fresh and fearless but in spite of this the
face was to a certain extent the face of a debauchee.</p>
<p> The president of the college was a sequestrated person who took the chairs
at reunions and inaugural meetings of societies. His visible lieutenants were a
dean and a bursar. The bursar, Stephen thought fitted his title: a heavy, florid
man with a black-grey cap<a target="foot" id="fyz0003">&ordm;</a> of hair. He performed his duties
<br><font color="green">{ms, 520}</font>
<br> with great unction
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">and
was</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> often to be seen
looming in the hall watching the coming and going of the students. He insisted
on punctuality: a minute or so late once or twice &mdash; he would not mind that
so much; he would clap his hands and make some cheery reproof. But what made him
severe was a few minutes lost every day: it disturbed the proper working of the
classes. Stephen was
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">nearly</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
always more than a quarter of an hour late and
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">so</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
when he arrived the bursar had usually gone back to his office. One morning,
however, he arrived at the school earlier than usual. Walking up the stone steps
before him was a fat
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">young</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
student, a very hard-working, timorous young man with a bread-and-jam
complexion. The bursar was standing in the hall with his arms folded across
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the</span></span>
<font color="black">his</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
chest and when he caught sight of the fat young man he looked significantly
<br><font color="green">{ms, 521}</font>
<br> at the clock. It was eight minutes past eleven.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Now then, Moloney, you know this won&apos;t do. Eight
minutes late! Disturbing your class like that &mdash; we can&apos;t have that,
you know. Must be in sharp for lecture every morning in future &mdash;</p>
<p> The jam overspread the bread in Moloney&apos;s face as he stumbled over some
excuses about a clock being wrong and then scurried upstairs to his class.
Stephen delayed a little
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">while</span></span>
<font color="black">time</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
hanging up his overcoat while the large priest eyed him solemnly. Then he turned
his head quietly towards the bursar and said</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Fine morning, sir &mdash;</p>
<p> The bursar at once clapped his hands and rubbed them together and clapped
them together again. The beauty of the morning and the appositeness of the
remark both struck him at the same time and he answered cheerily:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Beautiful! Fine bracing morning
<br><font color="green">{ms, 522}</font>
<br> now! and he fell to rubbing his hands again &mdash;</p>
<p> One morning <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">he</span></span>
Stephen arrived three quarters of an hour late and he thought it his decenter
plan to wait till the French lecture
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">should
begin</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>. As he was
leaning over the banisters, waiting for the twelve o&apos;clock bell to ring a
young man began to ascend the winding-stairs slowly. At a few steps from the
landing he halted and turned a square rustic face towards Stephen.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is this the way to the Matriculation class, if you
please, he asked in a brogue accenting the first syllable of Matriculation &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen directed him and the two young men began to talk. The new student
was named Madden and came from the county of Limerick. His manner without being
exactly diffident was a little scared and he seemed grateful for Stephen&apos;s attentions. After the French lecture
<br><font color="green">{ms, 523}</font>
<br> the two walked across the Green together and Stephen brought the newcomer
into the National Library. Madden took off his hat at the turnstile and
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext"><font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">unread</span></font></span></span>
as he leaned on the counter to fill up the docket for his book Stephen remarked the peasant strength of his jaws.</p>
<p> The dean of the college was professor of English, Father Butt. He was
reputed the most able man in the college: he was a philosopher and a scholar. He
had read a series of papers at a total abstinence club to prove that Shakespeare
was a Roman Catholic: he had also written against another Jesuit father who had
very late in life been converted to
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">the</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
Baconian theory of the authorship of the plays. Father Butt had always his hands
full of papers and his soutane very soiled with chalk. He was an elderly
greyhound of a man and his vocal ligaments, like his garb, seemed to be coated
with chalk. He had a plausible manner with everyone and was particularly
<br><font color="green">{ms, 524}</font> </p>
<p class="spfl">[MISSING SHEET]
<br><font color="green">{ms, 525}</font> </p>
<p class="spfl">[MISSING SHEET]
<br><font color="green">{ms, 526}</font> </p>
<p class="flush">of verse are the first conditions which the words must submit
to, the rhythm is the esthetic result of the senses, values and relations of the
words thus conditioned. The beauty of verse consisted as much in the concealment
as in the revelation of construction but it certainly could not proceed from
only one of these. For this reason he found Father&apos;s Butt&apos;s reading of
verse and a schoolgirls&apos; accurate reading of verse intolerable. Verse to be
read according to its rhythm should be read according to the stresses; that is,
neither strictly according to the feet nor yet with complete disregard of them.
All this theory he set himself to explain to Maurice and Maurice, when he had
understood the meanings of the terms and had put these meanings carefully
together, agreed that Stephen&apos;s theory was the right one. There was only
one possible way of rendering the first quatrain of Byron&apos;s poem:</p>
<p class="set">My d&aacute;ys are in the y&eacute;llow l&eacute;af</p>
<p>
<br><font color="green">{ms, 527}</font> </p>
<p class="set">The flowers and fr&uacute;its of l&oacute;ve are g&oacute;ne
<br> The w&oacute;rm, the c&aacute;nker and the gr&iexcl;ef
<br> Are m&iacute;ne alone.</p>
<p class="flush">The two brothers tried this theory on all the verse they could
remember and it yielded wonderful results. Soon Stephen began to explore the
language for himself and to choose, and thereby rescue once for all, the words
and phrases most amenable to his theory. He became a poet with malice
aforethought.<a target="foot" id="fyz0004">&ordm;</a></p>
<p> He was at once captivated by the seeming eccentricities of the prose of
Freeman and William Morris. He read them as one would read a thesaurus and made
a garner of<a target="foot" id="fyz0005">&ordm;</a> words. He read Skeat&apos;s
Etymological Dictionary by the hour and his mind, which had from the first been
only too submissive to the infant sense of wonder, was often hypnotised by the
most commonplace conversation. People seemed to him strangely ignorant of the
value of the words they used so glibly. And pace by pace as this indignity of
life forced itself upon him he became enamoured
<br><font color="green">{ms, 528}</font>
<br> of an idealising, a more veritably human tradition. The phenomenon seemed:
to him a grave one and he began to see that people had leagued themselves
together in a conspiracy of ignobility and that Destiny had scornfully reduced
her prices for them. He desired no such reduction for himself and preferred to serve her on the ancient terms.</p>
<p> There was a special class for English composition and it was in this class
that Stephen first made his name. The English essay was for him the one serious
work of the week. His essay was usually very long and the professor, who was a
leader-writer on the <u>Freeman&apos;s Journal</u>, always kept it for the last.
Stephen&apos;s style of writing,
<font color="red"><sup><small>|s1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">that</span></span>
<font color="black">though</font><font color="red"><sup><small>s1|</small></sup></font>
it was over affectionate towards the antique and even the obsolete and too
easily rhetorical, was remarkable for a certain crude originality of expression.
He gave himself no great trouble to sustain the boldnesses which were expressed or implied in his essays.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 529}</font>
<br> He threw them out as sudden defence-works while he was busy constructing
<a name="pn1002d" href="../../FF/unbs/pn1all.htm#pn1002d">the enigma of a
manner</a>. For the youth had been apprised of another crisis and he wished to
make ready for the shock of it. On account of such manoeuvres he came to be
regarded as a very unequilibrated
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">youth</span></span> young man who
took more interest than young men usually take in theories which might be
permitted as pastimes. Father Butt, to whom the emergence of these unusual
qualities had been duly reported, spoke one day to Stephen with the purpose of
&lsquo;sounding&rsquo; him. Father Butt expressed a great admiration for
Stephen&apos;s essays all of which, he said, the professor of English
composition had shown him. He encouraged the youth and suggested that in a short
time perhaps he might contribute something to one of the Dublin papers or
magazines. Stephen found this encouragement kindly meant but mistaken and he launched forth into a copious
<br><font color="green">{ms, 530}</font>
<br> explanation of his theories. Father Butt listened and, even more readily
than <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Stephen</span></span> Maurice
had done, agreed with them all. Stephen laid down his doctrine very positively
and insisted on the importance of what he called the literary tradition. Words,
he said, have a certain value in the literary tradition and a certain value in
the market-place &mdash; a debased
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">value:
words</span></span> <font color="black">value.
Words</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> are simply
receptacles for human thought: in the literary tradition they receive more
valuable thoughts than they receive in the market-place. Father
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">Butt</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
listened to all this, rubbing his chalky hand often over his
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">he</span></span> chin and nodding
his head and said that Stephen evidently understood the importance of tradition.
Stephen quoted a phrase from Newman to illustrate his theory.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; In that sentence of Newman&apos;s, he said, the word is
used according to the literary tradition: it has there its full value. In ordinary
<br><font color="green">{ms, 531}</font>
<br> use, that is, in the market-place, it has a different value altogether, a
debased value. &ldquo;I hope I&apos;m not detaining you&rdquo; &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Not at all<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">!</span></span>, not at all! &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, no &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, yes, Mr Daedalus, I see &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. I
quite see your point. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. detain &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p> The very morning after this Father Butt returned Stephen&apos;s monologue in
kind. It was a raw nipping morning and when Stephen, who had arrived too late
for the Latin lecture, strolled into the Physics Theatre he discovered Father
Butt kneeling on the hearthstone engaged in lighting a small fire in the huge
grate. He was making neat wisps of paper and carefully disposing them among the
coals and sticks. All the while he kept up a little patter explaining his
operations and at a crisis he produced from the most remote pockets of his
chalkey soutane three dirty candle-butts. These he thrust in different openings and then looked up at
<br><font color="green">{ms, 532}</font>
<br> Stephen with an air of triumph. He set a match to a few projecting pieces
of paper and in a few minutes the coals had caught.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; There is an art, Mr Daedalus, in lighting a fire &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; So I see, sir. A very useful art &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That&apos;s it: a useful art.
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">We
have</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> The useful arts and we have the liberal arts &mdash;
<br>Father Butt after this statement got up from the hearthstone and went away
about some other business leaving Stephen to watch the kindling fire: and
Stephen brooded upon the fast melting candle-butts and on the reproach of the
priest&apos;s manner till it was time for the Physics lecture to begin.</p>
<p> The problem could not be solved out of hand but the artistic part of it at
least presented no difficulties. In reading through &lsquo;Twelfth Night&rsquo;
for the class Father Butt skipped the two songs of the clown without a word and
when Stephen, determined on forcing them on his attention, asked very gravely whether they
<br><font color="green">{ms, 533}</font>
<br> were to be learned by heart or not Father Butt said it was improbable such a question would be on the paper:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The clown sings these songs for the duke. It was a custom
at that time for noblemen to have clowns to sing to them. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. for amusement &mdash;</p>
<p> He took &lsquo;Othello&rsquo; more seriously and made the class take a note
of the moral of the play: an object lesson in the passion of jealousy.
Shakespeare, he said, had sounded the depths of human nature: his plays show us
men and women under the influence of various passions and they show us the moral
result of these passions. We see the conflict of these human passions and our
own passions are purified by the spectacle. The dramas of Shakespeare have a
distinct moral force and &lsquo;Othello&rsquo; is one of the greatest of
tragedies. Stephen trained
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">him</span></span>
<font color="black">himself</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
to hear all this out without moving hand or foot but at the same time he was
amused to learn that <a name="pn1005a" href="../../FF/unbs/pn1all.htm#pn1005a">the president had refused to allow
<br><font color="green">{ms, 534}</font>
<br> two of the boarders to go to a performance of &lsquo;Othello&rsquo; at the
Gaiety Theatre on the ground that there were many coarse expressions in the
play</a>.<a target="foot" id="fyz0006">&ordm;</a></p>
<p> The monster in Stephen had lately taken to misbehaving himself and on the
least provocation was ready for bloodshed. Almost every incident of the day was
a goad for him and the intellect had great trouble keeping him within bounds.
But the episode of religious fervour which was fast becoming a memory had
resulted in a certain outward self-control which was now found to be very
useful. Besides this Stephen was quick enough to see that he must disentangle
his affairs in secrecy and reserve had ever been a light penance for him. His
reluctance to debate scandal, to seem impolitely curious of others, aided him in
his real indictment and was not without a satisfactory flavour of the heroic.
Already while that fever-fit of holiness lay
<br><font color="green">{ms, 535}</font>
<br> upon him he had encountered but out of charity had declined to penetrate
disillusioning forces. These shocks had driven him from breathless flights of
zeal shamefully inwards and the most that devotional exercises could do for him
was to soothe him. This soothing he badly needed for he suffered greatly from
contact with his new environment. He hardly spoke to his colleagues and
performed the business of the class without remark or interest. Every morning he
rose and came down to breakfast. After breakfast he took the tram for town,
settling himself on the front seat outside with his face to the wind. He got
down off the tram at Amiens St Station instead of going on to the Pillar because
he wished to partake in the morning life of the city. This morning walk was
pleasant for him and there was no face that passed him on its way to its
commercial prison but he strove to pierce to the motive centre of its ugliness.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 536}</font>
<br> It was always with a feeling of displeasure that he entered the Green and
saw on the far side the gloomy building of the College.</p>
<p> As he walked thus through the ways of the city he had his ears and eyes ever
prompt to receive impressions. It was not only in Skeat that he found words for
his treasure-house, he found them also at haphazard in the shops, on
advertisements, in the mouths of the plodding public. He kept repeating them to
himself till they lost all instantaneous meaning for him and became wonderful
vocables. He was determined to fight with every energy of soul and body against
any possible consignment to what he now regarded as the hell of hells &mdash;
the region, otherwise expressed, wherein everything is found to be obvious
&mdash; and the saint who formerly was chary of
speech<a target="foot" id="fyz0007">&ordm;</a> in obedience to a commandment
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">of
silence</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> could just
be recognised in the artist who schooled himself to silence lest words should return him his discourtesy.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 537}</font>
<br> Phrases came to him asking to have themselves explained. He said to
himself: I must wait for the Eucharist to come to me: and then he set about
translating the phrase into common sense. He spent days and nights hammering
noisily as he built a house of silence for himself wherein he might await his
Eucharist, days and nights gathering the first fruits and every peace-offering
and heaping
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">them</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
upon his altar whereon he prayed clamorously the burning token of satisfaction
might descend. In class, in the hushed library, in the company of other students
he would suddenly hear a command to begone, to be alone, a voice agitating the
very tympanum of his ear, a flame leaping into divine cerebral life. He would
obey the command and wander up and down the streets alone, the fervour of his
hope sustained by ejaculations until he felt sure that it was useless to wander any more:
<br><font color="green">{ms, 538}</font>
<br> and then he would return home with a deliberate, unflagging step piecing
together meaningless words and phrases with deliberate unflagging seriousness.<a target="foot" id="fyz0008">&ordm;</a>

are hardly more scrupulous solitaries during the ballot for Christ&apos;s vicar
than was Stephen at this time. He wrote a great deal of verse and, in default of
any better contrivance, his
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">se</span></span> verse allowed him
to combine the offices of penitent and confessor. He sought in his verses to fix
the most elusive of his moods and he put his lines together not word by word but
letter by letter. He read Blake and Rimbaud on the values of letters and even
permuted and combined the five vowels to construct cries for primitive emotions.
To none of his former fervours had he given himself with such a whole heart as
to this fervour; the monk now seemed to him no more than half the artist. He
persuaded himself that it is necessary for an artist to labour incessantly at
his art if he wishes to express completely even the simplest conception and he
believed that every moment of inspiration must be paid for in advance. He was
not convinced of the truth of the saying
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext"><u>Poeta
nascitur, non fit</u></span></span> <font color="black">&ldquo;The poet is born,
not made&rdquo;</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> but
he was quite sure of the truth of this at least:
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext"><u>Poema</u></span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
<br><font color="green">{ms, 540}</font>
<br>
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext"><u>fit,
non nascitur</u></span></span> <font color="black">&ldquo;The poem is made, not
born&rdquo;</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>. The
burgher notion of the poet Byron in undress pouring out verses
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">like</span></span> just as a city
fountain pours out water seemed to him characteristic of most popular judgments
on esthetic matters and he combated the notion at its root by saying solemnly to
Maurice &mdash; Isolation is the first principle of artistic economy.</p>
<p> Stephen did not attach himself to art in any spirit of youthful dilettantism
but strove to pierce to the
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">significant</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
heart of everything. He doubled backwards into the past of humanity and caught
glimpses of emergent art as one might have a vision of the pleisiosauros
emerging from his ocean of slime. He seemed almost to hear the simple cries of
fear and joy and wonder which are antecedent to all song, the savage rhythms of
men pulling at the oar,<a target="foot" id="fyz0009">&ordm;</a>
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">to
see</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> the rude scrawls
and the portable gods of men whose legacy Leonardo and Michelangelo inherit. And
over all this chaos of history and legend, of fact and supposition, he strove to
draw out a line of order, to reduce the abysses of the
<br><font color="green">{ms, 541}</font>
<br> past to order by a diagram. The treatises which were recommended to him he
found valueless and trifling; the Laocoon of Lessing irritated him. He wondered
how the world could accept as valuable contributions such
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">unread</span></span> fanciful
generalisations. What finer certitude could be attained by the artist if he
believed that ancient art was plastic and that modern art was pictorial &mdash;
ancient art in this context meaning art between the Balkans and the Morea and
modern art meaning art
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">anywhere</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
between the Caucasus and the Atlantic except in the sacrosanct region. A great
contempt devoured him for the critics who considered &ldquo;Greek&rdquo; and
&ldquo;classical&rdquo; interchangeable terms and so full was he of intemperate
anger that
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1|a</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext"><font color="black">one
week</span></span> <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">one
Saturday</span></span></font><font color="red"><sup><small>a|1|</small></sup></font>
when Father Butt gave &ldquo;Othello&rdquo; as the subject for the essay of the
week Stephen lodged on the following Monday a profuse, downright protest against
the &lsquo;masterpiece&rsquo;. The young men in the class laughed and Stephen,
as he looked contemptuously at the laughing faces, thought of a self-submersive reptile.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 542}</font> </p>
<p> No-one would listen to his theories: no-one was interested in art. The young
men in the college<a target="foot" id="fyz0010">&ordm;</a> regarded art as a
continental vice and they said, in effect, &ldquo;If we must have art are there
not enough subjects in Holy Writ?&rdquo; &mdash; for an artist with them was a
man who painted pictures. It was a bad sign for a young man to show interest in
anything but his examinations or his prospective &ldquo;job&rdquo;. It was all
very well to be able to talk about it but really art was all &ldquo;rot&rdquo;:
besides it was probably immoral; they knew (or, at least, they had heard) about
studios. They didn&apos;t want that kind of thing in their country. Talk about
beauty, talk about rhythms, talk about esthetic &mdash; they knew what all the
fine talk covered. One day a big countrified student came over to Stephen and asked:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Tell us, aren&apos;t you an artist? &mdash;
<br>Stephen gazed at the idea-proof young man, without answering.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Because if you are why don&apos;t you wear your hair
long?<a target="foot" id="fyz0011">&ordm;</a> &mdash;
<br>A few bystanders laughed at this
<br><font color="green">{ms, 543}</font>
<br> and Stephen wondered for which of the learned professions the young man&apos;s father designed him.</p>
<p> In spite of his surroundings Stephen continued his labours of research and
all the more ardently since he imagined they had been put under
ban.<a target="foot" id="fyz0012">&ordm;</a>
<a name="pn1003a" href="../../FF/unbs/pn1all.htm#pn1003a">It was part of that
ineradicable egoism which he was afterwards to call redeemer that he conceived
converging to him the deeds and thoughts of his microcosm. Is the mind of youth
medieval that it is so divining of intrigue? Field-sports (or their equivalent
in the world of mentality) are perhaps the most effective cure and Anglo-Saxon
educators favour rather a system of hardy brutality. But for this fantastic
idealist, eluding the grunting booted apparition with a bound, the mimic warfare
was no less ludicrous than unequal in a ground chosen to his disadvantage.
Behind the rapidly indurating shield the sensitive answered: Let the pack of
enmities come tumbling and sniffing to my highlands after their game. There was his ground and he
<br><font color="green">{ms, 544}</font>
<br> flung their disdain from flashing antlers.</a></p>
<p> Indeed he felt the morning in his blood: he was aware of some movement
already proceeding out in Europe.<a target="foot" id="fyz0013">&ordm;</a> Of
this last phrase he was fond for it seemed to him to unroll the measurable world
before the feet of the islanders. Nothing could persuade him that the world was
such as Father Butt&apos;s students conceived it. He had no need for the
cautions which were named indispensable, no reverence for the proprieties which
were called the bases of life. He was an enigmatic figure in the midst of his
shivering society where he enjoyed a reputation. His comrades hardly knew how
far to venture with him and professors pretended to think his seriousness a
sufficient warrant against any practical disobedience. On his side chastity,
having been found a great inconvenience, had been quietly abandoned and the
youth amused himself in he company of certain of his fellow-students among whom (as the fame went) wild
<br><font color="green">{ms, 545}</font>
<br> living was not unknown. The Rector of Belvedere had a brother who was at
this time a student in the college and one night in the gallery of the Gaiety
(for Stephen had become a constant &lsquo;god&rsquo;) another Belvedere boy, who
was also a student in the college, bore scandalous witness into Stephen&apos;s
ear.<a target="foot" id="fyz0014">&ordm;</a></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I say, Daedalus &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I wonder what MacNally would say if he met his brother
&mdash; you know the fellow in the college? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I saw him in Stephen&apos;s Green the other day with a
tart. I was just thinking if MacNally saw him &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;.</p>
<p class="flush">The informant paused: and then, afraid of
over-implication<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span>
and with an air of a connoisseur, he added seriously:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Of course she was &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. all right &mdash;</p>
<p> Every evening after tea Stephen left his house and set out for the city,
Maurice at his side. The elder smoked cigarettes and the younger ate lemon drops
and, aided by these animal comforts, they beguiled the long
<br><font color="green">{ms, 546}</font>
<br> journey with philosophic discourse. Maurice was a very attentive person and
one evening he told Stephen that he was keeping a diary of their conversations.
Stephen asked to see the diary but Maurice said it would be time enough for that
at the end of the first year. Neither of the youths had the least suspicion of
themselves; they both looked upon life with frank curious eyes (Maurice
naturally serving himself with Stephen&apos;s vision when his own was deficient)
and they both felt that it was possible to arrive at a sane understanding of
so-called mysteries if one only had patience enough. On their way in every
evening the heights of argument were traversed and the younger boy aided the
elder bravely in the building of an entire science of esthetic. They spoke to
each other very decisively and Stephen found Maurice very useful for raising
objections. When they came to the gate of the Library they used to stand to
finish some branch of their subject and often the discussion was so protracted
that Stephen would decide that it was too late to go in to read and so they would set their faces for Clontarf and
<br><font color="green">{ms, 547}</font>
<br> return in the same manner. Stephen, after certain hesitations, showed
Maurice the first-fruits of his verse and Maurice asked who the woman was.
Stephen looked a little vaguely before him before answering and in the end had
to answer that he didn&apos;t know who she was.</p>
<p> To this unknown verses were now regularly inscribed and it seemed that the
evil dream of love which Stephen chose to commemorate in these verses lay
veritably upon the world now in a season of damp violet
mist.<a target="foot" id="fyz0015">&ordm;</a> He had abandoned his Madonna, he
had forsaken his word and he had withdrawn sternly from his little world and
surely it was not wonderful that his solitude should propel him to frenetic
outbursts of a young man&apos;s passion and to outbursts of loneliness? This
quality of the mind which so reveals itself is called (when incorrigible) a
decadence but if we are to take a general view of
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">life</span></span>
<font color="black">the
world</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> we cannot but
see a process to life through corruption. There were moments for him, however,
when such a process would have seemed intolerable, life on any common terms an intolerable
<br><font color="green">{ms, 548}</font>
<br> offence, and at such moments he prayed for nothing and lamented for nothing
but he felt with
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">a</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
sweet sinking of consciousness that if the end came to him it was in the arms of
the unknown that it would come to him:</p>
<p class="set">The dawn awakes with tremulous alarms,
<br> How grey, how cold, how bare!
<br> O, hold me still white arms, encircling arms!
<br> And hide me, heavy hair!
<br> &mdash;</p>
<p class="set">Life is a dream, a dream. The hour is done
<br> And antiphon is said.
<br> We go from the light and falsehood of the Sun
<br> To bleak wastes of the dead.<a target="foot" id="fyz0016">&ordm;</a></p>
<p> Little by little Stephen became more irregular in his attendances at the
college. He would leave his house every morning at the usual hour and come into
the city on the tram. But always at Amiens St Station he would get down and walk
and as often as not he would decide to follow some trivial indication of city
life instead of entering the oppressive life of the College. He often walked
thus for seven or eight hours at a stretch without
<br><font color="green">{ms, 549}</font>
<br> feeling in the least fatigued. The damp Dublin winter seemed to harmonise
with his inward sense of unreadiness and he did not follow the least of feminine
provocations through tortuous, unexpected ways any more zealously than he
followed through ways even less satisfying the nimble movements of the elusive
One. What was that One: arms of love that had not love&apos;s malignity,
laughter running upon the mountains of the morning, an hour wherein might be
encountered the incommunicable? And if the heart but trembled an instant at some
approach to that he would cry youthfully, passionately &ldquo;It is so! It is
so! Life is such as I conceive it.&rdquo; He spurned from before him the stale
maxims of the Jesuits and he swore an oath that
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">never</span></span> they should
never establish over him an ascendancy. He spurned from before him a world of
the higher culture in which there was neither scholarship nor art nor dignity of
manners &mdash; a world of trivial intrigues
<br><font color="green">{ms, 550}</font>
<br> and trivial triumphs. Above all he spurned from before him the company of
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the
decrepit</span></span> <font color="black">decrepit
youth</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> and he swore
an oath that never would they establish with him a compact of fraud. Fine words!
fine oaths! crying bravely and passionately even in the teeth of circumstances.
For not unfrequently in the pauses of rapture Dublin would lay a sudden hand
upon his shoulder<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span>
and the chill of the summons would strike
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">to</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
his heart. One day he passed on his homeward journey through Fairview.
<a name="jn0a05a" href="../../FF/unbs/jn0all.htm#jn0a05a">At the fork of the
roads before the swampy beach a big dog was recumbent. From time to time he
lifted his muzzle in the vapourous air, uttering a prolonged sorrowful
howl.<a target="foot" id="fyz0017">&ordm;</a> People had gathered on the
footpaths to hear him
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">and</span></span><font color="black">.</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
Stephen made one of them till he felt the first drops of
rain<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span>
<font color="black">and
then</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> He continued
his way in silence under the dull surveillance of heaven, hearing from time to
time behind him the strange lamentation.</a></p>
<p> It was natural that the
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">more</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
<br><font color="green">{ms, 551}</font>
<br> the youth sought solitude for himself the more his society sought to
prevent his purpose. Though he was still in his first year he was considered a
personality and there were even many who thought that though his theories were a
trifle ardent they were not without meaning. Stephen came seldom to lectures,
prepared nothing and absented himself from term examinations and not merely was
no remark passed on these extravagances but it was supposed probable that he
represented really the artistic type and that he was, after the fashion of that
little known tribe, educating himself. It must not be supposed that the popular
University of Ireland lacked an intelligent centre. Outside the compact body of
national revivalists there were here and there students who had certain ideas of
their own and were more or less tolerated by their
fellows.<a target="foot" id="fyz0018">&ordm;</a> For instance there was a
serious young feminist named McCann &mdash; a blunt brisk figure, wearing a Cavalier beard and shooting-
<br><font color="green">{ms, 552}</font>
<br> suit, and a steadfast reader of the <u>Review of Reviews</u>. The students
of the college did not understand what manner of ideas he favoured and they
considered that they rewarded his originality sufficiently by calling him
&lsquo;<a name="jn1037u" href="../../FF/unbs/jn1all.htm#jn1037u">Knickerbockers</a>&rsquo;.
There was also the College orator &mdash; a most amenable young man who spoke at
all meetings. Cranly too was a personality and Madden had soon been recognised
as the spokesman<a target="foot" id="fyz0019">&ordm;</a> of the patriotic party.
Stephen may be said to have occupied the position of notable-extraordinary: very
few had ever heard of the writers he was reported to read and those who had knew
them to be mad fellows. At the same time as Stephen&apos;s manner was so
unbending to all it was supposed that he had preserved his sanity entire and
safely braved temptations. People began to defer to him, to invite him to their
houses and to present serious faces to him. His were simply theories and, as he
had as yet committed no breach of the law, he was respectfully invited to read a
paper before the Literary and Historical Society
<br><font color="green">{ms, 553}</font>
<br> of the College. The date was fixed for the end of March and the title of
the paper was announced as &lsquo;Drama and Life&rsquo;. Many risked the peril
of rebuff to engage the young eccentric in talk but Stephen preserved a
disdainful silence. One night as he was returning from a party a reporter of one
of the Dublin papers, who had been introduced that evening to the prodigy,
approached him and after a few exchanges said to him tentatively:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I was reading of that writer &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;.
what&apos;s this you call him &nbsp;. &nbsp;. Maeterlinck the other day &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. you know? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I was reading, <u>The Intruder</u> I think was the name
of it &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. Very &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. curious play &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen had no wish to talk to the man about Maeterlinck and on the other
hand he did not like to offend by the silence which the remark and the tone and
the intention all seemed to deserve so he cast about quickly in his mind for
some non-committal banality with which to pay the debt. At last he said:
<br><font color="green">{ms, 554}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It would be hard to put it on the stage &mdash;</p>
<p> The journalist was quite satisfied at this exchange as if it was just this
impression and no other which Maeterlinck&apos;s play had produced upon him. He assented with conviction:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O yes! &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. next to impossible &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p> Allusions of such a kind to what he held so dear at heart wounded Stephen
deeply. It must be said simply and at once that at this time Stephen suffered
the most enduring influence of his life. The spectacle of the world which his
intelligence presented to him with every sordid and deceptive detail set side by
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">b</span></span> side with the
spectacle of the world which the monster in him, now grown to a reasonably
heroic stage, presented also had often
filled<a target="foot" id="fyz0020">&ordm;</a> with such sudden despair as could
be assuaged only by melancholy versing. He had all but decided to consider the
two worlds as aliens one to another &mdash; however disguised or expressed the
most utter of pessimisms &mdash; when he encountered through the medium
<br><font color="green">{ms, 555}</font>
<br> of hardly procured translations the spirit of Henrik Ibsen. He understood
that spirit instantaneously.<a target="foot" id="fyz0021">&ordm;</a> Some years
before this same instantaneous understanding had occurred when he had read the
very puzzled, apologetic account which Rousseau&apos;s English biographer had
given of the young<a target="foot" id="fyz0022">&ordm;</a> philosopher&apos;s
stealing his mistress&apos;s spoons and allowing a servant-girl to be accused of
the theft at the very moment when he was beginning his struggle for Truth and
Liberty. Just as then with the
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">perverted</span></span> perverse
philosopher so now: Ibsen had no need of apologist or critic: the minds of the
old
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">Norse</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
poet and of the perturbed young Celt met in a moment of radiant simultaneity.
Stephen was captivated first by the evident excellence of the art: he was not
long before he began to affirm, out of a sufficiently scanty knowledge of the
tract, of course, that Ibsen was the first among the dramatists of the world. In
translations of the Hindu or Greek or Chinese theatres he found only anticipations of
<br><font color="green">{ms, 556}</font>
<br> or attempts and in the French classical, and the English romantic, theatres
anticipations less distinct and attempts less successful. But it was not only
this excellence which captivated him: it was not that which he greeted gladly
with an entire joyful spiritual salutation. It was the very spirit of Ibsen
himself that was discerned moving behind the impersonal manner of the artist:
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Ibsen
with his profound self-approval, Ibsen with his haughty, disillusioned courage,
Ibsen with his minute and wilful energy. a mind of sincere and boylike bravery,
of disillusioned pride, of minute and wilful energy.</span></span>
<font color="black">a mind of sincere and boylike bravery, of disillusioned
pride, of minute and wilful
energy.</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> Let the
world solve itself in whatsoever fashion it pleased, let its putative Maker
justify Himself <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">wh</span></span>
by whatsoever processes seemed good to Him, one could scarcely advance the
dignity of the human attitude a step beyond this answer. Here and not in
Shakespeare or Goethe was the successor to the first poet of the Europeans,
here, as only to such purpose in Dante, a human personality had been found united with
<br><font color="green">{ms, 557}</font>
<br>
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">a</span></span>
<font color="black">an
artistic</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> manner
which was itself almost a natural phenomenon: and the spirit of the time united
one more readily with the Norwegian than with the Florentine.</p>
<p> The young men of the college had not the least idea who Ibsen was but from
what they could gather here and there they surmised that he must be one of the
atheistic writers
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">whom
the papal secretary
puts</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> on the
<u>Index</u>.<a target="foot" id="fyz0023">&ordm;</a> It was a novelty to hear
anyone mention such a name in their college but as the professors gave no lead
in condemnation they concluded that they had better wait. Meanwhile they were
somewhat impressed: many now began to say that though Ibsen was immoral he was a
great writer and one of the professors was heard to say that when he was in
Berlin last summer on his holidays there had been a great deal of talk about
some play of Ibsen&apos;s which was being performed at one of the theatres.
Stephen had begun to study Danish instead of preparing his course for the
examination and this fact was magnified into a report that he was a
<br><font color="green">{ms, 558}</font>
<br> competent Danish scholar. That youth was astute enough to profit by rumours
which he took no trouble to contradict. He smiled to think that these people in
their hearts feared him as an infidel and he marvelled at the quality of their
supposed beliefs. Father Butt talked to him a great deal and Stephen was nothing
loth to make himself the herald<a target="foot" id="fyz0024">&ordm;</a> of a new
order. He never spoke with heat and he argued always as if he did not greatly
care which way the argument went, at the same time never losing a point. The
Jesuits
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">and
their flocks</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> may
have said to themselves: the youthful
seeming-independent<a target="foot" id="fyz0025">&ordm;</a> we know, and the
appeasable patriot we know, but what are you? They played up to him very well,
considering their disadvantages,<a target="foot" id="fyz0026">&ordm;</a> and
Stephen could not understand why they took the trouble to humour him.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, yes, said Father Butt one day after one of these
scenes, I see &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. I quite see your point &nbsp;. &nbsp;.
&nbsp;. It would apply of course to the dramas of Turg&eacute;nieff? &mdash;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 559}</font> </p>
<p> Stephen had read and admired certain translations of Turg&eacute;nieffs
novels and stories and he asked therefore with
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">a</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
genuine note in his voice:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do you mean his novels? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Novels, yes, said Father Butt swiftly, &nbsp;. &nbsp;.
&nbsp;. his novels, to be sure &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. but of course
they are dramas &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. are they not, Mr Daedalus? &mdash;</p>
<p> Very often Stephen used to visit at a house in Donnybrook the atmosphere of
which was compact of liberal patriotism and orthodox study. There were several
marriageable daughters in the family and whenever any promise
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">was</span></span> on the part of a
young student was signalled he was sure to receive an invitation to
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the</span></span>
<font color="black">this</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
house. The young feminist McCann was a constant visitor there and Madden used to
visit occasionally. The father of the family was an elderly man who played chess
on week evenings with his grown-up sons and assisted on Sunday evenings at a
round of games and music. The music was supplied by Stephen. There was an old
piano in the room and when the room was tired of games one of the daughters
<br><font color="green">{ms, 560}</font>
<br> used<a target="foot" id="fyz0027">&ordm;</a>
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">to</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
come over smilingly to Stephen and ask him to sing them some of his beautiful
songs. The keys of the piano were worn away and sometimes the notes would not
sound but the tone was soft and mellow and Stephen used to sit down and sing his
beautiful songs to the polite, tired, unmusical audience. The songs, for him at
least, were really beautiful &mdash; the old country songs of England and the
elegant songs of the Elizabethans. The &lsquo;moral&rsquo; of these songs was
sometimes a little dubious and Stephen&apos;s ear used to catch at once the note
of qualification in the applause that followed them. The studious daughters
found these songs very quaint but Mr Daniel said that Stephen should sing
operatic music if he wanted to have his voice heard properly. In spite of the
entire absence of sympathy between this circle and himself Stephen was very much
at ease in it and he was, as they bade him be, very much &lsquo;at home&rsquo; as he sat on the sofa
<br><font color="green">{ms, 561}</font>
<br> counting the lumps of horsehair with the ends of his
fingers<a target="foot" id="fyz0028">&ordm;</a> and listening to the
conversation. The young men and the daughters amused themselves tolerably under
Mr Daniel&apos;s eye but whenever there was an approach to artistic matters
during the process of their games Stephen
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">egoistically</span></span>
<font color="black">with egoistic
humour</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> imagined his
presence acting as a propriety. He could see seriousness developing on the
shrewd features of a young man who had to put a certain question to one of the daughters:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;<a target="foot" id="fyz0029">&ordm;</a>
<a name="jn0016a" href="../../FF/unbs/jn0all.htm#jn0016a">I suppose it&apos;s my
turn now &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. Well &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. let me see &nbsp;.
&nbsp;. &nbsp;. (and here he became as serious as a young man
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">can</span></span>, who has has
been laughing very much
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">for a
full</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> five minutes,
can become). &nbsp;. &nbsp;. Who is your favourite poet, Annie? &mdash;
<br>Annie thought for a few moments: there was a pause. Annie and the young man
were &lsquo;doing&rsquo; the same course.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. German? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. Yes. &mdash;</p>
<p class="flush">Annie thought for another few moments while the table waited
<br><font color="green">{ms, 562}</font>
<br> to</a><a target="foot" id="fyz0030">&ordm;</a>
<a name="jn0016a" href="../../FF/unbs/jn0all.htm#jn0016a">be edified.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I think &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. Goethe</a> &mdash;</p>
<p> McCann used very often organize charades in which he used to take
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the
most</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> violent
parts. The charades were very farcical and everyone took his part with goodwill,
Stephen as well as the others. Stephen would
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">play
often</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> play
his quiet deliberative manner off against McCann&apos;s uproarious acting and
for this reason the two were often &lsquo;picked&rsquo; together. These charades
wearied Stephen a little but McCann was very much given to organising them as he
was of the opinion that amusement is necessary for the bodily welfare of
mankind. The young feminist&apos;s Northern accent always excited laughter and
his face, adorned with its Cavalier beard, was
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">certainly</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
capable of brazen grimaces. In the college McCann
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">was
never</span></span> <font color="black">had never
been</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> assimilated on
account of his &lsquo;ideas&rsquo; but here he partook of the inner life of the
family. In this house it was the custom to call a young visitor by his
Christian<a target="foot" id="fyz0031">&ordm;</a> name a little too soon and though
<br><font color="green">{ms, 563}</font>
<br> Stephen was spared the compliment, McCann was never spoken of as anything
but &lsquo;Phil&rsquo;. Stephen used to call him &lsquo;Bonny Dundee&rsquo;
nonsensically associating
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">his
brisk name and</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the</span></span>
<font color="black">his</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
brisk manners with the sound of the line:</p>
<p class="set">Come fill up my cup, come fill up my can.</p>
<p> Whenever the evening assumed the character of a serious affair Mr Daniel
would be asked to recite something for the company. Mr Daniel had formerly been
the manager of a theatre in Wexford and he had often spoken at public
meetings<a target="foot" id="fyz0032">&ordm;</a> through the country. He recited
national pieces in a stem declamatory fashion amid attentive silence. The
daughters also recited. During these recitations Stephen&apos;s eye never moved
from the picture of the Sacred Heart which
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">wh</span></span> hung right above
the head of the reciter&apos;s head. The Miss Daniels were not so imposing as
their father and their dress was
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">unread unread</span></span>
somewhat colleen. Jesus, moreover,
exposed<a target="foot" id="fyz0033">&ordm;</a> his heart somewhat too obviously in the cheap print: and Stephen&apos;s
<br><font color="green">{ms, 564}</font>
<br> thoughts were usually fascinated to a pleasant stupor by these twin
futilities. A parliamentary charade was frequent. Mr Daniel had sat for his
county some years before and for this reason he was chosen to impersonate the
Speaker of the House. McCann always represented a member of the Opposition and
he spoke point-blank. Then a member would protest and there would be a make-believe of parliamentary manners.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;
<a name="jn0021a" href="../../FF/unbs/jn0all.htm#jn0021a">Mr Speaker, I must ask &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Order! order! &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You know it&apos;s a lie!&mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You must withdraw, sir &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; As I was saying before the honourable gentleman
interrupted we must &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I won&apos;t withdraw &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I must ask honourable members to preserve order in the House &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I won&apos;t withdraw &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Order! order!</a> &mdash;</p>
<p> Another favourite was &ldquo;Who&apos;s Who&rdquo;. A person goes out of the
room and the rest of the company choose
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">the
name of</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> someone who
is supposed to have special attractions for the absent player. This latter, when he returns to the company, has to
<br><font color="green">{ms, 565}</font>
<br> ask questions all round and try to guess the name. This game was generally
used to the discomfiture of the young male guests for the manner in which it was
played suggested that each young student had an affair of the heart with some
young lady within tolerable distance of him: but the young men, who were at
first surprised by these implications, ended by looking as if they thought
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">that</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
the sagacity of the other players had just forestalled them in an unexpected,
not unpleasant, discovery. No such suggestion could be seriously made by the
company to fit Stephen&apos;s case and so the first time he played the game they
chose differently for him. The
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">company was</span></span> players
were unable to answer his questions when he returned to the room: such questions
as: &ldquo;Where does the person live?&rdquo; &ldquo;Is the person married or
single?&rdquo; &ldquo;What age is the person?&rdquo; could not be answered by
the circle until McCann had been consulted in a swift undertone. The answer
&ldquo;Norway&rdquo; gave Stephen the clue at once and so the game ended and the
company proceeded to divert themselves as before this serious interruption.
Stephen sat down beside one of the daughters and, while admiring the rural
<br><font color="green">{ms, 566}</font>
<br> comeliness of her features, waited quietly for her first word which, he
knew, would destroy his satisfaction. Her large handsome eyes looked at him for
a while as if
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">she
were</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> about to trust
him<a target="foot" id="fyz0034">&ordm;</a> and then she said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; How did you guess it so quickly? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;
<a name="jn0014a" href="../../FF/unbs/jn0all.htm#jn0014a">I knew you meant him.
But you&apos;re wrong about his age &mdash;</p>
<p> Others had heard this: but she was impressed by a possible vastness of the
unknown, complimented to confer with one who conferred directly with the
exceptional. She leaned forward to speak with soft seriousness.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Why, how old is he? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Over seventy &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is he?</a> &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen now imagined that he had explored this region sufficiently and he
would have discontinued his visits had not two causes induced him to continue.
The first cause was the unpleasant character of his home and the second was the
curiosity occasioned by the advent of a new figure. One evening while he was
musing on the horsehair sofa he heard his name called and stood up to be
introduced. A dark full-figured<a target="foot" id="fyz0035">&ordm;</a>
<br><font color="green">{ms, 566}</font>
<br> girl was standing before him and, without waiting for Miss Daniel&apos;s introduction, she said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I think we know each other already &mdash;</p>
<p> She sat beside him on the sofa and he found out that
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">he</span></span>
<font color="black">she</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
was studying in the same college with the Miss Daniels and that she always
signed her name in Irish. She said Stephen should learn Irish too and join the
League. A young man of the company
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">with</span></span>, whose face
wore always the same look of studied purpose, spoke with her across Stephen
addressing her familiarly by her Irish name. Stephen therefore spoke very
formally and always addressed her as &lsquo;Miss Clery&rsquo;. She seemed on her
part to include him in the general scheme of her nationalising charm: and when
he helped her into her jacket she allowed his hands to rest for a moment against the warm flesh of her shoulders.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 568}</font> </p>
<p class="center">XVII</p>
<p> Stephen&apos;s home-life had by this time grown sufficiently unpleasant: the
direction of his development was against the stream of tendency of his family.
The evening walks with Maurice had been prohibited for it had become evident
that Stephen was corrupting his brother to idle habits. Stephen was harassed
very much by enquiries as to his progress at the College and Mr Daedalus,
meditating upon the evasive answers, had begun to express a fear that his son
was falling into bad company. The youth was given to understand that if he did
not succeed brilliantly at the coming examination his career at the University
would come to a close. He was not greatly troubled by this warning for he knew
that his fate was, in this respect, with his godfather and not with his father.
He felt that the moments of his youth were too precious to be wasted in a dull
mechanical endeavour and he determined, whatever came of it, to prosecute his
intentions to the end. His family expected that he would at once follow the path of remunerative
<br><font color="green">{ms, 569}</font>
<br> respectability and save the situation but
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">he</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
could not satisfy his family. He thanked their intention: it had first fulfilled
him with egoism; and he rejoiced that his life had been so self-centred. He felt
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">also</span></span>
<font color="black">however</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
that there were activities which it would be a peril to postpone.<a target="foot" id="fyz0036">&ordm;</a></p>
<p> Maurice accepted this prohibition with a bad grace and had to be restrained
by his brother from overt disobedience. Stephen himself bore it lightly because
he could ease himself greatly in solitude and for human channels, at the worst,
he could resort to a few of his college-companions. He was now busily preparing
his paper for the Literary and Historical Society and he took every precaution
to ensure in it a maximum of explosive force. It seemed to him that the students
might need only the word to enkindle them towards liberty or that, at least, his
trumpet-call might bring to his side a certain minority of the elect. McCann was
the Auditor of the Society and as he was anxious to know the trend of Stephen&apos;s paper the two used often
<br><font color="green">{ms, 570}</font>
<br> leave the Library at ten o&apos;clock and walk towards the Auditor&apos;s
lodgings, discussing. McCann enjoyed the reputation of a fearless, free-spoken
young man but Stephen found it difficult to bring him to any fixed terms on
matters which were held to be dangerous ground. McCann would talk freely on
feminism and on rational life: he believed that the sexes should be educated
together in order to accustom them early to each other&apos;s influences and he
believed that women should be afforded the same opportunities as were afforded
to the so-called superior sex and he believed that women had the right to
compete with men in every branch of social and intellectual activity. He also
held the opinion that a man should live without using any kind of stimulant,
that he had a moral obligation to transmit to posterity sound minds in sound
bodies, and that he should not allow himself to be dictated to on the subject
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">of
dress</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> by any conventions. Stephen delighted to riddle these
<br><font color="green">{ms, 571}</font>
<br> theories with agile bullets.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You would have no sphere of life closed to them? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Certainly not &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Would you have the soldiery, the police and the
fire-brigade recruited also from them? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; There are certain social duties for which women are physically unfitted &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I believe you &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; At the same time they should be allowed to follow any
civil profession for which they have an aptitude &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Doctors and lawyers? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Certainly &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And what about the third learned profession? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; How do you mean? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do you think they would make good confessors? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You are flippant. The Church does not allow women to enter the priesthood &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;O, the Church! &mdash;</p>
<p class="flush">Whenever the conversation reached this point McCann refused to
follow it further. The discussion usually ended in
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">an
impasse</span></span> <font color="black">a deadlock</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But you go mountain-climbing in
<br><font color="green">{ms, 572}</font>
<br> search of fresh air? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And bathing in the summertime? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And surely the mountain air and the salt water act as
stimulants<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">!</span></span>? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Natural stimulants, yes &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What do you call an unnatural stimulant? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Intoxicating drinks &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But they are produced from natural vegetable substances, aren&apos;t they? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Perhaps, but by an unnatural process &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Then you regard a brewer as a high thaumaturgist? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Intoxicating drinks are manufactured to satisfy
artificially induced appetites. Man, in the normal condition, has no need for such props to life &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Give me an example of man in what you call &lsquo;the normal condition&rsquo; &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A man who lives a healthy, natural life &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yourself? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do you then represent normal humanity? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I do &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Then is normal humanity short- sighted and tone-deaf? &mdash;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 573}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Tone-deaf? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes: I think you are tone-deaf &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I like to hear music &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What music? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; All music &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But you cannot distinguish one air from another &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No: I can recognise some airs &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; For instance? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I can recognise &lsquo;God save the Queen&rsquo; &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Perhaps because all the people stand up and take off their hats &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, admit that my ear is a little defective &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And your eyes? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; They too &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Then how do you represent normal humanity? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; In my manner of life &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;Your wants and the manner in which you satisfy them, is it? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Exactly &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And what are your wants? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Air and food &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Have you any subsidiary ones? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The acquisition of knowledge &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And you need also religious comforts?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Maybe so &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. at times &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And women &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. at times? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Never! &mdash;</p>
<p> This last word was uttered with
<br><font color="green">{ms, 574}</font>
<br> a moral snap of the jaws and in such a business-like tone of voice that
Stephen burst out into a fit of loud laughter. As for the fact, though he was
very suspicious in this matter, Stephen was inclined to believe in McCann&apos;s
chastity and much as he disliked it he chose to contemplate it rather than the
contrary phenomenon. He almost trembled to think of that unhorizoned doggedness working its way backwards.</p>
<p> McCann&apos;s insistence on a righteous life and his condemnation of licence
as a sin against the future both annoyed and stung Stephen. It annoyed him
because it savoured so strongly of <u>paterfamilias</u> and it stung him because
it seemed to judge him incapable of that part. In McCann&apos;s mouth he
considered
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">it</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
unjust and unnatural and he fell back on a sentence of Bacon&apos;s. The care of
posterity, he quoted, is greatest in them that have no posterity: and for the
rest he said that he could not understand what right the future had to hinder
him from any passionate exertions in the present.<a target="foot" id="fyz0037">&ordm;</a></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That is not the teaching of Ibsen, said McCann &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Teaching! cried Stephen &mdash;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 575}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The moral of <u>Ghosts</u> is just the opposite of what you say &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Bah! You regard a play as a scientific document &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Ghosts</u> teaches self-repression &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O Jesus! said Stephen in agony &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; This is my lodging, said McCann, halting at the gate. I must go in &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You have connected Ibsen and Eno&apos;s Fruit Salt forever in my mind, said Stephen &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Daedalus, said the Auditor crisply, you are a good fellow
but you have yet to learn the dignity of altruism and the responsibility of the
human individual<a target="foot" id="fyz0038">&ordm;</a> &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen had decided to address himself to Madden to
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">find
out</span></span>
<font color="black">ascertain</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
where Miss Clery was to be found. He set about this task carefully. Madden and
he were often together but their conversations were rarely serious and though
the rustic mind of one was very forcibly impressed
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">by</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
the metropolitanism of the other both young men were on relations of
affectionate familiarity. Madden who had previously tried in vain to infect
Stephen with nationalistic fever was surprised to hear these overtures of his
friend. He was delighted at the prospect of making such a convert and he began
to appeal eloquently to the sense of justice. Stephen allowed his critical
<br><font color="green">{ms, 576}</font>
<br> faculty a rest. The so-desired community for the realising of which Madden
sought to engage his personal force seemed to him anything but ideal and the
liberation which would have satisfied Madden would by no means have satisfied
him. The Roman, not the Sassenach, was for him the tyrant of the islanders: and
so deeply had the tyranny eaten into all souls that the intelligence, first
overborne so arrogantly, was now eager to prove that arrogance its friend. The
watchcry was Faith and Fatherland, a sacred word in that world of cleverly
inflammable enthusiasms. With literal obedience and with annual doles the Irish
bid eagerly for the honour which was studiously withheld from them to be given
to nations which in the
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">present</span></span>
<font color="black">past</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>,
as in the
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">past</span></span>
<font color="black">present</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>,
had never bent the knee but in defiance. While the multitude of preachers
assured them that high honours were on the way and encouraged them ever to hope.
The last should be first, according to the Christian sentiment, and whosoever
humbled himself, exalted and in reward for several centuries of obscure fidelity
the Pope&apos;s Holiness<a target="foot" id="fyz0039">&ordm;</a> had presented a
tardy cardinal to <a name="jn1034f" href="../../FF/unbs/jn1all.htm#jn1034f">an
island which
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">is</span></span>
<font color="black">was for him,
perhaps,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> only the afterthought
<br><font color="green">{ms, 577}</font>
<br> of Europe</a>.<a target="foot" id="fyz0040">&ordm;</a></p>
<p> Madden was prepared to admit the truth of much of this but he gave Stephen
to understand that the new movement was politic. If the least infidelity were
hoisted on the standard the people would not flock to it and for this reason the
promoters desired as far as possible to work hand in hand with the priests.
Stephen objected that this working hand in hand with the priests had over and
over again ruined the chances of revolutions. Madden agreed: but now at least
the priests were on the side of the people.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do you not see, said Stephen, that they encourage the
study of Irish that their flocks may be
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">more</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
safely protected from the wolves of
disbelief;<a target="foot" id="fyz0041">&ordm;</a> they consider it is an
opportunity to withdraw the people into a past of literal, implicit faith? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But really our peasant has nothing to gain from English Literature &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Rubbish! &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Modern at least. You yourself are always railing &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; English is the medium for the Continent &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; We want an Irish Ireland &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It seems to me you do not care what
<br><font color="green">{ms, 578}</font>
<br> banality a man expresses so long as he expresses it in Irish &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I do not entirely agree with your modern notions. We want
to have nothing of this English civilisation &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But the civilisation of which you speak is not English
&mdash; it is Aryan. The modern notions are not English; they point the way of Aryan civilisation &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You want our peasants to ape the gross materialism of the Yorkshire peasant? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; One would imagine the country was inhabited by cherubim.
Damme if I see much difference in peasants: they all seem to me as like one
another as a peascod is like another peascod. The Yorkshireman is perhaps better fed &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Of course you despise the peasant because you live in the city &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I don&apos;t despise his office in the least &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But you despise him &mdash; he&apos;s not clever enough for you &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Now, you know, Madden, that&apos;s nonsense. To begin
with he&apos;s as cute as a fox &mdash; try to pass a false coin on him and
you&apos;ll see. But his cleverness is all of a low order. I really don&apos;t
think that the Irish peasant represents a very admirable type of culture &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That&apos;s you all out! Of course you sneer at him
because he&apos;s not up-to-date and lives a simple life &mdash;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 579}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, a life of dull routine &mdash; the calculation of
coppers, the weekly debauch and the weekly piety &mdash; a life lived in cunning

<p class="pdi">&mdash; The life of a great city like London seems to you better? &mdash;</p>

mental swamp of the Irish peasant &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And what about the two
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">as</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
moral beings? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The Irish are noted for at least one virtue all the world over &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Oho! I know what&apos;s coming now! &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But it&apos;s a fact &mdash; they are chaste &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; To be sure &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You like to run down your own people at every hand&apos;s
turn but you can&apos;t accuse them &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Very good: you are partly right. I fully recognise that
my countrymen have not yet advanced
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">to</span></span>
<font color="black">as far
as</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> the machinery of
Parisian harlotry because &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Because &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;.? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, because they can do it by hand, that&apos;s why! &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Good God, you don&apos;t mean to say you think &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; My good youth, I know what I am
<br><font color="green">{ms, 580}</font>
<br> saying is true and so do you know it. Ask Father Pat and ask Dr Thisbody
and ask Dr Thatbody. I was at school and you were at school &mdash; and that&apos;s enough about it &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, Daedalus! &mdash;</p>
<p> This accusation laid a silence on the conversation. Then Madden spoke:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, if these are your ideas I don&apos;t see what you
want coming to me and talking about learning Irish &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I would like to learn it &mdash; as a language, said
Stephen lyingly. At least I would like to see first &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; So you admit you are an Irishman after all and not one of the red garrison &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Of course I do &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And don&apos;t you think that every Irishman worthy of
the name should be able to speak his native tongue? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I really don&apos;t know &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And don&apos;t you think that we as a race have a right to be free? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, don&apos;t ask me such questions, Madden. You can use
these phrases of the platform but I can&apos;t &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But surely you have some political opinions, man! &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I am going to think them out. I am an artist, don&apos;t you see? Do you believe
<br><font color="green">{ms, 581}</font>
<br> that I am? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, yes, I know you are &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Very well then, how the devil can you expect me to settle
everything all at once? Give me time &mdash;</p>
<p> So it was decided that Stephen was to begin a course of lessons in Irish. He
bought the O&apos;Growney&apos;s primers published by the Gaelic League but
refused either to pay a subscription to the League or to wear the badge in his
buttonhole. He had found out what he had desired, namely, the class in which
Miss Clery was. People at home did not seem opposed to this new freak of his. Mr
Casey taught him a few Southern songs in Irish and always raised his glass to
Stephen saying &ldquo;Sinn Fein&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Good Health&rdquo;. Mrs
Daedalus was probably pleased for she thought that the superintendence of
priests and the society of harmless enthusiasts might succeed in influencing her
son in the right direction: she had begun to fear for him. Maurice said nothing
and asked no questions. He did not understand what made his brother associate
with the patriots and he did not believe that the study of Irish seemed in any
way useful to Stephen: but he was silent and waited. Mr Daedalus said that he did not mind his son&apos;s learning
<br><font color="green">{ms, 582}</font>
<br> the language so long as it did not keep him from his legitimate work.</p>
<p> One evening when Maurice came back from school he brought with him the news
that the retreat would begin in three days&apos; time. This news suddenly
delivered showed Stephen his position. He could hardly believe that in a year
his point of view had changed so completely. Only twelve months ago he had been
clamouring for forgiveness and promising endless penances. He could hardly
believe that it was no other than he who had clung
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">so
fiercely</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> to the sole
means of salvation which the Church vouchsafes to her guilty children. He
marvelled at the terror which had then possessed him. One evening during the
retreat he asked his
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">w</span></span> brother what kind
of sermons the priest was giving. The two were standing together looking into
the window of a stationer&apos;s shop and it was a picture of S. Anthony in the
window which had led to the question. Maurice smiled broadly as he answered:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Hell today &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And what kind of a sermon was it? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Usual
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">thing</span></span>
<font color="black">kind</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
of thing. Stink in the morning and pain of loss in the evening &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen laughed and looked at the square-shouldered boy beside him. Maurice
announced facts in a dry satirical voice and his cloudy complexion did not change colour when he laughed. He made
<br><font color="green">{ms, 583}</font>
<br> Stephen think of the pictures in &lsquo;Silas Verney&rsquo;. His sombre
gravity, his careful cleansing of his much-worn clothes, and the premature
disillusionment of his manner all suggested
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">the
human vesture of</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
some spiritual or philosophic problem transplanted from Holland. Stephen did not
know in what stage the problem was and he thought it wiser to allow it its own path of solution.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do you know what the priest told us also? asked Maurice after a pause &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He said we weren&apos;t to have companions &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Companions? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That we weren&apos;t to go for walks in the evenings with
any special companions. If we wanted to take a walk, he said, a lot of us were
to go together<a target="foot" id="fyz0042">&ordm;</a> &mdash; Stephen halted in
the street and struck the palms of his hands together.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What&apos;s up with you? said Maurice &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I know what&apos;s up with them, said Stephen. They&apos;re afraid &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Of course they&apos;re afraid, said Maurice gravely &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; By the bye of course you have made the retreat? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, yes. I&apos;m going to the altar in the morning &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Are you really? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Tell the truth, Stephen. When mother gives you the money on Sunday to go
<br><font color="green">{ms, 584}</font>
<br> in to short twelve in Marlboro&apos; St do you really go to Mass &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen coloured slightly</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Why do you ask that? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Tell the truth &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No &nbsp;. &nbsp;. I don&apos;t &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And where do you go? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O anywhere &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. about the town, &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; So I thought &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You&apos;re a &apos;cute fellow, said Stephen in a
sidewise fashion. Might I ask do you go to mass yourself? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, yes, said Maurice &mdash; They walked on
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">then</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
for a short time in silence. Then Maurice said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext"><font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">unread</span></font></span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
I have bad hearing &mdash;</p>
<p class="flush">Stephen made no remark.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And I think I must be a little stupid &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; How&apos;s that? &mdash;</p>
<p> In his heart Stephen felt that he was condemning his brother. In this
instance he could not admit that freedom from strict religious influences was
desirable. It seemed to him that anyone who could contemplate the condition of
his soul in such a prosaic manner was not worthy of freedom and was fit only for
the severest shackles of the Church.<a target="foot" id="fyz0043">&ordm;</a></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well today the priest was telling us a true story. It was about the death of
<br><font color="green">{ms, 585}</font>
<br> the drunkard. The priest came in to see him and talked to him and asked him
to <font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">say
he was sorry and to</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
promise to give up drink. The man felt that he was going to die in a few moments
but he sat upright in the bed, the priest said, and pulled out a black bottle
from under the bedclothes &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And said &ldquo;Father, if this was to be the last I was
ever to drink in this world I must drink it&rdquo; &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; So he drained the bottle dry. That very moment he dropped
dead, said the priest lowering his voice. &ldquo;That man fell dead in the bed,
stone dead. He died and went &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;.&rdquo; He spoke so
low that I couldn&apos;t hear but I wanted to know where the man went so I
leaned forward to hear and hit my nose a wallop against the bench in front.
While I was rubbing it the fellows knelt down to say the prayer so I didn&apos;t
hear where he went. Amn&apos;t I stupid? &mdash;
<br>Stephen exploded in laughter. He laughed so loudly that the people who were
passing turned to look at him and had to smile themselves by attraction. He put
his hands to his sides and the tears almost fell out of his eyes. Every glimpse
he caught of Maurice&apos;s solemn olive-coloured
<br><font color="green">{ms, 586}</font>
<br> face set him off on a new burst. He could say nothing between times but:
&mdash; &ldquo;I&apos;d have given anything to have seen
it<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">&rdquo;</span></span> &mdash;
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">&ldquo;</span></span>&lsquo;Father,
if this was the last&rsquo; &nbsp;.&nbsp;. and you with your mouth open.
I&apos;d have given anything to have seen it&rdquo; &mdash;</p>
<p> The Irish class was held every Wednesday night in a back room on the second
floor of a house in O&apos;Connell St. The class consisted of six young men and
three young women. The teacher was a young man in spectacles with a very
sick-looking face and
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">a</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
very crooked mouth. He spoke in a high-pitched
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">voice</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
and with a cutting Northern accent. He never lost an opportunity of sneering at
seoninism and at those who would not learn their native tongue. He said that
Beurla was the language of commerce and Irish the speech of the soul and he had
two witticisms which always made his class laugh. One was the &lsquo;Almighty
Dollar&rsquo; and the other was the &lsquo;Spiritual Saxon&rsquo;. Everyone
regarded Mr Hughes as a great enthusiast and some thought he had a great career
before him as an orator. On Friday nights when there was a public meeting of the
League he often spoke but as he did not know enough Irish he always excused
himself at the beginning of his speech for having to speak to the audience in
the language of the &lsquo;
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">gallant</span></span>
<font color="black">Spiritual</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
Saxon&rsquo;. At the end of every speech he quoted a piece of verse. He scoffed very much
<br><font color="green">{ms, 587}</font>
<br> at Trinity College and at the Irish Parliamentary Party. He could not
regard as patriots men who had taken oaths of allegiance to the Queen of England
and he could not regard as a national university an institution which did not
express the religious convictions of the majority of the Irish people. His
speeches were always loudly applauded and Stephen heard some of the audience say
that they were sure he would be a great success at the bar. On enquiry
<font color="red"><sup><small>|s1</small></sup></font><font color="black">Stephen
found</font><font color="red"><sup><small>s1|</small></sup></font> that Hughes,
who was the son of a Nationalist solicitor in Armagh, was a law-student at the King&apos;s Inns.</p>
<p> The Irish class which Stephen attended was held in a very sparely furnished
room lit <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">with</span></span> by a
gasjet which had a broken globe. Over the mantelpiece hung the picture of a
priest with a beard who, Stephen found, was Father O&apos;Growney. It was a
beginners&apos; class and its progress was retarded by the stupidity of two of
the young men. The others in the class learned quickly and worked very hard.
Stephen found it very
<font color="red"><sup><small>|s1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">hard</span></span>
<font color="black">troublesome</font><font color="red"><sup><small>s1|</small></sup></font>
to pronounce the gutturals but he did the best he could. The class was very
serious and patriotic. The only time Stephen found it inclined to levity was at
the lesson which introduced the word &lsquo;gradh&rsquo;. The three young women
laughed and the two stupid young men laughed, finding something very
<br><font color="green">{ms, 588}</font>
<br> funny in the Irish word for &lsquo;love&rsquo; or perhaps in the notion
itself. But Mr Hughes and the other three young men and Stephen were all very
grave. When the excitement of the word had passed Stephen&apos;s attention was
attracted to the younger of the stupid young men who was still blushing
violently. His blush continued for such a long time that Stephen began to feel
nervous. The young man grew more and more confused and what was worst was that
he was making all this confusion for himself for no-one in the class but Stephen
seemed to have noticed him. He continued so till the end of the hour never once
daring to raise his eyes from his book and when he had occasion to use his
handkerchief he did so stealthily with his left hand.<a target="foot" id="fyz0044">&ordm;</a></p>
<p> The meetings on Friday nights were public and were largely patronised by
priests. The organisers brought in reports from different districts and the
priests made speeches of exhortation. Two young men
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">were</span></span> would then be
called on for songs in Irish and when it was time for the whole company to break
up all would rise and sing the Rallying-Song. The young women would then begin
to chatter while their cavaliers helped them into their jackets. A very stout
black-bearded
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">citizen</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
who always wore a
<br><font color="green">{ms, 589}</font>
<br> wideawake hat and a long bright green muffler was a constant figure at
these meetings. When the company was going home he was usually to be seen
surrounded by a circle of young men who looked very meagre about his bulk. He
had the voice of an ox and he could be heard at a great distance, criticising,
denouncing and scoffing. His circle was the separatist centre and in it reigned
the irreconcilable temper. It had its headquarters in Cooney&apos;s tobacco-shop
where the members sat every evening in the &lsquo;Divan&rsquo; talking Irish
loudly and smoking churchwardens. To this circle Madden who was the captain of a
club of hurley-players reported the muscular condition of the young
irreconcilables under his charge and the editor of the weekly journal of the
irreconcilable party reported any signs of Philocelticism which he had observed in the Paris newspapers.</p>
<p> By all this society liberty was held to be the chief desirable; the members
of it were fierce democrats. The liberty they desired for themselves was mainly
a liberty of costume and vocabulary: and Stephen could hardly understand how
such a poor scarecrow of liberty could bring
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">to their</span></span> serious human beings to their
<br><font color="green">{ms, 590}</font>
<br> knees in worship. As in
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">the</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
Daniels&apos; household he had seen people playing at being important so here he
saw people playing at being free. He saw that many political absurdities arose
from the lack of a just sense of comparison in public men. The orators of this
patriotic party were not ashamed to cite the precedents of Switzerland and
France. The intelligent centres of the movement were so scantily supplied that
the analogies they gave out as exact and potent were really
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">bu</span></span> analogies built
haphazard upon very inexact knowledge. The cry of a solitary Frenchman (A bas
l&apos;Angleterre!) at a Celtic re-union in Paris would be made by these
enthusiasts the subject of a leading article in which would be shown the
imminence of aid
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">for
Ireland</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> from the
French Government. A glowing example was to be found for Ireland in the case of
Hungary, an example, as these patriots imagined, of a long-suffering minority,
entitled by every right of race and justice to a separate freedom, finally
emancipating itself. In emulation of that achievement bodies of young Gaels
conflicted murderously in the Phoenix Park with whacking hurley-sticks, thrice
armed in their just quarrel since their revolution had been blessed
<br><font color="green">{ms, 591}</font>
<br> for them by the Anointed, and the same bodies were set aflame with
indignation <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">at</span></span> by
the unwelcome presence of any young sceptic who was aware of the capable
aggressions of the Magyars upon the Latin and Slav and Teutonic populations,
greater than themselves in number, which are politically allied to them, and of
the potency of a single regiment of infantry to hold in check a town of twenty thousand inhabitants.</p>
<p> Stephen said one day to Madden:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I suppose these hurley-matches and walking tours are preparations for the great event &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; There is more going on in Ireland at present than you are aware of &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But what use are cam&agrave;ns? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, you see, we want to raise the physique of the country &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen meditated for a moment and then he said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It seems to me that the English Government is very good to you in this matter &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; How is that may I ask? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The English Government will take you every summer in
batches to different militia camps, train you to the use of modern weapons,
drill you, feed you and pay you and then send you
<br><font color="green">{ms, 592}</font>
<br> home again when the manoeuvres are over &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Wouldn&apos;t that be better for your young men than hurley practice in the Park? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do you mean to say you want young Gaelic Leaguers to wear
the redcoat and take an oath of allegiance to the Queen and
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">take</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
her shilling too? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Look at your friend, Hughes &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What about him? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; One of these days he will be a barrister a Q.C, perhaps a
judge &mdash; and yet he sneers at the Parliamentary Party because they take an oath of allegiance &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Law is law all the world over &mdash; there must be
someone to administer it, particularly here,
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">were</span></span> where the people have no friends in Court &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Bullets are bullets, too. I do not quite follow the
distinction you make between administering English law and administering English
bullets: there is the same oath of allegiance for both professions &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Anyhow it is better for a man to follow a line of life
which civilisation regards as humane. Better be a barrister than a redcoat &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You consider the profession of arms a disreputable one.
Why then have you Sarsfield Clubs, Hugh O&apos;Neill Clubs,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 593}</font>
<br> Red Hugh Clubs? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, fighting for freedom is different. But it is quite
another matter to take service meanly under your tyrant, to make yourself his slave &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And, tell me, how many of your Gaelic Leaguers are
studying for the Second Division and looking for advancement in the Civil Service &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That&apos;s different. They are only civil servants:
they&apos;re not &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Civil be damned! They are pledged to the Government, and paid by the Government &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, well, of course if you like to look at it that way &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And how many relatives of Gaelic Leaguers are in the
police and the constabulary? Even I know nearly ten
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">of your
friends</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">that</span></span> who are sons of Police inspectors &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It is unfair to accuse a man because his father was
so-and-so. A son and a father often have different ideas &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But Irishmen are fond of boasting that they are true to
the traditions they receive in youth. How faithful all you fellows
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">are</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
to Mother Church! Why would you not be as faithful to the tradition of the
helmet as to that of the tonsure?<a target="foot" id="fyz0045">&ordm;</a> &mdash;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 594}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; We remain true to the Church because it is our national
Church, the Church our people have suffered for and would suffer for again. The
police are different: we look upon them as aliens, traitors, oppressors of the people &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The old peasant down the country doesn&apos;t seem to be
of your opinion when he counts over his greasy notes and says &ldquo;I&apos;ll
put the priest on Tom an&apos; I&apos;ll put the polisman on Mickey&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I suppose you heard that sentence in some
&ldquo;stage-Irishman&rdquo; play. It&apos;s a libel on our countrymen &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, no, it is
<a name="jn1034d" href="../../FF/unbs/jn1all.htm#jn1034d">Irish peasant wisdom:
he balances the priest against the polisman</a> and a very nice balance it is
for they both of a good girth. A compensative system! &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No West-Briton could speak worse of his countrymen. You
are simply giving vent to old stale libels &mdash; the drunken Irishman, the
baboon-faced Irishman that we see in <u>Punch</u> &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What I say I see about me. The publicans and the
pawnbrokers who live on the miseries of the people spend part of the money they
make in sending their sons and daughters into religion to pray for them. One of
your professors in the Medical School who teaches
<br><font color="green">{ms, 595}</font>
<br> you Sanitary Science or Forensic Medicine or something &mdash; God knows
what &mdash; is at the same time the landlord of a whole
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">street full</span></span>
streetful of brothels not a mile away from where we are standing &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Who told you that? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A little robin-redbreast &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It&apos;s a lie! &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, it&apos;s a contradiction in terms,
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">wi</span></span> what I call a systematic compensation &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen&apos;s conversations with the patriots were not all of this severe
type. Every Friday evening he met Miss Clery, or, as he
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">had</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
now returned to the Christian name, Emma. She lived near Portobello and any
evening that the meeting was over early she walked home. She
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">often</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
delayed a long time chatting with a low-sized young priest, a Father Moran, who
had a neat head of curly black hair and expressive black eyes. This young priest
was a pianist and sang sentimental songs and was for many reasons a great
favourite with the ladies. Stephen often watched Emma and Father Moran. Father
Moran, who sang tenor, had once complimented Stephen saying he had heard many
people speak highly of his voice and hoping he would have the pleasure of
hearing him some time. Stephen had said the same
<br><font color="green">{ms, 596}</font>
<br> thing to the priest adding that Miss Clery had told him great things of
<u>his</u> voice. At this
<a name="jn1038m" href="../../FF/unbs/jn1all.htm#jn1038m">the priest</a> had
smiled and looked archly at Stephen. &ldquo;One must not believe all the
complimentary things the ladies say of us&rdquo; he had said. &ldquo;The ladies
are a little given to &mdash; what shall I say &mdash; fibbing, I am
afraid.&rdquo; And here the priest had bit his lower rosy lip with two little
white even teeth and smiled with his expressive eyes and altogether
<a name="jn1038m" href="../../FF/unbs/jn1all.htm#jn1038m">looked such a pleasant
tender-hearted vulgarian</a> that Stephen felt inclined to slap him on the back
admiringly. Stephen
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">had</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
continued talking for a few minutes and once when the conversation had touched
on Irish matters the priest had become very serious and had said very piously
&ldquo;Ah, yes. God bless the
work!&rdquo;<a target="foot" id="fyz0046">&ordm;</a> Father Moran was no lover
of the old droning chants, he told Stephen. Of course, he said, it is very grand
music, severe style of music. But he held the opinion that the Church must not
be made too gloomy and he said with a charming smile that the spirit of the
Church was not gloomy. He said that one could not expect the people to take
kindly to severe music and that the people needed more human religious music than the Gregorian
<br><font color="green">{ms, 597}</font>
<br> and ended by advising Stephen to learn &ldquo;The Holy City&rdquo; by Adams.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; There is a song now, beautiful, full of lovely melody and
yet &mdash; religious. It has the religious sentiment, a touching melody, power
&mdash; soul, in fact<a target="foot" id="fyz0047">&ordm;</a> &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen watching this young priest and Emma together usually worked himself
into a state of unsettled rage. It was not so much that he suffered personally
as that the spectacle seemed to him typical of Irish ineffectualness. Often he
felt his fingers itch.
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Father&apos;s</span></span> Father
Moran&apos;s
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">eyes</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
were so clear and tender-looking, Emma stood to his gaze in such a poise of bold
careless pride of the flesh<a target="foot" id="fyz0048">&ordm;</a> that Stephen
longed to precipitate the two into each other&apos;s arms and shock the room
even though he knew the pain this impersonal generosity would cause himself.
Emma allowed him to see her home several times but she did not seem to have
reserved herself for him. The youth was piqued at this for above all things he
hated to be compared with others and, had it not been that her body seemed so
compact of pleasure, he would have preferred to have been ignominiously left
<br><font color="green">{ms, 598}</font>
<br> behind. Her loud forced manners shocked him at first until his mind had
thoroughly mastered the stupidity of hers. She criticized the Miss Daniels very
sharply, assuming, much to Stephen&apos;s discomfort, an identical temper in
him. She coquetted with knowledge, asking Stephen could he not persuade the
President of his College to admit women to the college. Stephen told her to
apply to McCann who was the champion of women. She laughed at this and said with
genuine dismay &ldquo;Well, honestly, isn&apos;t he a dreadful-looking
artist?<a target="foot" id="fyz0049">&ordm;</a> &rdquo; She treated femininely
everything that young men are supposed to regard as serious but she made polite
exception for Stephen himself and for the Gaelic Revival. She asked him
wasn&apos;t he reading a paper and what was it on. She would give anything to go
and hear him: she was awfully fond of the theatre herself and a gypsy woman had
once read her hand and told her she would be an actress. She had been three
times to the pantomime and asked Stephen what he liked best in a pantomime.
Stephen said he liked a good clown but she said that she preferred ballets. Then
she wanted to know did he go out much to dances and pressed him to join an Irish
dancing-class of which she was a member. Her
<br><font color="green">{ms, 599}</font>
<br> eyes had begun to imitate the expression of Father Moran&apos;s &mdash; an
expression of tender significance<a target="foot" id="fyz0050">&ordm;</a> when
the conversation was at the lowest level of banality. Often as he walked beside
her Stephen wondered how she had employed her time since he had last seen her
and he congratulated himself that he had caught an impression of her when she
was at her finest moment. In his heart he deplored the change in her for he
would have liked nothing so well as an adventure with her now but he felt that
even that warm ample body could hardly compensate
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">him</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
for her distressing pertness and middle-class affectations. In the centre of her
attitude towards him he thought he discerned a point of defiant illwill and he
thought he understood the cause of it.<a target="foot" id="fyz0051">&ordm;</a>
He had swept the moment into his memory, the figure and the landscape into his
treasure-room, and conjuring with all three had brought forth some pages of
sorry verse.<a target="foot" id="fyz0052">&ordm;</a>
<a name="jn0a06a" href="../../FF/unbs/jn0all.htm#jn0a06a">One rainy night when
the streets were too bad for walking she took the Rathmines tram at the Pillar
and
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">as</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
she held down her hand to him from the step, thanking him for his kindness and
wishing him good-night, that episode of their childhood</a> seemed to magnetise
the minds<a target="foot" id="fyz0053">&ordm;</a> of both at the</a>
<br><font color="green">{ms, 600}</font>
<br> same instant. The change of circumstances had reversed their positions,
giving her the upper hand. He took her
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">hand</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
caressingly, caressing one after another the three lines on the back of her kid
glove and numbering her knuckles, caressing also his own past towards which this
inconsistent hater of
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">antiquity</span></span>
<font color="black">inheritances</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
was always lenient. They smiled at each other; and again in the centre of her
amiableness he discerned a
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">point*
of illwill and he suspected that by her code of honour she was obliged to insist
on the forbearance
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">and</span></span> of the male and to despise him for forbearing.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 601}</font> </p>
<p class="center">XVIII</p>
<p class="flush">Stephen&apos;s paper was fixed for the second Saturday
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">and</span></span> in March.
Between Christmas and that date he had therefore an ample space of time wherein
to perform preparative abstinences. His forty days were consumed in aimless
solitary walks during which he forged out his sentences. In this manner he had
his whole essay in his mind from the first word to the last before he had put
any morsel of it on paper.<a target="foot" id="fyz0054">&ordm;</a> In thinking
or constructing the form of the essay he found himself much hampered by the
sitting posture.<a target="foot" id="fyz0055">&ordm;</a> His body disturbed him
and he adapted the expedient of appeasing it by gentle promenading. Sometimes
during his walks he lost the train of his thought and whenever the void of his
mind seemed irreclaimable he forced order upon it by ejaculatory fervours. His
morning walks were critical, his evening walks imaginative and whatever had
seemed plausible in the evening was always rigorously examined in the light of
day. These wanderings in the desert were reported from different points and Mr
Daedalus once asked his son what the hell had brought him out to Dolphin&apos;s
Barn.<a target="foot" id="fyz0056">&ordm;</a> Stephen said he had
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">been</span></span> gone part of
the way home with a fellow from the college
<br><font color="green">{ms, 602}</font>
<br> whereupon Mr Daedalus remarked that the fellow from the college
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">must</span></span> should have
gone all the way into the county Meath
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">to
live</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> as his hand was
in. Any acquaintances that were encountered during these walks were never
allowed to intrude on the young man&apos;s meditations by commonplace
conversation &mdash; a fact which they seemed to recognise in advance by a
deferent salute. Stephen was therefore very much surprised one evening as he
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">was</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
walking past the Christian Brother&apos;s School in North Richmond St to feel
his arm seized from behind and to hear a voice say somewhat blatantly:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Hello, Daedalus, old man, is that you? &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen turned round and saw a tall young man with many eruptions on his
face dressed completely in heavy black. He stared for a few moments, trying to recall the face.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Don&apos;t you remember me? I knew you at once &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, yes now I do, said Stephen. But you&apos;ve changed &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Think so? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I wouldn&apos;t know you &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;.
Are you &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. in mourning? &mdash;</p>
<p> Wells laughed.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; By Jove, that&apos;s a good one. Evidently
<br><font color="green">{ms, 603}</font>
<br> you don&apos;t know your Church when you see it<a target="foot" id="fyz0057">&ordm;</a> &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What? You don&apos;t mean to say &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;.? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Fact, old man. I&apos;m in Clonliffe at present. Been
down in Balbriggan today on leave: the boss is very bad. Poor old chap! &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, indeed! &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You&apos;re over in the Green now, Boland told me. Do you
know him? He said you were at Belvedere with him &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is he in too? Yes I know him &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He has a great opinion of you. He says you&apos;re a litterateur now &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen smiled and did not know what subject to suggest next. He wondered
how far this loud-voiced student intended to accompany him.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; See me down a bit of the way, will you? I&apos;ve just
come off the train at Amiens St. I&apos;m making for dinner &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Certainly &mdash;
<br>So they walked on side by side.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, and what have you been doing with yourself? Having
a good time, I suppose? Down in Bray? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ah, the usual thing, said Stephen &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I know: I know. After the esplanade girls, isn&apos;t
that it? Silly game, old man, silly game! Get tired of it &mdash;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 604}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You have, evidently &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Should think so: time too &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;.
Ever see any of the Clongowes fellows? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Never one &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That&apos;s the way. We all lose sight of each other
after we leave. You remember Roth? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Out in Australia now &mdash; bushranger or something.
You&apos;re going in for literature, I suppose &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I don&apos;t know really what I&apos;m going in for &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I know: I know. On the loose, isn&apos;t that it?
I&apos;ve been there myself<a target="foot" id="fyz0058">&ordm;</a> &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, not exactly &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. began Stephen &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;O, of course not! said Wells quickly with a loud laugh &mdash;</p>
<p> Passing down Jones&apos;s Road they saw a gaudy advertisement in strong
colours for a melodramatic play. Wells asked Stephen had he read <u>Trilby</u>.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Haven&apos;t you? Famous book, you know; style would suit
you, I think. Of course it&apos;s a bit &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. blue &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; How is that? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, well, you know &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. Paris, you know
&nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. artists &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, is that the kind of book it is? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Nothing very wrong in it that I could see. Still some people think it&apos;s a bit
<br><font color="green">{ms, 605}</font>
<br> immoral &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You haven&apos;t it in the library in Clonliffe &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, not likely &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. Don&apos;t I wish I was out of the show! &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Are you thinking of leaving? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Next year &mdash; perhaps this year &mdash; I go to Paris for my theology &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You won&apos;t be sorry, I suppose &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You bet. Rotten show, this place. Food is not so bad but so dull, you know &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Are there many students in it now? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, yes &nbsp;. &nbsp;. I don&apos;t mix much with them,
you know &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. There are a good lot &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I suppose you&apos;ll be a parish priest, one of these days &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I hope so. You must come and see me when I am &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Very good &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; When you&apos;re a great writer yourself &mdash; as the
author of a second <u>Trilby</u> or something of that sort &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. Won&apos;t you come in &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is it allowed &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, with me &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you come in, never mind &mdash;</p>
<p> The two young men went into the grounds of the College and along the
circular carriage-drive. It was a damp evening and rather dark. In the uncertain
light a few of the more adventurous were to be seen vigorously playing handball
in a little side-alley, the smack of the wet ball against the concrete
<br><font color="green">{ms, 606}</font>
<br> wall of the alley alternating with their lusty shouts. For the most part
the students were walking in little groups through the ground, some with their
b&eacute;rrettas pushed far back to the nape of their necks and others holding
their soutanes up as women do with their skirts when they cross a muddy street.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Can you go with anyone you like? asked Stephen &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Companions are not
allowed.<a target="foot" id="fyz0059">&ordm;</a> You must join the first group you meet &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Why didn&apos;t you go to the Jesuit order &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Not likely, my boy. Sixteen years of noviciate and no
chance of ever settling down. Here today, there tomorrow &mdash;</p>
<p> As Stephen looked at the big square block of masonry, looming before them
through the faint daylight, he re-entered again in thought the seminarist life
which he had led for so many years, to the understanding of the narrow
activities of which he could now in a moment bring the spirit of an acute
sympathetic alien. He recognised at once the martial mind of the Irish Church in
the style of this ecclesiastical barracks. He looked in vain at the faces and
figures which passed him for a token of moral elevation: all were cowed without
being humble, modish without being simple-mannered. Some of the students saluted Wells but got
<br><font color="green">{ms, 607}</font>
<br> scanty thanks for the courtesy. Wells wished Stephen to gather that he
despised his fellow-students and that it was not his fault if they regarded him
as an important person. At the foot of the stone steps he turned to Stephen:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I must go in to see the Dean for a minute. I&apos;m
afraid it&apos;s too late for me to show you round the show this evening &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, not at all. Another time &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, will you wait for me. Stroll along there towards
the chapel: I won&apos;t be a minute &mdash;</p>
<p> He nodded at Stephen for a temporary farewell and sprang up the steps.
Stephen wandered on towards the chapel meditatively kicking a white flat stone
along the grey pebbly path. He was not likely to
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">be</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
deceived by Wells&apos;s words into an acceptance of that young man as a quite
vicious person. He knew that Wells had exaggerated his airs in order to hide his
internal sense of mortification at meeting one who had not forsaken the world,
the flesh and the devil and he suspected that, if there were any tendency to
oscillation in the soul of the free-spoken young student, the iron hand of the
discipline of the Church would firmly intervene to restore equipoise. At the same time Stephen felt somewhat
<br><font color="green">{ms, 608}</font>
<br> indignant that anyone should expect him to entrust spiritual difficulties
to such a confessor or to receive with pious feelings any sacrament or
benediction from the hands of the young students whom he saw walking through the
grounds. It was not any personal pride which would prevent
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">him</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
but a recognition of the incompatibility of two natures, one trained to
repressive enforcement of a creed, the other equipped with a vision the angle of
which would never adjust itself for the reception of hallucinations and with an
intelligence which was as much in love with laughter as with combat.<a target="foot" id="fyz0060">&ordm;</a></p>
<p> The mist of the evening had begun to thicken into slow fine rain and Stephen
halted at the end of a narrow path beside a few laurel bushes, watching
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">at the
end of a leaf</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> a tiny
point of rain form and twinkle and hesitate and finally take the plunge into the
sodden clay beneath. He wondered was it raining in
Westmeath<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">, were the cattle
standing together patiently in the shelter of the hedges</span></span>. He
remembered
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">seeing</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
the cattle standing together patiently in the shelter of the hedges and reeking
in the rain. A little band of students passed at the other side of the laurel bushes: they were talking among
<br><font color="green">{ms, 609}</font>
<br> themselves:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But did you see Mrs Bergin? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, I saw her &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. with a black and white boa &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And the two Miss Kennedys were there &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Where? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Right behind the Archbishop&apos;s Throne &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, I saw her &mdash; one of them. Hadn&apos;t she a grey hat with a bird in it? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That was her! She&apos;s very lady-like, isn&apos;t she &mdash;</p>
<p> The little band went down the path. In a few minutes another little band
passed behind the bushes. One student was talking and the others were listening.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes and an astronomer too: that&apos;s why he had
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">built</span></span> that
observatory built over there at the side of the palace. I heard a priest say
once that the three greatest men in Europe were Gladstone, Bismarck (the great
German statesman) and our own Archbishop &mdash; as all-round men. He knew him
at Maynooth. He said that in Maynooth &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p> The speaker&apos;s words were lost in the crunch of the heavy boots on the
gravel. The rain was spreading and increasing and the vagrant bands of students
were all turning their steps towards the college. Stephen still waited at his
post and at last saw Wells coming down the path
<br><font color="green">{ms, 610}</font>
<br> quickly: he had changed his outdoor dress for a soutane. He was very
apologetic and not quite so familiar in manner. Stephen wanted him to go in with
the others but he insisted on seeing his visitor to the gate. They took a short
cut down beside the wall and were soon opposite the lodge. The
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">gate</span></span>
<font color="black">side-door</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
was shut and Wells called out loudly to the lodge-woman to open it and let the
gentleman out. Then he shook hands with Stephen and pressed him to come again.
The lodge-woman opened the side-door and Wells looked out for a second or two almost enviously. Then he said:
<br>Well, goodbye, old man. Must run in now. Awfully glad to see you again
&mdash; see any of the old Clongowes set, you know. Be good now: I must run. Goodbye &mdash;
<br>As he tucked up his soutane high and ran awkwardly up the drive he looked a
strange, almost criminal, fugitive<a target="foot" id="fyz0061">&ordm;</a> in
the dreary dusk. Stephen&apos;s eyes followed the running figure for a moment:
and as he passed through the door into the lamplit street he smiled at his own impulse of pity.</p>
<p> He<a target="foot" id="fyz0062">&ordm;</a></p>
<p> He smiled because it seemed to him so unexpected a ripeness in himself
&mdash; this pity or rather this impulse of pity for he had no more than entertained it. But it was
<br><font color="green">{ms, 611}</font>
<br> the<a target="foot" id="fyz0063">&ordm;</a> actual achievement of his essay
which had allowed him so mature a pleasure as the sensation of pity for another.
Stephen had a thoroughgoing manner in many things: his essay was not in the
least the exhibition of polite accomplishments. It was on the contrary very
seriously intended to define his own position for himself He could not persuade
himself that, if he wrote round about his subject with facility or treated it
from any standpoint of impression, good would come of it. On the other hand he
was persuaded that no-one served the generation into which he had been born so
well as he who offered it, whether in his art or in his life, the gift of
certitude. The programme of the patriots filled him with very reasonable doubts;
its articles could obtain no intellectual assent from him. He knew, moreover,
that concordance with it would mean for him a submission of everything else in
its interest and that he would thus be obliged to corrupt the springs of
speculation at their very sources. He refused therefore to set out for any task
if he had first to prejudice his success by oaths to his patria
<br><font color="green">{ms, 612}</font>
<br> and this refusal resulted in a theory of art which was at once severe and
liberal. His Esthetic was in the main applied
Aquinas<a target="foot" id="fyz0064">&ordm;</a> and he set it forth plainly with
a na&iuml;f air of discovering novelties. This he did partly to satisfy his own
taste for enigmatic r&acirc;les and partly from a genuine predisposition in
favour of all but the premisses of
scholasticism.<a target="foot" id="fyz0065">&ordm;</a> He proclaimed at the
outset that art was the human disposition of intelligible or sensible matter for
an esthetic end, and he announced further that all such human dispositions must
fall into the division of three distinct natural kinds,
<a name="pn1019e" href="../../FF/unbs/pn1all.htm#pn1019e">lyrical, epical and
dramatic</a>. Lyrical art, he said, is the art whereby the artist sets forth his
image in immediate relation to himself; epical art is the art whereby the artist
sets forth his image in mediate relation to himself and to others; and dramatic
art is the art whereby the artist sets forth his image in immediate relations to
others. The various forms of art, such as music, sculpture, literature, do not
offer this division with the same clearness and he concluded from this that
those forms of art which offered the division most dearly
<br><font color="green">{ms, 613}</font>
<br> were to be called the most excellent forms: and he was not greatly
perturbed because he could not decide for himself whether a portrait was a work
of epical art or not or whether it was possible for an architect to be a
lyrical, epical or dramatic poet at will. Having by this simple process
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">establishing</span></span>
<font color="black">established</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
the literary form of art as the most excellent he proceeded to examine it in
favour of his theory, or, as he rendered it, to establish the relations which
must subsist between the literary image, the work of art itself, and that energy
which had imagined and fashioned it, that centre of conscious, re-acting, particular life, the artist.</p>
<p> <a name="pn1019f" href="../../FF/unbs/pn1all.htm#pn1019f">The artist</a>, he
imagined, standing in the position of mediator between the world of his
experience and the world of his dreams &mdash; a mediator,
<a name="pn1019f" href="../../FF/unbs/pn1all.htm#pn1019f">consequently gifted
with twin faculties</a>, a selective faculty and a reproductive
faculty.<a target="foot" id="fyz0066">&ordm;</a> To equate these faculties was
the secret of artistic success: the artist who could disentangle the subtle soul
of the image from its mesh of defining circumstances most exactly and re-embody
it in artistic circumstances chosen as the most exact for it in its
<br><font color="green">{ms, 614}</font>
<br> new office, he was the supreme artist. This perfect coincidence of the two
artistic faculties Stephen called poetry and he imagined the domain of an art to
be cone-shaped. The term
<a name="pn1019d" href="../../FF/unbs/pn1all.htm#pn1019d">&lsquo;literature&rsquo;</a>
now seemed to him a term of contempt and he used it to designate the vast middle
region which lies between apex and base, between
<a name="pn1019d" href="../../FF/unbs/pn1all.htm#pn1019d">poetry</a> and the
chaos of unrembered writing. Its merit lay in its portrayal of externals; the
realm of its princes was the realm of the manners and customs of societies
&mdash; a spacious
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">realm</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>.
But society is itself, he conceived, the complex body in which certain laws are
involved and overwrapped and he therefore proclaimed as the realm of the poet
the realm of these unalterable laws. Such a theory might easily have led its
deviser to the acceptance of spiritual anarchy in literature had he not at the
same time insisted on the classical style. A classical style, he said, is the
syllogism of art, the only legitimate process from one world to another.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 615}</font>
<br> Classicism is not the manner of any fixed age or of any fixed country: it
is a constant state of the artistic mind. It is a temper of security and
satisfaction and patience. The romantic temper, so often and so grievously
misinterpreted and not more by others than by its own, is an insecure,
unsatisfied, impatient temper which sees no fit abode here for its ideals and
chooses therefore to behold them under insensible figures. As a result of this
choice it comes to
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">regard</span></span>
<font color="black">disregard</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
certain limitations. Its figures are blown to wild adventures, lacking the
gravity of solid bodies, and the mind that has conceived them ends by disowning
them. The classical temper on the other hand, ever mindful of limitations,
chooses rather to bend upon these present things and so to work upon them and
fashion them that the quick intelligence may go beyond them to their meaning
which is still unuttered. In this method the sane and joyful spirit issues forth
and achieves imperishable perfection, nature assisting with her goodwill
<br><font color="green">{ms, 616}</font>
<br> and thanks. For so long as this place in nature is given us it is right
that art should do no violence to the gift.<a target="foot" id="fyz0067">&ordm;</a></p>
<p> Between these two conflicting schools the city of the arts had become
marvellously unpeaceful. To many spectators the dispute had seemed a dispute
about names, a battle in which the position of the standards could never be
foretold for a minute. Add to this internecine warfare &mdash; the classical
school fighting the materialism that must attend it, the romantic school
struggling to preserve coherence &mdash; and behold from what ungentle manners
criticism is bound to recognise the emergence of all achievement. The critic is
he who is able, by means of the signs which the artist affords, to approach the
temper which has made the work and to see what is well done therein and what it
signifies. For him a song by Shakespeare which seems so free and living, as
remote from any conscious purpose as rain that falls in a garden or as the
lights of evening, discovers itself as the rhythmic
<br><font color="green">{ms, 617}</font>
<br> speech of an emotion otherwise incommunicable, or at least so fitly. But to
approach the temper which has made art is an act of reverence before the
performance of which many conventions must be first put off for certainly that
inmost region will never yield its secret to one who is enmeshed with profanities.</p>
<p> Chief among these profanities Stephen set the antique principle that the end
of art is to instruct, to elevate, and to amuse. &ldquo;I am unable to find even
a trace of this Puritanic conception of the esthetic purpose in the definition
which Aquinas has given of beauty&rdquo; he wrote &ldquo;or in anything which he
has written concerning the beautiful. The qualifications he expects for beauty
are in fact of so abstract and common a character that it is quite impossible
for even the most violent partizan to use the Aquinatian theory with the object
of attacking any work of art that we possess from the hand of any artist
whatsoever&rdquo;. This recognition of the beautiful in virtue of the most abstract relations
<br><font color="green">{ms, 618}</font>
<br> afforded by an object to which the term could be applied so far from giving
any support to a commandment of <u>Noli Tangere</u> was itself no more than a
just sequence from the taking-off of all interdictions from the artist. The
limits of decency suggest themselves somewhat too readily to the modern
speculator and their effect is to encourage the profane mind to very futile
jurisdiction. For it cannot be urged too strongly on public mind that the
tradition of art is with the artists and that
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">even</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
if
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">these</span></span>
<font color="black">they</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
do not make it their invariable practice to outrage these limits of decency the
public
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">mind</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
has no right to conclude therefrom that they do not arrogate for themselves an
entire liberty to do so if they choose. It is as absurd, wrote the fiery-hearted
revolutionary, for a criticism itself established upon homilies to prohibit the
elective courses of the artist
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">in his
revelation of the
beautiful</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> as it
would be for a police-magistrate to prohibit
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">the sum
of any</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> two sides of
a triangle from being together greater than the third side.</p>
<p> In fine the truth is not that the artist requires a document of licence
<br><font color="green">{ms, 619}</font>
<br> from householders entitling him to proceed in this or that fashion but that
every age must look for its sanction to its poets and philosophers. The poet is
the intense centre of the life of his age to which he stands in a relation than
which none can be more vital. He alone is capable
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">to</span></span> of absorbing in
himself the life that surrounds him and of flinging it abroad again amid
planetary music. When the poetic phenomenon is signalled in the heavens,
exclaimed this heaven-ascending essayist, it is time for the critics to verify
their calculations in accordance with it. It is time for them to acknowledge
that here the imagination has contemplated intensely the truth of the being of
the visible world and that beauty, the splendour of truth, has been born. The
age, though it bury itself fathoms deep in formulas and machinery, has need of
these realities which alone give and sustain life and it must await from those
chosen centres of vivification the force to live, the security for life which can come to it only from them. Thus
<br><font color="green">{ms, 620}</font>
<br> the spirit of man makes a continual affirmation.</p>
<p> Except for the eloquent and arrogant peroration Stephen&apos;s essay was a
careful exposition of a carefully meditated theory of esthetic. When he had
finished it he found it necessary to change the title from &ldquo;Drama and
Life&rdquo; to &ldquo;Art and Life&rdquo; for he had occupied himself so much
with securing the foundations that he had not left himself space enough to raise
the complete structure. This strangely unpopular manifesto was traversed by the
two brothers phrase by phrase and word by word and at last pronounced flawless
at all points. It was then safely laid by until the time should come for its
public appearance. Besides Maurice two other well-wishers had an advance view of
it; these were Stephen&apos;s mother and his friend Madden. Madden had not asked
for it directly but at end of a conversation in which Stephen had recounted
sarcastically his visit to Clonliffe College he had vaguely wondered what state
of mind could produce such irreverences and Stephen had at once offered him the
manuscript saying &ldquo;This is the first of my explosives&rdquo;. The following evening Madden had
<br><font color="green">{ms, 621}</font>
<br> returned the manuscript and praised the writing highly. Part of it had been
too deep for him, he said, but he could see that it was beautifully written.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You know Stevie, he said (Madden had a brother Stephen
and he sometimes used this familiar form) you always told me I was a country
<u>buachail</u> and I can&apos;t understand you mystical fellows &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Mystical? said Stephen &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; About the planets and the stars, you know. Some of the
fellows in the League belong to the mystical set here. They&apos;d understand quick enough &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But there&apos;s nothing mystical in it I tell you. I
have written it carefully &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, I can see you have. It&apos;s beautifully written. But
I&apos;m sure it will be above the heads of your audience &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You don&apos;t mean to tell me. Madden, you think
it&apos;s a &lsquo;flowery&rsquo; composition! &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I know you&apos;ve thought it out. But you are a poet, aren&apos;t you? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I have &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. written verse &nbsp;.
&nbsp;. &nbsp;. if that&apos;s what you mean &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do you know Hughes is a poet too? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Hughes! &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes. He writes for our paper, you know. Would you like to see some of his poetry? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Why, could you show me any?
<br><font color="green">{ms, 622}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It so happens I have one in my pocket. There&apos;s one
in this week&apos;s <u>Sword</u> too. Here it is: read it &mdash;
<br>Stephen took the paper and read a piece of verse entitled <u>Mo N&aacute;ire
T&ugrave;</u> (My shame art thou). There were four stanzas in the piece and each
stanza ended with the Irish phrase &mdash; <u>Mo N&aacute;ire T&ugrave;</u>, the
last word, of course, rhyming to an English word in the corresponding line. The piece began:</p>
<p class="set">What! Shall the rippling tongue of Gaels
<br> Give way before the Saxon slang!</p>
<p class="flush">and in lines
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">full</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
of excited patriotism proceeded to pour scorn upon the Irishman who would not
learn the ancient language of his native land. Stephen did not remark anything
in the lines except
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">the
frequency of</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> such
contracted forms as &ldquo;e&apos;en&rdquo; &ldquo;ne&apos;er&rdquo; and
&ldquo;thro&apos;&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;even&rdquo; &ldquo;never&rdquo; and
&ldquo;through&rdquo; and he handed back the paper to Madden without offering any comment on the verse.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I suppose you don&apos;t like that because it&apos;s too
Irish but you&apos;ll like this, I suppose, because it&apos;s that mystical,
idealistic kind of writing you poets indulge in. Only you musn&apos;t say I let you see &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, no &mdash;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 623}</font>
<br>
<br>Madden took from his inside pocket a sheet of foolscap folded in four on
which was inscribed a piece of verse, consisting of four stanzas of eight lines
each, entitled &lsquo;My Ideal<a target="foot" id="fyz0068">&ordm;</a>. Each
stanza began with the words &ldquo;Art thou real?.&rdquo; The poem told of the
poet&apos;s troubles in a &lsquo;vale of woe&rsquo; and of the
&lsquo;heart-throbs&rsquo; which these troubles caused him. It told of
&lsquo;weary nights&apos; and &lsquo;anxious days&rsquo; and of an
&lsquo;unquenchable desire&rsquo; for an excellence beyond that &lsquo;which
earth can give&rsquo;. After this mournful idealism the final stanza offered a
certain consolatory, hypothetical alternative to the poet in his woes: it began somewhat hopefully:</p>
<p class="set">Art thou real, my Ideal?
<br> Wilt thou ever come to me
<br> In the soft and gentle twilight
<br> With your baby on your knee?</p>
<p class="flush">The
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">combined</span></span> effect of
this apparition on Stephen was a long staining blush of anger. The tawdry lines,
the futile change of number, the ludicrous waddling approach of Hughes&apos;s
&ldquo;Ideal&rdquo; weighed down by an inexplicable infant, combined to cause
him a sharp agony in the sensitive region. Again he handed back the verse without saying a
<br><font color="green">{ms, 624}</font>
<br> word of praise or of blame but he decided that attendance in Mr
Hughes&apos;s class was no longer possible for him and he was foolish enough to
regret
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">having
yielded to</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> the impulse for sympathy from a friend.</p>
<p> When a demand for intelligent sympathy goes unanswered
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">it
is too sternly</span></span> <font color="black">he is a too
stern</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> disciplinarian
who blames himself for having offered a dullard an opportunity
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">f</span></span> to participate in
the warmer movement of a more highly organised life. So Stephen regarded his
loans of manuscripts as elaborate flag-practices with
phrases.<a target="foot" id="fyz0069">&ordm;</a> He did not consider his mother
a dullard but the result of his second disappointment in the search for
appreciation
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">was
that he was</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> enabled
to place the blame on the shoulders of others &mdash; not on his own: he had
enough responsibilities thereon already, inherited and acquired. His mother had
not asked to see the manuscript: she had continued to iron the clothes on the
kitchen-table without the least suspicion of the agitation in the mind of
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the</span></span>
<font color="black">her</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
son. He
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">had</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
sat on three or four kitchen chairs, one after another, and had dangled his legs unsuccessfully from all free corners
<br><font color="green">{ms, 625}</font>
<br> of the table. At last, unable to control his agitation, he asked her
point-blank would she like him to read out his essay.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, yes,
Stephen<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">:</span></span> &mdash; if
you don&apos;t mind my ironing a few things &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, I don&apos;t mind &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen read out the essay to her slowly and emphatically and when he had
finished reading she said it was very beautifully written but that as there were
some things in it which she couldn&apos;t follow, would he mind reading it to
her again and explaining some of it. He read it over again and allowed himself a
long exposition of his theories, garnished with many crude striking allusions
with which he hoped to drive it home the
better.<a target="foot" id="fyz0070">&ordm;</a> His mother who had never
suspected probably that &ldquo;beauty&rdquo; could be anything more than a
convention of the drawingroom or a natural antecedent to marriage and married
life was surprised to see the extraordinary honour which her son conferred upon
it. Beauty, to the mind of such a woman, was often a synonym for licentious ways and probably for this reason she was
<br><font color="green">{ms, 626}</font>
<br> relieved to find that the excesses of this new worship were supervised by a
recognised saintly authority. However as the essayist&apos;s recent habits were
not very re-assuring she decided to combine a discreet motherly solicitude with
an interest, which without being open to the accusation of factitiousness was at
first intended as a compliment. While she was nicely folding a handkerchief she said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What does Ibsen write, Stephen? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Plays &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I never heard of his name before. Is he alive at present? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, he is. But, you know, in Ireland people don&apos;t
know much about what is going on out in Europe &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He must be a great writer from what you say of him &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Would you like to read some of his plays, mother. I have some &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes. I would like to read the best one. What is the best one? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I don&apos;t know &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But do you really want to read Ibsen? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I do, really &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; To see whether I am reading dangerous authors or not, is that why? &mdash;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 627}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, Stephen, answered his mother with a brave
prevarication. I think you&apos;re old enough now to know what is right and what
is wrong without my dictating to you what you are to read &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I think so too &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But I&apos;m
surprised to hear you ask about Ibsen. I didn&apos;t imagine you took the least interest in these matters &mdash;</p>
<p> Mrs Daedalus pushed her iron smoothly over a white petticoat in time to the current of her memory.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, of course, I don&apos;t speak about it but I&apos;m
not so indifferent &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. Before I married your father I used
to read a great deal. I used to take an interest in all kinds of new plays &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But since you married neither of you so much as bought a single book! &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, you see, Stephen, your father is not like you: he
takes no interest in that sort of thing &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. When he was
young he told me he used to spend all his time out after the hounds or rowing on
the Lee. He went in for athletics &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I suspect what he went in for, said Stephen irrevently. I
know he doesn&apos;t care a jack straw about what I think or what I write &mdash;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 628}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He wants to see you make your way, get on in life, said
his mother defensively. That&apos;s his ambition. You shouldn&apos;t blame him for that &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, no, no. But it may not be my ambition. That kind of
life I often loathe: I find it ugly and cowardly &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Of course life isn&apos;t what I used to think it was
when I was a young girl. That&apos;s why I would like to read some great writer,
to see what ideal of life he has &mdash; amn&apos;t I right in saying &ldquo;ideal&rdquo;? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, but &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Because sometimes &mdash; not that I grumble at the lot
Almighty God has given me and I have more or less a happy life with your father
&mdash; but sometimes I feel that I want to leave this actual life and enter another &mdash; for a time &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But that is wrong: that is the great mistake everyone
makes. Art is not an escape from life! &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You evidently weren&apos;t listening to what I said or
else you didn&apos;t understand what I said. Art is not an escape from life.
It&apos;s just the very opposite. Art, on the contrary, is the very central
<br><font color="green">{ms, 629}</font>
<br> expression of life. An artist is not a fellow who dangles a mechanical
heaven before the public. The priest does that. The artist affirms out of the
fulness of his own life, he creates &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. Do you understand? &mdash;</p>
<p> And so on. A day or two afterwards Stephen gave his mother a few of the
plays to read. She read them with great interest and found Nora Helmer a
charming character. Dr Stockmann she admired but her admiration was naturally
checked by her son&apos;s light-heartedly blasphemous description of that stout
burgher as &lsquo;Jesus in a frock-coat&rsquo;. But the play which she preferred
to all others was the &lsquo;<u>Wild Duck</u>. Of it she spoke readily and on
her own initiative: it had moved her deeply. Stephen, to escape a charge of
hot-headedness and partizanship, did not encourage her to
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">an</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
open record of her feelings.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I hope you&apos;re not going to mention Little Nell in the <u>Old Curiosity Shop</u> &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Of course I like Dickens too but I can see a great
difference between Little Nell and that poor little creature &mdash; what is her name? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Hedvig Ekdal? &mdash;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 630}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Hedvig, yes &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. It&apos;s so sad:
it&apos;s terrible to read it even. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. I quite agree with
you that Ibsen is a wonderful writer &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Really? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, really. His plays have impressed me very much &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do you think he is immoral &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Of course, you know, Stephen, he treats of subjects
&nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. of which I know very little myself &nbsp;. &nbsp;.
&nbsp;. subjects &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Subjects which, you think, should never be talked about? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, that was the old people&apos;s idea but I
don&apos;t know if it was right. I don&apos;t know if it is good for people to
be entirely ignorant &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Then why not treat them openly? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I think it might do harm to some people &mdash;
uneducated, unbalanced people. People&apos;s natures are so different. You perhaps &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, never mind me. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. Do you think
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the</span></span>
<font color="black">these</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
plays are unfit for people to read? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, I think they&apos;re magnificent plays indeed &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And not immoral? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I think that Ibsen &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. has an
extraordinary knowledge of human nature &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. And I think that human nature is a
<br><font color="green">{ms, 631}</font>
<br> very extraordinary thing sometimes &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen had to be contented with this well-worn generality as he recognised
in it a genuine sentiment. His mother, in fact, had so far evangelised herself
that she undertook the
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">duty</span></span>
<font color="black">duties</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
of missioner to the heathen; that is to say, she offered some of the plays to
her husband to read. He listened to her praises with a somewhat startled air,
observing no feature of her face, his eyeglass screwed into an astonished eye
and his mouth poised in na&iuml;f surprise. He was always interested in
novelties, childishly interested and receptive, and this new name and the
phenomena it had produced in his house were novelties for him. He made no
attempt to discredit his wife&apos;s novel development but he resented both that
she should have achieved it unaided by him and that she should be able thereby
to act as intermediary between him and his son. He condemned as inopportune
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">but</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
not discredited his son&apos;s wayward researches into strange literature and,
though a similar taste was not discoverable in him, he was prepared to commit
that most pious of heroisms namely the extension of one&apos;s sympathies late
in life in deference to the advocacy of a junior. Following
<br><font color="green">{ms, 632}</font>
<br> the custom of certain old-fashioned people who can never understand why
their patronage or judgments should put men of letters into a rage he chose his
play from the title. A metaphor is a vice that attracts
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">the
dull mind</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> by reason
of its aptness and repels the too serious mind by reason
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">of</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
its falsity and danger so that, after all, there is something to be said,
nothing voluminous perhaps, but at least a word of concession for that class of
society which in literature as in everything else goes always with its four feet
on the ground. Mr Daedalus, anyhow, suspected that <u>A Doll&apos;s House</u>
would be a triviality in the manner of <u>Little Lord Fauntleroy</u> and, as he
had never been even unofficially a member of that international society which
collects and examines psychical phenomena, he decided that <u>Ghosts</u> would
probably be some
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">interesting</span></span>
<font color="black">uninteresting</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
story about a haunted house. He chose the <u>League of Youth</u> in which he
hoped to find the reminiscences of like-minded roysterers and, after reading
through <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">too</span></span> two acts
of provincial intrigue abandoned the enterprise as tedious. He had promised himself
<br><font color="green">{ms, 633}</font>
<br> arguing from the alienated attitudes and half-deferential half-words of
pressmen at the mention of the name, a certain extravagance, perhaps an
anomalous torridity of the North and
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">hi</span></span> though the name
beneath Ibsen&apos;s photograph never failed to reawaken his sense of wonder,
the upright line of the &ldquo;b&rdquo; running so strangely beside the initial
letter as to suspend
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">one</span></span>
<font color="black">the
mind</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> amid
incertitudes for some oblivious instants, the final impression made upon him by
the figure to which the name was affixed, a figure which he associated with a
solicitor&apos;s or a stockbroker&apos;s office in Dame St, was an impression of
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">disappointment mixed</span></span>
relief mixed with disappointment, the relief for his son&apos;s sake prevailing
dutifully over his own slight but real disappointment. So that from neither of
Stephen&apos;s <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">pap</span></span>
parents did respectability get full allegiance.</p>
<p> A week before the date fixed for the reading of the paper Stephen consigned
a small packet covered with neat characters into the Auditor&apos;s hands.
McCann smacked his lips and put the manuscript into
<br><font color="green">{ms, 634}</font>
<br> the inside pocket of his coat:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I&apos;ll read this tonight and I&apos;ll see you here at
the same hour tomorrow. I think I know all that is in it beforehand &mdash;</p>
<p> The next
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">evening</span></span>
<font color="black">afternoon</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> McCann reported:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, I&apos;ve read your paper &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Brilliantly written &mdash; a bit strong, it seems to me.
However I gave it to the President this morning to read &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What for? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; All the papers must be submitted to him first for approval, you know &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do you mean to say, said Stephen scornfully, that the
President must approve of my paper before I can read it to your society! &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes. He&apos;s the Censor &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What a valuable society! &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Why not? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It&apos;s only child&apos;s play, man. You remind me of children in the nursery &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Can&apos;t be helped. We must take what we can get &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Why not put up the shutters at once? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, it is valuable. It trains young men for public
speaking &mdash; for the bar and the political platform &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Mr Daniel could say as much for his charades &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I daresay he could &mdash;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 635}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; So this Censor of yours is inspecting my essay? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well. He&apos;s liberal-minded &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ay &mdash;
<br>While the two young men were holding this conversation on the steps of the
Library, Whelan, the college orator
<font color="red"><sup><small>|s1</small></sup></font><font color="black">offering
him the grapes, &lsquo;I never eat Muscatel
grapes,&rsquo;</font><font color="red"><sup><small>s1|</small></sup></font> came
up to them. This suave rotund young man,
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">wh</span></span>
<font color="black">who</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
was the Secretary of the Society, was reading for the Bar. His eyes regarded
Stephen now with mild, envious horror and he forgot all his baggage from Attica:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Your essay is tabu, Daedalus &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Who said so? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The Very Reverend Dr Dillon &mdash;</p>
<p> <font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">The
delivery of</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> This
news was followed by a silence during which Whelan slowly moistened his lower
lip with saliva from his tongue and McCann made ready to shrug his shoulders &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Where is the damned old
fool<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span>? said the essayist promptly &mdash;</p>
<p> Whelan blushed and pointed his thumb over his shoulder. Stephen in a moment
was half across the quadrangle. McCann called after him:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Where are you going? &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen halted but
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">discovered</span></span><font color="black">,
discovering</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> that he
was too angry to trust himself to speak, he merely pointed in the direction
<br><font color="green">{ms, 636}</font>
<br> of the College, and went forward quickly.</p>
<p> So after all his trouble, thinking out his essay and composing his periods,
this old fogey was about to prohibit it! His indignation settled into a mood of
politic contempt as he crossed the Green. The clock in the hall of the College
pointed to half past three as Stephen addressed the
doddering<a target="foot" id="fyz0071">&ordm;</a> door-porter. He had to speak
twice, the second time with a distinct, separated enunciation, for the door-porter was rather stupid and deaf:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Can&mdash;I&mdash;see&mdash;the&mdash;President? &mdash;</p>
<p> The President was not in his room: he was saying his office in the garden.
Stephen went out into the garden and went down towards the ball-alley. A small
figure wrapped in a loose Spanish-looking black cloak presented its back to him
near the far end of the side-walk. The figure went on slowly to the end of the
walk, halted there for a few moments, and then turning about presented to him
over the edge of a breviary a neat round head covered with curly grey hair and a
very wrinkled face of an indescribable colour: the upper part was the colour of
putty and the lower part was shot with slate colour. The President came slowly
down the side-walk, in his capacious cloak, noiselessly moving his grey lips as he said his office. At the end
<br><font color="green">{ms, 637}</font>
<br> of the walk he halted again and looked inquiringly at Stephen. Stephen
raised his cap and said &ldquo;Good evening, sir.&rdquo; The President answered
with the smile which a pretty girl gives when she receives some compliment which
puzzles her &mdash; a &lsquo;winning&rsquo; smile:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What can I do for you? he asked in a
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">wonderfully</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
rich deep
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">calculated</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
voice &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I understand, said Stephen, that you wish to see me about
my essay &mdash; an essay I have written for the Debating Society &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, you are Mr Daedalus, said the President more seriously but still agreeably &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Perhaps I am disturbing &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, I have finished my office, said the President &mdash;</p>
<p> He <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">started</span></span> began
to walk slowly down the path at such a pace as implied invitation. Stephen kept therefore at his side.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I admire the style of your paper, he said firmly, very
much but I do not approve at all of your theories. I am afraid I cannot allow
you to read your paper before the Society &mdash;</p>
<p> They walked on to the end of the path, without speaking. Then Stephen
<br><font color="green">{ms, 638}</font>
<br> said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Why, sir? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I cannot encourage you to to disseminate such theories
among the young men in this college &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You think my theory of art is a false one? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It is certainly not the theory of art which is respected in this college &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I agree with that, said Stephen &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; On the contrary, it represents the sum-total of modern
unrest and modern freethinking. The authors you quote as examples, those you
seem to admire &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Aquinas? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Not Aquinas; I have to speak of him in a moment. But
Ibsen, Maeterlinck &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. these atheistic writers &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You do not like &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I am surprised that any student of this college could
find anything to admire in such writers, writers who usurp the name of poet, who
openly profess their atheistic doctrines and fill the minds of their readers
with all the garbage of modern society. That is not art &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Even admitting the corruption you speak of I see nothing
unlawful in an examination of corruption &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, it may be lawful &mdash; for the scientist,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 639}</font>
<br> for the reformer &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Why not for the poet too? Dante surely examines and upbraids society &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ah, yes, said the President explanatorily, with a moral
purpose in view: Dante was a great poet &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ibsen is also a great poet &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You cannot compare Dante and Ibsen &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I am not doing so &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Dante, the lofty upholder of beauty, the greatest of
Italian poets, and Ibsen, the writer above and beyond all others, Ibsen and
Zola, who seek to degrade their art, who pander to a corrupt taste &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But <u>you</u> are comparing them! &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, you cannot compare them. One has a high moral
aim<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span> &mdash; he
ennobles the human race: the other degrades it &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The lack of a specific code of moral conventions does not
degrade the poet, in my opinion &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ah, if he were to examine even the basest things, said
the President with a suggestion of tolerance in store,
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">that</span></span>
<font color="black">it</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
would be different if he were to examine and then show men the way to purify themselves &mdash;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 640}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That is for the Salvationists, said Stephen &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do you mean &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I mean that Ibsen&apos;s account of modern society is as
genuinely ironical as Newman&apos;s account of English Protestant morality and belief &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That may be, said the President appeased by the conjunction &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And as free from any missionary intention &mdash;</p>
<p> The President was silent.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It is a question of temper. Newman could refrain from
writing his <u>Apologia</u> for twenty years &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But when he came out on him! said the President with a
chuckle and an expressive incompletion of the phrase. Poor Kingsley! &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It is all a question of temper &mdash; one&apos;s
attitude towards society whether one is poet or critic &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, yes &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ibsen has the temper of an archangel &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It may be: but I have always believed that he was a
fierce realist like Zola with some kind of a new doctrine to preach &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You were mistaken, sir &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; This is the general opinion &mdash;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 641}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A mistaken one &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I understood he had some doctrine or other &mdash; a
social doctrine, free living, and an artistic doctrine, unbridled licence
&mdash; so much so that the public will not tolerate his plays on the stage and
that you cannot name him even in mixed society &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Where have you seen this? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, everywhere &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. in the papers &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; This is a serious argument, said Stephen reprovingly &mdash;</p>
<p> The President far from resenting this hardy statement seemed to bow to its
justice: no-one could have a poorer opinion of the half-educated journalism of
the present day than he had and he certainly would not allow a newspaper to
dictate criticism to him. At the same time there was such a unanimity of opinion
everywhere about Ibsen that he imagined &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; May I ask you if you have read much of his writing? asked Stephen &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, no &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. I must say I &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; May I ask you if you have read even a single line?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, no &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I must admit &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And surely you do not think it right to pass judgment on
a writer
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">a
single line</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> of whose
<br><font color="green">{ms, 642}</font>
<br> writing you have never read &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, I must admit that &mdash;
<br>Stephen hesitated after this first success. The President resumed:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I am very interested in the enthusiasm you show for this
writer. I have never had any opportunity to read Ibsen myself but I know that he
enjoys a great reputation. What you say of him, I must confess, alters my view
of him considerably. Some day perhaps I shall &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I can lend you some of the plays if you like, sir, said
Stephen with imprudent simplicity &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Can you indeed? &mdash;
<br>Both paused for an instant: then &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You will see that he is a great poet and a great artist, said Stephen &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I shall be very interested, said the President with an
amiable intention, to read some of his work for myself. I certainly shall &mdash;
<br>Stephen had an impulse to say &ldquo;Excuse me for five minutes while I send
a telegram to Christiania&rdquo; but he resisted his impulse. During the
interview he had occasion more than once to put severe shackles on this importunate devil within him whose
<br><font color="green">{ms, 643}</font>
<br> appetite was on edge for the farcical. The President was beginning to
exhibit the liberal side of his character, but with priestly cautiousness.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, I shall be most interested. Your opinions are
somewhat strange. Do you intend to publish this essay? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Publish it! &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I should not care for anyone to identify the ideas in
your essay with the teaching in our college. We receive this college in trust &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But you are not supposed to be responsible for everything
a student in your college thinks or says &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, of course not &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. but, reading
your essay and knowing you came from our college, people would suppose that we inculcated such ideas here &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Surely a student of this college can pursue a special line of study if he chooses &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It is just that which we always try to encourage in our
students but your study, it seems to me, leads you to adopt very revolutionary
&nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. very revolutionary theories &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; If I were to publish tomorrow a very revolutionary
pamphlet on the means of avoiding potato-blight would you consider yourself responsible for my theory? &mdash;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 644}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, no, of course not &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. but then
this is not a school of agriculture &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Neither is it a school of dramaturgy, answered Stephen &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Your argument is not so conclusive as it seems, said the
President after a short pause. However I am glad to see that your attitude
towards your subject is so genuinely serious. At the same time you must admit
that this theory you have &mdash; if pushed to its logical conclusion &mdash;
would emancipate the poet from all moral laws. I notice too that in your essay
you allude satirically to what you call the &lsquo;antique&rsquo; theory &mdash;
the theory, namely, that the drama should have special ethical aims, that it
should instruct, elevate and amuse. I suppose you mean Art for Art&apos; sake &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I have only pushed to its logical conclusion the
definition Aquinas has given of the beautiful &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Aquinas? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Pulcra sunt quae visa placent</u>. He seems to regard
the beautiful as that which satisfies the esthetic appetite and nothing more
&mdash; that the mere apprehension of which pleases &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But he means the sublime &mdash; that which leads man upwards &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; His remark would apply to a Dutch painter&apos;s representation of a plate of onions &mdash;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 645}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, no that which pleases the soul in a state of
sanctification, the soul seeking
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">its</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
spiritual good &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Aquinas&apos; definition of the good is an unsafe basis
of operations: it is very wide. He seems to me almost ironical in his treatment of the &ldquo;appetites&rdquo; &mdash;
<br>The President scratched his head a little dubiously:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Of course Aquinas is an extraordinary mind he murmured,
the greatest doctor of the Church: but he requires immense interpretation. There
are parts of Aquinas which no priest would think of announcing in the pulpit &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But what if I, as an artist, refuse to accept the
cautions which are considered necessary for those who are still in a state of original stupidity? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I believe you are sincere but I will tell you this as an
older human being than you are and as a man of some experience: the cult of
beauty is difficult. Estheticism often begins well only to end in the vilest
abominations of which &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Ad pulcritudinem tria requiruntur</u> &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It is insidious, it creeps into the mind, little by little &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Integritas, consonantia, claritas</u>. There seems to
me to be effulgence in that theory instead of danger. The intelligent nature apprehends it at once &mdash;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 646}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; S. Thomas of course &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Aquinas is certainly on the side of the capable artist. I
hear no mention of instruction or elevation &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; To support Ibsenism on Aquinas seems to me somewhat
paradoxical. Young men often substitute brilliant paradox for conviction &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; My conviction has led me nowhere: my theory states itself &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ah, you are a paradoxist, said the President smiling with
gentle satisfaction. I can see that &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. And there is another
thing &mdash; a question of taste perhaps rather than anything else &mdash;
which makes me think your theory juvenile. You don&apos;t seem to understand the
importance of the classical drama &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. Of course in his own
line Ibsen also may be an admirable writer &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But, allow me, sir, said Stephen. My entire esteem is for
the classical temper in art. Surely you must remember that I said &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; So far as I can remember, said the President lifting to
the pale sky a faintly smiling face on which memory endeavoured to bring a
vacuous amiability to book, so far as I can remember you treated the Greek drama
&mdash; the classical temper &mdash; very summarily indeed, with a kind of
juvenile &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. impudence, shall I say? &mdash;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 647}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But the Greek drama is heroic, monstrous. Eschylus is not a classical writer! &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I told you you were a paradoxist, Mr Daedalus. You wish
to upset centuries of literary criticism by a brilliant turn of speech, by a paradox &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I use the word &lsquo;classical&rsquo; in a certain
sense, with a certain definite meaning, that is all &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But you cannot use any terminology you like &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I have not changed the terms. I have explained them. By
&lsquo;classical&rsquo; I mean the slow elaborative patience of the art of
satisfaction. The heroic, the fabulous, I call romantic. Menander perhaps, I
don&apos;t know &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; All the world recognises Eschylus as a supreme classical dramatist &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, the world of professors whom he helps to feed &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Competent critics, said the President severely, men of
the highest culture. And even the public themselves can appreciate him. I have
read, I think, in some &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. a newspaper, I think it was
&nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. that Irving, the great actor, Henry Irving produced one
of his plays in London and that the London public flocked to see it &mdash;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 648}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; From curiosity. The London public will flock to see
anything new or strange. If Irving were to give an imitation of a hard-boiled egg they would flock to see it &mdash;
<br>The President received this absurdity with unflinching gravity and when he
had come to the end of the path, he halted for a few instants before leading the way to the house &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I do not predict much success for your advocacy in this
country, he said generally. Our people have their faith and they are happy. They
are faithful to their Church and the Church is sufficient for them.
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">Even</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
For the profane world these modern pessimistic writers are a little too &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. too much &mdash;
<br>With his
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">scornful</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
mind scampering from Clonliffe College to Mullingar Stephen strove to make
himself ready for some definite compact.
<a name="jn1037g" href="../../FF/unbs/jn1all.htm#jn1037g">The President had
carefully brought the interview into the region of chattiness.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, we are happy. Even the English people have begun to
see the folly of these morbid tragedies, these wretched unhappy, unhealthy
tragedies. I read the other day that some playwright had to change the last act of his
<br><font color="green">{ms, 649}</font>
<br> play because it ended in catastrophe &mdash; some sordid murder
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">of</span></span> or suicide or death &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Why not make death a capital offence? said Stephen.</a>
People are very timorous. It would be so much simpler to take the bull by the horns and have done with it &mdash;
<br>When they reached the hall of the College the President stood at the foot of
the staircase before going up to his room. Stephen waited silently:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Begin to look at the bright side of things, Mr Daedalus.
Art should be healthy first of all &mdash;
<br>The President gathered in his soutane for the ascent with a slow hermaphroditic gesture:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I must say you have defended your theory very well
&nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. very well indeed. I do not agree with it, of course, but
I can see you have thought it all out carefully beforehand. You have thought it out carefully? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, I have &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It is very interesting &mdash; a little paradoxical at
times and a little juvenile &mdash; but I have been very interested in it. I am
sure too that when your studies have brought you further afield you will be able to amend it so as to
<br><font color="green">{ms, 650}</font>
<br> fit in more with recognised facts; I am sure you will be able to apply it
better then &mdash; when your mind has undergone a course of &nbsp;. &nbsp;.
&nbsp;. regular &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. training and you have a larger, wider
sense of &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. comparison &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &mdash;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 650}</font>
<br> XIX
<br>The President&apos;s indefinite manner of closing the interview had left
some doubts in Stephen&apos;s mind; he was unable to decide whether the retreat
upstairs was a breach of friendly relations or a politic confession of
inability. However as no definite prohibition had been pronounced upon him he
determined to proceed calmly on his way until he encountered a substantial
check. When he met McCann again he smiled and waited to be questioned. His
account of the interview went the rounds of the undergraduate classes and he was
much amused to observe the startled expression of many pairs of eyes which, to
judge from their open humiliated astonishment, appeared to behold in him
characteristics of a moral Nelson. Maurice listened to his brother&apos;s
account of his battle with recognised authority but he made no remark upon it.
Stephen
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">himself</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>,
in default of
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext"><font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">unread</span></font></span></span>
another&apos;s service, began to annotate the incident copiously, expanding
every suggestive phase of the interview. He consumed much imaginative fuel in
this diverting chase of the presumable and his
<br><font color="green">{ms, 652}</font>
<br> rapid changeful courses kindled in him a flame of discontent for Maurice&apos;s impassiveness:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Are you listening to me at all? Do you know what I&apos;m talking about? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, it&apos;s all right &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. You can
read your paper, can&apos;t you? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes. Of course I can &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. But
what&apos;s up with you? Are you bored? Are you thinking of anything? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well &nbsp;. &nbsp;. yes, I am &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;
<a name="jn1038k" href="../../FF/unbs/jn1all.htm#jn1038k">I have found out why I
feel different this evening. Why, do you think? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I don&apos;t know. Tell us &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I have been walking
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">on</span></span>
<font color="black">from</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
the ball of my left foot.</a> I usually walk from the ball of my right foot &mdash;
<br>Stephen looked sideways at the speaker&apos;s solemn face to see if there
were any signs thereon of a satirical mood but, finding only steadfast self-analysis, he said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Indeed? That&apos;s damned interesting &mdash;</p>
<p> On the Saturday night
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">which
had been</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> fixed for
the reading of the paper Stephen found himself facing the benches in the
Physics&apos; Theatre. While the minutes were being read out by the secretary he
had time to observe his father&apos;s eyeglass glimmering high up near the window
<br><font color="green">{ms, 653}</font>
<br> and he divined more than saw the burly form of Mr Casey hard by that
observant centre. He could not see his brother but in the front benches he
noticed Father Butt and McCann and two other priests. The Chairman was Mr Keane,
the professor of English composition. When the formal business was ended the
chairman called on the essayist to read his paper and Stephen stood up. He
waited until a compliment of discreet applause had subsided
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">and</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
until McCann&apos;s energetic hands had given four resounding
claps<a target="foot" id="fyz0072">&ordm;</a> as a concluding solo of welcome.
Then he read out his essay. He read it quietly and distinctly, involving every
hardihood of thought or expression in an envelope of low innocuous melody. He
read it on calmly to the end: his reading was never once interrupted with
applause: and when he had read out the final sentences in a tone of metallic clearness he sat down.</p>
<p> The first single thought that emerged through a swift mood of confusion was
the bright conviction that he should never have written his essay. While he was
gloomily taking counsel with himself as to whether he should fling
<br><font color="green">{ms, 654}</font>
<br> the manuscript at their heads<a target="foot" id="fyz0073">&ordm;</a> and
march home or remain as he was shading his face from the light of the candles on
the Chairman&apos;s table he became aware that the discussion on his paper had
begun: this discovery surprised him. Whelan, the orator of the College, was
proposing a vote of thanks and wagging his head in time to ornate phrases.
Stephen wondered did anyone else observe the infantile movements of the
orator&apos;s
mouth<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">;
he</span></span><font color="black">.
He</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> wished that
Whelan would shut his jaws with a clap so as to reveal the presence of solid
teeth; the mere sound of the speech reminded him of the noise Nurse Sarah used
to make when she mashed Isabel&apos;s bread-and-milk in the
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">blue</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
bowl which his mother now used to hold starch. But he at once corrected himself
for such a manner of criticism and strove to listen to the words of the orator.
Whelan was profusely admiring: he felt (he said) during the reading of Mr
Daedalus&apos; essay as though he had been listening to the discourse of angels
and did not know the language that they spoke. It was with some diffidence that he
<br><font color="green">{ms, 655}</font>
<br> ventured to criticise but it was evident that Mr Daedalus did not
understand the beauty of the Attic theatre. He pointed out that Eschylus was an
imperishable name and he predicted that the drama of the Greeks would outlive
many civilisations. Stephen noticed that
<a name="jn1037h" href="../../FF/unbs/jn1all.htm#jn1037h">Whelan said
&lsquo;yisterday&rsquo; twice instead of &lsquo;yesterday&rsquo; in imitation of
Father Butt</a> who was a South of England man and he speculated as to whether
it was a Dominican preacher or a Jesuit preacher
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">that</span></span>
<font color="black">who</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
had given the orator his final phrase. &ldquo;Greek art&rdquo; said Whelan
&ldquo;is not for a time but for all times. It stands aloof, alone. It is
imperial, imperious and imperative.<a target="foot" id="fyz0074">&ordm;</a> &rdquo;</p>
<p> McCann seconded the vote of thanks which had been so ably proposed by Mr
Whelan and he desired to add his tribute to Mr Whelan&apos;s eloquent tribute to
the essayist of the night. There were perhaps many things in the paper which Mr
Daedalus had read to them with which he could not
agree<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">. Bu</span></span> but he was
not such a blind partizan of antiquity for antiquity&apos; sake as Mr Whelan
seemed to be. Modern ideas must find their expression:
<br><font color="green">{ms, 656}</font>
<br> the modern world had to face pressing problems: and he considered that any
writer who could call attention to those problems in a striking way was well
worthy of every serious person&apos;s consideration. He considered that he was
speaking for one and all of those present when he said that Mr Daedalus, by
reading his frank and earnest essay that night, had conferred a benefit on the Society.</p>
<p> The general diversion of the night began when these two opening speeches had
ended. Stephen was subjected to
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">a
fire</span></span> <font color="black">the
fires</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> of six or
seven hostile speakers. One speaker, a young man named Magee, said he was
surprised that any paper which was conceived in a spirit so hostile to the
spirit of religion itself &mdash; he did not know if Mr Daedalus understood the
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">true</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
purport of the theory he propounded &mdash; should find approval in their
society. Who but the Church had sustained and fostered the artistic temper? Had
not the drama owed its very birth to religion? That was indeed a poor theory
which tried to bolster up the dull dramas of sinful intrigues and to decry the
immortal masterpieces. Mr Magee said he did not know as
<br><font color="green">{ms, 657}</font>
<br> much about Ibsen as Mr Daedalus did &mdash; nor did he want to know
anything about him &mdash; but he knew that one of his plays was about the
sanitary condition of a bathing-place. If this was drama he did not see why some
Dublin Shakespeare should not pen an immortal work dealing with the new Main
Drainage Scheme of the Dublin Corporation. This speech was the signal for a
general attack. The essay was pronounced a jingle of meaningless words, a clever
presentation of vicious principles in the guise of artistic theories, a
reproduction of the decadent literary opinions of exhausted European capitals.
The essayist was supposed to intend parts of his essay as efforts at practical
joking: everyone knew that <u>Macbeth</u> would be famous when the unknown
authors of whom Mr Daedalus was so fond were dead and forgotten. Ancient art
loved to uphold the beautiful and the sublime: modern art might select other
themes but those who still preserved their minds uncontaminated by atheistic
poisons would know which to choose. The climax of aggressiveness was reached
when Hughes stood up. He declared in ringing Northern accents that the moral welfare of the Irish people
<br><font color="green">{ms, 658}</font>
<br> was menaced by such theories. They wanted no foreign
filth.<a target="foot" id="fyz0075">&ordm;</a> Mr Daedalus might read what
authors he liked, of course, but the Irish people had their own glorious
literature where they could always find fresh ideals to spur them on to new
patriotic endeavours. Mr Daedalus was himself a renegade from the Nationalist
ranks: he professed cosmopolitism. But a man that was of all countries was of no
country &mdash; you must first have a nation before you have art. Mr Daedalus
might do as he pleased, kneel at the shrine of Art (with a capital A), and rave
about obscure authors. In spite of
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">his</span></span>
<font color="black">any</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
hypocritical use of the name of a great doctor of the Church Ireland would be on
her guard against the insidious theory that art can be separated from morality.
If they were to have art let it be moral art, art that elevated, above all, national art,</p>
<p class="set">Kindly Irish of the Irish,
<br> Neither Saxon nor Italian.</p>
<p> When the time had come for the Chairman to sum up and to put the motion
before the house there was the usual pause. In this pause Father Butt rose and
begged leave to say a few words. The benches applauded
<br><font color="green">{ms, 659}</font>
<br> with excitement and settled themselves to hear a denunciation <u>ex
cathedra</u>. Father Butt excused himself amid cries of &ldquo;No, no&rdquo; for
detaining his audience at such an advanced hour but he thought he should enter a
word in favour of the much-abused essayist. He would be <u>advocatus diaboli</u>
and he felt the uncomfortableness of his office all the more since one of the
speakers had, not unjustly, described the language in which Mr Daedalus&apos;
essay had been couched as a language of angels. Mr Daedalus had contributed a
very striking paper, a paper which had filled the house and entertained them by
the lively discussion which it had provoked. Of course everyone could not be of
the same opinion in matters artistic.<a target="foot" id="fyz0076">&ordm;</a> Mr
Daedalus admitted the conflict between romantics and classicals as the condition
of all achievement and they had certainly proof that night that a conflict
between antagonistic theories had been able to produce such distinct
achievements as the essay itself, a remarkable piece of work, on the one hand
and the memorable attack delivered by Mr Hughes, as leader of the opposition, on
the other hand. He thought that one or two
<br><font color="green">{ms, 660}</font>
<br> of the speakers had been unduly severe with the essayist but he was
confident that the essayist was well able to take care of himself in the matter
of argument. As for the theory itself Father Butt confessed that it was a new
sensation for him to hear Thomas Aquinas quoted as an authority on esthetic
philosophy. Esthetic philosophy was
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">a</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
modern branch and, if it was anything at all, it was practical. Aquinas had
treated slightly of the beautiful but always from a theoretic standpoint. To
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">interpreted</span></span>
interpret his statements
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">practically</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
one needed a fuller knowledge than Mr Daedalus could have of his entire
theology. At the same time he would not go so far as to say that Mr Daedalus had
really, intentionally or unintentionally, misinterpreted Aquinas. But just as an
act which may be good in itself may become bad by reason of circumstances so an
object intrinsically beautiful may be vitiated by other considerations. Mr
Daedalus had chosen to consider <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">to
consider</span></span> beauty intrinsically and to neglect these other
considerations. But beauty also has its practical side. Mr Daedalus was a
passionate admirer of the artistic and such people are not always the most
practical people in the
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">wide</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
world. Father Butt
<br><font color="green">{ms, 661}</font>
<br> then reminded his audience of the story of King Alfred and the old woman
who was cooking cakes &mdash; of the theorist, that is, and of the practical
person and concluded by expressing the hope that the essayist would emulate King
Alfred and not be too severe on the practical persons who had criticised him.</p>
<p> The chairman in his summing-up speech complimented the essayist on his style
but he said the essayist had evidently forgotten that art implies selection. He
thought that the discussion on the paper had been very instructive and
<font color="red"><sup><small>|s1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">we</span></span>
<font color="black">he</font><font color="red"><sup><small>s1|</small></sup></font>
was sure they were all thankful
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">f</span></span> to Father Butt for
his clear, concise criticism. Mr Daedalus had been somewhat severely handled but
he thought that, considering the many excellences of his paper, he (the
Chairman) was well justified in asking them to agree unanimously that the best
thanks of this society
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">are</span></span>
<font color="black">were</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
due and
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">are</span></span>
<font color="black">were</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
hereby tendered to Mr Daedalus for his admirable and instructive
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">paper</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>.
The vote of thanks was passed unanimously but without enthusiasm.</p>
<p> Stephen stood up and bowed.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 662}</font>
<br> It was customary for the essayist of the night to avail himself of this
occasion for replying to his critics but Stephen contented himself with
acknowledging the vote of thanks. Some called on him for a speech but, when the
Chairman had waited in vain for a few moments, the proceedings ran on rapidly to
a close. In five minutes the Physics&apos; Theatre was empty. Downstairs in the
hall the young men were busy putting on their coats and lighting cigarettes.
Stephen looked for his father and Maurice but could see them nowhere so he set
out for home alone. At the corner of the Green he came up with a group of four
young men, Madden, Cranly, a young medical student named Temple, and a clerk in
the Custom-House. Madden caught Stephen&apos;s arm and said consolingly in private:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, old man, I told you those fellows wouldn&apos;t
understand it. I knew it was too good for them &mdash;
<br>Stephen was touched by this show of friendship but he shook his head as if
he wished to change the subject. Besides, he knew that Madden really understood very little of the paper and
<br><font color="green">{ms, 663}</font>
<br> disapproved of what he understood. When Stephen came up with the four young
men they were strolling very slowly, discussing a projected trip to Wicklow on
Easter Monday. Stephen walked beside Madden at the edge of the footpath and thus
the group advanced abreast along the wide footpath. Cranly
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">in the
centre</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> was linking
Madden and the clerk from the Custom-House. Stephen listened vaguely. Cranly was
speaking (as was his custom when he walked with other gentlemen of leisure) in a
language the base of which was Latin and the superstructure of which was composed of Irish, French and German:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Atque ad duas horas in Wicklowio venit</u> &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Damnum longum tempus prendit</u>, said the Clerk from the Custom-House.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Quando</u> &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. no, I mean &nbsp;.
&nbsp;. <u>quo in</u> &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. <u>bateau</u> &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. <u>irons-nous</u>? asked Temple</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Quo in batello</u>? said Cranly,</u>in</u> &ldquo;<u>Regina Maris</u>&rdquo; &mdash;</p>
<p> So after a little talk the young men agreed to take a trip to Wicklow on the
<u>Sea-Queen</u>. Stephen was much relieved to listen to this conversation; in a
<br><font color="green">{ms, 664}</font>
<br> few minutes the sting of his disaster was no longer felt so acutely. Cranly
at last observed Stephen walking at the edge of the path and said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;</u>Ecce orator qui in malo humore est</u> &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Non sum</u>, said Stephen &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Credo ut estis</u>, said Cranly &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Minime</u> &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Credo ut vos sanguinarius mendox estis quia facies
vestra mostrat ut vos in malo humore estis</u><a target="foot" id="fyz0077">&ordm;</a> &mdash;
<br>Madden who could not talk this language well led the group back to English.
The clerk from the Custom-House seemed to have it on his conscience to express
admiration for Stephen&apos;s style. He was a big stout young man with a lardy
face and he carried an umbrella.<a target="foot" id="fyz0078">&ordm;</a> He was
several years
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">younger</span></span>
<font color="black">older</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
than any of his companions but he had decided to read for his degree in Mental
and Moral Science. He was
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">an</span></span>
<font color="black">a</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
constant companion of Cranly&apos;s and it was the latter&apos;s eloquence which
had induced him to enter the night-classes in the college. Cranly spent
<br><font color="green">{ms, 665}</font>
<br> a great part of his time persuading young men to adopt different lines of
life. The Clerk from the Custom-House<a target="foot" id="fyz0079">&ordm;</a>
was named O&apos;Neill. He was a very amiable person, always laughing
asthmatically at Cranly&apos;s serious fooling, but he was interested to hear of
any occasion whereby he might improve himself mentally. He attended the Debating
Society and the meetings of the College Sodality because he was thus brought
into &lsquo;touch&lsquo; with University life. He was a circumspect young man
but he allowed Cranly to &lsquo;chaff&rsquo; him about girls. Stephen tried to
dissuade the company from alluding to his essay but O&apos;Neill had accepted
the occasion as one to be availed of. He asked Stephen questions such as are to
be found in the pages of young ladies&apos; confession-albums and Stephen
thought that his mental heaven must greatly resemble a confectioner&apos;s shop.
Temple was a raw Gipsy-looking youth with a shambling gait and a shambling
manner of speaking. He was from the West of Ireland and he was known to be very
revolutionary. When O&apos;Neill had spoken for some time to Cranly, who had
answered him more politely than Stephen, Temple
<br><font color="green">{ms, 666}</font>
<br> after a few false starts got in a phrase:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I think &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. was a bloody fine paper &mdash;
<br>Cranly turned a vacant face in the direction of the speaker but
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">O&apos;Neill</span></span>
<font color="black">Temple</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> continued:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Made &apos;em sit up too &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Habesne bibitum</u>? asked Cranly &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; &apos;Scuse me, sir, said
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">O&apos;Neill to</span></span>
Temple to Stephen across the intervening bodies, do you believe in Jesus &nbsp;.
&nbsp;. &nbsp;. I don&apos;t believe in Jesus, he added &mdash;
<br>Stephen laughed loudly at the tone of this statement and he continued when
Temple began to shamble through a kind of apology:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; &apos;Course I don&apos;t know &nbsp;. &nbsp;. if you
believe in Jesus &nbsp;. &nbsp;. I believe in Man &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. If you
b&apos;lieve in Jesus &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. of course &nbsp;. &nbsp;. I
oughtn&apos;t to say anything the first time I met you &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. Do you think that? &mdash;</p>
<p> O&apos;Neill preserved a solemn silence until Temple&apos;s speech had faded
into indistinct mutterings; then he said, as if he were beginning an entirely new subject:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I was very interested in your paper and in the speeches
too &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. What did you think of Hughes? &mdash;
<br>Stephen did not answer.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Bloody cod, said Temple &mdash;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 667}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I thought his speech was in very bad taste, said O&apos;Neill sympathetically &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Bellam boccam habet</u>, said Cranly &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, I think he went too far, said Madden, but, you see,
he gets carried away by his enthusiasm &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Patrioticus est</u> &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, he is a patriotic &apos;cus, said O&apos;Neill
laughing wheezily. But I thought Father Butt&apos;s speech very good, very clear and philosophical &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Did you think that? cried Temple from the inside of the
path<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span> to Stephen
&nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &apos;Scuse me &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. I wanted to know
what he thought of Butt&apos;s speech, he explained at the same time to the
other
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">four</span></span>
<font color="black">three</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
&nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. Did you think &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. he was a bloody cod too? &mdash;
<br>Stephen could not help laughing at this novel form of address though Father
Butt&apos;s speech had put him into anything but a charitable mood.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It was just the kind of thing he gives us every day, said Madden. You know the style &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; His speech annoyed me, said Stephen curtly &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Why was that? said Temple eagerly. Why was it he annoyed you? &mdash;
<br>Stephen made a grimace instead of
<br><font color="green">{ms, 668}</font>
<br> answering:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Bloody cod of a speech, said Temple &nbsp;. &nbsp;.
&nbsp;. I&apos;m a rationalist. I don&apos;t b&apos;lieve in any religion &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I think he meant part of his speech kindly, said Cranly
slowly after a pause, turning his face full towards Stephen. Stephen answered
his gaze <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">and met</span></span>,
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">looked</span></span>
<font color="black">looking</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
steadily into a pair of bright dark eyes, and at the moment when their eyes met
he felt hope. There was nothing in the phrase to encourage; he doubted its
justice very much: yet he knew that hope had touched him. He walked on beside
the four young men, pondering. Cranly stopped before the window of a little
huckster&apos;s shop in one of the mean streets through which they passed,
staring fixedly at an old yellow copy of the <u>Daily Graphic</u> which was
hanging sideways on the glass. The illustration was a winter scene. No-one said
anything and as silence seemed about to set in permanently Madden asked him what
he was looking at. Cranly looked at his questioner and then looked back again at
the dirty picture, towards which he nodded his head heavily:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What is &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. what is? asked Temple,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 669}</font>
<br> who had been looking at some cold crubeens in the next window &mdash;
<br>Cranly turned his vacant face again towards his questioner and pointed to the picture, saying:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Feuc an eis super stradam &nbsp;.&nbsp;. in Liverpoolio</u> &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen&apos;s family circle was
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">now</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
increased by Isabel&apos;s return from her convent. For some time she had been
in delicate health and the nuns had recommended that she should have home care.
She came home a few days after the famous day of Stephen&apos;s paper. Stephen
was standing at the little front window that looked towards the mouth of the
river when he saw his parents walking from the tram with a thin pale girl
walking between them. Stephen&apos;s father did not like the prospect of another
inhabitant in his house, particularly a daughter for whom he had little
affection. He was annoyed that his daughter would not avail herself of the
opportunity afforded her in the convent but his sense of public duty was real if
spasmodic and he would by no means permit his wife to bring the girl home without his aid. The reflection that his
<br><font color="green">{ms, 670}</font>
<br> daughter, instead of being a help to him would be a hindrance, and the
suspicion that the burden of responsibility which he had piously imposed on his
eldest son&apos;s shoulders was beginning to irk that young man troubled his
vision of the future. He had a taste for contrasts, perhaps, which led him to
expect industry and sobriety in his offspring
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">and</span></span>
<font color="black">but</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
it cannot be said that he desired any material re-exaltation. It was just this
impalpable excellence which he wished his son to assert again in the teeth of
circumstances which gained him a conditional pardon at Stephen&apos;s hands. But
this slight thread of union between father and son had been worn away by the
usages of daily life and, by reason of its tenuity and of the
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">failure</span></span> gradual
rustiness which had begun to consume the upper station, it bore fewer and feebler messages along it.</p>
<p> Stephen&apos;s father was quite capable of talking himself into believing
what he knew to be untrue. He knew that his own ruin had been his own handiwork
but he had talked himself into believing that it was the handiwork of others. He
had his son&apos;s distaste for responsibility without his son&apos;s courage. He was one of
<br><font color="green">{ms, 671}</font>
<br> those illogical wiseacres with whom no evidence can outreason the first
impression. His wife had fulfilled her duties to him with startling literalness
and yet she had never been able to expiate the offence of her blood.
Misunderstanding such as this,
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">which</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
is accepted as natural in higher social grades, is
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">wrongly</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
refused recognition in the burgher class where it is often found
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">to</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
issue in feuds of insatiable, narrow hatred. Mr Daedalus hated his wife&apos;s
maiden name with a medieval intensity: it stunk in his nostrils. His alliance
therewith was the only sin of which, in the entire honesty of his cowardice, he
could accuse himself. Now that he was making for the final decades of life with
the painful consciousness of having diminished comfortable goods and of having
accumulated uncomfortable habits he consoled and revenged himself by tirades so
prolonged and so often repeated that he was in danger of becoming a monomaniac.
The hearth at night was the sacred witness of these revenges, pondered,
muttered, growled and execrated. The exception which his clemency had originally made in favour
<br><font color="green">{ms, 672}</font>
<br> of his wife was soon out of mind and she began to irritate him by her
dutiful symbolism. The great disappointment of his life was accentuated by a
lesser and keener loss &mdash; the loss of a coveted fame. On account of a
certain income and of certain sociable gifts Mr Daedalus had been accustomed to
regard himself as the centre of a little world, the darling of a little society.
This position he still strove to maintain but at the cost of
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">a</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
reckless liberality from which his household had to suffer both in deed and in
spirit. He imagined that while he strove to retain this
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">infatuating</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
position his home affairs would, through the agency of a son whom he made no
effort to understand, in some divine manner right themselves. This hope when
indulged in would sometimes embitter his affection for a son whom he
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">thereby</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
acknowledged as superior but, now that he was led to suspect that his hope was
fatuous, an embitterment of that affection seemed likely to fix itself
permanently among his emotional landmarks. His son&apos;s notion of aristocracy
was not the one which he could sympathise with and his son&apos;s silence during the
<br><font color="green">{ms, 673}</font>
<br> domestic battles no longer seemed to him a conveyed compliment. He was, in
fact, sufficiently acute to observe here a covert menace against castellar
rights and he would not have been wrong if he had imagined
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">that</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
his son regarded
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">these</span></span> assistance at
these tortuous and obscene monologues as the tribute exacted by a father for
affording a wayward child a base of supplies.</p>
<p> Stephen did not consider his parents very seriously. In his opinion they had
opened up misleading and unnatural relations between themselves and him and he
considered their affection for him requited by a studious demeanour towards
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">them</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
and by a genuine goodwill to perform
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">for
them</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> a great number
of such material services as, in his present state of fierce idealism, he could
look upon as trifles. The only material services he would refuse them were those
which he judged to be spiritually dangerous and it is as well to admit that this
exception all but nullified his charity for he had cultivated an independence of
the soul which could brook very few subjections. Divine exemplars abetted him in
this. The phrase which preachers elaborate into a commandment of obedience seemed to him meagre,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 674}</font>
<br> ironical and inconclusive and the narrative of the life of Jesus did not in
any way impress him
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">with</span></span> as the
narrative of the life of one who was subject to others. When he had been a Roman
Catholic in the proper sense of the term the figure of Jesus had always seemed
to him too remote and too passionless<a target="foot" id="fyz0080">&ordm;</a>
and he had never uttered from his heart a single fervent prayer to the Redeemer:
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">it
was</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> to Mary, as to a
weaker and more engaging vessel<a target="foot" id="fyz0081">&ordm;</a> of
salvation,
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">that</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
he had entrusted his spiritual affairs. Now his enfranchisement from the
discipline of the Church seemed to be coincident with
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">a
natural</span></span>
<font color="black">an</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
instinctive return to the Founder thereof and this impulse would have led him
perhaps to a considerations of the merits of Protestantism had not another
natural impulse inclined him to bring even the self-contradictory and the absurd
into order. He did not know, besides, whether the haughtiness of the Papacy was
not as derivable from Jesus<a target="foot" id="fyz0082">&ordm;</a> himself as
the reluctance to be pressed beyond &ldquo;Amen: I say to you&rdquo; for an
account of anything but he was quite sure that behind the
<a name="pn1021b" href="../../FF/unbs/pn1all.htm#pn1021b">enigmatic utterances
of Jesus</a>
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">there
was</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> a very much more
<br><font color="green">{ms, 675}</font>
<br> definite conception than any which could be supposed
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">to</span></span> discoverable behind Protestant theology:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Put this in your diary, he said to transcriptive Maurice.
Protestant Orthodoxy is like Lanty McHale&apos;s dog: it goes a bit of the road with everyone &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It seems to me that S. Paul trained that dog, said Maurice &mdash;</p>
<p> One day when Stephen had gone to the College by accident he found McCann
standing in the hall holding a long testimonial. Another part of the testimonial
was on the hall-table and nearly all the young men in the College were signing
their names to it. McCann was speaking volubly to a little group and Stephen
discovered that the testimonial was the tribute of Dublin University students to
the tsar of Russia. World-wide peace: solution of all disputes by arbitration:
general disarming of the nations: these were the benefits for which the students
were returning their thanks. On the hall table there were two photographs, one
of the Tsar of Russia, the other of the Editor of the <u>Review of Reviews</u>:
both of the photographs were signed by the famous couple. As McCann was standing
sideways to the light Stephen amused himself in tracing a resemblance between
him and the pacific Emperor whose photograph had been taken in profile. The
tsar&apos;s air of besotted Christ moved him to scorn
<br><font color="green">{ms, 676}</font>
<br> and he turned for support to Cranly who was standing beside the door.
Cranly wore a very dirty yellow straw hat of the shape of an inverted bucket in
the shelter of which his face was composed to a glaucous calm.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Doesn&apos;t he look a wirrasthrue Jaysus? said Stephen
pointing to the tsar&apos;s photograph and using the Dublin version of the name as an effective common noun &mdash;
<br>Cranly looked in the direction of McCann and replied, nodding his head:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Wirrasthrue Jaysus and hairy Jaysus &mdash;
<br>At that moment McCann caught sight of Stephen and signalled that he would be with him in a moment:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Have you
signed<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span>? asked Cranly &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; This
thing<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span>? no &mdash; have you? &mdash;
<br>Cranly hesitated and then brought out a well deliberated &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What for? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What for? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ay &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; For &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. <u>Pax</u> &mdash;
<br>Stephen looked up under the bucket-shaped hat but could read no expression
on his neighbour&apos;s face. His eyes wandered up to the dinged vertex of the hat.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; In the name of God what do you wear that hat for?
It&apos;s not so terribly hot, is it? he asked &mdash;
<br>Cranly took off the hat slowly and gazed into its depths. After a little pause he pointed into it and said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Viginti-uno denarios</u> &mdash;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 677}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Where? said Stephen &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I bought it, said Cranly very impressively
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">and
very flatly</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>, last summer in Wickla &mdash;
<br>He looked back into the hat and said, smiling with a sour affection<a target="foot" id="fyz0083">&ordm;</a></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It&apos;s not &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. too bloody bad
&nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. of a hat &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. d&apos;ye know &mdash;
<br>And he replaced it on his head slowly, murmuring to himself from force of
habit &lsquo;<u>Viginti-uno denarios</u>&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Sicut bucketus est</u>, said Stephen &mdash;
<br>The subject was not discussed further. Cranly produced a little grey ball
from one of his pockets and began to examine it carefully, indenting the surface
at many points. Stephen was watching this operation when he heard McCann addressing him</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I want you to sign this testimonial &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What about? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It&apos;s a testimonial of admiration for the courage
displayed by the Tsar of Russia in issuing a rescript to the Powers, advocating
arbitration instead of war as a means of settling national disputes &mdash;
<br>Stephen shook his head. Temple who had been wandering round the hall in
search of sympathy came over at this moment and said to Stephen:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do you believe in peace? &mdash;
<br>No-one answered him.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; So you won&apos;t sign? said McCann &mdash;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 678}</font> </p>
<p class="flush">Stephen shook his head again:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Why not? said McCann sharply &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; If we must have a Jesus, answered Stephen, let us have a legitimate Jesus &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; By hell! said Temple laughing, that&apos;s good. Did you
hear that? he said to Cranly and McCann both of whom he seemed to regard as very
hard of hearing. D&apos;you hear that? Legitima&apos; Jesus! &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I presume then you approve of war and slaughter, said McCann &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I did not make the world, said Stephen &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; By hell! said Temple to Cranly. I believe in universal
brotherhood. &apos;Scuse me, he said, turning to McCann, do you believe in universal brotherhood? &mdash;
<br>McCann took no heed of the question but continued addressing Stephen. He
began an argument in favour of peace which Temple listened to for a few moments,
but, as he spoke with his back to Temple, that revolutionary young man
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">who</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
could not hear him very well began to wander round the hall again. Stephen did
not argue with McCann but at a convenient pause he said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I have no intention of signing &mdash;
<br>McCann halted and Cranly said, taking Stephen&apos;s arm:
<br><u>Nos ad manum ballum jocabimus</u> &mdash;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 679}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; All right, said McCann promptly, as if he was accustomed
to rebuffs, if you won&apos;t, you won&apos;t &mdash;
<br>He went off to get more signatures for the Tsar while Cranly and Stephen
went out into the garden. The ball-alley was deserted so they arranged a match
of twenty, Cranly allowing Stephen seven points. Stephen had not had much
practice at the game and so he was only seventeen when Cranly cried out
&lsquo;Game Ball&rsquo;. He lost the second game also. Cranly was a strong,
accurate player but Stephen thought too heavy of foot to be a brilliant one.
While they were playing Madden came into the alley and sat down on an old box.
He was much more excited than either of the players and kept kicking the box
with his heels and crying out &ldquo;Now, Cranly! Now, Cranly!&rdquo; &ldquo;But
it, Stevie!&rdquo; Cranly who had to serve the third game put the
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">wall</span></span>
<font color="black">ball</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
over the side of the alley into Lord Iveagh&apos;s grounds and the game had to
wait while he went in search of it. Stephen sat down on his heels beside Madden
and they both looked up at the figure of Cranly who was holding on to the
netting and making signals to one of the gardeners from the top of the wall. Madden took out smoking materials:
<br><font color="green">{ms, 680}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Are you and Cranly long here? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Not long, said Stephen &mdash;
<br>Madden began to stuff very coarse tobacco into his pipe:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; D&apos;ye know what, Stevie? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Hughes &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. doesn&apos;t like you
&nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. at all. I heard him speaking of you to someone &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; &lsquo;Someone&rsquo; is vague &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He doesn&apos;t like you at all &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; His enthusiasm carries him away, said Stephen &mdash;</p>
<p> On the
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">evening
of the</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> Saturday
before Palm Sunday Stephen found himself alone with Cranly. The two were leaning
over the marble staircase of the Library, idly watching the people coming in and
going out. The big windows in front of them were thrown and the mild air
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">entered
through them</span></span> <font color="black">came
through</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do you like the services of Holy Week? said Stephen &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, said Cranly &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; They are wonderful, said Stephen. Tenebrae &mdash;
it&apos;s so damned childish to frighten us by knocking prayerbooks on a bench.
Isn&apos;t it strange to see the Mass of the Presanctified &mdash; no lights or
vestments, the altar naked, the door of the tabernacle gaping open, the priests
lying prostrate on the altar steps? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, said Cranly &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Don&apos;t you think the Reader who begins
<br><font color="green">{ms, 681}</font>
<br> the mass is a strange person. No-one knows where he comes from: he has no
connection with the mass. He comes out by himself and opens a book at the right
hand side of the altar and when he has read the lesson he closes the book and
goes away as he came. Isn&apos;t he strange? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, said Cranly &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You know how his lesson begins?
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext"><u>Dixit
enim</u></span></span> <font color="black">Haec
dicit</u></font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
<u>Dominus: in tribulatione sua consurgent ad me; venite et revertamur ad Dominum</u> &mdash;
<br>He chanted the opening of the lesson in <u>mezza voce</u> and his voice went
flowing down the staircase and round the circular hall, each tone coming back upon the ear enriched and softened.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He pleads, said Stephen. He is what that chalk-faced chap
was for me, <u>advocatus diaboli</u>. Jesus has no friend on Good Friday. Do you
know what kind of a figure rises before me on Good Friday? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What kind? &mdash;
<br>
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">the
idea of the scapegoat in the Old Testament and of the Lamb of God in New
(Christ&apos;s own words)</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; An ugly little man who has taken into his body the sins
of the world. Something between Socrates and a Gnostic Christ &mdash; A Christ
of the Dark Ages. That&apos;s what his mission of redemption has got for him: a
crooked ugly body for which neither God nor man have pity. Jesus is on strange
<br><font color="green">{ms, 682}</font>
<br> terms with that father of his. His father seems to me something of a snob.
Do you notice that he never notices his son publicly but once &mdash; when Jesus
is in full dress on the top of Thabor? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I don&apos;t like Holy Thursday much, said Cranly &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Neither do I. There are too many mammas and daughters
going chapel-hunting. The chapel smells too much of flowers and
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">hot</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
candles and women. Besides girls praying put me off my stroke &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do you like Holy Saturday? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The service is always too early but I like it &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I like it &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, the Church seems to have thought the matter
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">over</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
and to be saying &ldquo;Well, after all, you see, it&apos;s morning now and he
wasn&apos;t so dead we thought he was.&rdquo;
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">The
corpse has become a paschal candle with five grains of incense stuck in it
instead of its five wounds. The three faithful Mary&apos;s too who thought all
was over on Friday have a candle each. The bells ring and the service is full of
irrelevant
alleluias.</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> It&apos;s
rather a technical affair, blessing this, that and the other but it&apos;s cheerfully ceremonious &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But you don&apos;t
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">y</span></span> imagine the damned
fools of people see anything in these services, do you? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do they not? said Stephen &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Bah, said Cranly &mdash;
<br>One of Cranly&apos;s friends came up the stairs while they were talking. He
was a young man who was by day a clerk in Guinness&apos;s Brewery and by night a student of
<br><font color="green">{ms, 683}</font>
<br> mental and moral philosophy in the night classes of the College. It was, of
course, Cranly who had induced him to attend. This young man, who was named
Glynn, was unable to keep his head steady as he suffered from inherited
nervousness and his hands trembled very much whenever he tried to do anything
with them. He spoke with nervous hesitations and seemed to obtain satisfaction
only in the methodic stamp of his feet. He was a low-sized young man, with a
nigger&apos;s face and the curly black head of a nigger. He usually carried an
umbrella and his conversation was for the most part a translation of
commonplaces into polysyllabic phrases. This habit he cultivated partly because
it saved him from the inconvenience of cerebrating at the normal rate and
perhaps because he considered it was the channel best fitted for his peculiar humour.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Here is Professor Bloody-Big-Umbrella Glynn, said Cranly &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Good evening, gentlemen, said Glynn, bowing &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Good &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. evening, said Cranly
vacantly. Well, yes &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. it is a good evening &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I can see, said Glynn shaking a trembling forefinger in
reproof, I can see that you are about to make obvious remarks &mdash;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 684}</font>
<br>
<br>On Spy Wednesday night Cranly and Stephen attended the office of Tenebrae in
the Pro-Cathedral. They went round to the back of the altar and knelt behind the
students from Clonliffe who were chanting the office. Stephen was right opposite
Wells and he observed the great change which a surplice made in that young
man&apos;s appearance. Stephen did not like the office which was gabbled over
quickly. He said to Cranly that the chapel with its polished benches and
incandescent lamps reminded him of an insurance office. Cranly arranged that on
Good Friday they should attend the office in the Carmelite Church,
Whitefriar&apos;s St where, he said, the office was much more homely. Cranly
accompanied Stephen part of the way home and explained very minutely, using his
large hands for the purpose, all the merits of Wicklow bacon.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You are no Israelite, said Stephen, I see you eat the unclean animal &mdash;
<br>Cranly replied that it was nonsense to consider the pig unclean because he
ate dirty garbage and at the same time to consider the oyster, which fed chiefly
on excrements, a delicacy. He believed that the pig was much maligned: he said
there was a lot of money to be made out of pigs. He instanced all the Germans who made small fortunes in Dublin
<br><font color="green">{ms, 685}</font>
<br> by opening pork-shops.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I often thought seriously, he said stopping in his walk
to give emphasis to his remark, of opening a pork-shop, d&apos;ye know &nbsp;.
&nbsp;. &nbsp;. a gentleman butcher and putting <u>Kranliberg</u> or some German
name, d&apos;ye know, over the door &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. and makin&apos; a
flamin&apos; fortune out of pig&apos;s meat &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; God bless us! said Stephen, What a terrible idea! &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ay,
<a name="jn1040e" href="../../FF/unbs/jn1all.htm#jn1040e">said Cranly walking on
heavily, a flamin&apos; bloody</a> fortune I&apos;d make &mdash;</p>
<p> On Good Friday as Stephen was wandering aimlessly about the city he caught
sight of a placard on a wall which announced that the Three Hours&apos; Agony
would be preached by the Very Reverend W. Dillon S.J and the Very Reverend J.
Campbell S.J in the Jesuit Church, Gardiner St. Stephen felt very solitary and
purposeless as he traversed empty street after empty street and, without being
keenly aware of it, he began to proceed in the direction of Gardiner St. It was
a warm sunless day and the city wore an air of sacred torpor. As he passed under
S. George&apos;s Church he saw that it was already half past two; &mdash; he had
been three hours wandering up and down the city. He entered the Church in
Gardiner St and, passing by
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">without
honouring</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> the table
of the lay-brother who roused himself from a stupefied doze in expectation of silver, arrived in
<br><font color="green">{ms, 686}</font>
<br> the right wing of the chapel. The chapel was crowded from altar to doors
with a well-dressed multitude. Everywhere he saw the same flattered affection
for the Jesuits who are in the habit of attaching to their order the souls of
thousands of the insecurely respectable middle-class by offering them a refined
asylum, an interested, a considerate confessional, a particular amiableness of
manners which their spiritual adventures in no way entitled them to. Not very
far from him in the shelter of one of the pillars Stephen saw his father and two
friends. His father had directed his eyeglass upon the distant choir and his
face wore an expression of impressed piety. The choir was executing some florid
tracery which was intended as an expression of mourning. The walk, the heat, the
crush, the darkness of the chapel overcame Stephen and, leaning against the
lintel of the door, he half closed his eyes and allowed his thoughts to drift.
Rhymes began to make themselves in his head.</p>
<p> He perceived dimly that a white figure had ascended the pulpit and he heard
a voice saying
<a name="jn1037e" href="../../FF/unbs/jn1all.htm#jn1037e"><u>Consummatum
est</u></a>. He recognised the voice and he knew that Father Dillon was
preaching on the Seventh Word. He took no trouble to hear the sermon but every few
<br><font color="green">{ms, 687}</font>
<br> minutes he heard a new translation of the Word rolling over the
congregation. &ldquo;It is ended&rdquo; &ldquo;It is accomplished&rdquo; This
sensation awoke him from his day-dream and as the translations followed
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">each</span></span> one another
more and more rapidly he found his gambling instinct on the alert. He wagered
with himself as to what word the preacher would select. &ldquo;It is &nbsp;.
&nbsp;. &nbsp;. accomplished&rdquo; &ldquo;It is &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;.
consummated&rdquo; &ldquo;It is &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. achieved&rdquo;. In the
few seconds which intervened between the first part and the second part of the
phrase Stephen&apos;s mind performed feats of divining agility &ldquo;It is
&nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. finished&rdquo; &ldquo;It is &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;.
completed&rdquo; &ldquo;It is &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. concluded&rdquo;. At last
with a final burst of rhetoric Father Dillon cried out that it was over and the
congregation began to pour itself out into the streets. Stephen was borne along
in the crowd and everywhere about him he heard the same murmurs of
admiration<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span> and saw
the same expressions of satisfaction, discreet murmurs, subdued expressions. The
special charges of the Jesuits were congratulating themselves and one another on a well-spent Good Friday.</p>
<p> To avoid his father Stephen slipped round towards the body of the chapel and
waited in the central porch while the common people
<br><font color="green">{ms, 688}</font>
<br> came shuffling and stumbling past him. Here also there was admiration,
satisfaction. A young workman passed out with his wife and Stephen heard the
words &ldquo;He knows his thayology, I tell ye&rdquo;. Two women stopped beside
the holy water font and after scraping their hands vainly
over<a target="foot" id="fyz0084">&ordm;</a> the bottom crossed themselves in a
slovenly fashion with their dry hands. One of them sighed and drew her brown shawl about her:
<br>
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1|x</small></sup></font><font color="black">&ldquo;If
I told them there is no water in the font to symbolise that when Christ has
washed us in blood we have no need of other
aspersions.</font><font color="red"><sup><small>x|1|</small></sup></font></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; An&apos; his language, said the other woman &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Aw yis &mdash;
<br>Here the other woman sighed in her turn and drew her shawl about her:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; On&apos;y, said she, God bless the gintleman, he uses the
words that you nor me can&apos;t intarpit &mdash;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 689}</font> </p>
<p class="center">XX</p>
<p class="flush">Between Easter and the end of May Stephen&apos;s acquaintance
with Cranly progressed night by night. As the time of the Summer Examinations
was approaching Maurice and Stephen were both supposed to be hard at work.
Maurice retired to his room carefully every evening after tea-time and Stephen
repaired to the
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">library</span></span>
<font color="black">Library</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
where he was supposed to be engaged in serious work. As a matter of fact he read
little or nothing in the Library. He talked with Cranly by the hour either at a
table, or, if removed by the librarian or by the indignant glances of students,
standing at the top of the staircase. At ten o&apos;clock when the library
closed the two returned together through the central streets exchanging banalities with the other students.</p>
<p> It would seem at first somewhat strange and improbable that these two young
men should have anything in common beyond an incurable desire for leisure.
Stephen had begun to regard himself seriously as a literary artist: he professed
scorn for the rabblement and contempt for authority. Cranly&apos;s chosen
companions represented the rabblement in a stage
<br><font color="green">{ms, 690}</font>
<br> of partial fermentation when it is midway between vat and flagon and Cranly
seemed to please himself in the spectacle of this caricature of his own
unreadiness. Anyhow towards rabblement and authority alike he behaved with
submissive deference and Stephen would have been disposed to regard this too
mature demeanour as a real sign of interior corruption had he not daily evidence
that Cranly was willing to endanger his own fair name as a member of the
Sodality and as a general lay-servant of the Church by association with one who
was known to be contaminated. Cranly, however, might have wished the fathers to
suppose that he went with
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">this</span></span>
<font color="black">the</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
rebellious young artist with the secret purpose of leading him back again to
good ways and, as if from a secret appreciation of his own fitness for such a
task, he always enlarged and interpreted the doctrines of the Church side by
side with Stephen&apos;s theories. Thus confronted, it was a trick of the
pleader for orthodoxy to suggest a possible reconciliation between neighbours
and to suggest
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">even</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
further that the Church would not be over-hasty in condemning vagaries of
architecture or
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">even</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
the use of pagan emblems and flourishes so long as her ground rent was paid quarterly in advance.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 691}</font>
<br> These accommodating business terms, which would have seemed of suspicious
piety to more simple souls, were not likely to startle two young men who were
fond of tracing even moral phenomena back to the region of their primal cells.
The moral doctrine of Catholicism
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">with</span></span> so cunningly
lined and interwoven with a studious alloy of conscience was capable under the
management of a nimble spirit of performing feats of extension and contraction.
After a thousand such changes of form this elastic body was suddenly detected in
a change of position and a point hitherto external was now seen to be well
enclosed within it: and all this imperceptibly, while the eye was lulled by the
mere exhibition of so many variations
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">executed</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
with a certain amoeboid instinct.<a target="foot" id="fyz0085">&ordm;</a></p>
<p> As for artistic sympathies Cranly could hardly be said to offer these. He
had all the rustic&apos;s affection for the prosaic things of the six days of
the week and, in addition to this, he lacked the hypocritical taste which the
rustic affects for the fine arts on the seventh day. In the Library he read
nothing but the weekly illustrated papers. Sometimes he took a big book from the counter and carried it solemnly
<br><font color="green">{ms, 692}</font>
<br> to his place where he opened it and studied the title-page and preface for
an hour or so. Of fine literature he had, almost literally speaking, no
knowledge. His acquaintance with English prose seemed to be limited to a hazy
acquaintance with the beginning of <u>Nicholas Nickleby</u> and of English verse
he had certainly read Wordsworth&apos;s poem which is called &ldquo;<u>Advice to
a Father</u>.&rdquo; Both of these accomplishments he divulged to Stephen one
day when he had been discovered reading with great attention the title-page of a
book which was called <u>Diseases of the Ox</u>. He offered no comment on what
he had read and simply stated the achievement not without wonder at his having
achieved it. He had a straggling regiment of words at his command and he was
thus enabled to express himself: but he spoke flatly and frequently made
childish errors. He had a defiant manner of using technical and foreign terms as
if he wished to suggest that for him they were mere conventions of
language.<a target="foot" id="fyz0086">&ordm;</a> His receptiveness was not
troubled by any nausea; he received everything that came in his way and it was
purely instinctive of Stephen to perceive any special affinity in so
indiscriminate a vessel. He was fond of leading a philosophical argument back to the machinery
<br><font color="green">{ms, 693}</font>
<br> of the intellectual faculty itself and in mundane matters he did likewise,
testing everything by its food value.</p>
<p> It was in favour of this young man that Stephen decided to break his
commandment of reticence. Cranly, on his side, must have been above all the
accidents
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">of
life</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> if he had not
suffered a slight commotion from such delicately insistent flattery. Stephen
spoke to his impoverished ear out of the plenitude of an amassed vocabulary, and
confronted the daring commonplaces of his companion&apos;s moods
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">b</span></span> with a complex
radiance of thought. Cranly seldom or never obtruded his presence upon these
monologues. He listened to all, seemed to understand all, and seemed to think it
was the duty of his suppositious character to listen
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">to</span></span> and understand.
He never refused his ear. Stephen claimed it in and out of season as he felt the
need for intelligent sympathy. They promenaded miles of the streets together,
arm-in-arm. They halted in wet weather under spacious porches, desisting at the
sight of some inviting triviality. They sat sometimes in the pit of a music-hall
and one unfolded to the other the tapestry
<br><font color="green">{ms, 694}</font>
<br> of his poetical aims while the band bawled to the comedian and the comedian
bawled to the band. Cranly grew used to having sensations and impressions
recorded and analysed before him at the very instant of their apparition. Such
concentration upon oneself was unknown to
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Cranly</span></span>
<font color="black">him</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
and he wondered at first with the joy of solitary possession at Stephen&apos;s
ingenuous arrogance. This phenomenon, which called all his previous judgments to
accounts and opened out a new system of life at the last limit of
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Cranly&apos;s</span></span>
<font color="black">his</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
world, rankled somewhat in
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Cranly&apos;s</span></span>
<font color="black">his</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
mind. It irritated him also because he knew too well the large percentage of
Christian sentiment which concealed itself under
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">a</span></span>
<font color="black">his</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
veneer of Stoicism to suspect himself of any talent for a similar extravagance.
And yet, hearing the whole-hearted young egoist pour
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">out</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
his pride and anger at his feet like some costly ointment, and benefiting by a
liberality which seemed to keep nothing in reserve, much as he would have liked
to hold himself aloof from such ties he felt himself gradually answering the
appeal by a silent, perverse affection. He affected more brutality than was in his nature
<br><font color="green">{ms, 695}</font>
<br> and, as if infected by his companion&apos;s arrogance, seemed to expect
that the practice of aggressive criticism would be suspended in his case.</p>
<p> A licence which he allowed himself rather freely was that of impolite
abstraction, so deep as to suggest great mental activity but issuing at last in
some blunt actuality. If a
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">conversation</span></span>
<font color="black">monologue</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
which had set out from a triviality seemed to him likely to run on unduly he
would receive it with a silence through which aversion was just discernible and
at a lull bring his hammer down brutally on the poor original object. At times
Stephen found this ultra-classical habit very unpalatable. One evening the
monologue was interrupted time after time. Stephen had mentioned his
sister&apos;s illness and had spread out a few leagues of theory on the subject
of the tyranny of home. Cranly never actually broke in upon the oration but he
continued inserting question after question whenever he had an opening. He asked
Isabel&apos;s age, her symptoms, her doctor&apos;s name, her treatment, her
diet, her appearance, how her mother nursed her, whether they had sent for a priest or not, whether
<br><font color="green">{ms, 696}</font>
<br> she had ever been sick before or not. Stephen answered all these questions
and still Cranly was not satisfied. He continued his questions until the
monologue had in all decency to be abandoned: and Stephen, thinking over his
manner, was unable to decide whether such conduct was to be considered the sign
of a deep interest in a human illness or the sign of irritated dissatisfaction with an inhuman theorist.</p>
<p> Stephen did not in the least shrink from applying the reproach to himself
but he found himself honestly unable to admit its justice. His sister had become
almost a stranger to him on account of the way in which she had been brought up.
He had hardly spoken a hundred words to her since the time when they had been
children together. He could not speak to her now except as to a stranger. She
had acquiesced in the religion of her mother; she had accepted everything that
had been proposed to her. If she lived she had exactly the temper for a Catholic
wife of limited intelligence and of pious docility and if she died she was
supposed to have earned for herself a place in the eternal heaven of Christians from which her two brothers were
<br><font color="green">{ms, 697}</font>
<br> likely to be shut out. Calamities in this world are reported to sit lightly
on the shoulders of the true Christian who can bide his time until the Creator
institutes the kingdom of the good. Isabel&apos;s case moved Stephen&apos;s
anger and commiseration but he saw at once how hopeless it was and how vain it
would be for him to interfere. Her life had been and would always be a trembling
walk before God. The slightest interchange of ideas between them must be either
a condescension on his part or an attempt to corrupt. No consciousness of their
nearness in blood troubled him with natural, unreasoning affection. She was
called his sister as his mother was called his mother but there had never been
any proof of that relation offered him in their emotional attitude towards him,
or any recognition of it permitted in his emotional attitude towards them. The
Catholic husband and wife, the Catholic father and mother, are allowed to be
natural at discretion but the same grace is not vouchsafed to Catholic children. They must preserve an unquestioning
<br><font color="green">{ms, 698}</font>
<br> orderliness even at the risk of being upbraided as unnatural by the very
preachers who assert that nature is the possession of
Satan.<a target="foot" id="fyz0087">&ordm;</a> Stephen had felt impulses of pity
for his mother, for his father, for Isabel, for Wells also but he believed that
he had done right in resisting them: he had first of all to save himself and he
had no business trying to save others unless his experiment with himself
justified him. Cranly had all but formulated serious charges against him,
calling up by implication the picture of Isabel with her gradually wasting
flame, her long dark hair and great wondering eyes, but Stephen stood up to the
charges and answered in his heart that it was injustice to point a finger of
reproach at him and that
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">a</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
vague inactive pity from those who upheld a system of mutual servile association
towards those who accepted it was only a play upon emotions as characteristic of
the egoist as of the man of sentiment. Isabel, moreover, did not seem to Stephen
to be in any great danger. He told Cranly she was probably growing too fast; many girls
<br><font color="green">{ms, 699}</font>
<br> were delicate at that age. He confessed that the subject tired him a
little. Cranly stood still and looked at him fixedly:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; My dear man, said he, d&apos;ye know what it is &nbsp;.
&nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. You&apos;re an extraordinary &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. man &mdash;</p>
<p> A week before the examination Cranly explained to Stephen his plan for
reading the course in five days.<a target="foot" id="fyz0088">&ordm;</a> It was
a carefully made plan, founded upon an intimate knowledge of examiners and
examination papers. Cranly&apos;s plan was to study from ten in the morning
until half past two in the afternoon, then from four to six, and then from half
past seven to ten. Stephen declined to follow this plan as he imagined he had a
fair chance of passing on what he called &lsquo;roundabout&rsquo; knowledge but
Cranly said that the plan was perfectly safe.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I don&apos;t quite see that, said Stephen, how can you
manage to pass &mdash; in Latin composition, say &mdash; after such a cursory
run over it? If you like I&apos;ll show you some things &mdash; not that I can
write so marvellously &mdash; &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &mdash;
<br>Cranly meditated without seeming to observe the offer. Then he averred flatly that his plan would work:
<br><font color="green">{ms, 700}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I&apos;ll take my dyin&apos; bible, he said. I&apos;ll
write them as good a thing, d&apos;ye know, ay &mdash; as good a thing as they
want. What do they know about Latin prose? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Not much, I suppose, said Stephen, but they may not be quite ignorant of Latin grammar &mdash;
<br>Cranly thought this over and then found his remedy:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; D&apos;ye know what, he said, whenever I can&apos;t think
of the grammar I&apos;ll bring in a piece out of Tacitus &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Apropos of what? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What the flamin&apos; hell does it matter what it&apos;s apropos of? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Quite right, said Stephen &mdash;</p>
<p> Cranly&apos;s plan neither succeeded nor failed for the very good reason
that it was never followed. The nights before the examination were spent sitting
outside under the porch of the Library. The two young men gazed up into the
tranquil sky and discussed how it was possible to live with the least amount of
labour. Cranly suggested bees: he seemed to know the entire economy of bee-life
and he did not seem as intolerant towards bees as towards men. Stephen said it would be a good arrangement
<br><font color="green">{ms, 701}</font>
<br> if Cranly were to live on the labour of the bees and allow him (Stephen) to
live on the united labours of the bees and of their keeper.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; &ldquo;I will watch from dawn to gloom
<br> The lake-reflected sun illume
<br> The yellow bees in the ivy bloom&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; &ldquo;Illume&rdquo;? said Cranly &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You know the meaning of &ldquo;illume&rdquo;? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Who wrote that? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Shelley &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Illume &mdash; it&apos;s just the word, d&apos;ye know, for autumn, deep gold colour &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A spiritual interpretation of landscape is very rare.
Some people think they write spiritually if they make their scenery dim and cloudy &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That bit you said now doesn&apos;t seem to me spiritual &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Nor to me: but sometimes Shelley does not address the
eye. He says &ldquo;many a lake-surrounded flute&rdquo;. Does that strike your eye or your sense of colour? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Shelley has a face that reminds me of a bird. What is it?
&ldquo;The lake-surrounded sun illume&rdquo;? &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; &ldquo;The lake-reflected sun illume
<br> The yellow bees in the ivy bloom&rdquo; &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What are you quoting? asked Glynn who had just come out
of the Library after several hours of study.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 702}</font>
<br>
<br>Cranly surveyed him before answering:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Shelley &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, Shelley? What was the quotation again? &mdash;
<br>Cranly nodded towards Stephen.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What was the quotation? asked Glynn. Shelley is an old flame of mine &mdash;
<br>Stephen repeated the lines and Glynn nodded his head nervously several times in approval</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Beautiful poetry Shelley wrote, didn&apos;t he? So mystical &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; D&apos;ye know what they call them yellow bees in Wickla?
asked Cranly suddenly, turning to Glynn &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No? what? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Red-arsed bees &mdash;
<br>Cranly laughed loudly at his own remark and struck his heels on the granite
steps. Glynn, conscious of a false position, began to fumble with his umbrella
and to search for one of his stock witticisms.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But that is only, he said, if you will pardon the
expression, that is only so to speak &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; &ldquo;The lake-surrounded sun illume
<br>The red-arsed bees in the ivy bloom&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; it&apos;s every bit as good bloody poetry as
Shelley&apos;s, said Cranly to Glynn. What do you think? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It seems to me undeniable, said Glynn driving his
unsteady umbrella before him as an emphasis, that the bees
<br><font color="green">{ms, 703}</font>
<br> are in the bloom. Of that we may say that it is distinctly so &mdash;</p>
<p> The examination lasted five days. After the first two days Cranly did not
even go through the form of entering the examination hall but after each paper
he was to be seen outside the University going over all the questions carefully
with his more diligent friends. He said that the papers were very easy and that
anyone could pass them on a fair knowledge. He did not ask Stephen any
particular questions but said merely &ldquo;I suppose you&apos;re
through&rdquo;. &ldquo;I expect so&rdquo; said Stephen. McCann usually came to
meet the students who had been under examination. He came partly because he
considered it was part of his duty to show an interest in all that concerned the
College, and partly because one of Mr Daniel&apos;s daughters was under
examination. Stephen who did not care very much whether he succeeded or failed
in the examination was very much amused observing the jealousies and nervous
anxieties which tried to conceal themselves under airs of carelessness. Students
who had studied hard all the year pretended to be in the same case as idlers and
idle and diligent both appeared to submit to the
<br><font color="green">{ms, 704}</font>
<br> examination with great unwillingness. Those who were rivals did not speak
to each other, being afraid to trust their eyes, but one questioned wandering
acquaintances privily about the other&apos;s success.
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">The</span></span>
<font color="black">Their</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
excitement was so genuine that even the excitement of sex failed to overcome it.
The girl students were not the subject of the usual sniggers and jokes but were
regarded with some aversion as sly enemies. Some of the young men eased their
enmity and vindicated their superiority at the same time by saying that it was
no wonder the women would do well seeing that they could study ten hours
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">all</span></span> a day all the
year round. McCann, who acted as go-between, told them the gossip from the other
camp and it was he who
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">had</span></span> spread the
report that Landy would not get first class honours in English because Miss
Reeves had written an essay of twenty pages on
<a name="jn1038b" href="../../FF/unbs/jn1all.htm#jn1038b"><u>The Use and Abuse of Ridicule</u></a>.</p>
<p> The examination ended on Tuesday. On Wednesday morning Stephen&apos;s mother
seemed to be rather anxious. Stephen had not given his parents much satisfaction
as to his conduct at the examination but he could not think that this was the
cause of his mother&apos;s trouble: he waited, however,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 705}</font>
<br> for the trouble to declare itself. His mother waited till the room was clear and then she said casually:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You have not made your Easter duty yet, have you, Stephen? &mdash;
<br>Stephen answered that he had not.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It would be better for you to go to confession in the
day-time. Tomorrow is Ascension Thursday and the chapels are sure to be crowded
tonight by people who have left off making their Easter duty till the last
moment. It&apos;s a wonder people wouldn&apos;t have more shame in them.
Goodness knows they have time enough from Ash Wednesday without waiting till the
stroke of twelve to go to the priest &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. I&apos;m not
speaking of you, Stephen. I know you have been studying for your examination.
But people who have nothing to do &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &mdash;
<br>Stephen made no answer to this but went on scraping diligently in his eggshell.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I have made my Easter duty already &mdash; on Holy
Thursday &mdash; but I&apos;m going to the altar in the morning. I am making a
novena and I want you to offer up your communion for a special intention of mine &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What special intention? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, dear. I&apos;m very much concerned about Isabel
&nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. I don&apos;t know what to think &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;.&nbsp;. &mdash;
<br>Stephen stuck his spoon angrily<a target="foot" id="fyz0089">&ordm;</a> through
<br><font color="green">{ms, 706}</font>
<br> the bottom of the shell and asked was there any more tea.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; There&apos;s no more in the pot but I can boil some water in a minute &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, never mind &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It won&apos;t be a jiffy &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen allowed the water to be put on as it would
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">allow</span></span>
<font color="black">give</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
him time to put an end to the conversation. He was much annoyed that
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">this</span></span> his mother
should try to wheedle him into conformity by using his sister&apos;s health as
an argument. He felt that such an attempt dishonoured him and freed him from the
last dissuasions of considerate piety. His mother put on the water and appeared
to be less anxious as if she had expected a blunt refusal. She even ventured on the small talk of religious matrons.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I must try and get in to town tomorrow in time for High
Mass in Marlborough St. Tomorrow is a great feast-day in the Church &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Why? asked Stephen smiling &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The Ascension of Our Lord, answered his mother gravely &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And why is that a great feast-day? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Because it was on that day that he showed Himself Divine: he ascended into Heaven &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen began to plaster butter over a
<br><font color="green">{ms, 700}</font>
<br> crusty heel of the loaf while his features settled into definite hostility:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Where did he go off? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; From Mount Olivet, answered his mother reddening under her eyes &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Head first? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What do you mean, Stephen? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I mean he must have been rather giddy by the time he
arrived. Why didn&apos;t he go by balloon? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Stephen, are you trying to scoff at Our Lord? I really
thought you had more intelligence than to use that kind of language: it&apos;s
only what people who believe only in what they can see under their noses say. I&apos;m surprised &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Tell me, mother, said Stephen between mouthfuls, do you
mean to tell me you believe that our friend went up off the mountain as they say he did? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I do &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I don&apos;t &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What are you saying, Stephen? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It&apos;s absurd: it&apos;s Barnum. He comes into the
world God knows how, walks on the water, gets out of his grave and goes up off
the Hill of Howth. What drivel is this? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Stephen! &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I don&apos;t believe it: and it would be no
<br><font color="green">{ms, 708}</font>
<br> credit if I did. It&apos;s no credit to me that I don&apos;t. It&apos;s drivel &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The most learned doctors of the Church believe it and that&apos;s good enough for me &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He can fast for forty days &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; God can do all things &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; There&apos;s a fellow in Capel St at present in a show
who says he can eat glass and hard nails. He calls himself <u>The Human Ostrich</u> &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Stephen, said his mother, I&apos;m afraid you have lost your faith &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I&apos;m afraid so too, said Stephen &mdash;</p>
<p> Mrs Daedalus looked very discomposed and sat down helplessly on the nearest
chair. Stephen fixed his attention on the water and when it was ready made himself another cup of tea.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I little thought, said his mother, that it would come to
this &mdash; that a child of mine would lose the faith &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But you knew some time ago &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; How could I know? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You knew &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I suspected something was wrong but I never thought &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And yet you wanted me to receive Holy Communion! &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Of course you cannot receive it now. But I thought you would make your Easter
<br><font color="green">{ms, 709}</font>
<br> duty as you have done every year up till now. I do not know what led you
astray unless it was those books you read. John, too, your uncle &mdash; he was
led astray by books when he was young but &mdash; only for a time &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Poor fellow! said Stephen &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You were religiously brought up by the Jesuits, in a
Catholic home &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A very Catholic home! &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; None of your people, neither your father&apos;s nor mine,
have a drop of anything but Catholic blood in their veins &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, I&apos;ll make a beginning in the family &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; This is the result of being left too much liberty. You do
as you like and believe what you like &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I don&apos;t believe, for example, that Jesus was the
only man that ever had pure auburn hair &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Nor that he was the only man that was exactly six feet high, neither more nor less &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, you believe that. I heard you tell that years ago
to our nurse in Bray &mdash; do you remember nurse Sarah? &mdash;
<br>Mrs Daedalus defended the tradition in a half-hearted way &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That is what they say &mdash;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 710}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, they say! They say a great deal &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But you need not believe that if you don&apos;t want to &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Thanks very much &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; All you are asked to believe in is the word of God. Think
of the beautiful teachings of Our Lord. Think of your own life when you believed
in those teachings. Weren&apos;t you better and happier then? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It was good for me at the time, perhaps, but it is quite useless for me now &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I know what is wrong with you &mdash; you suffer from the
pride of the intellect. You forget that we are only worms of the earth. You
think you can defy God because you have misused the talents he has given you &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I think Jehovah gets too high a salary for judging
motives. I want to retire him on the plea of old age &mdash;
<br>Mrs Daedalus stood up.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Stephen, you may use that kind of language with your
companions whoever they are but I will not allow you to use it with me. Even
your father, bad as he is supposed to be, does not speak such blasphemy as you
do. I am afraid that you are a changed boy since you went to that University. I
suppose you fell in with some of those students &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Good Lord, mother, said Stephen, don&apos;t believe that. The students are awfully
<br><font color="green">{ms, 711}</font>
<br> nice fellows. They love their religion: they wouldn&apos;t say boo to a goose</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Wherever you&apos;ve learnt it I will not allow you to
use such language to me when you speak of holy things. Keep that for the street-corners at night &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Very well, mother, said Stephen. But you began the conversation &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I never thought I would see the day when a child of mine
would lose the faith. God knows I didn&apos;t. I did my best for you to keep you in the right way &mdash;
<br>Mrs Daedalus began to cry. Stephen, having eaten and drunk all within his
province, rose and went towards the door:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It&apos;s all the fault of those books and the company
you keep. Out at all hours of the night instead of in your home, the proper
place for you. I&apos;ll burn every one of them. I won&apos;t have them in the house to corrupt anyone else &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen halted at the door and turned towards his mother who had now broken out into tears:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; If you were a genuine Roman Catholic, mother, you would burn me as well as the books &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I knew no good would come of your going to that place.
You are ruining yourself body and soul. Now your faith is gone! &mdash;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 712}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Mother, said
Stephen<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span> from
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">the</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
threshhold, I don&apos;t see what you&apos;re crying for. I&apos;m young,
healthy, happy. What is the crying for? &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. It&apos;s too
silly &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;.&mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen went over to the Library that evening expressly to see Cranly and
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">tell
him of</span></span>
<font color="black">narrate</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
his latest conflict with orthodoxy. Cranly was standing under the Library porch
announcing the results of the examinations beforehand. He was surrounded, as
usual, by a little group among whom were his friend, the clerk from the Custom
House, and another bosom friend, a very grave-looking elderly student named
Lynch. Lynch was of
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">a</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
very idle disposition and had allowed six or seven years to intervene between
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">his</span></span> leaving school
and beginning a course in medicine at the College of Surgeons. He was much
esteemed by his colleagues because he had a deep bass voice, never
&lsquo;stood&rsquo; any drinks in return for those which he accepted from
others, and seldom uttered any remarks in return for those he listened to. He
always kept both his hands in his trousers&apos; pockets when he walked and
jutted out his chest in a manner which was intended as a criticism of
life.<a target="foot" id="fyz0090">&ordm;</a> He spoke, however, to Cranly principally about women and for
<br><font color="green">{ms, 713}</font>
<br> this reason Cranly had nicknamed him Nero. It was possible to accuse his
mouth of a Neronic tendency but he destroyed the illusion of imperialism by
wearing his cap very far back from a shock
forehead.<a target="foot" id="fyz0091">&ordm;</a> He had unbounded contempt for
medical students and their ways and, if he had not absorbed so much Dublin into
his mind, he would have been a lover of the fine arts. He was, in fact, very
interested in the art of singing
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">and
he</span></span><font color="black">.
He</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> used this
interest to attempt an intimacy with Stephen and, his gravity covering a
shame-faced idealism,<a target="foot" id="fyz0092">&ordm;</a> he had already
begun to feel through Cranly the influence of Stephen&apos;s vivifying
disorderliness. His objection, singular enough in a lax character, to trite and
meaningless execrations, to the facile
iniquities<a target="foot" id="fyz0093">&ordm;</a> of the lips, had resulted for
him in two moments of inspiration. He execrated in
yellow<a target="foot" id="fyz0094">&ordm;</a> in protest against the sanguine
adjective of uncertain etymology and, to describe the hymeneal tract, he had one
invariable term. He called it <u>Oracle</u> and all within the frontiers he
called <u>oracular</u>. The term was considered distinguished in his circle and
he was careful never to explain the process which had discovered it.</p>
<p> Stephen stood on one of the steps of the porch but Cranly did not honour him with
<br><font color="green">{ms, 714}</font>
<br> any kind of welcome. Stephen inserted a few phrases into the conversation
but his presence was still unhonoured by
Cranly.<a target="foot" id="fyz0095">&ordm;</a> He was not in the least daunted
by this reception, much as he was puzzled by it, and waited quietly for his
opportunity. Once he addressed Cranly directly but got no answer. His mind began
to ruminate upon this and at last his ruminations expressed themselves in a
prolonged smile. While he was enjoying his smile he saw that Lynch was observing
him. Lynch came down from the group and said &lsquo;Good evening&rsquo;. He then
took a packet of Woodbine cigarettes from his side pocket and offered one to Stephen, saying:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Five a penny &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen, who knew that Lynch was a very poor young man, accepted the
cigarette appreciatively. They smoked in silence for some minutes and at length
the group under the porch fell silent also:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Have you a copy of your essay? said Lynch &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do you want it? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I&apos;d like to read it &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I&apos;ll bring it to you tomorrow night, said Stephen going up the steps &mdash;</p>
<p> He went up to Cranly who was leaning against a pillar and gazing straight
before him and touched him lightly on the shoulder:
<br><font color="green">{ms, 715}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I want to speak to you, he said &mdash;</p>
<p> Cranly turned slowly round and looked at him. Then he asked:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Now? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes &mdash;</p>
<p> They walked together up along Kildare St without speaking. When they came to the Green Cranly said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I&apos;m going home on Saturday. Will you come as far as
Harcourt St Station? I want to see the hour the train goes at &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; All right &mdash;</p>
<p> In the station Cranly spent a great deal of time reading the time-tables and
making abstruse calculations. Then he went up to the platform and watched for a
long time the shunting of the engine of a goods train on to a passenger train.
The engine was steaming and blowing a deafening whistle and rolling billows of
thick smoke towards the roof of the station. Cranly said that the engine-driver
came from his part of the country and that he was the son of a cobbler in
Tinahely. The engine executed a series of indecisive movements and finally
settled itself on to the train. The engine-driver stuck his head out through the
side and gazed languidly along the train:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I suppose you would call him sooty Jaysus, said Cranly &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <a name="pn1006b" href="../../FF/unbs/pn1all.htm#pn1006b">Cranly, said Stephen, I have left
<br><font color="green">{ms, 716}</font>
<br> the Church</a> &mdash;
<br>Cranly took his arm at the word and they turned away from the platform and
went down the staircase. As soon as they had emerged into the street he said encouragingly:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You have left the Church? &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen went over the interview phrase by phrase.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Then you do not believe any longer? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I cannot believe &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But you could at one time &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I cannot now &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You could now if you wanted to &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, I don&apos;t want to &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Are you sure you do not believe &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Quite sure &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Why do you not go to the altar? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Because I do not believe &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Would you make a sacrilegious communion? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Why should I? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; For your mother&apos;s sake &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I don&apos;t see why I should &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Your mother will suffer very much. You say you do not
believe. The Host for you is a piece of ordinary bread. Would you not eat a
piece of ordinary bread to avoid causing your mother pain? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I would in many cases &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And why not in this case? Have you any
<br><font color="green">{ms, 717}</font>
<br> reluctance to commit a sacrilege? If you do not believe you should not have any &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Wait a minute, said Stephen. At present I have a
reluctance to commit a sacrilege. I am a product of Catholicism; I was sold to
Rome before my birth. Now I have broken my slavery but I cannot in a moment
destroy every feeling in my nature. That takes time. However if it were a case
of needs must &mdash; for my life, for instance &mdash; I would commit any enormity with the host &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Many Catholics would do the same, said Cranly, if their lives were at stake &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Believers? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ay, believers. So by your own showing you are a believer &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It is not from fear that I refrain from committing a sacrilege &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Why then? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I see no reason for committing sacrilege &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But you have always made your Easter Duty. Why do you
change? The thing for you is mockery, mummery &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; If I mum it is an act of submission, a public act of
submission to the Church. I will not submit to the Church &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Even so far as to mum? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It is mumming with an intention. The
<br><font color="green">{ms, 718}</font>
<br> outward show is nothing but it means a good deal &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Again you are speaking like a Catholic. The host is
nothing in outward show &mdash; a piece of bread &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I admit: but all the same I insist on disobeying the
Church. I will not submit any longer &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But could you not be more diplomatic? Could you not rebel
in your heart and yet conform out of contempt? You could be a rebel in spirit &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That cannot be done for long by anyone who is sensitive.
The Church knows the value of her services: her priest must hypnotise himself
every morning before the tabernacle. If I get up every morning, go to the
looking-glass and say to myself &ldquo;You are the Son of God&rdquo; at the end
of twelve months I will want disciples &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; If you could make your religion pay like Christianity I
would advise you to get up every morning and go to the looking-glass &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That would be good for my vicars on earth but I would
find crucifixion a personal inconvenience &mdash;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 719}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But here in Ireland by following your new religion of
unbelief you may be crucifying yourself like Jesus &mdash; only socially not physically &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; There is this difference. Jesus was good-humoured over it. I will die hard &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; How can you propose such a future to yourself and yet be
afraid to trust yourself to perform even the simplest mumming in a church? said Cranly &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That is my business, said Stephen, tapping at his forehead &mdash;</p>
<p> When they had come to the Green they crossed the streets and began to walk
round the enclosure inside the chains. A few mechanics and their sweethearts
were sitting on the swinging-chains turning the shadows to account. The footpath
was deserted except for the metallic image of a distant policeman who had been
posted <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">in</span></span> well in
the gaslight as an admonition. When the two young men passed the college they
both looked up at the same moment towards the dark windows.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; May I ask you why you left the Church? asked Cranly &mdash;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 720}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I could not observe the precepts &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Not even with grace? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Jesus gives very simple precepts. The Church is severe &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Jesus or the Church &mdash; it&apos;s all the same to me.
I can&apos;t follow him. I must have liberty to do as I please &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No man can do as he pleases &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Morally &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, not morally either &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You want me, said Stephen, to toe the line with those
sycophants and hypocrites in the college. I will never do so &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No. I mentioned Jesus &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Don&apos;t mention him. I have made it a common noun.
They don&apos;t believe in him; they don&apos;t observe his precepts. In any
case let us leave Jesus aside. My sight will only carry me as far as his
lieutenant in Rome. It is quite useless: I will not be frightened into paying tribute in money or in thought &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You told me &mdash; do you remember the evening we were
standing at the top of the staircase talking about &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, yes, I remember, said Stephen who hated
Cranly&apos;s method of remembering<a target="foot" id="fyz0096">&ordm;</a> the
<br><font color="green">{ms, 721}</font>
<br> past, What did I tell you? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You told me the idea you had of Jesus on Good Friday, an
ugly misshapen Jesus. Did it ever strike you that Jesus may have been a conscious impostor? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I have never believed in his chastity &mdash; that is
since I began to think about him.
<a name="pn1021p" href="../../FF/unbs/pn1all.htm#pn1021p">I am sure he
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">is</span></span>

<p class="pdi">&mdash; You don&apos;t think he was God? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What a question! Explain it: explain the hypostatic
union: tell me if the figure which that policeman
worships<a target="foot" id="fyz0097">&ordm;</a> as the Holy Ghost is intended
for a spermatozoon with wings added. What a question! He makes general remarks
on life, that&apos;s all I know: and I disagree with them &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; For example? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; For example, &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;.&nbsp;. Look here, I
cannot talk on this subject. I am not a scholar and I receive no pay as a
minister of God. I want to live, do you understand. McCann wants air and food: I
want them and a hell of a lot of other things too. I don&apos;t care whether I am right or wrong. There is always that
<br><font color="green">{ms, 722}</font>
<br> risk in human affairs, I suppose. But even if I am wrong at least I shall
not have to endure Father Butt&apos;s company for eternity &mdash;
<br>Cranly laughed</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Remember he would be glorified &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Heaven for climate, isn&apos;t that it, and hell for
society. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. The whole affair is too damn idiotic. Give it
up. I am very young. When I have a beard to my middle I will study Hebrew and then write to you about it &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Why are you so impatient with the Jesuits? asked Cranly.</p>
<p> Stephen did not answer and, when they arrived in
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">the</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
next region of light Cranly exclaimed:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Your face is red! &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I felt it, said Stephen &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Most people think you are self-restrained, said Cranly after a pause &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; So I am, said Stephen &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Not on this subject. Why do you get so excited: I
can&apos;t understand that. It is a thing for you to think out &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I can think out things when I like. I have thought this
affair out very carefully though you may not believe me when I tell you. But my escape
<br><font color="green">{ms, 723}</font>
<br> excites me: I must talk as I do. I feel a flame in my face. I feel a wind rush through me &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; &lsquo;Like a mighty wind rushing&rsquo;, said Cranly &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You urge me to postpone life &mdash; till when? Life is
now &mdash; this is life: if I postpone it I may never live. To walk nobly on
the surface of the earth, to express oneself without pretence, to acknowledge
one&apos;s own humanity! You mustn&apos;t think I rhapsodise: I am quite serious. I speak from my soul &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Soul? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes: from my soul, my spiritual nature. Life is not a
yawn. Philosophy, love, art will not disappear from my world because I no longer
believe that by entertaining an emotion of desire for the tenth part of a second
I prepare for myself an eternity of torture. I am happy &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Can you say that? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Jesus is sad. Why is he so sad? He is solitary &nbsp;.
&nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. I say, you must feel the truth of what I say.
You are holding up the Church against me &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Allow me &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But what is the Church? It is not Jesus, the magnificent solitary with his
<br><font color="green">{ms, 724}</font>
<br> inimitable abstinences. The Church is
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">made by
me and my like
&mdash;</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> her
services, legends, practices, paintings, music, traditions. These
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">her</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
artists gave her. They made her what she is. They accepted Aquinas&apos;
commentary on Aristotle as the Word of God and made her what she is &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And why will you not help her to be so still &mdash; you as an artist? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I see you recognise the truth of what I say though you won&apos;t admit it &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The Church allows the individual conscience to have great
&nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. in fact, if you believe &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. believe,
that is, said Cranly stamping each heavy foot on the words, honestly and truly &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Enough! said Stephen gripping his companion&apos;s arm.
You need not defend me. I will take the odds as they are &mdash;
<br>They paced along three sides of the Green in silence while the couples began
to leave the chains and return meekly to their modest resting-places and after a
while Cranly began to explain to Stephen how he too had felt a desire for life
&mdash; a life of freedom and happiness &mdash; when he had been younger and how
at that time he too had been about to leave the Church in search of happiness
but that many considerations had restrained him.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 725}</font> </p>
<p class="center">XXI</p>
<p> Cranly went to Wicklow at the end of the week leaving Stephen to find
another auditor. Luckily Maurice was enjoying his holidays and though Stephen
spent a great deal of his time roaming through the slums of the city while
Maurice was out on the Bull the two brothers often met and discoursed. Stephen
reported his long conversations with Cranly of which Maurice made full notes.
The younger sceptic did not seem to share his brother&apos;s high opinion of
Cranly though he said little. It was not from jealousy but rather from an
over-estimate of Cranly&apos;s rusticity that Maurice allowed himself this
prejudice. To be rustic, in his eyes, was to be a mass of cunning and stupid and
cowardly habits. He had spoken with Cranly only once but he had often seen him.
He gave it as his opinion that Cranly never thought until someone spoke to him
and then he
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">gives</span></span>
<font color="black">gave</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
birth to some commonplace which he would
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">have</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
liked to
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">be</span></span>
<font color="black">have
been</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> able to
disbelieve. Stephen thought this exaggerated
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">and</span></span> saying that
<a name="jn1040g" href="../../FF/unbs/jn1all.htm#jn1040g">Cranly was daringly
commonplace, that he could talk like a
pint</a>,<a target="foot" id="fyz0098">&ordm;</a> and that it was possible to
credit him with a certain perverse genius. Cranly&apos;s
<br><font color="green">{ms, 726}</font>
<br> undue scepticism and his heavy feet moved Maurice to hit the
rustic<a target="foot" id="fyz0099">&ordm;</a> in him with a name. He called him
<a name="jn1040f" href="../../FF/unbs/jn1all.htm#jn1040f">Thomas Squaretoes</a>
and he would not even admit that
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Cranly</span></span>
<font color="black">he</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
had to a certain extent
<a name="jn1040c" href="../../FF/unbs/jn1all.htm#jn1040c">the grand manner.
Cranly,</a> in his opinion, went to
<a name="jn1040d" href="../../FF/unbs/jn1all.htm#jn1040d">Wicklow</a> because it
was necessary for him to play the god<a target="foot" id="fyz0100">&ordm;</a> to
an audience. He will grow to dislike you, said the shrewd young heathen, when
you begin to play the god to someone else. He will give you nothing in exchange
for what you give him whether he has it or not because his

<font color="black">character</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
is naturally overbearing. He cannot possibly understand half of what you say to
him and yet he would like to be thought the only one
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">y</span></span> who could
understand you. He wants to become more and more necessary to you until he can
have you in his power. Be careful never to show any weakness to him when you are
together. You can have him in your power so long as you hold the whip-hand.
Stephen replied that he thought this was a very novel conception of friendship
which could not be proved true or false by debate alone but that he was himself
the conscious possessor of an intuitive instrument
<br><font color="green">{ms, 727}</font>
<br> which might be trusted to register any enmity as soon as it appeared. He
defended his friend and his friendship at the same time.</p>
<p> The summer was dull and warm. Nearly every day Stephen wandered through the
slums watching the sordid lives of the inhabitants. He read all the
street-ballads which were stuck in the dusty windows of the Liberties. He read
the
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">racing</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
names and prices scrawled in blue pencil outside the dingy tobacco-shops, the
windows of which
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">were</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
adorned with scarlet police journals. He examined all the book-stalls which
offered old directories and volumes of sermons and unheard-of treatises
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">for</span></span> at the rate of a
penny each or three for twopence. He often posted himself opposite one of the
factories in old Dublin at two o&apos;clock to
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">wh</span></span> watch the hands
coming out to dinner<a target="foot" id="fyz0101">&ordm;</a> &mdash; principally
young boys and girls with colourless, expressionless faces, who seized the
opportunity to be gallant in their way. He drifted in and out of interminable
chapels in which an old man dozed on a bench or a clerk dusted the woodwork or
an old woman prayed before the candle she had
<br><font color="green">{ms, 728}</font>
<br> lighted. As he walked slowly through the maze of poor streets he stared
proudly in return for the glances of stupid wonder that he received and watched
from under his eyes the great cow-like trunks of police constables swing slowly
round after him as he passed them. These wanderings filled him with deep-seated
anger and whenever he encountered a burly black-vested priest taking a stroll of
pleasant inspection through these warrens full of swarming and cringing
believers he cursed the farce of Irish
Catholicism<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.
An</span></span><font color="black">:

they may ensure for themselves a life of spiritual paralysis, an island in which
all the power and riches
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">i</span></span> are in the keeping
of those whose kingdom is not of this world, an island in which Caesar
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">professes</span></span> confesses
Christ and Christ confesses Caesar that together they may wax fat upon a
starveling rabblement which is bidden ironically to take to itself this
consolation in hardship &ldquo;The Kingdom of God is within you&rdquo;.</p>
<p> This mood of <a name="pn1019g" href="../../FF/unbs/pn1all.htm#pn1019g">indignation</a> which
<br><font color="green">{ms, 729}</font>
<br> was not guiltless of a certain superficiality was undoubtedly due to the
excitement of release and it was hardly countenanced by him before he realised
the dangers of being a demagogue. The attitude which was constitutional with him
was a silent, self-occupied, contemptuous manner and his intelligence, moreover,
persuaded him that the tomahawk, as an effective instrument of warfare, had
become obsolete. He acknowledged to himself in honest egoism that he could not
take to heart the distress of a nation, the soul of which was antipathetic to
his own, so bitterly as the indignity of a bad line of verse: but at the same
time he was nothing in the world so little as an amateur artist. He wished to
express his nature freely and fully for the benefit of
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">a</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
society which he would enrich and also for his own benefit, seeing that it was
part of his life to do so. It was not part of his life to undertake an extensive
alteration of society but he felt the need to express himself such an urgent
need, such a real need, that he was determined no conventions of a society,
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">however</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
plausibly mingling pity with its tyranny, should be allowed to stand in his way, and
<br><font color="green">{ms, 730}</font>
<br> though a taste for elegance and detail unfitted him for the part of
demagogue,
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">in</span></span>
<font color="black">from</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
his general attitude he might have been supposed not unjustly an ally of the
collectivist politicians, who are often very seriously upbraided by
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">believers</span></span> opponents
who believe in Jehovahs, and decalogues and judgments
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">for</span></span>
<font color="black">with</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
sacrificing the reality to an abstraction.</p>
<p> That kind of Christianity which is called Catholicism seemed to him to stand
in his way and forthwith he removed it. He had been brought up in the belief of
the Roman supremacy and to cease to be a Catholic for him meant to cease to be a
Christian. The idea that the power of an empire is weakest at its borders
requires some modification for everyone knows that the Pope cannot govern Italy
as he governs Ireland nor is the Tsar as terrible an engine to the tradesmen of
S. Petersburg as he is to the little Russian of the Steppes. In fact in many
cases the government of an empire is strongest at its borders and it is
invariably strongest there in the case when its power at the centre is on the
wane. The waves of the rise and fall of empires do not travel with the rapidity of waves of light and it will be perhaps
<br><font color="green">{ms, 731}</font>
<br> a considerable time before Ireland will be able to understand that the
Papacy is no longer going through a period of
anabilism.<a target="foot" id="fyz0102">&ordm;</a> The bands of pilgrims who are
shepherded safely across the continent by their Irish pastors must shame the
jaded reactionaries of the eternal city by their stupefied intensity of worship
in much the same way as the staring provincial newly arrived from Spain or
Africa may have piqued the loyalty of some smiling Roman for whom
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the</span></span>
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">his past had</span></span>
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">his</span></span> the future of
his race was becoming uncertain as its past had already become obvious. Though
it is evident on the one hand that this persistence of Catholic power in Ireland
must intensify very greatly the loneliness of the
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Irish</span></span>
<font color="black">Irish</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
Catholic who voluntarily outlaws himself yet on the other hand the force which
he must generate to propel himself out of so strong and intricate a tyranny may
often be sufficient to place him beyond the region of re-attraction. It was, in
fact, the very fervour of Stephen&apos;s former religious life which sharpened
for him now the pains of his solitary position and at the same time hardened into a less
<br><font color="green">{ms, 732}</font>
<br> pliable, a less appeasable enmity molten rages and
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">glowing</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
transports on which the emotions of helplessness and loneliness and despair had first acted as chilling influences.</p>
<p> The tables in the Library were deserted during the summer months and
whenever Stephen wandered in there he found few faces that he knew.
Cranly&apos;s friend
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">O&apos;Neill</span></span>
<font color="black">Glynn</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>,
the clerk from
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the
Custom House</span></span>
<font color="black">Guinness&apos;s</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>,
was one of these familiar faces: he was very busy all the summer reading
philosophical handbooks. Stephen had the misfortune to be captured one night by
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">O&apos;Neill</span></span>
<font color="black">Glynn</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>,
who at once attempted a conversation on the modern school of Irish writers
&mdash; a subject of which Stephen knew nothing &mdash; and he had to listen to
an inconstant stream of literary opinions. These opinions were not very
interesting: Stephen, for instance,
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">was</span></span>
<font color="black">grew</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
rather weary of
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">O&apos;Neill&apos;s</span></span>
<font color="black">Glynn&apos;s</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
telling him what beautiful poetry Byron and Shelley and Wordsworth and Coleridge
and Keats and Tennyson wrote, and of hearing that Ruskin and Newman and Carlyle
and Macaulay were the greatest modern English prose stylists. At last when
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">O&apos;Neill</span></span>
<font color="black">Glynn</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
was about to begin an account of a literary paper which his sister had read to
the
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">Girl&apos;s</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
Debating Society in
<br><font color="green">{ms, 734}</font>
<br> Loreto<a target="foot" id="fyz0103">&ordm;</a> Convent Stephen thought he
was justified in putting a closure on the conversation
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">b</span></span>, somewhat in
Cranly&apos;s manner, by asking
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">O&apos;Nell</span></span>
<font color="black">Glynn</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
very pointedly could he manage<a target="foot" id="fyz0104">&ordm;</a> to get
him a &lsquo;pass&rsquo; to see the Brewery. The request was made in such a tone
of subdued thirsty curiosity that
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">O&apos;Neill</span></span>
<font color="black">Glynn</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
was
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">too</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
discouraged to continue his literary criticism and promised to do his best to
get the &lsquo;pass&rsquo;. Another reader in the Library who seemed to wish to
be very friendly with Stephen was a young student named Moynihan who had been
elected Auditor of the Literary and Historical Society for the following year.
He had to read his inaugural address in November and he had chosen as his
subjects &ldquo;Modern Unbelief and Modern Democracy&rdquo;. He was an extremely
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">small</span></span>
<font color="black">ugly</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
young man with a wide mouth which gave the idea that it was under his chin until
the face was seen at close quarters, eyes of an over-washed olive green colour
set viciously close together, and large rigid ears standing far apart. He took a
most agitated interest in the success of his paper as he was going to be a solicitor and he relied on this inaugural
<br><font color="green">{ms, 736}</font>
<br> address<a target="foot" id="fyz0105">&ordm;</a> to make his name known. He
had not yet developed the astuteness of the legal mind in as much as he imagined
that Stephen shared his agitated interest concerning the inaugural address.
Stephen came upon him one night while he was busily &lsquo;making-up&rsquo; his
subject. He had some bulky volumes by Lecky at his side and
<a name="jn1037j" href="../../FF/unbs/jn1all.htm#jn1037j">he was reading and
making notes upon an article in the <u>Encyclopaedia Britannica</u> under the
heading of &lsquo;Socialism&rsquo;</a>. He desisted from his labours when he saw
Stephen and began to explain the preparations which the committee were making.
He showed the letters which had been received from various public men who had
been written to by the committee to know if they would speak. He showed the
patterns of the cards of invitation which they had decided to have printed and
he showed a copy of the notice which was to be sent to all the papers. Stephen
who did not know Moynihan very well was surprised at all these confidences.
Moynihan said he was sure Stephen would be the auditor
<br><font color="green">{ms, 737}</font>
<br> who would be elected after him and added how much he had admired the style
of Stephen&apos;s paper. After this he began to discuss his own and
Stephen&apos;s prospects for the degree. He said German was more useful than
Italian
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">(though,
of course, Italian was more beautiful as a
language)</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> and that
he had always studied it for that reason. When Stephen rose to go Moynihan said
he might as well go too and put up his books. He came along Nassau St to catch
his tram for Palmerston Park and
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">on the
way</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>, the night being
wet and the streets black and glistening with rain, he united himself still more
intimately with his successor-designate by little ejaculations and glances in
the wake of a hospital nurse who wore brown stockings and pink petticoats.
Stephen was not at all displeased by the spectacle which he had been
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">quietly</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
observing for a long time before Moynihan had caught sight of it but
Moynihan&apos;s <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">ejaculatory
desi</span></span> desirous ejaculations reminded him of the clicking of a
type-writing machine.
<a name="jn1037i" href="../../FF/unbs/jn1all.htm#jn1037i">Moynihan who by this
time was on famous terms with him said he would like to know Italian on account
<br><font color="green">{ms, 738}</font>
<br> of Boccaccio</a> and the other Italian writers. He told Stephen that if he
wanted to read something &lsquo;smutty&rsquo;
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">that</span></span> the
<u>Decameron</u> took the biscuit for &lsquo;smut&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I wish I was like you, he said, it must be ten times as
bad in the original. I can&apos;t tell you now because here&apos;s my tram
&nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. but it takes the biscuit for downright &nbsp;. &nbsp;.
&nbsp;. you know? &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. well, Tooraloo! &mdash;</p>
<p> Mr Daedalus had not an acute sense of the rights of private property: he
paid rent very rarely. To demand money for eatables seemed to him just but to
expect people to pay for shelter the exorbitant sums which are demanded annually
by houseowners in Dublin seemed to him unjust. He had now been a year in his
house in Clontarf and for that year he had paid a quarter&apos;s rent The writ
which had been first served on him had contained a legal
flaw<a target="foot" id="fyz0106">&ordm;</a> and this fact enabled him to
prolong his term of occupancy. Just now matters were drawing to a head and he
was scouring the city for another house. A private message from a friend in the
Sheriff&apos;s office gave him exactly five days of grace and every morning he brushed his silk
<br><font color="green">{ms, 739}</font>
<br> hat very diligently and polished his eyeglass and went forth humming
derisively to offer himself as a bait to landlords. The halldoor was often
banged loudly on these occasions as the only possible close of an altercation.
The results of the examination had awarded Stephen a mere pass and his father
told him very confidentially that he had better look out for some kind of a doss
because in a week&apos;s time they would all be out on the street. The funds in
the house were very low for the new furniture had fetched very little after its
transport piecemeal to a pawn-office. Tradesmen who had seen it depart had begun
a game of knocking and
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">w</span></span> ringing which was
very often followed by the curious eyes of street-urchins. Isabel was lying
upstairs in the backroom, day by day growing more wasted and querulous. The
doctor came twice a week now and ordered her delicacies. Mrs Daedalus had to set
her wits to work to provide even one substantial meal every day and she
certainly had no time to spare between accomplishing this feat, appeasing the
clamour at the halldoor, parrying her husband&apos;s
<br><font color="green">{ms, 740}</font>
<br> ill-humour and attending on her dying daughter. As for her sons, one was a
freethinker, the other surly. Maurice ate dry bread, muttered maledictions
against his father and his father&apos;s creditors, practised pushing a heavy
flat stone in the garden and raising and lowering a broken
dumb-bell,<a target="foot" id="fyz0107">&ordm;</a> and trudged to the Bull every
day that the tide served. In the evening he wrote his diary or went
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">out</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
for a walk by himself. Stephen wandered about morning, noon and night. The two
brothers were not often together
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">until
one dusky summer evening when</span></span><font color="black">. One dusky
summer evening</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> they
walked into each other very gravely
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">at a
corner</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> and both
burst out laughing: and after that they sometimes went for walks together in the
evening and discussed the art of literature.</p>
<p> Stephen had lent his essay to Lynch as he had promised to do and this loan
had led to a certain intimacy. Lynch had almost taken the final vows in the
order of the discontented but Stephen&apos;s unapologetic egoism, his
remorseless lack of sentiment for himself no less than for others, gave him
pause. His taste for fine arts, which had always seemed to him a taste
<br><font color="green">{ms, 741}</font>
<br> which should be carefully hidden away, now began to encourage itself
timidly. He was also very much relieved to find Stephen&apos;s estheticism
united with a sane and conscienceless acceptance of the animal needs of young
men for, being a shrewd animal himself, he had begun to suspect from
Stephen&apos;s zeal and loftiness of discourse at least an assertion of that
incorrigible virginity which the Irish race
demands<a target="foot" id="fyz0108">&ordm;</a>
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">alike</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
from any John who would baptise it or from any Joan who would set it free as the
first heavenly proof of fitness for such high offices. Daniel&apos;s household
had become so wearisome to Stephen that he had discontinued his Sunday visits
there and had substituted rambles with Lynch through the city. They made their
way with difficulty along the crowded streets where underpaid young men and
flaunting girls were promenading in bands. After a few of these rambles Lynch
had absorbed the new terms which expressed the new point of view and he began to
feel that he was justifying the contempt to which the spectacle of Dublin
manners had always moved him. Many times they stopped to confer in scrupulous slang with the foolish
<br><font color="green">{ms, 742}</font>
<br> virgins of the city, whose souls were almost terrified out of their naughty
intentions by the profundity of the tones of the elder of the young men, and
Lynch, sunning himself in a companionship which was so alert and liberal, so
free from a taint of secret competition or patronage, began to wonder how he
could ever have thought Stephen an affected young man. Everyone, he thought now,
who has a character to preserve must have a manner to preserve it with.</p>
<p> One evening as Stephen was coming down the Library staircase, after idling
away a half-hour at <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">a dictionary
of music</span></span> a medical treatise on singing, he heard a dress brushing
the steps behind him. The dress belonged to Emma Clery who, of course, was very
much surprised at seeing Stephen. She had just been working at some old Irish
and now she was going home: her father didn&apos;t like her to stay in the
Library until ten o&apos;clock as she had no escort. The night was so fine that
she thought she would not take the tram. Stephen asked her might he not see her
home. They stood under the porch for a few minutes, talking. Stephen took out
<br><font color="green">{ms, 743}</font>
<br> a cigarette and lit it but at once knocked off the lighted end
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">very</span></span> meditatively
and put the cigarette back into his case: her eyes were very bright.</p>
<p> They went up Kildare St and when they came to the corner of the Green she
crossed the road and they continued to walk, but not quite so quickly, along the
gravel path beside the chains.<a target="foot" id="fyz0109">&ordm;</a> The
chains bore their nightly burden of amorousness. He offered her his arm which
she took, leaning appreciably upon it. They talked gossip. She discussed the
likelihood of McCann&apos;s marrying the eldest of Mr Daniel&apos;s daughters.
She seemed to think it very amusing that McCann should have a desire for
matrimony but she added quite seriously that Annie Daniel was certainly a nice
girl. A feminine voice called out from the dusky region of the couples &ldquo;Don&apos;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; &ldquo;&lsquo;Don&apos;t&rsquo;, said Emma. Isn&apos;t
that Mr Punch&apos;s advice to young men who are about to marry &nbsp;. &nbsp;.
&nbsp;. I hear you are quite a woman-hater now, Stephen &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Wouldn&apos;t that be a change? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And I heard you read a dreadful paper
<br><font color="green">{ms, 744}</font>
<br> paper in the college &mdash; all kinds of ideas in it. Isn&apos;t that so? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Please, don&apos;t mention that paper &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But I&apos;m sure you&apos;re a woman-hater. You&apos;ve
got so stand-offish, you know, so reserved. Perhaps you don&apos;t like ladies&apos; company? &mdash;
<br>Stephen pressed her arm a little by way of a disclaimer.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Are you a believer in the emancipation of women too? she asked &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; To be sure! said Stephen &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, I&apos;m glad to hear you say that, at any rate. I
didn&apos;t think you were in favour of women &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, I am very liberal &mdash; like Father Dillon &mdash; he is very liberal-minded &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes? Isn&apos;t he? she said in a. puzzled manner &nbsp;.
&nbsp;. &nbsp;. Why do you never go to Daniel&apos;s now? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I &nbsp;. &nbsp;. don&apos;t know &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What do you do with yourself on Sunday evenings? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. stay at home, said Stephen &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You must be morose when you&apos;re at home &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Not I. I&apos;m as happy as if the divil had me &mdash;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 745}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I want to hear you sing again &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, thanks &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. Some time, perhaps &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Why don&apos;t you study music? Have your voice trained? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Strange to say I was reading a book on singing tonight.
It is called &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I am sure you would make a success with your voice, she
said quickly evidently afraid to allow him control of the conversation &nbsp;.
&nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. Have you ever heard Father Moran sing? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No. Has he a good voice &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, very nice; he sings with such taste. He&apos;s an
awfully nice man, don&apos;t you think? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Very nice indeed. Do you go to confession to him? &mdash;
<br>She leaned a little more appreciably on his arm and said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Now, don&apos;t be bold, Stephen &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I wish you would go to confession to me, Emma, said Stephen from his heart &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That&apos;s a dreadful thing to say. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. Why would you like that? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; To hear your sins &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Stephen! &mdash;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 746}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; To hear you murmur them into my ear and say you were
sorry and would never
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">do</span></span>
<font color="black">commit</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
them again and ask me to forgive you. And I would forgive you and make you
promise to commit them every time you liked and say &ldquo;God bless you, my dear child&rdquo; &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, for shame, Stephen! Such a way to talk of the sacraments! &mdash;
<br>Stephen had expected that she would blush but her cheek maintained its
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">innonce</span></span>
<font color="black">innocence</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
and her eyes grew brighter and brighter.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You&apos;d get tired of that too &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do you think so? said Stephen, making an effort not to be
surprised at such an intelligent remark &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You&apos;d be a dreadful flirt, I&apos;m sure. You get
tired of everything so quickly &mdash; just the way you did in the Gaelic League &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; People should not think of the end in the beginning of flirtations, should they? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Perhaps not &mdash;</p>
<p> When they came to the corner of her terrace she stopped and said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Thanks ever so much &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Thank <u>you</u> &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, you must reform, won&apos;t you, and
<br><font color="green">{ms, 747}</font>
<br> come next Sunday to Daniel&apos;s &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; If you expressly &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, I insist &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Very good, Emma. In that case, I&apos;ll go &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Mind. I expect you to obey me &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Very good &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Thanks again for your kindness coming across with me.
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Aur</span></span> <u>Au

<p class="pdi">&mdash; Good night &mdash;</p>
<p> He waited till he had seen her enter the fourth garden of the terrace. She
did not turn her head to see if he was watching but he was not cast down because
he knew she had a trick of seeing things without using her eyes frankly.</p>
<p> Of course when Lynch heard
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">of</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
this incident he rubbed his hands together and prophesied. By his advice Stephen
went to Daniel&apos;s on the following Sunday. The old horsehair sofa was there,
the picture of the Sacred Heart was there, she was there. The prodigal was
welcomed. She spoke to him very little during the evening and seemed to be in
deep conversation with Hughes, who had lately been honoured by an invitation. She was dressed in cream
<br><font color="green">{ms, 748}</font>
<br> colour and the great mass of her hair lay heavily upon her cream-coloured
neck. She asked him to sing and when he had sung a song of Dowland&apos;s she
asked him would he not sing them an Irish song. Stephen glanced from her eyes to
Hughes&apos;s face and sat down again at the piano. He sang her one of the few
Irish melodies which he knew &ldquo;My love she was born in the North
Countree&rdquo;. When his song was over she applauded loudly and so did Hughes.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I love the Irish music, she said a few minutes
afterwards, inclining herself toward him with an air of oblivion, it is so soul-stirring &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen said nothing. He remembered almost every word she had said from the
first time he had met her and he strove to recall any word which revealed the
presence of a spiritual principle in her worthy of so significant a name as
soul. He submitted himself to the perfumes of her body and strove to locate a
spiritual principle in it: but he could not. She seemed to conform to the Catholic belief, to obey the
<br><font color="green">{ms, 749}</font>
<br> commandments and the precepts. By all outward signs he was compelled to
esteem her holy. But he could not so stultify himself as to misread the gleam in
her eyes as holy or to interpret the
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">motions</span></span> rise and
fall of her bosom as a movement of a sacred intention.
<a name="pn1002b" href="../../FF/unbs/pn1all.htm#pn1002b">He thought of his own
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">fervid

<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">no more

under the influence of her charm he wondered whether the God of the Roman
Catholics would put him into hell because he had failed to understand that most
marketable goodness which makes it possible to give comfortable assent to
propositions without in the least ordering one&apos;s life in accordance with
them and had failed to appreciate the digestive value of the sacraments.</a></p>
<p> Among the guests was an elder brother of Mrs Daniel&apos;s, Father Healy. He
had just come back from the United States of America where he had been for seven
years collecting money to build a chapel near
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Ennicothy</span></span>
<font color="black">Enniscorthy</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>. He was being
<br><font color="green">{ms, 750}</font>
<br> f&icirc;ted on his home-coming. He sat in the armchair which Mr Daniel
insisted on giving him and joined the tips of his fingers lightly together and
smiled on the company. He was
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">a</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
little fat white priest whose body reminded one of a new tennis-ball and as he
sat in his chair with one leg thrown smartly over the other he kept agitating
quickly a fat little foot which was encased in a fat little creaky leather shoe.
He spoke with a judicious American
accent<a target="foot" id="fyz0111">&ordm;</a> and when he spoke the room was
all ears. He was greatly interested in the new Gaelic revival and in the new
literary movement in Ireland. He paid particular attention to McCann and to
Stephen, asking both of them many questions. He agreed with McCann that
Gladstone was the greatest man of the nineteenth century and then Mr Daniel, who
was glowing with pride at the honour he was paying so honourable a guest, told a
dignified story of Gladstone
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">and Sir
Ashmead Bartlett</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> and
deepened his voice to reproduce the oratory of the grand old man. During the
charades
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">he</span></span>
<font color="black">Father
Healy</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> kept asking Mr
Daniel to repeat to him the witticisms of the players
<br><font color="green">{ms, 751}</font>
<br> and very often he shook laughing when Mr Daniel had told him what a player
had said. He let no opportunity for increasing his knowledge of the interior
life of the University escape him and every allusion was beaten out into an
unmistakable flatness before he nodded a head in satisfaction. Attacking Stephen
on the literary side he began a monologue on the writings of John Boyle
O&apos;Reilly but finding Stephen too polite he began to depreciate an
exclusively literary training for young men. Stephen thereupon began to tell him
of the alley in the College and of the hand-ball tournament and all with discreet earnestness.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I am sure now, said Father Healy putting his head
shrewdly on one side and looking genially at the youth, I am sure you would make
a good player. You&apos;re just the build &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, no, said Stephen longing for Cranly&apos;s presence. I&apos;m a poor player &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; So you say, said Father Healy laughing, so you say &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Really, said Stephen, smiling at this clever detection of
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the</span></span>
<font color="black">his</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
merits as a handball-player and at the recollection of
<br><font color="green">{ms, 752}</font>
<br> Cranly&apos;s execrations at his play.</p>
<p> At last Father Healy began to yawn a little and this was taken as a signal
for handing rounds cups of milk and slices of bread and butter to the young men
and women, none of whom took anything stronger. Hughes, indeed, was so frugal
that he declined to eat or drink anything at all whereat Stephen was somewhat
disappointed as he could have had a good view of the idealist. McCann who
represented the practical view of life ate rather noisily and asked for jam.
This remark made Father Healy, who had never heard it before, laugh very
heartily and made the others smile but Hughes and Stephen looked at each other
very gravely across the uninhabited<a target="foot" id="fyz0112">&ordm;</a>
tablecloth. The young women were all sitting at one end of the table and the
young men at the other end with the result that one end of the table was very
lively and the other end very serious. Stephen after having failed
<br><font color="green">{ms, 753}</font>
<br> to engage in conversation a maiden aunt of the family who had fulfilled her
office by bringing in two tumblers of punch, one for Father Healy and the other
for Mr Daniel, retired silently to the piano where he began to strum old airs
and hum them to himself until someone at the table said &ldquo;Do sing us
something&rdquo; and then he left the piano and returned to the horsehair sofa.</p>
<p> Her eyes were very bright. Stephen&apos;s way through self-examinations had
worn him out so much that he could not but long to repose himself in the
neighbourhood of her beauty. He remembered the first mood of monstrous
dissatisfaction which had overcome him on his entrance into Dublin life and how
it was her beauty that had appeased him. Now she seemed to offer him rest. He
wondered did she understand him or sympathise with him and was the vulgarity of
her manners only a condescension of one who was consciously playing the game. He
knew that it was not for such an image that he had constructed
<br><font color="green">{ms, 754}</font>
<br> a theory of art and life and a garland of verse and yet if he could have
been sure of her he would have held his art and verses lightly enough. The
longing for a mad night of love came upon him, a desperate willingness to cast
his soul away, his life and his art, and to bury them all with her under fathoms
of lust-laden<a target="foot" id="fyz0113">&ordm;</a> slumber. The ugly
artificiality of the lives over which Father Healy was comfortably presiding
struck this outrageous instant out of him and he went on repeating to himself a
line from Dante for no other reason except that it contained the angry
disyllable &ldquo;frode&rdquo;. Surely, he thought, I have as much right to use
the word as ever Dante had. The spirits of Moynihan and O&apos;Neill and Glynn
seemed to him worthy of some blowing about round the verges of a hell which
would be a caricature of Dante&apos;s. The spirits of the patriotic and
religious enthusiasts seemed to him fit to inhabit the fraudulent circles where hidden in hives of immaculate ice they
<br><font color="green">{ms, 755}</font>
<br> they might work their bodies to the due pitch of frenzy. The spirits of the
tame sodalists, unsullied and undeserving, he would petrify amid a ring of
Jesuits in the circle of foolish and grotesque virginities and ascend above them
and their baffled icons to where his Emma, with no detail of her earthly form or
vesture abated, invoked him from a Mohammedan paradise.</p>
<p> At the door he had to resign her to others and see her depart with
insignificant courtesies and as
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">she</span></span> he came home
alone he led his mood through mazes of doubts and misgivings. After that evening
he did not see her for a little time as home affairs were rather engrossing. His
father&apos;s days of grace were exciting days. It seemed likely that the family
would not have where to lay its heads when at the eleventh hour Mr Daedalus
found a roof with a friend from the North of Ireland who was traveller for an
ironmonger. Mr Wilkinson was in possession of an old-fashioned house containing perhaps fifteen
<br><font color="green">{ms, 756}</font>
<br> rooms of which he was nominally a tenant but, the landlord, an old miser
without kith or kin in the world, having died very opportunely, Mr
Wilkinson&apos;s tenancy was untroubled by considerations of time or money. Mr
Daedalus was allowed a set of apartments in this dilapidated mansion for a small
weekly payment and on the night before the day fixed for his legal eviction he
moved his camp by night. The little furniture which remained to them was carried
on a float<a target="foot" id="fyz0114">&ordm;</a> and Stephen and his brother
and his mother and his father carried the ancestral portraits themselves as the
draymen had drunk a good deal more than was good for them. It was a clear night
of late summer freshened with cold as they walked in a body beside the sea-wall.
Isabel had been removed earlier in the day and put in Mrs Wilkinson&apos;s
charge. Mr Daedalus was a long way in front with Maurice and in high spirits
with his successful manoeuvre. Stephen followed with his mother and even she was
light-hearted. The tide was lapping softly
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">at</span></span>
<font color="black">by</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
the wall, being at the full, and through
<br><font color="green">{ms, 757}</font>
<br> the clear air Stephen heard his father&apos;s voice like a muffled flute
singing a love-song. He made his mother stop to listen and they both leaned on
the heavy picture-frames and listened:</p>
<p class="set">Shall carry my heart to thee
<br> Shall carry my heart to thee
<br> And the breath of the balmy night
<br> Shall carry my heart to thee</p>
<p> In Mr Wilkinson&apos;s house there was a lofty drawing-room panelled in oak
entirely bare of furniture except for a piano. During the winter Mr Wilkinson
had been paid seven shillings a week by a dancing club for the use of the room
on Tuesdays and Fridays but now he used the lower end of the room as a
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">general

samples. He was a tall one-eyed man with a silent manner and a great power of
holding his drink. He had a deep appreciation of his guest whom he never
addressed without the prefix
&ldquo;Mr&rdquo;.<a target="foot" id="fyz0115">&ordm;</a> He was married to a
tall woman as silent as himself who read a great many novelettes and hung half her body out of the windows while her
<br><font color="green">{ms, 758}</font>
<br> two young children entangled themselves in pieces of wire-netting and
coils<a target="foot" id="fyz0116">&ordm;</a> of gas-pipes. She had a long white
face and she laughed at everything. Mr Daedalus and Mr Wilkinson went to town
every morning together and often came back together and, during the day, Mrs
Wilkinson hung out of the windows or talked with messenger boys and milkmen
while Mrs Daedalus sat by Isabel&apos;s bedside. There could be no doubt now
that the girl was in a bad way. Her eyes were piteously enlarged and her voice
had become hollow: she sat half propped-up by pillows in the bed all day, her
damp-looking hair hanging in wisps about her face, turning over the pages of an
illustrated book. She began to whimper when she was told to eat or when anyone
left her bedside. She showed very
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">few</span></span> little animation
except when the piano was playing in the room below and then she made them
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">o</span></span> leave the
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">bedroom</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
door open and closed her eyes. Money was still scarce and still the doctor
ordered her delicacies. The lingering nature of her illness had spread a
hopeless apathy about the household and, though she herself
<br><font color="green">{ms, 759}</font>
<br> was little more than a child, she must have been aware of this. Stephen
alone with persistent kindness preserved his usual manner of selfish
cheerfulness and strove to stir a fire out of her
embers<a target="foot" id="fyz0117">&ordm;</a> of life. He even exaggerated and
his mother reproved him for being so noisy. He could not go into his sister and
say to her &ldquo;Live! live!&rdquo; but he tried to touch her soul in the
shrillness of a whistle or the vibration of a note. Whenever he went into the
room he asked questions with an indifferent air as if her illness was of no
importance and once or twice he could have assured himself that the eyes that
looked at him from the bed had guessed his meaning.</p>
<p> The summer closed in sultry weather. Cranly was still in Wicklow and Lynch
had begun to study for an examination in October. Stephen was too concerned with
himself to talk much with his brother. In a few days Maurice was to return to
school, that event having been delayed a fortnight on account of what he himself
called the &lsquo;boot and clothes&rsquo; complaint. Mr Wilkinson&apos;s
household dragged out day after day, Mrs Wilkinson hanging herself out of the windows and
<br><font color="green">{ms, 760}</font>
<br> Mrs Daedalus watching her daughter. Very often Mr Wilkinson brought his
guest home after a day&apos;s carouse and the two would sit in the kitchen for
the rest of the night talking politics loudly. When Stephen turned the corner of
the avenue he could often hear his father&apos;s voice shouting or his
father&apos;s
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">voice</span></span>
<font color="black">fist</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
banging the table. When he came in the two disputants would ask him for his
opinion but he always ate what supper there was without remark and
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">went
up</span></span>
<font color="black">retired</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
to his room
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">hearing</span></span>
<font color="black">and as he went up the stairs he could
hear</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> his father say
to Mr Wilkinson &ldquo;Queer chap, you know, queer chap!&rdquo; and he could
imagine the heavy stare of Mr Wilkinson&apos;s eyes.</p>
<p> Stephen was very lonely. As at the beginning of the summer so now: he
wandered vaguely through the streets. Emma had gone away to the Isles of Aran
with a Gaelic party. He was hardly unhappy and yet not happy. His moods were
still waited upon and courted and set down in phrases of prose and verse: and
when the soles of his feet were too tired
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">or</span></span>, his mood too
dim<a target="foot" id="fyz0118">&ordm;</a> a memory or too timid a hope, he
would wander into the long <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">loafty</span></span> lofty dusty drawing-room
<br><font color="green">{ms, 761}</font>
<br> and sit at the piano while the sunless dusk enwrapped
him.<a target="foot" id="fyz0119">&ordm;</a> He could feel about him and above
him the hopeless house and the decay of leaves and in his soul the one bright
insistent star of joy trembling at her wane. The chords that floated towards the
cobwebs and rubbish and floated vainly to the dust-strewn windows were the
meaningless voices of his perturbation and all they could do was flow
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">in</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
meaningless succession through
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">all</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
the chambers of sentience. He breathed an air of tombs.</p>
<p> Even the value of his own life came into doubt with him. He laid a finger
upon every falsehood it contained:
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">an</span></span> egoism which
proceeded bravely before men to be frighted by the least challenge of the
conscience, freedom which would dress the world anew in
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the</span></span> vestments and
usages begotten of enslavement, mastery of an art understood by few which owed
its very delicacy to a physical decrepitude, itself the brand and sign of vulgar
ardours. Cemeteries revealed their ineffectual records to him, records
<br><font color="green">{ms, 762}</font>
<br> of the lives of all those who with good grace or bad grace had accepted
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">t</span></span> an obvious
divinity. The vision of all those failures, and the vision, far more pitiful, of
congenital lives, shuffling onwards amid yawn and howl, beset him with evil: and
evil, in the similitude of a distorted ritual, called to his soul to commit fornication with her.</p>
<p> One evening he sat
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">silent</span></span> at his piano
while the dusk enfolded him. The dismal sunset lingered still upon the
window-panes in a smoulder of rusty fires. Above him and about him hung the
shadow of decay, the decay of leaves and flowers, the decay of hope. He desisted
from his chords and waited, bending upon the keyboard in silence: and his soul
commingled itself with the assailing, inarticulate dusk.
<a name="jn0042a" href="../../FF/unbs/jn0all.htm#jn0042a">A form which he knew
for his mother&apos;s appeared far down in the room, standing in the
doorway.</a><a target="foot" id="fyz0120">&ordm;</a>
<a name="jn0042a" href="../../FF/unbs/jn0all.htm#jn0042a">In the gloom her excited face was crimson. A voice
<br><font color="green">{ms, 763}</font>
<br> which he remembered as his mother&apos;s, a voice of a terrified human
being, called his name. The form at the piano answered:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do you know anything about the body? &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;.&nbsp;. &mdash;
<br>He heard his mother&apos;s voice addressing him excitedly like the voice of a messenger in a play: &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What ought I do? There&apos;s some matter coming away
from the hole in Isabel&apos;s &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. stomach
&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Did you ever hear of that happening? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I don&apos;t know, he answered, trying to make sense of
her words, trying to say them again to himself &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ought I send for the doctor &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. Did
you ever hear of that? &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. What ought I do? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I don&apos;t know &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. What hole? &mdash;</p>

<br><font color="green">{ms, 764}</font> </p>
<p class="center">XXII</p>
<p class="flush">Stephen was present in the room when his sister died. As soon
as her mother had been alarmed the priest was sent for. He was a diminutive man
who carried his head mostly on his right shoulder and spoke in a lisping voice
which was not very easily heard. He heard the girl&apos;s confession and went
away saying &ldquo;Leave it to God: He knows best: leave it to God&rdquo;. The
doctor came with Mr Daedalus on a car, examined the girl and asked had she seen
a priest. He went away saying that while there was life there was hope but she
was very low: he would call in the morning. Isabel died a little after midnight.
Her father who was not quite sober walked about the room on tiptoe, cried in
little fits every time his daughter showed a change and kept on saying
&ldquo;That&apos;s right, duckey: take that now&rdquo; whenever her mother
forced her to swallow a little champagne and then nodded his head until he began
to cry afresh. He kept telling everyone to keep her spirits up. Maurice sat down
by the empty fireplace and gazed in the grate. Stephen sat at the head of the bed and held his sister&apos;s
<br><font color="green">{ms, 765}</font>
<br> hand, her mother bending over her offering her the glass and kissing her
and praying. Isabel seemed to Stephen to have grown very old: her face had
become a woman&apos;s face. Her eyes turned constantly between the two figures
nearest to her as if to say she had been wronged in being given life and, at
Stephen&apos;s word, she gulped down whatever was offered her. When she could
swallow no more her mother said to her &ldquo;You are going home, dear, now. You
are going to heaven where we will all meet again. Don&apos;t you know? &nbsp;.
&nbsp;. &nbsp;. Yes, dear &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. Heaven, with God&rdquo; and
the child fixed her great eyes on her mother&apos;s face while her bosom began
to heave loudly beneath the bedclothes.</p>
<p> Stephen felt very acutely the futility of his sister&apos;s life. He would
have done many things for her and, though she was almost a stranger to him, he
was sorry to see her lying dead. Life seemed to him a gift; the statement
&lsquo;I am alive&rsquo; seemed to him to contain a satisfactory certainty and
many other things, held up as indubitable, seemed to him uncertain. His sister
had enjoyed little more than the fact of life, few or none
<br><font color="green">{ms, 765}</font>
<br> of<a target="foot" id="fyz0121">&ordm;</a> its privileges. The supposition
of an allwise God calling a soul home whenever it seemed good to Him could not
redeem in his eyes the futility of her life. The wasted body that lay before him
had existed by sufferance; the spirit that dwelt
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">therein</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
had literally never dared to live and had not learned anything by an abstention
which it had not willed for itself. She had not been anything herself and for
that reason had not attached anything to herself or herself to anything. When
they were children together people had spoken of &lsquo;Stephen and
Maurice&rsquo; and her name had been added by an afterthought. Even her name, a
certain lifeless name, had held her apart from the plays of life. Stephen
remembered the voices of children crying with glee and venom:</p>
<p class="set">Stephen, the Reephen, the Rix-Dix Deephen!</p>
<p class="flush">but it was always with half-hearted glee and shamefaced venom
that they
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">had</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
called out her name:</p>
<p class="set">Isabel, the Risabel, the Rix-Dix Disabel.</p>
<p>
<br><font color="green">{ms, 766}</font> </p>
<p class="flush">Isabel&apos;s death was the occasion of bringing to the house
many of Mrs Daedalus&apos; relatives. They knocked a little timidly at the
hall-door and though they were very retiring in manner their host convicted them
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">&mdash;
the females, at least
&mdash;</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> privately of
making a cunning use of their eyes. The males he received in the long empty
drawingroom in which an early fire had been lit. During the two nights of the
girl&apos;s wake a big company assembled in the drawingroom: they did not smoke
but they drank and told stories.
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Every</span></span>
<font color="black">The</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
morning after the table looked like a marine-stores so crowded was it with empty
bottles, black and green. Isabel&apos;s two brothers assisted at this wake. The
discussions were often general. One of the boys&apos; uncles was a very
shock-headed asthmatic man who had in his youth rather indiscreet with his
landlady&apos;s daughter and the family had been scarcely appeased by a tardy
marriage. One of Mr Daedalus friends, a clerk in the Police Courts, told the
company of the task which a friend of his in the Castle had in examining prohibited books:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Such filth, he said, You&apos;d wonder
<br><font color="green">{ms, 777}</font>
<br> how<a target="foot" id="fyz0122">&ordm;</a> any man would have the face to print it &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; When I was a boy, said Uncle John in a very flat accent,
and had more
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">of
a</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> taste for reading
than now and much less money I used to go to a bookshop near Patrick&apos;s
Close. One day I went there to buy a copy of the &lsquo;<u>Colleen
Bawn</u>&rsquo;. The man asked me in and he showed me a book &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I know, I know, said the clerk from the Police Courts &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Such a book to put into the hands of a young lad! Such
ideas to put in his head! Scandalous! &mdash;
<br>Maurice let a moment of respectful approval pass and then he asked:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Did you buy the book. Uncle John? &mdash;
<br><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">?&mdash;</span></span>
Everyone seemed inclined to laugh but Uncle John grew very red and angry and went on:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; They should be prosecuted for putting such books on sale.
Children should be kept in their places &mdash;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 778}</font> </p>
<p> Standing beside the closed piano on the morning of the funeral Stephen heard
the coffin bumping down the crooked staircase. The mourners followed it out and
seated themselves in the four carriages. Stephen and Maurice carried the three
wreaths into the mourning coach. The hearse made for Glasnevin Cemetery at a
smart trot. At the cemetery gates six hearses were drawn up. The funeral which
had drawn up immediately before Isabel&apos;s was a funeral of someone of the
poor class. The mourners, who were huddled in sixes on outside cars, were just
scrambling down from the cars as Mr Daedalus and his fellow-mourners drove up.
The first funeral went in through the gates where a little crowd of loungers and
officials were grouped. Stephen watched them pass in.
<a name="jn0044a" href="../../FF/unbs/jn0all.htm#jn0044a">Two of them who were
late pushed their way viciously through the crowd. A girl, one hand catching the
woman&apos;s skirt, ran a pace in advance. The girl&apos;s face was the face of
a fish, discoloured and oblique-eyed; the woman&apos;s face was square and
pinched, the face of a bargainer. The girl, her mouth distorted, looked up at
the woman to see if it</a><a target="foot" id="fyz0123">&ordm;</a>
<a name="jn0044a" href="../../FF/unbs/jn0all.htm#jn0044a">
<br><font color="green">{ms, 779}</font>
<br> was time to cry: the woman, settling a flat bonnet, hurried on towards the mortuary chapel.</a></p>
<p> At the mortuary chapel Mr Daedalus and his friends had to wait until the
poor mourners had first been served. In a few minutes the service was over and
Isabel&apos;s coffin was carried up and laid on the bier. The mourners scattered
in the seats and knelt timidly on their handkerchiefs. A priest with a great
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">toad-like</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
belly balanced to one side came out of the sacristy, followed by an altar boy.
He read the service rapidly in a croaking voice and shook the aspergill drowsily
over the coffin, the boy piping responses at intervals. When he had read the
service he closed the book, crossed himself, and made back for the sacristy at a
swinging
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">gate</span></span>
<font color="black">gait</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>.
Labourers came in and bore out the coffin to a barrow and pushed it along the
gravel-path. The super-intendant of the cemetery shook hands with Mr Daedalus at
the door of the chapel and followed the funeral slowly. The coffin slid evenly
into the grave and the grave-diggers began
<br><font color="green">{ms, 780}</font>
<br> to shovel in the earth. At the sound of the first clods Mr Daedalus began
to sob and one of his friends came to his side and held his arm.</p>
<p> When the grave had been covered in the grave-diggers laid their shovels upon
it and crossed themselves. The wreaths were put on the grave and after a pause
for prayer the mourning party returned through the trim alleys of the cemetery.
The unnatural tension of condolence had been somewhat relieved and the talk was
becoming practical again. They got into the carriages and drove back along the
Glasnevin road. At Dunphy&apos;s corner the carriage drew up behind the
carriages of other funerals. In the bar Mr Wilkinson stood the party the first
drink: the drivers of the carriages were called in and they stood by the door in
a clump and rubbed their coat-sleeves across their bony battered-looking faces
until they were asked to name their drink. They all chose pints and indeed their
own bodily tenements were not unlike hardly used pewter measures. The mourners drank small specials for the most part.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 781}</font>
<br>
<br>Stephen, when asked what he would drink, answered at once:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A pint &mdash;
<br>His father ceased talking and began to regard him with great attention but,
Stephen feeling too cold-hearted to be abashed, received his pint very seriously
and drank it off in a long draught. While his head was beneath the tankard he
was conscious of his startled father and he felt the savour of the bitter clay of the graveyard sharp in his throat.</p>
<p> The inexpressibly mean way in which his sister had been buried inclined
Stephen to consider rather seriously the claims of water and fire to be the last
homes of dead bodies. The entire apparatus of the State seemed to him at fault
from its first to its last operation. No young man can contemplate the fact of
death with extreme satisfaction and no young man, specialised by fate or her
stepsister chance for an organ of sensitiveness and intellectiveness, can
contemplate the network of falsities and trivialities which make up the funeral
of a dead burgher without extreme disgust. For some days after
<br><font color="green">{ms, 782}</font>
<br> the funeral Stephen, clothed in second-hand clothes of two shades of
black,<a target="foot" id="fyz0124">&ordm;</a> had to receive sympathies. Many
of these sympathies proceeded from casual friends of the family. Nearly all the
men said &ldquo;And how is the poor mother bearing it?&rdquo; and nearly all the
women said &ldquo;It&apos;s a great trial for your poor mother&rdquo;: and the
sympathies were always uttered in the same listless unconvincing monotone.
McCann was also sympathetic. He came over to Stephen while that young man was
looking into a haberdasher&apos;s window at some ties and wondering why the
Chinese chose
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">yellow</span></span>
<font color="black">white<a target="foot" id="fyz0125">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
as a colour of mourning. He shook hands briskly with Stephen:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;
<a name="jn0045a" href="../../FF/unbs/jn0all.htm#jn0045a">I was sorry to hear of
the death of your sister &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;.sorry we didn&apos;t
know in time &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. to have been at the funeral &mdash;
<br>Stephen released his hand gradually and said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, she was very young &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. a girl &mdash;
<br>McCann released his hand at the same rate of release, and said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Still &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;.it hurts</a> &mdash;</p>
<p> The acme of unconvincingness seemed to Stephen to have been reached
<br><font color="green">{ms, 783}</font>
<br> at that moment.</p>
<p> The second year of Stephen&apos;s University life opened early in October.
His godfather had made no comment on the result of the first year but Stephen
was told that this opportunity would be the last given him. He chose Italian as
his optional subject, partly from a desire to read Dante seriously, and partly
to escape the crush of French and German lectures. No-one else in the college
studied Italian and every second morning he came to the college at ten
o&apos;clock and went up to Father Artifoni&apos;s bedroom. Father Artifoni was
an intelligent little <u>moro</u> who came from Bergamo, a town in Lombardy. He
had clean lively eyes and a thick full mouth. Every morning when Stephen rapped
at his door <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">he</span></span> there
was the noise of chairs being disarranged before the &ldquo;Avanti!&rdquo; The
little priest never read in the sitting posture and the noise which Stephen
heard was the noise of an improvised lectern returning to its constituent parts,
namely, two cane chairs and a stiff blotting-pad. The Italian lessons often extended
<br><font color="green">{ms, 784}</font>
<br> beyond the hour and much less grammar and literature was discussed than
philosophy. The teacher probably knew the doubtful reputation of his pupil but
for this very reason he adopted a language of ingenuous piety, not that he was
himself Jesuit enough to lack ingenuousness but that he was Italian enough to
enjoy a game of belief and unbelief. He reproved his pupil once for an admiring
allusion to the author of <u>The Triumphant Beast</u>.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You know, he said, the writer, Bruno, was a terrible heretic &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, said Stephen, and he was terribly burned &mdash;
<br>But the teacher was a poor
<font color="red"><sup><small>|s1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">inquisitioner</span></span>
<font color="black">inquisitor</font><font color="red"><sup><small>s1|</small></sup></font>.
He told Stephen very slily that when he and his clerical companions attended
public lectures in the University the lecturer was shrewd enough to add a trifle
of salt to his criticisms. Father Artifoni accepted the salt with a relish. He
was unlike many of the citizens of the third Italy in his want of affection for
the English and he was inclined to be lenient towards the audacities of his
pupil, which, he supposed, must
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">have</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
been the outcome
<br><font color="green">{ms, 785}</font>
<br> of too fervid Irishism. He was unable to associate audacity of thought with
any temper but that of the irredentist.</p>
<p> Father Artifoni had to admit one day to Stephen that the most reprehensible
moment of human delight in as much as it had given pleasure to a human being was
good in the sight of God. The conversation had been about an Italian novel. A
priest in the house had read the novel and condemned it to the dinner-table. It
was bad, he said. Stephen urged that it had given him at least esthetic pleasure
and that, for that reason, it could be said to be good:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Father Byrne does not think so &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But God? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; For God it might be &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. good &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Then I prefer to side against Father Byrne &mdash;
<br>They argued very acutely of the beautiful and the good. Stephen wished to
amend or to clarify scholastic terminology: a contrast between the good and the
beautiful was not necessary. Aquinas had defined the good as that towards the
possession of which an appetite tended, the desirable. But the true and the
beautiful were desirable, were the highest, most persistent orders of the desirable, truth being desired by the
<br><font color="green">{ms, 786}</font>
<br> intellectual
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">appeased</span></span>
<font color="black">appetite</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
which was appeased by the most satisfying relations of the intelligible, beauty
being desired by the esthetic appetite
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">appetite</span></span> which was
appeased by the most satisfying relations of the sensible. Father Artifoni
admired very much the whole-hearted manner in which Stephen vivified philosophic
generalisations and encouraged the young man to write a treatise on esthetic. It
must have been a surprise for him to find in such latitudes a young man who
could not conceive a divorce between art and nature and that not for reasons of
climate or temperament but for intellectual reasons. For Stephen art was neither
a copy nor an imitation of nature: the artistic process was a natural process.
In all his talk about artistic perfection it was impossible to
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">deteuct</span></span> detect an
artificial accent. To talk about the perfection of one&apos;s art was not for
him to talk about
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">something</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
agreed upon as sublime but in reality no more than a sublime convention but
rather to talk a veritably sublime process of one&apos;s nature which had a right to examination and open discussion.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 787}</font> </p>
<p> It was exactly this vivid interest which kept him away from such places of
uncomely dalliance as the debating society and the warmly cushioned sodality. Mr
Moynihan&apos;s inaugural address was held in the Aula Maxima in November. The
president took the chair, surrounded by his professors. The platform was given
up to notabilities and the body of the hall to the irregular intellectuals who
go from address to address during the winter season and never miss attendance at
the theatre when the play is not played in English. The end of the hall was
packed with the students of the college. Nine-tenths of them were very serious
and nine-tenths of the remainder were serious at intervals. Before the paper was
read Whelan received from the president a gold medal for oratory, and one of Mr
Daniel&apos;s sons a silver medal for oratory. Mr Moynihan was in evening dress
and the front of his hair was curled.
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">The president clapped him
when</span></span> When he stood up to read his paper the president clapped him
and then the hall clapped. Moynihan&apos;s paper showed that the true consoler
<br><font color="green">{ms, 788}</font>
<br> of the afflicted was not the self-seeking demagogue with his ignorance and
lax morality but the Church and that the true way to better the lot of the
working classes was not by teaching them to disbelieve in a spiritual and
material order, working together in harmony, but by teaching them to follow
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">in
humility</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> the life of
One who was the friend of all humanity, great and lowly, rich and poor, just and
unjust, lettered and unlettered, of One who though above all other men was
Himself the meekest of men. Moynihan alluded also to the strange death of a
French atheistic writer and implied that Emmanuel had chosen to revenge himself
on the unhappy gentleman by privily tampering with his gas-stove.</p>
<p> Among the speakers who followed Moynihan were a County Court Judge and a
retired colonel of reactionary sympathies. All the speakers praised the work
done by the Jesuits in training the youth of Ireland for the higher walks of
life. The essayist of the night was adduced as an example. From his post beside
Cranly in an angle of the hall Stephen glanced along the ranks of students. The
faces which were now composed to seriousness all bore the same stamp
<br><font color="green">{ms, 789}</font>
<br> of Jesuit training. For the most part they were free from the more blatant
crudities of youth; they were not without a certain inoffensive and genuine
distaste for the vices of youth.<a target="foot" id="fyz0126">&ordm;</a>
<a name="pn1004b" href="../../FF/unbs/pn1all.htm#pn1004b">They admired
Gladstone, physical science and the tragedies of Shakespeare: and they believed
in the adjustment of Catholic teaching to everyday needs, in the Church
diplomatic. Without displaying an English desire for an aristocracy of substance
they held violent measures to be unseemly and in their relations among
themselves and towards their superiors they displayed a nervous and (whenever
there was question of authority) a very English liberalism.</a> They respected
spiritual and temporal authorities, the spiritual authorities of Catholicism and
of patriotism, and the temporal authorities of the hierarchy and the government.
<a name="pn1004d" href="../../FF/unbs/pn1all.htm#pn1004d">The memory of Terence
MacManus was not less revered by them than the memory of Cardinal Cullen.</a> If
the call to a larger and nobler life ever came to visit them they heard it with
secret gladness but always they decided to defer their lives until a favourable
moment because they felt unready. They listened to all
<br><font color="green">{ms, 790}</font>
<br> the speakers attentively and applauded whenever there was an allusion to
the President, to Ireland or to the faith. Temple shambled into the hall in the
middle of the proceedings and introduced a friend of his to Stephen:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; &apos;Scuse me, this is Fitz, decent fellow. He admires
you. &apos;Scuse me for introducing him, decent fellow &mdash;
<br>Stephen shook hands with Fitz, a grey-headed young man with a puzzled
flushed face. Fitz and Temple stood against the wall for support as they were
both a little unsteady. Fitz began to doze quietly.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He&apos;s a revolutionist, said Temple to Stephen and
Cranly. D&apos;ye know what, Cranly, I believe you&apos;re a revolutionist too.
Are you a revolutionist &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;.Ah, by hell, you
don&apos;t like answering that &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. I&apos;m a revolutionist &mdash;
<br>At this moment a speaker was applauded for mentioning the name of John Henry Newman.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Who is he? said Temple to everyone near him, Who&apos;s this chap? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Colonel Russell &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, is this Colonel &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
What did he say? What was he said? &mdash;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 791}</font>
<br>
<br>Nobody answered him so he shambled through a few more incoherent questions
and at last, unable to satisfy himself as to the Colonel&apos;s way of thinking,
called out &ldquo;Hurrah for the Mad Mullah&rdquo; and then asked Cranly did he
not think the Colonel was a &lsquo;bloody cod&rsquo;.</p>
<p> Stephen studied even less regularly
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">during</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
the second year than he had done during the first. He attended lectures oftener
but he seldom went to the Library to read. The <u>Vita Nuova</u> of Dante
suggested to him that he should make his scattered love-verses into a perfect
wreath and he explained to Cranly at great length the difficulties of the
verse-maker. His love-verses gave him pleasure: he wrote them at long intervals
and when he wrote it was always a mature and reasoned emotion which urged him.
But in his expressions of love he found himself compelled to use what he called
the feudal terminology and as he could not use it with the same faith and
purpose as animated the feudal poets themselves he was compelled to express his
love <font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">a
little</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> ironically.
This suggestion of relativity, he said, mingling itself with so immune a passion
is a modern note: we cannot swear or expect eternal fealty because we
<br><font color="green">{ms, 792}</font>
<br> recognise too accurately the limits of every human energy. It is not
possible for the modern lover to think the universe an assistant at his
love-affair and modern love, losing somewhat of its fierceness, gains also
somewhat in amiableness. Cranly would not hear of this: for him a distinction
between ancient and modern was a trick of words because he had in his own mind
reduced past and present to a level of studious ignobility. Stephen tried to
sustain against him that though humanity may not change beyond recognition
during the short eras known as the ages of man yet these ages are the preys of
different ideas in accordance with which every activity, even the least, which
they engender is conceived and directed. The distinction, he argued, between the
feudal spirit and the spirit of humanity at present is not a phrase of the men
of letters. Cranly, like many cynical romanticists, held that the civil life
affected in no way the individual life and that it was possible for men to
preserve ancient superstitions and prejudices in the midst of a machinery of
modernity, just as it was possible for a man to live in the medley of machines a
live<a target="foot" id="fyz0127">&ordm;</a> of
<br><font color="green">{ms, 793}</font>
<br> conformity and yet to be in his heart a rebel against the order he upheld:
human nature was a constant quantity. As for the scheme of making a wreath of
songs in praise of love he thought that if such a passion really existed it was incapable of being expressed.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; We are not likely to know whether it exists or not if no
man tries to express it, said Stephen. We have nothing to test it by &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What can you test
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">if</span></span> it by? said
Cranly.
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Jesus</span></span>
<font color="black">The
Church</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> says the test
of friendship is to see if a man will lay down his life for a friend&mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You do not believe that, surely? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No; bloody fools of people will die for different things.
McCann, for instance, would die out of sheer obstinacy &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Renan says a man is a martyr only for things of which he is not quite sure &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Men die for two sticks
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">put</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
crosswise even in this modern age. What is a cross but two common sticks? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Love, said Stephen, is a name, if you like, for something
inexpressible &nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. but no, I won&apos;t admit that &nbsp;.
&nbsp;. &nbsp;. I believe it might be a test of love to see what exchanges it
offers. What do people give when they love? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A wedding breakfast, said Cranly &mdash;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 794}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Their bodies, isn&apos;t it: that, at the very least. It
is something to give one&apos;s body even for hire &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Then you think that women who give their bodies for hire,
as you say, love the people they give them to? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; When we love, we give. In a way they love too. We give
something, a tall hat or a book of music or one&apos;s time and labour or
one&apos;s body, in exchange for love &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I&apos;d a damn sight sooner them women gave me a tall hat than their bodies &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A matter of taste. You may like tall hats. I don&apos;t &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; My dear man, said Cranly, you know next to nothing about human nature &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I know a few elementary things and I express them in
words. I feel emotions and I express them in rhyming lines. Song is the simple
rhythmic liberation of an emotion. Love can express itself in part through song &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You idealise everything &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You make me think of Hughes when you say that &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You imagine that people are capable of all these
&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. all
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">these</span></span> this beautiful
imaginary business. They&apos;re not. Look
<br><font color="green">{ms, 795}</font>
<br> at the girls you see every day. Do you think they would understand what you say about love? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I don&apos;t know really, said Stephen. I do not idealise
the <a name="jn1037l" href="../../FF/unbs/jn1all.htm#jn1037l">girls I see every
day. I regard them as marsupials</a>. &nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. But still I must express my nature &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Write the verses, anyway, said Cranly &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I feel rain, said Stephen stopping under a branch and waiting for the fall of raindrops &mdash;
<br>Cranly stood beside him and watched his pose with an expression of bitter satisfaction on his face.</p>
<p> During his wanderings Stephen came on an old library in the midst of
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">those</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
sluttish streets which are called old Dublin. The library had been founded by
Archbishop Marsh and though it was open to the public few people seemed aware of
its existence. The librarian
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">was</span></span>, delighted at
the prospect of a reader, showed Stephen niches and nooks inhabited by dusty
brown volumes. Stephen went there a few times in the week to read old Italian
books of the Trecento. He had begun to be interested in Franciscan literature. He appreciated not without
<br><font color="green">{ms, 796}</font>
<br> pitiful feelings the legend of the mild heresiarch of Assisi. He knew, by
instinct, that S. Francis&apos; love-chains would not hold him very long but the
Italian was very quaint. Elias and Joachim also relieved the na&iuml;f history.
He had found on one of the carts of books near the river an unpublished book
containing two stories by Mr WB Yeats. One of these stories was called <u>The
Tables of the Law</u> and in it was mentioned the fabulous preface which
Joachim, abbot of Flora, is said to have prefixed to his Eternal Gospel. This
discovery, coming so aptly upon his own researches, induced him to follow his
Franciscan studies with vigour. He went every Sunday evening to the church of
the Capuchins whither he had once carried the disgraceful burden of his sins to
be eased of it. He was not offended by the processions of artizans and labourers
round the church and the sermons of the priests were grateful to him inasmuch as
the speakers did not seem inclined to make much use of their rhetorical and
elocutionary training nor anxious to reveal themselves, in theory, at least, men of the world. He thought,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 797}</font>
<br> in an Assisan mood, that these men might be nearer to his purpose than
others: and one evening, while talking with a Capuchin, he had over and over to
restrain an impulse which urged him to take the priest by the arm, lead him up
and down the chapel-yard and deliver himself boldly of the whole story of the
<u>Tables of the Law</u>, every word of which he remembered. Considering
Stephen&apos;s general attitude towards the Church, there was certainly a
profound infection in such an impulse which it needed great efforts of his
intelligent partner to correct. He satisfied himself by leading Lynch round the
enclosure of Stephen&apos;s Green and making that young man very awkward by
reciting Mr Yeats&apos;s story with careful animation. Lynch said he didn&apos;t
know what the story was about but, afterwards, when safely secluded in a
&lsquo;snug&rsquo; he said that the recitation had given him immense pleasure:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; These monks are worthy men, said Stephen &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Full, round men, said Lynch &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Worthy men. I went a few days ago to their library. I had
great trouble getting in: all the monks came out of different corners to spy at
me. Father
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Abbot</span></span>
<font color="black">Guardian</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
asked me what I wanted. Then he brought me in and gave himself a great deal of
trouble going over
books<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,
mind</span></span><font color="black">.

fat priest and he had just dined so he really was good-natured &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Good worthy man &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He didn&apos;t know in the least what I wanted or why I
wanted it but he went up one page and down the next with his finger looking for
the name and puffing and humming to himself &ldquo;Jacopone, Jacopone, Jacopone,
Jacopone&rdquo;. Haven&apos;t I a sense of rhythm, eh? &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen was still a lover of the deformations wrought by dusk. Late autumn
and winter in Dublin are always seasons of damp gloomy weather. He went through
the streets at night intoning phrases to himself. He repeated often the story of
<u>The Tables of the Law</u> and the story of the <u>Adoration of the Magi</u>.
The atmosphere of these stories was heavy with incense and omens and the figures of the monk-errants, Ahern and Michael
<br><font color="green">{ms, 799}</font>
<br> Robartes strode through it with great strides. Their speeches were like
<a name="pn1021b" href="../../FF/unbs/pn1all.htm#pn1021b">the enigmas of a
disdainful Jesus</a>; their morality
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">was</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
infrahuman or superhuman: the ritual they laid such store by was so incoherent
and heterogeneous, so strange a mixture of trivialities and sacred practices,
that it could be recognised as the ritual of men who had received from the hands
of
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">high</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
priests,
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">who
had been</span></span>
<font color="black">anciently</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
guilty of some arrogance of the spirit, a confused and dehumanised tradition, a
mysterious ordination. Civilisation may be said indeed to be the creation of its
outlaws but the least
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">protest</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
against the existing order is made by the outlaws whose creed and manner of life
is not renewable even so far as to
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">be</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
reactionary. These inhabit a church apart; they lift their thuribles wearily
before their deserted altars; they live beyond the region of mortality, having
chosen to fulfil the law of their being. A young man like Stephen in such a
season of damp and unrest <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">had</span></span> has no pains to
<br><font color="green">{ms, 800}</font>
<br> believe in the reality of their existence. They lean pitifully
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">above</span></span> towards the
earth, like vapours, desirous of sin,
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">remembering
the pride of their
origin,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> calling to
others to come to them. Stephen was fondest of repeating to himself this
beautiful passage from <u>The Tables of the Law</u>: Why do you fly from our
torches which were made out of the wood of the trees under which Christ wept in
the gardens of Gethsemane? Why do you fly from our torches which were made of
sweet wood after it had vanished from the world and come to us who made it of old times with our breath &mdash;</p>
<p> A certain extravagance began to tinge his life. He was aware that, though he
was nominally in amity with the order of society into which he had been born, he
would not be able to continue so. The life of an errant seemed to him far less
ignoble than the life of one who had accepted the tyranny of the mediocre
because the cost of being exceptional was too high. The young generation which
he saw growing up about him regarded his manifestations of spiritual activity as something
<br><font color="green">{ms, 801}</font>
<br> more than unseemly and he knew that, under their air of fearful
amiableness, the representatives of authority cherished the hope that his
unguided nature would bring him into
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">such</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
a lamentable conflict with actuality that they would one day have the pleasure
of receiving him officially into some hospital or asylum. This would have been
no unusual end for the high emprise of youth often

by a bright blue ribbon along the
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">p</span></span> footpath reserved
for the citizens. He felt acutely the insidious dangers which conceal themselves
under the guise of extravagance but he was convinced also that a dull discharge
of duties, neither understood nor congenial, was far more dangerous and far less satisfactory.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The Church believes that in every act a man does he seeks
some good, said Cranly. The publican wants to make money, Whelan wants to become
<br><font color="green">{ms, 802}</font>
<br> a County Court judge, that girl I saw you talking to yesterday &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Miss Clery? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; She wants a man and a little house to live
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">h</span></span> in. The missioner
wants to make heathens

understand the good which these men seek but what do you seek? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The Church differentiates between the good which this man
seeks and the good which I seek. There is a <u>bonum simpliciter</u>. The men
you mention seek a good of that kind because they are impelled by
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">direct</span></span> passions
which are direct even if they are menial: lust, ambition, gluttony. I seek a <u>bonum arduum</u> &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It might be a <u>bonum</u> very much <u>simpliciter</u>.
I don&apos;t think you know, said Cranly &mdash;

<p class="center">XXIII</p>
<p class="flush">About this time there was some agitation in the political world
concerning the working of the Royal University. It was proposed to institute a
commission to examine into the matter. The Jesuits were accused of working the
machine for their own ends without a just sense of impartiality. To parry the
charge of obscurantism a monthly review was started under the editorship of
McCann. The new editor was in high spirits over this event.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I have got nearly all the &lsquo;copy&rsquo; for the
first number, he said to Stephen. I&apos;m sure it will be a success. I want you
to write us something for the second number &mdash; but something we can
understand. Condescend a little. You can&apos;t say we are such barbarians now:
we have a paper of our own. We can express our views. You will write us
something, won&apos;t you? We have an article by Hughes in this month &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Of course there is a censor? said Stephen &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, said McCann, the person who originated the idea of
the paper in the first instance was Father Cummins &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The director of your sodality? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes. He originated the idea so you see he
<br><font color="green">{ms, 804}</font>
<br> acts as a kind of sponsor to us &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He is the Censor then? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He has discretionary powers but he is not at all
narrow-minded. You needn&apos;t be afraid of him &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I see. And tell me, will I be paid? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I thought you were an idealist, said McCann &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Good luck to the paper, said Stephen waving his hand in adieu &mdash;</p>
<p> The first number of McCann&apos;s paper contained a long article by Hughes
on <u>The Future of the Celt</u>. It contained also an article in Irish by
Glynn&apos;s sister and an
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">editorial</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
article by McCann in which was narrated the history of the inception of the
paper. The article began &ldquo;It was a happy thought of the director of our
sodality to unite the various elements of our college life by affording them the
opportunity of interchanging ideas and criticisms through the medium of a
University magazine. Thanks to the zeal and enterprise of Father Cummins the
initial difficulties have been surmounted and we make our bow to the public in
the expectation that the public will give us a hearing&rdquo; The paper also contained several pages of
<br><font color="green">{ms, 805}</font>
<br> notes from various sporting and intellectual societies in which celebrities
were &lsquo;chaffed&rsquo; under the thin disguise of their Latinised surnames.
The &lsquo;Medical
Memos<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">,
which</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> were signed
&ldquo;H<sub><small>2</small></sub>O&rdquo;
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">and</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
consisted of several congratulatory paragraphs about medicoes who had passed
their final examinations and a few complimentary paragraphs about the genial
professors of the medical school. The paper also contained some verses: <u>The
Female Fellow</u>: (a swallow-flight of song) which were signed &ldquo;Toga Girilis&rdquo;.</p>
<p> Stephen was shown the new review
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">in the
Library</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> by Cranly
who seemed to have read it from the first line to the last. Cranly took his
friend from one item to another with great persistence, paying no heed to
Stephen&apos;s exclamations of impatience. At the &ldquo;Medical Memoes&rdquo;
Stephen execrated with such smothered fervour that Cranly began to laugh between
the pages of the paper and a red-faced priest who was sitting opposite stared
indignantly across his copy of <u>The Tablet</u>. In the porch of the Library were a little knot
<br><font color="green">{ms, 806}</font>
<br> of young men and a little knot of young women, all provided with copies of
the new review. All were laughing and talking, making the rain an excuse for
lingering under shelter. McCann, brisk and heated with his cycling-cap sideways
on his head, went to and fro between the groups. When he saw Stephen he approached with an air of expectancy.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well? Have you seen &nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;.? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It is a great day for Ireland, said Stephen, seizing the
Editor&apos;s hand and shaking it gravely &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well &nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. it is something, said McCann with a suffused forehead &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen leaned against one of the stone pillars and regarded the farther
group. She stood in a ring of her companions, laughing and talking with them.
The anger
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">with</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
which the new review had filled him gradually ebbed away and he chose to
contemplate the spectacle which she and her companions offered him. As on his
entrance into the grounds of Clonliffe College a sudden
<br><font color="green">{ms, 807}</font>
<br> sympathy arose out of a sudden reminiscence, a reminiscent sympathy toward
a <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">sheltered</span></span>
protected seminarist life the very virtues of which seemed to be set provokingly
before the wild gaze of the world, so provokingly that only the strength of
walls and watchdogs held them in a little circle of modish and timid ways.
Though their affectations often lacked grace and their vulgarity wanted only
lungs to be strident the rain brought him
charity.<a target="foot" id="fyz0128">&ordm;</a>
<a name="jn0a18a" href="../../FF/unbs/jn0all.htm#jn0a18a">The babble of the
young students reached him as if from a distance, in broken pulsations and
lifting his eyes he saw the high rain-clouds retreating across the rain-swept
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">country</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>.
The quick light shower was over, tarrying, a cluster of diamonds, among the
shrubs of the quadrangle where an exhalation ascended from the blackened earth.
The company in the colonnade was leaving shelter, with many a doubting glance,
with a prattle of trim boots, a pretty rescue of petticoats, under umbrellas, a light armoury, upheld at cunning
<br><font color="green">{ms, 808}</font>
<br> angles. He saw them returning to the convent &mdash; demure corridors and
simple dormitories, a quiet rosary of hours &mdash; while the rain-clouds
retreated towards the west and the babble of the young men reached him in
regular pulsations. He saw far away amid a flat rain-swept country a high plain
building with windows that filtered the obscure daylight. Three hundred boys,
noisy and hungry, sat at long tables eating beef fringed with green fat</a> like
blubber and junks of white damp bread and one young boy, leaning upon his
elbows, opened and closed the flaps of his ears while the noise of the diners
reached him rhythmically as the wild gabble of animals.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; There should be an art of gesture, said Stephen one night to Cranly &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Of course I don&apos;t mean art of gesture in the sense
that the elocution professor understands the word. For him a gesture is an emphasis. I mean a rhythm. You know the
<br><font color="green">{ms, 809}</font>
<br> song &ldquo;Come unto these yellow sands&rdquo;? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; This is it, said the youth making a graceful anapaestic
gesture with each arm. That&apos;s the rhythm, do you see? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I would like to go out into Grafton St some day and make
gestures in the middle of the street &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I&apos;d like to see that &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; There is no reason why life should lose all grace and
nobility even though Columbus discovered America. I will live a free and noble life &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; My art will proceed from a free and noble source. It is
too troublesome for me to adopt the manners of these slaves. I refuse to be
terrorised into stupidity. Do you believe that one line of verse can immortalise a man? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Why not one word? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; &lsquo;Sitio&rsquo; is a classical cry. Try
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">and</span></span>
<font color="black">to</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> improve on it &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do you think that Jesus when he hung on the cross
appreciated what you would call the rhythm of that remark? Do you think
<br><font color="green">{ms, 810}</font>
<br> that Shakespeare when he wrote a song went out into the street to make gestures for the people? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It is evident that Jesus was unable to illustrate his
remark by a correspondingly magnificent gesture but I do not imagine he uttered
it in a matter-of-fact voice. Jesus had a very pure tragic manner: his conduct
during his trial was admirable. Do you imagine the Church could have erected
such elaborately artistic sacraments about his legend unless the original figure
had been one of a certain tragic majesty? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And Shakespeare &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I don&apos;t believe he wanted to go out into the street
but I am sure he appreciated his own music. I don&apos;t believe that beauty is
fortuitous. A man might think for seven years at intervals and all at once write
a quatrain which would immortalise
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">him</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
seemingly without thought or care &mdash; seemingly. Then the groundling will
say: &ldquo;O, he could write poetry&rdquo;: and if I ask &ldquo;
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">how</span></span>
<font color="black">How</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
was that?&rdquo; the groundling will answer &ldquo;Well, he just wrote it, that&apos;s all&rdquo; &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; In my opinion you imagine all this about rhythm and gesture. A poet
<br><font color="green">{ms, 811}</font>
<br> according to you, is a terribly mixed-up fellow &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The reason you say that is because you have never seen a poet in action before &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; How do you know that? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You think my theorising very high-flown and fantastical, don&apos;t you? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, I do &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, I tell you you think me fantastical simply because I am modern &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; My dear man, that&apos;s rubbish. You&apos;re always
talking about &ldquo;modern&rdquo;. Have you any idea of the age of the earth?
You say you&apos;re emancipated<a target="foot" id="fyz0129">&ordm;</a> but, in
my opinion, you haven&apos;t got beyond the first book of Genesis yet. There is
no such thing as &ldquo;modern&rdquo; or &ldquo;ancient&rdquo;: it&apos;s all the same &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What&apos;s all the same? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ancient and modern &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, yes, I know, everything is the same as everything
else. Of course I know the word &ldquo;modern&rdquo; is only a word. But when I
use it I use it with a certain meaning &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What do you mean, for instance? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The modern spirit is vivisective. Vivisection itself is
the
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">most</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
modern process one can conceive. The ancient spirit
<br><font color="green">{ms, 812}</font>
<br> accepted phenomena with a bad grace. The ancient method investigated law
with the lantern of justice, morality with the lantern of revelation, art with
the lantern of tradition. But all these lanterns have magical properties: they
transform and disfigure. The modern method examines its territory by the light
of day. Italy has added a science to civilisation by putting out the lantern of
justice and considering the criminal in
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">action</span></span>
<font color="black">production</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
and in action. All modern political and religious criticism dispenses with
presumptive States
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">and</span></span><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
presumptive Redeemers and
Churches<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">.
It* examines the entire community in action and reconstructs the spectacle of
redemption. If you were an esthetic philosopher you would take note of all my
vagaries because here you have the spectacle of the esthetic instinct in action.
The philosophic college should spare a detective for me &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I suppose you know that Aristotle founded the science of biology &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I would not say a word against Aristotle for the world
but I think his spirit would hardly do itself justice in treating
<br><font color="green">{ms, 813}</font>
<br> of the &ldquo;inexact&rdquo; sciences &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I wonder what Aristotle would have thought of you as a poet? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I&apos;m damned if I would apologise to him at all. Let
him examine me if he is able. Can you imagine a handsome lady saying &ldquo;O,
excuse me, my dear Mr Aristotle, for being so beautiful&rdquo;? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He was a very wise man &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes but I do not think he is the special patron of those
who <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">proclaims</span></span>
proclaim the usefulness of a stationary march &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What do you mean? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Have you noticed what a false and unreal sound abstract
terms have on the lips of those ancients in the college? You see what talk they
have now about their new paper. McCann is supposed to lead them out of
captivity. Doesn&apos;t that paper of theirs make you say to yourself &ldquo;O
Lord, I&apos;m glad I had no hand in this&rdquo;? The toy life which the Jesuits
permit these docile young men to live is what I call a stationary march. The
marionette life which the Jesuit himself lives as a dispenser of illumination
and rectitude is another variety of the stationary march. And yet both these classes of puppets think that
<br><font color="green">{ms, 814}</font>
<br> Aristotle has apologised for them before the eyes of the world. Kindly
remember the monstrous legend upon which all their life is regulated &mdash; how
Aristotelian it is! Kindly remember the minute bylaws they have for estimating
the exact amount of salvation in any good work &mdash; what an Aristotelian invention! &mdash;</p>
<p> A week or so before Christmas Stephen was standing one night in the porch of
the Library when Emma came out. She stopped to talk with him. She was dressed
cosily in warm tweeds and the long even coils of her white boa presented her
smiling face to the wintry air. Any young man of reasonable sanity, seeing so
happy and so glowing a figure in a cheerless landscape, would have longed to
take it in his arms. She wore a little brown fur cap which made her look like a
Christmas doll and her incorrigible eyes seemed to say &ldquo;Wouldn&apos;t you
like to fondle me?&rdquo; She began to chatter at once. She knew the girl that
had written <u>The Female Fellow</u> &mdash; an awfully smart girl at that kind of thing. They had a magazine
<br><font color="green">{ms, 815}</font>
<br> in her convent too; she wrote &ldquo;skits&rdquo; for it.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; By the way I hear dreadful things about you &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; How is that? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Everyone says you have dreadful ideas, that you read
dreadful books. You&apos;re a mystic or something. Do you know what I heard a girl say? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No. What? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That you didn&apos;t believe in God &mdash;
<br>They were walking along the Green inside the chains and as she said this she
gave more of her body&apos;s warmth to him and her eyes looked at him with an
expression of solicitude. Stephen looked into them steadfastly.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Never mind God, Emma, he said. You interest me much more than that old gentleman does &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What gentleman? said Emma frankly &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The middle-aged gentleman with the aviary &mdash; Jehovah the Second &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You must
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">not</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
say such things to me, I told you that before &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Very good, Emma. I see you are afraid you will lose the
faith. But you needn&apos;t be afraid of my influence &mdash;
<br>They walked from the Green as far as
<br><font color="green">{ms, 816}</font>
<br> the South Circular Road without an attempt at further conversation. At
every step that they took Stephen&apos;s resolution to leave her and see no more
of her became more deeply rooted. Even as a diversion her company was slightly
degrading to his sense of dignity. As they passed under the tall trees of the
Mall she slackened her pace and, when safe from the lights of the bridge, halted
deliberately. Stephen was very much surprised as the hour and the place made
their position equivocal and, though she had chosen the broad shadow of the
trees to halt in, she had committed this audacity in sight of her own house.
They listened for a moment to the quiet
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">flow</span></span>
<font color="black">flowing</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
of the water and saw the tram begin to crawl off the apex of the bridge.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do I interest you so much as that? she said, speaking at
last in a rich significant voice &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Of course you do, said Stephen trying to match her tone.
I know that you are alive and human &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But so many people are alive &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You are a woman, Emma &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Would you call me a woman now? Don&apos;t you think I am still a girl? &mdash;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 817}</font> </p>
<p class="flush">Stephen&apos;s gaze traversed the provoking territory for a few
moments during which her half-closed eyes suffered the trespass without remonstrating.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, Emma, he said. You are not a girl any longer &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But you are not a man, are you? she said quickly for
pride and youth and desire were beginning to
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">e</span></span> inflame her cheek even in the shadow.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I am a hobbledehoy, said Stephen &mdash;
<br>She leaned a little more towards him and the same expression of tender
solicitude appeared in her eyes. The warmth of her body seemed to flow into his
and without a moment&apos;s hesitation he put his hand into his pocket and began to finger out his coins.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I must be going in, she said &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Good night, said Stephen smiling &mdash;
<br>When she had gone in he went along by the canal bank, still in the shadow of
the leafless trees, humming to himself the chant of the Good Friday Gospel. He
thought of what he had said to Cranly that when people love they give and he
said aloud &ldquo;I will never speak to her again&rdquo;. As he came near the
lower bridge a woman emerged from the shadows
<br><font color="green">{ms, 818}</font>
<br> and said &ldquo;Good night, love&rdquo;. Stephen stood still and looked at
her. She was an undersized woman and even in that chilly season her clothes gave
off an odour of ancient sweats. A black straw hat was set rakishly
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">upon</span></span>
<font color="black">above</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
her glazed face. She asked him to come for a little walk. Stephen did not speak
to her but, still humming the chant of the passion, transferred his coins to her
hand and continued on his way.<a target="foot" id="fyz0130">&ordm;</a> He heard
her benedictions at his back as he walked and he began to wonder which was
better from the literary point of view: Renan&apos;s account of the death of
Jesus or the account given by the evangelists. He had once heard a preacher
allude in horrified piety to the theory put forward by some literary agent of
the devil that Jesus was a maniac. The woman in the black straw hat would never
believe that Jesus was a maniac and Stephen shared her opinion. He is certainly
a great exemplar for bachelors, he said to himself, but he is a little too
careful of himself for a divine person. The woman in the black
<br><font color="green">{ms, 819}</font>
<br> straw hat has never heard of the name of Buddha but
<a name="pn1021f" href="../../FF/unbs/pn1all.htm#pn1021f">Buddha&apos;s
character seems to have been superior to that of Jesus</a> with respect to
unaffected sanctity. I wonder how she would like that story of Yasodhara&apos;s
kissing Buddha after his illumination and penance. Renan&apos;s Jesus is a
trifle Buddhistic but the fierce eaters and drinkers of the western world would
never worship such a figure. Blood will have blood. There are some people in
this island who sing a hymn called &ldquo;Washed in the blood of the Lamb&rdquo;
by way of easing the religious impulse. Perhaps it&apos;s a question of
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">impulse</span></span> diet but I
would prefer to wash in rice-water. Yeow! what a notion! A blood-bath to cleanse
the
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">spiritual</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
body of all its sinful sweats &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The sense of decorum
makes that woman wear a black straw hat in midwinter. She said to me &ldquo;Good
night, love&rdquo;. The greatest lover of all time could not say more than that.
Think of it &ldquo;Good night, love&rdquo;. Mustn&apos;t the devil be annoyed to hear her described as an evil creature?
<br><font color="green">{ms, 820}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I am not going to see her any more, said Stephen a few nights later to Lynch &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That is a great mistake, said Lynch expanding his chest &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It&apos;s only waste of time. I&apos;ll never get what I want from her &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And what do you want from her? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Love &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Eh? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Love &mdash;
<br>Lynch halted abruptly, saying:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Look here, I have fourpence &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>You</u> have? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Let us go in somewhere. But if I give you a drink you
must promise not to say that any more &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Say what? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That word &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; &lsquo;Love&rsquo; is it? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Let us go in here &mdash;
<br>When they were sitting in the squalid gloom of a tavern Stephen began to
rock his <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">chair</span></span> stool from leg to leg meditatively.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I see I have educated you too much, my good Lynch? &mdash;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 821}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But that was an atrocity, said Lynch enjoying the luxury
of entertaining and rebuking his companion &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You do not believe me? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Of course not &mdash;
<br>Stephen concerned himself with his pewter measure for a little time.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Of course, he said at last, I would take something less if she would give it to me &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, I know you would &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Would you like me to seduce her? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Very much. It would be very interesting &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ah, it wouldn&apos;t be possible! &mdash;
<br>Lynch laughed.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The sorrow-stricken tone you say that in. I wish McCann could hear you &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You know, Lynch, said Stephen, we may as well acknowledge
openly and freely. We must have women &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes: I agree. We must have women &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Jesus said
&ldquo;<a name="pn1021o" href="../../FF/unbs/pn1all.htm#pn1021o">Whoso looketh
upon a woman</a> to lust after her hath already committed adultery with her in his heart&rdquo;: but he did not condemn
<br><font color="green">{ms, 822}</font>
<br> &ldquo;adultery&rdquo;. Besides it is impossible not to commit &ldquo;adultery&rdquo; &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Quite impossible &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Consequently if I see a woman inclined for oracle I go to
her: if she has no inclination I stay away &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But that girl has an inclination for oracle &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That&apos;s the tantalising part of it: I know she has.
It&apos;s very unfair of her to tantalise me. I must go to where I am sure of my ground &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But that costs money; and besides it is dangerous. You
may get a dose that will last you your life. I wonder you have not got it before this &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ah, yes, isn&apos;t it a nuisance. And yet I must go
somewhere &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;. She is a human being, you know. I
can&apos;t say I consider harlots as human beings. <u>Scortum</u> and <u>moechus</u> are both neuter nouns &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Of course a human being would be much better. But you could get her, if you liked &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; How? &mdash;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 823}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; In marriage &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I&apos;m glad you reminded me of that, said Stephen. I was almost forgetting it &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You may be sure she doesn&apos;t forget it, said Lynch,
or let anyone else forget it either &mdash;
<br>Stephen sighed.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You remember in <u>The Adoration of the Magi</u> &mdash;
&ldquo;When the immortals wish to overthrow the things that are today and to
bring the things that were yesterday they have no-one to help them except one
whom the things that are today have cast out.&rdquo; &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Who have I to help me except the woman in the black straw
hat? And yet I wish to bring to the world the spiritual renewal which the poet
brings to it &nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. No. I have decided. I will not see her any more &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The woman in the black straw hat? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, the virgin &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Still I think you are making a mistake, said Lynch, finishing his pint &mdash;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 824}</font> </p>
<p> One raw misty morning after Christmas Stephen was reading <u>Oreste</u> in
Father Artifoni&apos;s bedroom. He asked questions mechanically and listened to
answers mechanically. He devised the following question and answer for the pseudo-classical catechism:</p>
<p class="flush"><u>Question</u> &mdash;</p>
<p class="set">What great truth do we learn from the <u>Libation-Pourers</u> of Eschylus?</p>
<p class="flush"><u>Answer</u> &mdash;</p>
<p class="set">We learn from the <u>Libation-Pourers</u> of Eschylus that in
ancient Greece brothers and sisters took the same size in boots.</p>
<p class="flush">He looked wearily from the wretched Italian binding of his book
towards the desolate gardens of S. Stephen&apos;s Green. Above him and beneath
him and around him in little dark dusty rooms the intellectual heart of Ireland
was throbbing &mdash; young men were engaged in the pursuit of learning. Above
and beneath and around him were posted Jesuits to guide the young men amid the
<br><font color="green">{ms, 825}</font>
<br> perilous ways of knowledge. The hand of Jesuit authority was laid firmly
upon that intellectual heart and if, at times, it bore too heavily thereon what
a little cross was that! The young men were sensible that such severity had its
reasons. <a name="pn1005b" href="../../FF/unbs/pn1all.htm#pn1005b">They
understood it as an evidence of watchful care and interest, assured that in
their future lives this care would continue, this interest be maintained: the
exercise of authority might be sometimes (rarely) questionable, its intention,
never. Who, therefore, readier than these young men to acknowledge gratefully
the sallies of some genial professor or the surliness of some
door-porter<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span>? Who
more sollicitous to cherish in every way and to advance in person the honour of Alma Mater?</a></p>
<p> The mortifying atmosphere of the college crept about Stephen&apos;s heart.
<a name="pn1005c" href="../../FF/unbs/pn1all.htm#pn1005c">For his part he was at
the difficult age, dispossessed and necessitous, sensible of all that was ignoble in such manners who in revery,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 826}</font>
<br> at least, had been acquainted with nobility. As a remedy for so untoward a
malady an earnest Jesuit
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">had
some days before prescribed</span></span> <font color="black">was to
prescribe</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> a
clerkship in Guinness&apos;s: and doubtless the clerk-designate of a brewery
would not have had scorn and pity only for an admirable community had it not
been that he desired, in the language of the schoolmen, an arduous good.
Impossible that he should find his soul&apos;s sufficient good</a>
<a name="pn1006a" href="../../FF/unbs/pn1all.htm#pn1006a">in societies for the
encouragement of thought among laymen, or any other than bodily solace in the
warm sodality, in the company of
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">those</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
foolish and grotesque virginities! Impossible that a temperament ever trembling
towards its ecstasy should submit to acquiesce, that a soul should decree
servitude for its portion over which the image of beauty had fallen as a mantle.</a></p>
<p> The deadly chill of the atmosphere
<br><font color="green">{ms, 827}</font>
<br> of the college paralysed Stephen&apos;s heart. In a stupor of powerlessness
he reviewed the plague of Catholicism. He seemed to see
<a name="jn1034e" href="../../FF/unbs/jn1all.htm#jn1034e">the vermin begotten in
the catacombs</a> in an age of sickness and cruelty issuing forth upon the
plains and mountains of Europe. Like the plague of locusts described in Callista
they seemed to choke the rivers and fill the valleys up. They obscured the sun.
Contempt of the
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">body</span></span>
<font color="black">human
nature</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>, weakness,
nervous tremblings, fear of day and joy, distrust of man and life, hemiplegia of
the will, <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">beside</span></span>
beset the body burdened and disaffected in its members by its black tyrannous
lice. Exultation of the mind before joyful beauty, exultation of the
body<a target="foot" id="fyz0131">&ordm;</a> in free confederate labours, every
natural impulse towards health and wisdom and happiness had been corroded by the
pest of these vermin. The spectacle of the world in thrall filled him with the fire of courage.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 828}</font>
<br> He, at least, though living at the farthest remove from the centre of
European culture, marooned on an island in the ocean, though inheriting a will
broken by doubt and a soul the steadfastness of whose hate became as weak as
water in siren arms, would live his own life according to what he recognised as
the voice of a new humanity, active, unafraid and unashamed.</p>
<p> He followed his Italian lesson mechanically, feeling the unintermittent
deadliness of the atmosphere of the college in his throat and lungs, obscuring
his eyes and obfuscating his brain. The little iron watch on the table had
barely passed the half hour: eleven o&apos;clock seemed so far off. He had to
open his Machiavelli and read out a paragraph until the teacher&apos;s ear was
satisfied. The dingy chronicle fell piecemeal from his lips, dull wooden words.
From time to time he glanced up from the page to see the thick mouth of the
priest correct his
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">slovely</span></span>
<font color="black">slovenly</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
&lsquo;o&rsquo;s, now with a sudden harsh ejaculation of the vowel sound, now
with a slow mute
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">protusion</span></span>
<font color="black">protrusion</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> of the lips. The little
<br><font color="green">{ms, 829}</font>
<br> iron watch ticked on for another five minutes. Then the teacher began to
correct the exercise. Stephen gazed wearily out of the window, across the
mist-laden gardens. The air was webbed with water vapours and all the
flower-beds and walks confronted the grey of the sky with a truculent sodden
brown. Mackintoshes and overcoats came along the walks or down the steps of the
monument under their umbrellas or surmounted by a muffled human
head.<a target="foot" id="fyz0132">&ordm;</a> The footpath inside the chains
where Stephen had so often walked with his friends at night glistened like a
grey mirror. Stephen watched the feet pass along the polished surface: he
wondered if it was his moments of excessive vitality which cast back by
revulsion on such hours of despair. He felt that he was looking at the world
with Cranly&apos;s eyes and still he continued gazing along the footpath.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You cannot say, said the teacher running his pencil under a phrase. It is not Italian &mdash;
<br>Stephen withdrew his eyes from the window suddenly and stood up:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Will you please excuse me, sir. I am
<br><font color="green">{ms, 830}</font>
<br> I forgot to tell you that today I must go away earlier
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I am afraid I shall be late, he added looking at the watch. Will you excuse me? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You have an appointment now? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, I nearly forgot. You must excuse me for today &nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Certainly, certainly. You can go now &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Thanks. I am afraid I &nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Certainly, certainly &mdash;</p>
<p> With a flying hand for the banisters he ran down the stairs, taking five
steps at a time. He struggled into his raincoat in the hall and emerged panting
and half-dressed on to the front steps. He ran out into the middle of the muddy
roadway and peered through the dull light towards the eastern side of the
square. He walked on swiftly in the middle of the road with his eyes fixed on
the same point and then came in again on the footpath and began to run. When he
reached the corner of Earlsfort Terrace he stopped running and turning to the
right walked on again swiftly. Outside of the University he came alongside of the object which he had been pursuing.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 831}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Good morning! &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Stephen! &nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. Have you been running? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Where are you going to? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I saw you from the window &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What window? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; In the college. Where are you going? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I am going to Leeson Park &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; This way, said Stephen taking her arm &mdash;</p>
<p> She seemed as if she were about to resent such an act in broad daylight but
after a quick glance of remonstrance allowed him to escort her. Stephen held her
arm tightly to his side and discomposed her somewhat by speaking very close to
her face. Her face was glistening with mist and it
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">had</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
begun to glow in answer to his excited and passionate manner.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Where did you see me? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I was in the window at my Italian lesson with Father
Artifoni. I saw you come through the Green and cross the road &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Did you? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; So I jumped up at once and asked him to excuse me as I had to keep
<br><font color="green">{ms, 832}</font>
<br> an appointment and flew downstairs and out after you &mdash;
<br>The colour had begun to deepen very much on her cheek and it was plain that
she was trying to appear quite at her ease. At first she had been flattered but
now she was becoming a little nervous. She laughed nervously when he told her
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">why</span></span>
<font color="black">that</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> he had run out after her.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Goodness! Why did you do that? &mdash;
<br>Stephen did not answer but he pressed her arm fiercely to his side. At the
end of the terrace she turned into a side street instinctively. Here she walked
more slowly. The street was very quiet and they both lowered their voices.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; How did you know it was I? she said. You must have good sight &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I was gazing out of the window, he answered, looking at
the sky and the Green. Lord God! I felt so full of despair. Sometimes I am taken
that way: I live such a strange life &mdash; without help or sympathy from anyone. Sometimes I am afraid of myself.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 833}</font>
<br> I call those people in the college not men but vegetables
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &nbsp;. Then while I was cursing my own character I saw you &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes? she said looking at the disorderly figure beside her out of her large oval eyes &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You know I was delighted to see you. I had to jump up and
rush out. I couldn&apos;t have sat there another minute
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I said, Here is a human creature at last
&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. I can&apos;t tell you how delighted I was &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You strange boy! she said. You mustn&apos;t go running
about like that: You must have more sense &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Emma! cried Stephen, don&apos;t start talking to me like
that today. I know you want to be very sensible. But you and I &mdash; we are both young, aren&apos;t we? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, Stephen &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Very good, then. If we&apos;re young we feel happy. We feel full of desire &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Desire? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do you know when I saw you &nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. &mdash;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 834}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, how did you know me? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I knew the stride &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Stride! &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do you know, Emma, even from my window I could see your
hips moving inside your waterproof? I saw a young woman walking proudly through
the decayed city. Yes, that&apos;s the way you walk: you&apos;re proud of being
young and proud of being a woman. Do you know when I caught sight of you from my
window &mdash; do you know what I felt?<a target="foot" id="fyz0133">&ordm;</a> &mdash;
<br>There was no use in her essaying indifference now. Her cheeks were covered
with a persistent flush and her eyes shone like gems. She gazed straight before
her and her breath began to be agitated. They stood together in the deserted
street and he continued speaking, a certain
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">ingenuous</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
disattachment guiding his excited passion &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I felt that I longed to hold you in my arms &mdash; your
body. I longed for you to take me in your arms. That&apos;s all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Then I thought I would run after you and say that to
you &nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. Just to live one night together, Emma, and then to say goodbye in the morning
<br><font color="green">{ms, 835}</font>
<br> and never to see each other again! There is no such thing as love in the world: only people are young &mdash;
<br>She tried to take her arm away from his and murmured as if she were repeating from memory:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You are mad, Stephen &mdash;
<br>Stephen let go her arm and took her hand in his, saying:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Goodbye, Emma &nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;. I felt that I
wanted to say that to you for my own sake but if I stand here in this stupid
street beside
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">you</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
for much longer I shall begin to say more &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You say I
am mad because I do not bargain with you or say I love you or swear to you. But
I believe you hear my words and understand me, don&apos;t you &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I don&apos;t understand you indeed, she answered with a touch of anger &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I will give you a chance, said Stephen, pressing her hand
close in his two hands. Tonight when you are going to bed remember me and go to
your window: I will be in the garden. Open the window and call my name and ask me to come in. Then come
<br><font color="green">{ms, 836}</font>
<br> down and let me in. We will live one night together &mdash; one night, Emma
alone together and in the morning we will say goodbye &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Let go my hand, please, she said pulling her hand away
from him. If I had known
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">if</span></span> it was for this
mad talk &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You must not speak to me any more, she said
moving on a pace or two and plucking her waterproof out of his reach. Who do you
think I am that you can speak to me like that? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It is no insult, said Stephen colouring suddenly as the
reverse of the image struck him, for a man to ask a woman what I have asked you.
You are annoyed at something else not at that &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You are mad, I think, she said, brushing past him swiftly
without taking any notice of his salute. She did not go quickly enough, however,
to hide the tears that were in her eyes and he, surprised to see them and
wondering at their cause, forgot to say the goodbye that was on his lips. As he watched
<br><font color="green">{ms, 837}</font>
<br> her walk onward swiftly with her head slightly bowed he seemed to feel her
soul and his falling asunder swiftly
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">and</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
for ever after an instant of all but union.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 838}</font> </p>
<p class="center">XXIV</p>
<p class="flush">Lynch chuckled very much over this adventure. He said it was
the most original attempt at seduction of which he had ever heard, so original
that &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You know, he said, I must tell you that to the ordinary
intelligence &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; To you, that is? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; To the ordinary intelligence it looks as if you had taken
leave of your senses for the time being &mdash;
<br>Stephen stared fixedly at his toes: they were sitting on a bench in the Green.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It was the best I could do, he said &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A very bad best, in my opinion. No girl with an ounce of
brains would listen to you. That&apos;s not the way to go about it, man. You run
out suddenly after her, come up sweating and puffing and say &ldquo;Let us lie
together&rdquo;. Did you mean it as a joke? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, I was quite serious. I thought she might
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In fact I don&apos;t know what I thought. I saw her,
as I told you, and I ran after her and said what was in my mind. We are friends
for a long time &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Now it seems I have acted like
<br><font color="green">{ms, 839}</font>
<br> a lunatic &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, no, said Lynch, expanding his chest, not like a
lunatic but you went about the affair so strangely &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; If I had run after her and proposed to her, proposed
marriage that is, you would not say I had acted strangely &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">No,
no</span></span> Even in that case &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, no, don&apos;t deceive yourself, you would not. You would find an excuse for me</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, you see, there is something relatively sane about marriage, isn&apos;t there? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; For a man of your ordinary intelligence there may be: not
for me. Have you ever read the Form of Solemnization of Marriage in the Book of Common Prayer? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Never &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You should then. Your everyday life is Protestant: you
show yourself a Catholic only when you discuss. Well, to me that ceremony is not
acceptable: it is not so sane as you imagine. A man who swears
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">before
the world</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> to love a
woman till death part him and her is sane neither in the opinion of the
philosopher who understands what mutability is nor in the opinion of the man of
the world who understands that it is safer to be a witness than an actor in such affairs. A man who swears
<br><font color="green">{ms, 840}</font>
<br> to do something which
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">it</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
is not in his power to do is not accounted a sane man. For my part I do not
believe that there was ever a moment of passion so fierce and energetic that it
warranted a man in saying &ldquo;I could love you for ever&rdquo; to the adored
object. Please understand the importance of Goethe &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Still marriage is a custom. To follow a custom is a mark of sanity &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It is a mark of ordinariness. I admit that many ordinary
people are sane just as I know that many ordinary people have delusions. But a
capacity for being deceived by others or by oneself cannot be said to constitute
the essential part of sanity. It is rather a question whether a man does
encourage an insane condition in himself by deceiving himself voluntarily or
allowing himself to be deceived by others voluntarily &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Anyhow your move was not diplomatic &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; We all know that, said Stephen standing up, but all
genuine diplomacy is with a view to some particularly excellent plum. What plum
do you think Cranly is likely to gain by a diplomacy which is highly meritorious in itself? What
<br><font color="green">{ms, 841}</font>
<br> plum would I be likely to get by proposing a diplomatic marriage except a
partner &ldquo;to behold my chaste conversation, coupled with fear&rdquo; &mdash; eh? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The juice of the fruit, answered Lynch standing up in his
turn and looking very thirsty and tired &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The woman herself, you mean? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Exactly &mdash;
<br>Stephen walked along the path without saying anything for about twenty yards: then he said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I like a woman to give herself. I like to receive
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;. These people count it a sin to sell holy things for
money. But surely what they call the temple of the Holy Ghost should not be
bargained for! Isn&apos;t that simony? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You want to sell your verses, don&apos;t you, said Lynch
abruptly, and to a public you say you despise? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I do not want to sell my poetical mind to the public. I
expect reward from the public for my verses because I believe my verses are to
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">be</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
numbered among the spiritual assets of the State. That is not a simoniacal
exchange. I do not sell what Glynn calls the divine afflatus: I do not swear to love,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 842}</font>
<br> honour and obey the public until my dying day &mdash; do I? A woman&apos;s
body is a corporal asset of the State: if she traffic with it she must sell it
either as a harlot or as a married woman or as a working celibate or as a
mistress. But a woman is (incidentally) a human being: and a human being&apos;s
love and freedom is not a spiritual asset of the State. Can the State buy and
sell electricity? It is not possible. Simony is monstrous because it revolts our
notion of what is humanly possible. A human being can exert freedom to produce
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">or to
accept</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>, or love to
procreate or to satisfy. Love gives and freedom
takes.<a target="foot" id="fyz0134">&ordm;</a> The woman in the black straw hat
gave something before he<a target="foot" id="fyz0135">&ordm;</a> sold her body
to the State: Emma will sell herself to the State but give nothing &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You know, even if you had proposed to buy her decently
&mdash; for State purposes &mdash; said Lynch, kicking his toes moodily at the
gravel, she would not have sold at the price &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You think not. Not even if I &nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Not likely, said the other definitely. What a damn fool she is! &mdash;
<br>Stephen blushed ingenuously:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You have such a nice way of putting things, he said &mdash;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 843}</font>
<br>
<br>The next time Stephen met Emma in the street she did not salute him. He did
not tell the incident to anyone but Lynch. From Cranly he expected scant
sympathy and he was deterred from speaking of it to Maurice because he had still
the elder brother&apos;s wish to appear successful. The conversation with Lynch
had revealed to him with distressing effect the commonplace side of the
adventure. He asked himself seriously and often had he expected that she would
have answered &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to his proposal. His mind, he thought, must have
been somewhat unbalanced that morning. And yet when he reconsidered his own
defence of his conduct he found it just. The economic aspect of the affair did
not present itself to him very vividly and, indeed, was only vivid enough to
make him deplore
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">the
fact</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> that the
solution of moral problems should be so hopelessly entangled with merely
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">material</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
considerations. He was not sufficiently doctrinaire to wish to have his theory
put to the test by a general
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">revulsion</span></span>
<font color="black">revolution</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
of society but he could not believe that his theory was utterly impracticable. The Roman Catholic notion that a man
<br><font color="green">{ms, 844}</font>
<br> should be unswervingly continent from his boyhood and then be permitted to
achieve his male nature, having first satisfied the Church as to his orthodoxy,
financial condition
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">and</span></span>, prospects, and
general intentions,
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">and</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
having sworn before witnesses to love his wife for ever whether he loved her or
not and to beget children for the kingdom of heaven in such manner as the Church
approved of &mdash; this notion seemed to him by no means satisfactory.</p>
<p> During the train of these reflections the Church sent an embassy of nimble
pleaders into his ears. These ambassadors were of all grades and of all types of
culture. They addressed every side of his nature in turn. He was a young man
with a doubtful future and an unusual character: this was the first salient
fact. The ambassadors met it without undue pretence or haste. They stated that
it was in their power to make smooth many of the ways which promised to be rough
and, by diminishing the hardships of the material nature, to allow the unusual
character scope and ease to develop and approve itself. He had deplored the entanglement of merely
<br><font color="green">{ms, 845}</font>
<br> material considerations in a problem of morals and here, at least, was a
warrant that if he chose to give ear to the pleadings of the embassy the moral
problem in his case would be set on the road of solving itself free from minor
and unworthier cares. He had what he called a &lsquo;modern&rsquo; reluctance to
give pledges: no pledges were required. If at the end of five years he still
persevered in his obduracy of heart he could still seize upon his individual
liberty without fear of being called oath-breaker therefor. The practice of due
consideration was an old one and a wise one. He himself was the greatest sceptic
concerning the perfervid enthusiasms of the patriots. As an artist he had
nothing but contempt for a work which had arisen out of
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">many</span></span> any but the
most stable mood of the mind. Was it possible that he would exercise less rigour
on his life than he desired to exercise on his art? How could he be guilty of
such foolishness, of such cynical subordination of the actual to the abstract,
if he honestly believed that an institution is to be accounted valuable in proportion to its nearness
<br><font color="green">{ms, 846}</font>
<br> to some actual human need or energy and that the epithet
&lsquo;vivisective&rsquo; should be applied to the modern spirit as
distinguished from the ancient or category-burdened spirit. He desired for
himself the life of an artist. Well! And he feared that the Church would
obstruct his desire. But, during the formulation of his artistic creed, had he
not found item after item upheld for him in advance by the greatest and most
orthodox doctor of the Church and was it anything but vanity which urged him to
seek out the thorny crown of the heretic while the entire theory, in accordance
with which his entire artistic life was shaped, arose most conveniently for his
purpose out of the mass of Catholic theology? He could not accept
whole-heartedly the offers of Protestant belief: he knew that the liberty it
boasted of was often only the liberty to be slovenly in thought and amorphous in
ritual. No-one, not the most rabid enemy of the Church, could accuse it of being
<br><font color="green">{ms, 847}</font>
<br> slovenly in thought: the subtlety of its disquisitions had become a byword
with demagogues. No-one again could accuse the Church of being amorphous in
ritual. The Puritan, the Calvinist, the Lutheran were inimical to art and to
exuberant beauty: the Catholic was the friend of him who professed to interpret
or divulge the beautiful. Could he assert that his own aristocratic intelligence
and passion for a supremely satisfying order in all the fervours of artistic
creation were not purely Catholic qualities? The ambassadors did not labour this point.</p>
<p> Besides, they said, it is a mark of the modern spirit to be shy in the
presence of all absolute statements. However sure you may be now of the
reasonableness of your convictions you cannot be sure that you will always think
them reasonable. If you sincerely regard a pledge as an infringement of human
liberty you cannot pledge yourself against following a reactionary impulse which
is certain to overtake you some day. You cannot leave out of sight the possibility
<br><font color="green">{ms, 848}</font>
<br> that your views of the world will change to such an extent that you will
regard all interference with the course of affairs as the part of such
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">who</span></span>
<font color="black">as</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
can still be deluded by hope. In that case what
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">has</span></span>
<font color="black">will
have</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> become of your
life? You will have wasted it in efforts to save people
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext"><font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">unread</span></font></span></span>
who have neither inclination nor aptitude for freedom. You believe in an
aristocracy: believe also in eminence of the aristocratic class and in the order
of society which secures that eminence. Do you imagine that manners will become
less ignoble, intellectual and artistic endeavour less conditioned, if the
ignorant, enthusiastic, spiritual slovens whom we have subjected subject us? Not
one of those slovens understands your aims as an artist or wants your sympathy:
we, on the contrary, understand your aims and often are in sympathy with them
and we sollicit your support and consider your comradeship an honour. You are
fond of saying that the Absolute is dead. If that be so it is possible that we are all wrong and if once
<br><font color="green">{ms, 849}</font>
<br> you accept that as a possibility what remains for you but an intellectual
disdain. With us you can exercise your contemptuous faculties when you are
recognised as
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">one
of</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> the patrician
order and you will not even be obliged to grant a truce to the very doctrines,
the success of which in the world has secured you your patricianship. Make one
with us. Your life will be insured from grosser troubles, your art will be
safeguarded against the intrusions of revolutionary notions which no artist of
whom history tells us has ever made himself champion. Make one with us, on equal
terms. In temper and in mind you are still a Catholic. Catholicism is in your
blood.<a target="foot" id="fyz0136">&ordm;</a> Living in an age which professes
to have discovered
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">evolution</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
can you be fatuous enough to think that simply by being wrong-headed you can
recreate entirely your mind and temper or can clear your blood of what you may
call the Catholic infection? A revolution such as you desire is not brought
about by violence but gradually: and, within the
<br><font color="green">{ms, 850}</font>
<br> Church you have an opportunity of beginning your revolution in a rational
manner. You can sow the seeds in the careful furrows entrusted to you and if
your seed is good it will prosper. But by going into the unnecessary wilderness
and scattering your seed broadcast on all soils what harvest will you have?
Everything seems to urge you to a course of moderation, of forbearance, and the
purified will can surely display itself quite as well in acceptance as in
rejection. The trees do not resent autumn nor does any exemplary thing in nature
resent its limitations. Neither then do you resent the limitations of compromise.</p>
<p> These pleadings which Stephen so punctiliously heard out were supplemented
by Cranly&apos;s influence. Neither of the young men
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">were</span></span>
<font color="black">was</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
studying for
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">their</span></span>
<font color="black">his</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
examination and they spent their evenings as usual in aimless walking and
talking. Their walks and talks led nowhere because whenever anything definite
threatened to make its appearance in their talk Cranly promptly sought the company
<br><font color="green">{ms, 851}</font>
<br> of some of his chosen companions. The billiard-room of the Adelphi Hotel
was now a favourite resort of the two friends. After ten o&apos;clock every
night they went into the billiard-room. It was a big room well furnished with
ill-kept inelegant tables and poorly furnished with players. Cranly played
protracted matches with one or other of his companions while Stephen sat on the
seat that ran alongside of the table. A game of fifty cost sixpence which was
duly paid by each of the players in equal parts, Cranly producing his threepence
very deliberately from a leather heart-shaped purse. The players sometimes sent
their balls on to the floor and Cranly occasionally swore at his flamin&apos;
cue.<a target="foot" id="fyz0137">&ordm;</a> There was a bar attached to the
billiard-room. In the bar was a stout barmaid who wore badly made stays, served
bottles of stout with her head on one side, and conversed in an English accent
with her customers about the theatrical companies of the different theatres. Her customers were
<br><font color="green">{ms, 852}</font>
<br> young men who carried their hats
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">sideways</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
far back on their heads and walked with their feet far apart. Their trousers
were usually turned up high above their tan boots. One of the regular customers
at this bar (though he did not mix with the young gentlemen mentioned above) was
a friend of Cranly&apos;s, a young man who was a clerk in the Agricultural Board
Office. He was a bandy-legged little man who spoke very little when he was sober
but very much when he was drunk. When he was sober he was very orderly but his
tipsiness, signalled by a dark-coloured ooze upon his pock-marked face, was
boastful and disorderly. One night he engaged in a fierce argument about Tim
Healy with a thick set medical student who had a taste for the art of
self-defence. The argument was nearly entirely one-sided inasmuch as the medical
student&apos;s contributions were derisive laughs and such remarks as &ldquo;Is
he handy with the mits?&rdquo; &ldquo;Can he put up his props?&rdquo; &ldquo;Is
he a good man with the mits?&rdquo; At last the
<br><font color="green">{ms, 853}</font>
<br> clerk from the Agricultural Board Office called the medical student a dirty
name whereupon the medical student immediately knocked down all the drinks on
the counter in his efforts to &lsquo;smash&rsquo; the offender. The barmaid ran
screaming for the proprietor, the medical student was soothed and restrained by
considerate friends, and the offender was escorted out by Cranly and Stephen
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">and a
few others</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>. At first
he lamented that his new cuffs were stained with porter and expressed a great
desire to go back and fight it out but, dissuaded by Cranly,
<a name="jn1034k" href="../../FF/unbs/jn1all.htm#jn1034k">he began to tell
Stephen in an indistinct undertone that he had got the highest marks in Pure
Mathematics ever given in the degree examination</a>. He advised Stephen to go
to London to write for the papers and said he could put him in the right way to
get on. When Cranly had begun a conversation with the others concerning the
interrupted game of billiards Stephen&apos;s companion again announced that
<a name="jn1034k" href="../../FF/unbs/jn1all.htm#jn1034k">he had got
<br><font color="green">{ms, 854}</font>
<br> the highest marks ever given in the degree in Pure Mathematics</a>.</p>
<p> Stephen continued making his book of verses in spite of these distracting
influences. He had come to the conclusion that nature had designed him for a man
of letters and therefore he determined that, in spite of all influences, he
would do as nature counselled. He had begun to consider Cranly a bad influence.
Cranly&apos;s method in argument was to reduce all things to their food values
(though he himself was the most impractical of theorists) and Stephen&apos;s
conception of art fared very badly from such a method. Stephen held the test of
food values an extreme one and one which in its utter materialism suggested a
declination from the heights of romanticism. He knew that Cranly&apos;s
materialism was only skin-deep and he surmised that Cranly chose to express
himself in language and conduct of direct ugliness simply because his fear of
ridicule and more than diplomatic wish to be well with men urged him to refrain
from beauty of any kind. He fancied moreover that he detected
<br><font color="green">{ms, 855}</font>
<br> in Cranly&apos;s attitude towards him a certain hostility, arising out of a
thwarted desire to imitate. Cranly was fond of ridiculing Stephen to his bar
companions and though this was supposed to be no more than banter Stephen found
touches of seriousness in it. Stephen refused to close with this trivial
falsehood of his friend and continued to
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">disclose</span></span>
<font color="black">share</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
all the secrets of his bosom as if he had not observed any change. He no longer,
however, sought his friend&apos;s opinion or allowed the sour dissatisfaction of
his friend&apos;s moods to weigh with him. He was egoistically determined that
nothing material, no favour
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">of</span></span>
<font color="black">or</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
reverse of fortune, no bond of association or impulse or tradition should hinder
him from working out the enigma of his position in his own way. He avoided his
father sedulously because he now regarded his father&apos;s presumptions as the
most deadly part of a tyranny, internal and external, which he determined to
combat with might and main. He argued no further with his mother persuaded that he could have no
<br><font color="green">{ms, 856}</font>
<br> satisfactory commerce with her so long as she chose to set the shadow of a
clergyman between her nature and his. His mother told him one day that she had
spoken of him to her confessor and asked his spiritual advice. Stephen turned to
her and remonstrated hotly with her for doing such a thing.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It is a nice thing, he said, that you go and discuss me
behind my back. Have you not your own nature to guide you, your own sense of
what is right, without going to some Father Jack-in-the-Box to ask him to guide you? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Priests know a great deal of the world, said his mother &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And what did he advise you to do? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He said if there were any young children in the house he
would advise me to get out away
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">from
there</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> as quickly as I could &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Very nice! said Stephen angrily. That&apos;s a pretty
thing for you to come and say to a son of yours! &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I am simply telling you what the priest advised me to do, said his mother quietly &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; These fellows, said Stephen, know nothing
<br><font color="green">{ms, 857}</font>
<br> of the world. You might as well say that a rat in a sewer knew the world.
Anyway you won&apos;t repeat what I say to your confessor in future because I
won&apos;t say anything. And the next
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">t</span></span> time he asks you
&ldquo;What is that mistaken young man, that unfortunate boy, doing?&rdquo; you
can answer &ldquo;I don&apos;t know, father. I asked him and he said I was to
tell the priest he was making a torpedo&rdquo;.</p>
<p> The general attitude of women towards religion puzzled and often maddened
Stephen. His nature was incapable of achieving such an attitude of insincerity
or stupidity. By brooding constantly upon this he ended by anathematising Emma
as the most deceptive and cowardly of
<a name="pn1019c" href="../../FF/unbs/pn1all.htm#pn1019c">marsupials</a>. He
discovered that it was a menial fear and no spirit of chastity which had
prevented her from granting his request. Her eyes, he thought, must look strange
when upraised to some holy image and her lips when poised for the reception of
the host. He cursed her burgher cowardice and her beauty and he said to himself
that though her eyes might cajole the half-witted
<br><font color="green">{ms, 858}</font>
<br> God of the Roman Catholics they would not cajole him. In every stray image
of the streets he saw her soul manifest itself and every such manifestation
renewed the intensity of his disapproval. It did not strike him that the
attitude of women towards holy things really implied a more genuine emancipation
than his own and he condemned them out of a purely suppositious conscience. He
exaggerated their iniquities and evil influence and returned them their
antipathy in full measure. He toyed also with a theory of dualism which would
symbolise the twin eternities of spirit and nature in the twin eternities of
male and female and even thought of explaining the audacities of his verse as
symbolical allusions. It was hard for him to compel his head to preserve the
strict temperature of classicism. More than he had ever done before he longed
for the season to lift and for spring &mdash; the misty Irish spring &mdash; to
be over and gone. He was passing through Eccles&apos; St one evening one misty
evening with all these thoughts dancing the dance of unrest in his brain when a
trivial incident set him composing some ardent verses
<br><font color="green">{ms, 859}</font>
<br> which he entitled a &ldquo;Vilanelle of the Temptress&rdquo;. A young lady
was standing on the steps of one of those brown brick houses which seem the very
incarnation of Irish paralysis. A young gentleman was leaning on the rusty
railings of the area. Stephen as he passed on his quest heard the following
fragment of colloquy out of which he received an impression keen enough to afflict his sensitiveness very severely.
<br>The Young Lady &mdash; (drawling discreetly) &nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. O, yes
&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. I was &nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. at the &nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;.
cha &nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. pel. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
<br>The Young Gentleman &mdash; (inaudibly)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;. (again
inaudibly). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
<br>The Young Lady &mdash; (softly) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;. O
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but you&apos;re &nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. ve
&nbsp;&nbsp;. ry &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &nbsp;. wick &nbsp;. &nbsp;. ed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p> This triviality made him think of collecting many such moments together in a
book of epiphanies. By an epiphany he meant a sudden spiritual manifestation,
whether in the vulgarity of speech or of gesture or in a memorable phase of the
mind itself. He believed that it was for the man of letters to record these
epiphanies with extreme care, seeing that they themselves are the most delicate
and evanescent of moments. He told Cranly that the clock of the Ballast-office was capable of
<br><font color="green">{ms, 860}</font>
<br> an epiphany. Cranly questioned the inscrutable dial of the Ballast office
with his no less inscrutable countenance.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, said Stephen. I will pass it time after time, allude
to it, refer to it, catch a glimpse of it. It is only an item in the catalogue
of Dublin&apos;s street furniture. Then all at once I see it and I know at once what it is: epiphany &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Imagine my glimpses at that clock as the gropings of a
spiritual eye which seeks to adjust its vision to an exact focus. The moment the
focus is reached the object is epiphanised. It is just in this epiphany that I
find the third, the supreme quality of beauty &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes? said Cranly absently &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No esthetic theory,

Stephen</span></span> <font color="black">Stephen
pursued</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
relentlessly, is of any value which investigates with the aid of the lantern of
tradition. What we symbolise in black the Chinaman may symbolise in yellow: each
has his own tradition. Greek beauty laughs at Coptic beauty and the American
Indian derides them both. It is almost impossible to reconcile all tradition
whereas it is by no means impossible to find the justification of every form of
beauty which has been adored on the earth by an
<br><font color="green">{ms, 861}</font>
<br> examination into the mechanism of esthetic apprehension whether it be
dressed in red, white, yellow or black. We have no reason for thinking that the
Chinaman has a different system of digestion from that which we have though our
diets are quite dissimilar. The apprehensive faculty must be scrutinised in action &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You know what Aquinas says: The three things requisite
for beauty<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span> are,
integrity, a wholeness, symmetry and radiance. Some day I will expand that
sentence into a treatise. Consider the performance of your own mind when
confronted with any object, hypothetically beautiful. Your mind to apprehend
that object divides the entire universe into two parts, the object, and the void
which is not the object. To apprehend it you must lift it away from everything
else: and then you perceive that it is one integral thing, that is <u>a</u>
thing. You recognise its integrity. Isn&apos;t that so? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And then? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That is the first quality of beauty: it is declared in a
simple sudden synthesis of the faculty which apprehends. What then? Analysis
then. The mind considers the object in whole
<br><font color="green">{ms, 862}</font>
<br> and in part, in relation to itself and to other objects, examines the
balance of its parts, contemplates the form of the object, traverses every
cranny of the structure. So the mind receives the impression of the symmetry of
the object. The mind recognises that the object is, in the strict sense of the
word, a <u>thing</u>, a
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">definitely</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
constituted entity. You see? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Let us turn back, said Cranly &mdash;
<br>They had reached the corner of Grafton St and as the footpath was
overcrowded they turned back northwards. Cranly had an inclination to watch the
antics of a drunkard who had been ejected from a bar in Suffolk St but Stephen
took his arm summarily and led him away.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Now for the third quality. For a long time I
couldn&apos;t make out what Aquinas meant. He uses a figurative word (a very
unusual thing for him) but I have solved it. <u>Claritas</u> is
<u>quidditas</u>. After the analysis which discovers the second quality the mind
makes the only logically possible synthesis and discovers the third quality.
This is the moment which I call epiphany. First we recognise that the object is
<u>one</u> integral thing, then we recognise that it is an organised composite
structure, a <u>thing</u> in fact: finally, when the relation of the parts is
exquisite, when the parts are adjusted to the special point, we recognise
<br><font color="green">{ms, 863}</font>
<br> that it is <u>that</u> thing which it is. Its soul, its whatness, leaps to
us from the vestment of its appearance. The soul of the commonest object, the
structure of which is so adjusted, seems to us radiant. The object achieves its epiphany &mdash;
<br>Having finished his argument Stephen walked on in silence. He felt
Cranly&apos;s hostility and he accused himself of having cheapened the eternal
images of beauty. For the first time, too, he felt slightly awkward in his
friend&apos;s company and to restore a mood of flippant familiarity he glanced
up at the clock of the Ballast Office and smiled:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It has not epiphanised yet, he said &mdash;
<br>Cranly stared stolidly down the river and held his peace for a few minutes
during which the expounder of the new esthetic repeated his theory to himself
all over again. A clock at the far side of the bridge chimed and simultaneously
Cranly&apos;s thin lips parted for speech:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I wonder, he said &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What? &mdash;
<br>Cranly continued to stare towards the mouth of the Liffey like a man in a
trance. Stephen waited for the sentence to be finished and then he said again
&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Cranly then faced about suddenly and said
<br><font color="green">{ms, 864}</font>
<br> with flat emphasis:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;
<a name="jn1040i" href="../../FF/unbs/jn1all.htm#jn1040i">I wonder did that
bloody boat, the <u>Sea-Queen</u> ever start?</a><a target="foot" id="fyz0138">&ordm;</a> &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen had now completed a series of hymns in honour of extravagant beauty
and these he published privately in a manuscript edition of one copy. His last
interview with Cranly had been so unsatisfactory that he hesitated to show the
manuscript to him. He kept the manuscript by him and its presence tormented him.
He wanted to show it to his parents but the examination was approaching and he
knew that their sympathy would be incomplete. He wanted to show it to Maurice
but he was conscious that his brother resented having been forsaken for plebeian
companions. He wanted to show it to Lynch but he dreaded the physical labour of
urging that torpid young man into a condition of receptiveness. He even thought
for a moment of McCann and Madden. He saw Madden rarely; the salute which the
young patriot gave him on those rare occasions was not unlike the salute which
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">one</span></span>
<font color="black">a</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
friend who has failed gives to a friend who has succeeded. Madden spent the
greater part of his day in Cooney&apos;s tobacco-shop, sampling and
<br><font color="green">{ms, 865}</font>
<br> discussing <u>cam&agrave;ns</u>, smoking very heavy tobacco and speaking
Irish with <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">me</span></span> newly
arrived provincials. McCann was still busily occupied in editing his magazine
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">for</span></span>
<font color="black">to</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
which he had himself contributed an article, entitled &ldquo;Rationalism in
Practice&rdquo;. In this article he expressed the hope that mankind in the not
too distant future would use
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">minerals
as</span></span>
<font color="black">mineral,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
instead of animal
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">and</span></span>
<font color="black">or</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
vegetable diet. The tone of the editor&apos;s writing had become much more
orthodox than his speech had been wont to be. In the report of the general
meeting of the College Sodality which occupied a column and a half of the
College magazine it was stated that Mr McCann, in a forcible speech, had
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">suggested</span></span> made many
valuable suggestions for the working of the society on a more practical basis.
Stephen was surprised at this and when one day,
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">when Mc</span></span> walking
through Nassau St with Cranly, he encountered the editor
<br><font color="green">{ms, 866}</font>
<br> striding vigorously towards the Library he said to Cranly:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What is Bonny Dundee at? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; How &mdash; at? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I mean &nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. this sodality business
he&apos;s mixing himself up in. He can&apos;t be stupid enough to think he can
use the sodality for any good purpose &mdash;
<br>Cranly eyed Stephen quizzically but, after considering the matter, decided to make no remark.</p>
<p> The examination resulted in Cranly&apos;s being &lsquo;stuck&rsquo; again
and in Stephen&apos;s securing a low pass. Stephen did not think it necessary to
take the results of these examinations very bitterly to heart inasmuch as he
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">judged</span></span> knew that
Father Artifoni, who had presented himself for the matriculation examination,
had been awarded higher marks for his English paper than for his Italian paper,
having been tested in the latter language by a polyglot examiner who examined in
French, Italian, Arabic,
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Jewish</span></span> Hebrew,
Spanish and German. Stephen sympathised with his teacher who was ingenuous
enough to express his astonishment. One evening
<br><font color="green">{ms, 867}</font>
<br> during the examinations Stephen was talking to Cranly under the arcade of
the University when Emma passed them. Cranly raised his ancient straw hat (which
he had once more resurrected) and Stephen followed suit. In reply she bowed very
politely across Stephen at his friend. Cranly replaced his hat and proceeded to
meditate in the shade of it for a few minutes.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Why did she do that? he said &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; An invitation, perhaps, said Stephen &mdash;
<br>Cranly stared continuously at the air through which she had passed: and Stephen said smilingly:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Perhaps she meant it as an invitation &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Perhaps &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You&apos;re incomplete without a woman, said Stephen &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Only she&apos;s so flamin&apos; fat, said Cranly, d&apos;ye know &nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. &mdash;
<br>Stephen kept silent. He was not pleased that anyone else should speak
against her and he did not smile when Cranly took his arm saying
<a name="jn1040h" href="../../FF/unbs/jn1all.htm#jn1040h">&ldquo;Let us eke
go&rdquo;</a> which
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">he</span></span>
<font color="black">was
always</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> intended as
an old English expression inviting departure.<a target="foot" id="fyz0139">&ordm;</a> Stephen had long ago
<br><font color="green">{ms, 868}</font>
<br> debated with himself the advisability of telling Cranly that the expression
should be amended but Cranly&apos;s persistent emphasis of the word &lsquo;eke&rsquo; acted as a deterrent.</p>
<p> The announcement of the result of the examination led to a domestic
squabble. Mr
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">Daedalus</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
ransacked his vocabulary in search of abusive terms and ended by asking Stephen what were his plans for the future.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I have no plans &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well then the sooner you clear out the better.
You&apos;ve been having us I see. However with the help of God and His Holy
Mother I&apos;ll write to Mullingar the first thing in the morning. There&apos;s
no use in your godfather wasting any more of his money on you &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Simon, said Mrs Daedalus, you always go to the fair with
the story. Can&apos;t you be reasonable &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Reasonable be damned. Don&apos;t I know the set he has
got into &mdash; lousy-looking patriots and that football chap in the
knickerbockers. To tell you the God&apos;s truth, Stephen, I thought you&apos;d
have more pride than to associate with such <u>canaille</u> &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I don&apos;t think Stephen has done so badly
<br><font color="green">{ms, 869}</font>
<br> in his examination: he hasn&apos;t failed and after all &nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; She will put in her word, you know, said Mr Daedalus to
his son. That&apos;s a little hereditary habit. Her family, you know, by God
they know anything you can ask them down to the making of the mainspring of a watch. Fact &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You oughtn&apos;t to run away with the story, Simon. Many
fathers would be glad to have such a son &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You needn&apos;t interfere between me and my son. We
understand each other. I&apos;m not saying anything to him; but I want to know
what he has been doing for twelve months &mdash;
<br>Stephen continued tapping the blade of his knife on the edge of his plate.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What have you been doing? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Thinking &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Thinking? Is that all &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And writing a little &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Hm. I see. Wasting your time, in fact &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I don&apos;t consider it waste of time to think &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Hm. I see. You see I know these Bohemian chaps, these
poets, who don&apos;t consider it waste of time to think. But at the
<br><font color="green">{ms, 870}</font>
<br> same time they&apos;re damn glad to borrow an odd shilling now and then to
buy chops with. How will you like thinking when you have no chops? Can&apos;t
you go for something definite, some good appointment in a government office and
then, by Christ, you can think as much as you like. Study for some first-class
appointment, there are plenty of them, and you can write at your leisure.
Unless, perhaps, you would prefer to be a loafer eating orange-peels and sleeping in the Park &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen made no reply. When the harangue had been repeated five or six times
he got up and went out. He went over to the Library to look for Cranly and, not
finding him in the
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Lib</span></span> reading-room or
in the porch, went to the Adelphi Hotel. It was a Saturday night and the rooms
were crowded with
clerks<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">and</span></span>. The clerk
from the Agricultural Board Office was sitting in the corner of the bar with his
hat pushed well back from his forehead and at once Stephen recognised the dark
ooze
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">which
was</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> threatening to
emerge upon his heated face. He was occupied in twirling his moustache in the crook of his index finger, and
<br><font color="green">{ms, 871}</font>
<br> in glancing between the barmaid&apos;s face and the label of his bottle of
stout. The billiard-room was very noisy: all the tables were engaged and the
balls hopped on to the floor every minute or so. Some of the players played in their shirt-sleeves.</p>
<p> Cranly was sitting stolidly on the seat that ran alongside the tables,
watching a game <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">of</span></span>.
Stephen sat beside him in silence, also watching the game. It was a three-handed
game. An elderly clerk, evidently in a patronising mood, was playing two of his
junior colleagues. The elderly clerk was a tall stout man who wore gilt
spectacles on a face like a red shrivelled apple. He was in his shirt-sleeves
and he played and spoke so briskly as to suggest that he was drilling rather
than playing. The young clerks were both clean shaven. One of them was a
thickset young man who played doggedly without speaking, the other was an
effervescent young man with white eyebrows and a nervous manner. Cranly and Stephen watched the game progress, creep
<br><font color="green">{ms, 872}</font>
<br> from point to point. The heavy young man put his ball on to the floor three
times in succession and the scoring was so slow that the marker came and stood
by the table as a reminder that the twenty minutes had passed. The players
chalked their cues oftener than before and, seeing that they were in earnest
about finishing the game, the marker did not say anything about the time. But
his presence acted upon them. The elderly clerk jerked his cue at his ball,
making a bad stroke, and stood back from the table blinking his eyes and saying
&ldquo;Missed that time&rdquo;. The effervescent young clerk hurried to his
ball, made a bad stroke and, looking along his cue, said &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;. The
dogged young man shot his ball straight into the top
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">socket</span></span> pocket, a
fact which the marker registered at once on the broken marking-board. The
elderly clerk peered for a few critical seconds over the rim of his glasses,
made another bad stroke and, at once proceeding to chalk his cue,
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">briskly,</span></span>
<br><font color="green">{ms, 873}</font>
<br> said briefly and sharply to the effervescent young man &ldquo;Come on now, White. Hurry up now&rdquo;.</p>
<p> The hopeless pretence of those three lives before him, their unredeemable
servility, made the back of Stephen&apos;s eyes feel burning hot. He laid his
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">arm</span></span> hand on Cranly&apos;s shoulder and said impetuously:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; We must go out at once. I can&apos;t stand it any longer &mdash;
<br>They crossed the room together and Stephen said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; If I had remained another minute I think I would have begun to cry &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, it is bloody awful, said Cranly &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, hopeless! hopeless! said Stephen clenching his fists.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 874}</font> </p>
<p class="center">XXV</p>
<p class="flush">A few nights before Cranly went to the country to
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">recruit</span></span>
<font color="black">refresh</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
himself in body after his failure in the examination, Stephen said to him:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I believe this will be an important season for me. I
intend to come to some decision as to my course of action &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But you will go for Second Arts next year? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; My godfather may not pay. They expected I would get an exhibition &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And why didn&apos;t you? said Cranly &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I will think things out, said Stephen, and see what I can do &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; There are a hundred things you can do &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Are there, faith? We&apos;ll see
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I might want to write to you. What is your address? &mdash;
<br>Cranly affected not to hear this question. He was picking his teeth with a
match, very deliberately and scrupulously, occasionally halting to insert his
tongue carefully into some crevice before continuing the process of
picking.<a target="foot" id="fyz0140">&ordm;</a> He spat out what he dislodged.
His straw hat rested mainly on the nape of his neck and his feet
<br><font color="green">{ms, 875}</font>
<br> were planted far apart. After a considerable pause he returned to his last
phrase, as if he had been inwardly reviewing it:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ay, hundreds of things &mdash;
<br>Stephen said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What is your address in the country? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; My address? &nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. O
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &nbsp;. You see &nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;.
it&apos;s really impossible, d&apos;ye know, to say what my address would be.
But you won&apos;t come to any decision before I come back
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I&apos;m almost sure I&apos;ll go in the
morning but I want to see at what time there&apos;s a train &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; We looked before, said Stephen. Half past nine &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No &nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. I think I must go up to Harcourt
St to see what
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">time</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
there&apos;s a train &mdash;
<br>They walked slowly in the direction of Harcourt St. Stephen, refusing to nurse ill-feeling, said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What mysterious purpose is concealed under your
impossible prosiness? Please tell me that. Have you anything in your mind&apos;s eye? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; If I had a mysterious purpose, said Cranly, I
wouldn&apos;t be likely to tell
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">you,
would I?, what it was</span></span> <font color="black">you, what it was would
I?<a target="foot" id="fyz0141">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I have told you a great deal, said Stephen &mdash;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 876}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Most people have some purpose or other in their lives.
<a name="jn1004f" href="../../FF/unbs/jn1all.htm#jn1004f">Aristotle says that
the end of every being is its greatest good</a>.
<a name="jn1004e" href="../../FF/unbs/jn1all.htm#jn1004e">We all act in view of some good</a> &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Couldn&apos;t you be a bit more precise? You don&apos;t
wish me to write gospels about you, do you? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &nbsp;.
Are you really thinking of being a pork-butcher? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, really. Would you not think of it. You could wrap
your sausages in your love-poems<a target="foot" id="fyz0142">&ordm;</a> &mdash;
<br>Stephen laughed.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You mustn&apos;t think you can impose on me, Cranly, he
said. I know you are damnably romantic &mdash;
<br>At Harcourt St Station they went up to the time-table and after a glance at it Stephen said mischievously:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Half past nine, as I told you. You see you wouldn&apos;t
take a fool&apos;s word for it &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That&apos;s another train, said Cranly impatiently &mdash;
<br>Stephen smiled with enjoyment while Cranly began to examine the chart,
murmuring the names of the stations to himself and calculating time. In the end he seemed to arrive at
<br><font color="green">{ms, 877}</font>
<br> some decision for he said to Stephen
<a name="jn1040h" href="../../FF/unbs/jn1all.htm#jn1040h">&ldquo;Let us eke
go&rdquo;</a>. Outside the station Stephen pulled his friend&apos;s coat-sleeve
and pointed to a newsbill which was exposed to public gaze on the roadway, held down at the corners by four stones.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Have you seen this? &mdash;
<br>
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Cranly</span></span>
<font color="black">They</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
stopped to read the
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">items</span></span> bill and four
or five people also stopped to read it. Cranly read out the items in his flattest accent, beginning at the headline:</p>
<p class="set"><u>Evening Telegraph</u>
<br> <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Meeting</span></span>
<br> Nationalist Meeting at Ballinrobe.
<br> Important Speeches.
<br> Main Drainage Scheme.
<br> Breezy Discussion.
<br> Death of a Well-known Solicitor
<br> Mad Cow at Cabra,
<br> Literature &amp;c.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 878}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do you think it requires great ability to live that life
successfully? asked Stephen when they were once more on the way &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I suppose you consider literature the most important thing there? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You take up that view of the world, I am sure, out of
pure perversity. You try to prove me abnormal and diseased but it is as easy to
prove that the well-known solicitor was diseased and abnormal. Insensibility is a mark of disease &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He may have been what you would call an
artist<a target="foot" id="fyz0143">&ordm;</a> &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, of course &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &nbsp;. And as
for the temptation which Satan was allowed to dangle before the eyes of Jesus it
is, in reality, the most ineffectual temptation to offer to any man of genius.
The well-known solicitor might succumb to it but for Jesus the kingdom of this
world must have been a very empty phrase indeed &mdash; at least when he had
outgrown a romantic youth. Satan, really, is the romantic youth of Jesus
re-appearing for a moment.<a target="foot" id="fyz0144">&ordm;</a> I had a
romantic youth, too, when I thought it must be a grand thing
<br><font color="green">{ms, 879}</font>
<br> to be a material Messias: that was the will of my father who will never be
in heaven. But now such a thought arises in my mind only in moments of great
physical weakness. So I regard that view of life as the abnormal view &mdash;
for me. A few days ago I walked out to Howth for a swim and while I was going
round the side of the Head I had to take a little ribbon of a path that hung
high over the rocks &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What side of Howth? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Near the Bailey &nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. Very good. As I
looked down on those rocks beneath me the thought arose in my mind to cast
myself down upon them. The thought made me shiver with pleasure for a moment
but, of course, I recognised our old friend. All these temptations are of a
piece. To Jesus, to me, to the excitable person who adopts brigandage or suicide
after taking the suggestions of literature too seriously, Satan offers a
monstrous life. It is monstrous because the seat of the spiritual principle of a man
<br><font color="green">{ms, 880}</font>
<br> is not
transferable<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span>
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">to</span></span> to a material
object. A man only pretends to think his hat more important than his head. That
view of life, I consider, is abnormal &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You cannot call that abnormal which everyone does &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Does everyone jump off the Hill of Howth? Does everyone
join secret societies? Does everyone sacrifice happiness and pleasure and peace
to honour in the world? Father Artifoni told me of a society of mutual
assistance in Italy the members of which had the right to be thrown into the
Arno by their fellow-members on signing a paper proving that their case was past curing &mdash;</p>
<p> At Noblett&apos;s corner, where they always halted, they found Temple
declaiming to a little ring of young men. The young men were laughing very much
at Temple who was very drunk. Stephen kept his eyes fixed on Temple&apos;s
shapeless mouth which at moments was flecked with a thin foam as it strove to
enunciate a difficult word. Cranly stared at
<br><font color="green">{ms, 881}</font>
<br> the group and said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I&apos;ll take my dyin&apos; bible Temple has been
standing those medicals drinks &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The bloody fool! &nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. &mdash;
<br>Temple caught sight of them and at once broke off his discourse to come over
to them. One or two of the medicals followed him.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Good evening, said Temple, fumbling at his cap &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Druncus es</u> &mdash;
<br>The two medicals laughed while Temple began to search his pockets. During the search his mouth fell asunder.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Who has the money? said Cranly &mdash;
<br>The two medicals laughed and nodded towards Temple who desisted from his search disconsolately, saying:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ah, by hell, &nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. I was going to stand a
drink &nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. Ah, by hell!. &nbsp;&nbsp;. Where&apos;s the other
bob I had? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &mdash;
<br>One of the medicals said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You changed it in Connery&apos;s &mdash;
<br>The other medical said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He got stuck in his first today. That&apos;s why he went on the beer tonight &mdash;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 882}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And where did you raise the money? said Cranly to Temple,
who began to search his pockets again &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He popped his watch for ten bob &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It mustn&apos;t be a bad watch, said Cranly, if he got
ten bob on it. Where did he get ten bob? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ah no! said the second medical. I popped it for him. I
know a chap named Larkin in Granby Row &mdash;</p>
<p> The big medical student who had had the political discussion in the
<u>Adelphi</u> with the clerk from the Agricultural Board Office came over to them and said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, Temple, are you going to take us down to the kips? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ah, blazes, said Temple, all my money&apos;s gone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Ah, by hell, I must have a woman &nbsp;&nbsp;.
&nbsp;. By hell, I&apos;ll ask for a woman on tick &mdash;
<br>The big student roared laughing and, turning to Cranly, against whom he had
a grudge on account of the affair in the <u>Adelphi</u>, he said:
<br><font color="green">{ms, 883}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Will you have a woman too, if I stand? &mdash;
<br>Cranly&apos;s chastity was famous but the young men were not quite impressed
by it. At the same time the
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">little</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
group did not betray its opinion by laughing at the big student&apos;s
invitation. Cranly did not answer; and so the second medical student said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Mac got through &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What Mac? said Cranly &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Mac &mdash; you know &mdash; the Gaelic League chap. He
brought us down to the kips last night &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And had you all women? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No &nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What did you go there for? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He suggested we&apos;d walk through. Fine
tarts<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span> there, too.
They were running after us, man: it was fine skit. Ay, and one of them hit Mac
because she said he insulted her &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What did he do? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I don&apos;t know. He said &ldquo;Gellong,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 884}</font>
<br> you dirty <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">whore</span></span>
&apos;hure&rdquo; or something like that &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And what did Mac say? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Said he&apos;d charge her if she followed him any further &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, I&apos;ll stand women all round if Cranly has one,
said the big student who was in the habit of making a single inspiration serve
him for a half-hour&apos;s conversation<a target="foot" id="fyz0145">&ordm;</a> &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ah, by hell, said Temple suddenly, have you heard the new
parable &nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. about the monkeys in Barbary? &nbsp;&nbsp;. Mar
&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. vellous parable &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Flanagan told
me &nbsp;&nbsp;. O, (he said to Stephen) he wants to be introduced to you
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;. wants to know &nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. Fine fellow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;. doesn&apos;t care a damn for religion or priests
&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. By hell, I&apos;m a freethinker &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What is the parable? said Stephen &mdash;</p>
<p> Temple took off his cap and, bareheaded, he began to recite after the
fashion of a country priest, prolonging all the vowels
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">and</span></span></span></span>{sup>{small>1|</small></sup>
jerking out the phrases, and dropping his voice at every
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">pause:</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Dearly beloved Brethren: There was
<br><font color="green">{ms, 885}</font>
<br> once a tribe of monkeys in Barbary And &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;. these
monkeys were as numerous as the sands of the sea. They lived together in the
woods in polygamous &nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. intercourse &nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. and
reproduced &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;. their species. &nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. But,
behold, there came into Barbary &nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. the holy missionaries, the
holy men of God &nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. to redeem the people of Barbary. And these
holy men preached to the people &nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. and then &nbsp;&nbsp;.
&nbsp;. they went into the woods &nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. far away into the woods
&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. to pray to God. And they lived as hermits &nbsp;&nbsp;.
&nbsp;. in the woods &nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. and praying to God. And, behold, the
monkeys of Barbary who were in the trees &nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. saw these holy
men living as hermits &nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. as lonely hermits &nbsp;&nbsp;.
&nbsp;. praying to God. And the monkeys
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">(</span></span>who, my dearly
beloved brethren<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">)</span></span>,
are imitative creatures &nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. began to imitate the actions
&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. of these holy men &nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. and began to do
likewise. And so &nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. they
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">left
their wives</span></span> <font color="black">separated from one
another</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &nbsp;. and went away
<br><font color="green">{ms, 886}</font>
<br> far away, to pray to God &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and they did as they
had seen the holy men do &nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. and prayed to God
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And &nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. they did not return
&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. any more &nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. nor try to reproduce the
species &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And so &nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. gradually
&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. these po &nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. or monkeys &nbsp;&nbsp;.
&nbsp;. grew fewer and fewer &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and fewer and
fewer &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And today. &nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. there is no monkey in all Barbary &mdash;</p>
<p class="flush">Temple crossed himself and replaced his hat while the audience
began to clap their hands together. Just then a policeman moved on the group. Stephen said to Cranly:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Who is this Flanagan? &mdash;
<br>Cranly did not answer but followed Temple and his companions, walking
emphatically and saying &ldquo;&apos;M, yes&rdquo; to himself. They could hear
Temple bemoaning his poverty to his companions and repeating snatches of his parable.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Who is this Flanagan? said Stephen again to Cranly &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Another bloody fool, said Cranly in a tone which
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">left</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
the comparison open &mdash;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 887}</font> </p>
<p class="spfl">A few days later Cranly went to Wicklow. Stephen spent his
summer with Maurice. He told his brother what troubles he anticipated when the
college term reopened and together they discussed plans for living. Maurice
suggested that the verses should be sent to a publisher.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I cannot send them to a publisher, said Stephen, because I have burned them &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Burned them! &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, said Stephen curtly, they were romantic &mdash;</p>
<p> In the end they decided that it would be best to wait until Mr Fulham made
his intentions known. Mrs Daedalus called one day to see Father Butt. She did
not report her interview fully but Stephen understood that Father Butt had
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">at
first</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> prescribed a
clerkship in Guinness&apos;s as a solution of the young man&apos;s difficult
case and, when Mrs Daedalus had shaken her head incredulously, he had asked to
see Stephen. He had thrown out hints about some new arrangement
<br><font color="green">{ms, 888}</font>
<br> of the college which would necessitate new appointments. These hints were
fed upon by Stephen&apos;s parents. The next day Stephen called to the college to see Father Butt.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, come in,
<a name="jn1038g" href="../../FF/unbs/jn1all.htm#jn1038g">my dear boy, said
Father Butt</a> when Stephen appeared at the door of the little uncarpeted bedroom &mdash;</p>
<p> Father Butt began to talk a great deal about general topics, without saying
anything definite but asking Stephen over and over again for an expression of
opinion which was always studiously withheld. The young man was very much
bewildered. At last, after much rubbing of his chin and many blinkings of the
eyes, Father Butt asked what were Stephen&apos;s intentions &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Literature, said Stephen &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, yes &nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. of course &nbsp;&nbsp;.
&nbsp;. but meanwhile, I mean, &nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. of course you will continue
your course until you have got a degree &mdash; that is the important point &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I may not be able, said Stephen
<br><font color="green">{ms, 889}</font>
<br> I suppose you know that my father is unable to &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Now, said Father Butt joyfully, I&apos;m so glad
you&apos;ve come to the point &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. That is just it. The
question is whether we can find anything for you to enable you to finish your course here. That is the question &mdash;
<br>Stephen said nothing. He was convinced that Father Butt had some offer or
suggestion to make but he was determined not to help him in bringing it out.
Father Butt continued blinking his eyes and rubbing his chin and murmuring to
himself &ldquo;That is the difficulty, you see&rdquo;. In the end, as Stephen
held his peace sacredly, Father Butt said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; There might be &nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. it has just occurred
to me &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. an appointment here in the college. One or
two hours a day &nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. that would be nothing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I think, yes &nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. we shall be
&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. let me see now &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It would be no
trouble to you &nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. no teaching or drudgery, just an hour or so
in the office here in the morning &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen said nothing. Father Butt rubbed his hands together and said:
<br><font color="green">{ms, 890}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Otherwise there would be a danger of your perishing
&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. by inanition &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Yes, a
capital idea &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I shall speak to Father Dillon this very night &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen, somewhat taken by surprise though he had anticipated some such
proposal, murmured his thanks and Father Butt promised to send him a letter in the course of a day or two.</p>
<p> Stephen did not give a very full account of this interview to his father and
mother: he said that Father Butt had been vague and had suggested that he should
look for tuitions. Mr Daedalus thought this a highly practical notion:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; If you will only keep your head straight you can get on.
Keep in touch with those chaps, I tell you, those Jesuits: they can get you on
fast enough. I am a few years older than you &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I am sure they will do their best to help you, said Mrs Daedalus &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I don&apos;t want their help, said Stephen bitterly &mdash;
<br>Mr Daedalus put up his eyeglass
<br><font color="green">{ms, 891}</font>
<br> and stared at his son and at his wife. His wife began an apology:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Give it up, woman, he said. I know the groove he has got
into. But he&apos;s not going to fool me nor his godfather, either. With the
help of God I won&apos;t be long till I let <u>him</u> know what a bloody nice
atheist this fellow has turned out. Hold hard now a moment and leave it to me &mdash;
<br>Stephen answered that he did not want his godfather&apos;s help either.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I know the groove you&apos;re in, said his father.
Didn&apos;t I see you the morning of your poor sister&apos;s funeral &mdash;
don&apos;t forget that? Unnatural bloody ruffian. By Christ I was ashamed of you
that morning. You couldn&apos;t behave like a gentleman or talk or do a bloody
thing only slink over in a corner with the hearse-drivers and mutes, by
God.<a target="foot" id="fyz0146">&ordm;</a> Who taught you to drink pints of
plain porter, might I ask? Is that considered the proper thing for an a &nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. artist to do? &mdash;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 892}</font>
<br>
<br>Stephen clasped his hands together and looked across at Maurice who was convulsed with laughter.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What are you laughing at? said his father. Everyone knows
you&apos;re only this fellow&apos;s jackal &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Stephen was thirsty, said Maurice &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; By
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">god</span></span> God, he&apos;ll
be hungry as well as thirsty one of these days, if you ask me &mdash;</p>
<p class="SpPar">Stephen gave details of his interview to Maurice:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Don&apos;t you think they are trying to buy me? he asked &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, that&apos;s evident. But I&apos;m surprised at one
thing &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What is that? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That the priest lost his temper when speaking to Mother.
You must have annoyed the good man a great deal &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; How do you know he lost his temper? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, he must have when he suggested to her to put you on
the books of a brewery. That gave the show away. Anyhow we can see what right
these men have to call
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><font color="black">themselves</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font>
spiritual counsellors of their flocks &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes? &mdash;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 893}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; They can do nothing for a case like yours which presents
certain difficulties of temperament. You might as well apply to a policeman &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Perhaps his notion was that my mind was in such a state
of disorder that even routine would do it good &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I don&apos;t think that was his notion. Besides they must
all be liars in that case for they have all expressed great admiration for your
clearness in argument. A man&apos;s mind is not in intellectual disorder because
it refuses assent to the doctrine of the Blessed Trinity &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; By the way, said Stephen, do you notice what
understanding and sympathy
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">exists</span></span> exist between me and my parents? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Isn&apos;t it charming? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yet, there are plenty of people who would consider them
my best friends for
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">a</span></span> having advised me
as they have done. It seems absurd to call them enemies or to denounce them.
They want me to secure what they consider happiness. They would like me to
accept anything in the way of money at whatever a cost to myself &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And will you accept? &mdash;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 894}</font>
</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; If Cranly were here I know how he would put that question &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; How &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; &ldquo;Of course, you will accept?&rdquo; &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I have already told you my opinion of that young gentleman, said Maurice tartly &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Lynch, too, would say &ldquo;You&apos;d be a damn fool if
you didn&apos;t take it&rdquo; &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And what will you do? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Refuse it, of course &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I expected you would &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; How could I take it? asked Stephen in astonishment &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Not well, I suppose &mdash;</p>
<p> The following day a letter arrived for Stephen:</p>
<p class="set">Dear Mr Daedalus,
<br> I have spoken to our President <u>re</u> what we discussed a few days ago.
He is greatly interested in your case and would like to see you at the College
any day this week between 2 and 3. He thinks it may be possible to find
something for you such as I suggested &mdash; a few
<br><font color="green">{ms, 895}</font>
<br> hours or so daily &mdash; to enable you to <u>continue your studies</u>. That is the main point
<br> Sincerely Yours
<br> D. Butt SJ.</p>
<p> Stephen did not call to see the President but replied to Father Butt by letter:</p>
<p class="set">Dear Father Butt,
<br> Allow me to thank you for your kindness. I am afraid, however, that I
cannot accept your offer. I am sure you will understand that in declining it I
am acting as seems best to me and with every appreciation of the interest you have shown in me.
<br> Sincerely Yours
<br> Stephen Daedalus.</p>
<p class="SpPar">Stephen spent the greater part of his summer on the rocks of
the North Bull. Maurice spent the day there, stretching idly on the rocks or
plunging into the water. Stephen was now on excellent terms with his brother who seemed to have
<br><font color="green">{ms, 896}</font>
<br> forgotten their estrangement. At times Stephen would half clothe himself
and cross to the shallow side of the Bull where he would wander up and down
looking at the children and the nurses. He used to stand to stare at them
sometimes until the ash of his cigarette fell on to his coat but, though he saw
all that was intended, he met no other Lucy: and he usually returned to the
Liffey side, somewhat amused at his dejection and thinking that if he had made
his proposal to Lucy instead of to Emma he might have met with better luck. But
as often as not he encountered dripping Christian Brothers or disguised
policemen, apparitions which assured him<a target="foot" id="fyz0147">&ordm;</a>
that whether Lucy or Emma was in question the answer was all one. The two
brothers walked home from Dollymount together. They were both a little
ragged-looking but they did not envy the trim dressed clerks
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">that</span></span> who passed them
on their way home. When they came to Mr Wilkinson&apos;s house they both paused
outside to listen for <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the</span></span> sounds of wrangling
<br><font color="green">{ms, 897}</font>
<br> and even when all seemed peaceful Maurice&apos;s first questions to his
mother when she opened the door was &ldquo;Is he in?&rdquo;. When the answer was
&ldquo;No&rdquo; they both went down to the kitchen together but when the answer
was &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; Stephen only went down, Maurice listening over the
banisters to judge from his father&apos;s tones whether he was sober or not. If
his father was drunk Maurice retired to his bedroom but Stephen, who was
untroubled, discoursed gaily with his father. Their conversation always began:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well (in a tone of extreme sarcasm) might I ask where were you all day? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; At the <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">bull</span></span> Bull &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O (in a mollified tone). Had a dip? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, there&apos;s some sense in that. I like to see
that. So long as you keep away from those <u>canaille</u> (in a suspicious tone)
Sure you weren&apos;t with Knickerbockers or some of those noblemen? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Quite sure &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That&apos;s all right. That&apos;s all I want.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 898}</font>
<br> Keep away from them &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Was Maurice with you? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Where is he? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Upstairs, I think &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Why doesn&apos;t he come down here? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I don&apos;t know &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Hm &nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;. (again in a tone of ruminative
sarcasm) By God, you&apos;re a loving pair of sons, you and your brother! &mdash;</p>
<p> Lynch pronounced Stephen all the asses in Christendom for having declined the Jesuits&apos; offers:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Look at the nights you could have had! &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You are a distressingly low-minded person, answered
Stephen. After all I have dinned into that mercantile head of yours you are sure
to come out on me with some atrocity &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But why did you refuse? said Lynch &mdash;</p>
<p> The summer was nearly at an end and the evening had grown a little chilly.
Lynch was walking up and down the Library porch with his hands in his pockets
and his chest well protruded. Stephen kept at his side:
<br><font color="green">{ms, 899}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I am a young man, isn&apos;t that so? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That &mdash; is &mdash; so &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Very well. My entire aptitude is for the composition of
prose and verse. Isn&apos;t that so? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Let us suppose it is &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Very good. I was not intended to be a clerk in a brewery &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I think it would be very dangerous to put you in a
brewery &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;. sometimes &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I was not intended for that: that is enough. I went to
this University day-school in order to meet men of a like age and temper
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You know what I met &mdash;
<br> Lynch nodded his head in despair:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I found a day-school full of terrorised boys, banded
together in a complicity of diffidence. They have eyes only for their future
jobs: to secure their future jobs they will write themselves in and out of
convictions, toil and labour to insinuate themselves into the good graces of the
Jesuits. They adore Jesus and Mary and Joseph: they believe in the infallibility
of the Pope and in all his obscene, stinking<a target="foot" id="fyz0148">&ordm;</a>
<br><font color="green">{ms, 900}</font>
<br> hells; they desire the millennium which is to be
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">a</span></span> the season for
glorified believers and fried atheists &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Sweet Lord
Almighty! Look at that beautiful pale sky! Do you feel the cool wind on your
face? Listen to
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">my
voice</span></span> <font color="black">our
voices</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> here in the
porch &mdash; not because
<font color="red"><sup><small>|1</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">it
is</span></span> <font color="black">they
are</font><font color="red"><sup><small>1|</small></sup></font> mine or yours
but because they are human voices: and doesn&apos;t all that tomfoolery fall off
you like water off a duck&apos;s back? &mdash;
<br> Lynch nodded his head and Stephen continued:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It is absurd that I should go crawling and cringing and
praying and begging to mummers who are themselves no more than beggars. Can we
not root this pest out of our minds and out of our society that men may be able
to walk through the streets without meeting some old stale belief or hypocrisy
at every street corner? I, at least, will try. I will not accept anything from
them. I will not take service under them. I will not submit to them,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 901}</font>
<br> either outwardly or inwardly. A Church is not a fixture like Gibraltar: no
more is an institution. Subtract its human members from it and its solidity
becomes less evident. I, at least, will subtract myself: and remember that if we
allow a dozen for one&apos;s progeny the subtraction of oneself may mean a loss
to the Church of 12<sup>n</sup></font> members &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Aren&apos;t you rather liberal about the progeny? said Lynch &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Did I tell you I met Father Healy this evening? asked Stephen &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, where? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I was walking along the Canal with my Danish grammar
(because I am going to study it properly now &nbsp;&nbsp;. I&apos;ll tell you
why later on) and whom should I meet but this little man. He was walking right
into the golden sunset: all his creases and
wrinkles<a target="foot" id="fyz0149">&ordm;</a> were scattered with gold. He
looked at my book and said it was very interesting: he thought it must
<br><font color="green">{ms, 902}</font>
<br> be so interesting to know and compare the different languages. Then he
looked far away into the golden sun and all of a sudden &mdash; imagine! &mdash;
his mouth opened and he gave a slow, noiseless yawn &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Do you know you get a kind of shock when a man does a thing like that unexpectedly? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He&apos;ll have something to do shortly, said Lynch
pointing to a little group which was laughing and chatting in the doorway, and
that&apos;ll keep him from walking in his sleep &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen glanced over at the group. Emma and Moynihan and McCann and two of
the Miss Daniels were evidently in high spirits.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, I suppose she will do it legitimately one of these
days, said
