<p> At last after a fury of plunges he wrenched himself free. His tormentors set
off towards Jones&apos;s Road, laughing and jeering at him, while he, torn and
flushed and panting, stumbled after then,<a target="foot" id="fzz0033">&ordm;</a> half blinded with
<br><font color="green">{ms, 47}</font>
<br> tears,<a target="foot" id="fzz0034">&ordm;</a> clenching his fists madly and sobbing.</p>
<p> While he was still repeating the CONFITEOR amid the indulgent laughter of
his hearers and while the scenes of that malignant episode were still passing
sharply and swiftly before his mind he wondered why he bore no malice now to
those who had tormented him. He had not forgotten a whit of their cowardice and
cruelty but the memory of it called forth no anger from him. All the
descriptions of fierce love and hatred which he had met in books had seemed to
him therefore unreal. Even that night as he stumbled homewards along
Jones&apos;s Road he had felt that some power was divesting him of that
sudden-woven anger as easily as a fruit is divested of her<a target="foot" id="fzz0035">&ordm;</a> soft ripe peel.</p>
<p> He remained standing with his two companions at the end of the shed,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 48}</font>
<br> listening idly to their talk or to the bursts of applause in the theatre.
She was sitting there among the others, perhaps waiting for him to appear. He
tried to recall her appearance but could not. He could remember only that she
had worn a shawl about her head like a cowl and that her dark eyes had invited
and unnerved him. He wondered had he been in her thoughts as she had been in
his. Then in the dark and unseen by the other two he rested the tips of the
fingers of one hand upon the palm of the other hand, scarcely touching it
lightly. But the pressure of her fingers had been lighter and steadier: and
suddenly the memory of their touch traversed his brain and body like an invisible warm wave.</p>
<p> A boy came towards them, running along under the shed. He was excited
<br><font color="green">{ms, 49}</font>
<br> and breathless.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, Dedalus &mdash; he cried &mdash; Doyle is in a great
bake about you. You&apos;re to go in at once and get dressed for the play. Hurry up, you better &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He&apos;s coming now &mdash; said Heron to the messenger
with a haughty drawl &mdash; when he wants to &mdash;</p>
<p> The boy turned to Heron and repeated:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But Doyle is in an awful bake &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Will you tell Doyle with my best compliments that I damned his eyes? &mdash; answered Heron.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, I must go now &mdash; said Stephen, who cared little for such points of honour.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I wouldn&apos;t &mdash; said Heron &mdash; damn me if I
would. That&apos;s no way to send for one of the senior boys. In a bake, indeed!
I think it&apos;s quite enough that you&apos;re taking a part in his bally old play &mdash;</p>
<p> This spirit of quarrelsome
<br><font color="green">{ms, 50}</font>
<br> comradeship which he had observed lately in his rival had not seduced
Stephen from his habits of quiet obedience. He mistrusted the turbulence and
doubted the sincerity of such comradeship which seemed to him a sorry
anticipation of manhood. The question of honour here raised was, like all such
questions, trivial to him. While his mind had been pursuing its intangible
phantoms and turning back in
irresoluteness<a target="foot" id="fzz0036">&ordm;</a> from such pursuit he had
heard about him the constant voices of his father and of his masters, urging him
to be a gentleman above all things and urging him to be a good catholic above
all things. These voices had now come to be hollow-sounding in his ears. When
the gymnasium had been opened he had heard another voice urging him to be strong
and manly and healthy and when the movement towards national revival had begun to be felt in the college yet
<br><font color="green">{ms, 51}</font>
<br> another voice had bidden him be true to his country and help to raise up
her language and tradition. In the profane world, as he foresaw, a worldly voice
would bid him raise up his father&apos;s fallen state by his labours and,
meanwhile, the voice of his school comrades urged him to be a decent fellow, to
shield others from blame or to beg them off and to do his best to get free days
for the school. And it was the din of all these hollow-sounding voices that made
him halt irresolutely in the pursuit of phantoms. He gave them ear only for a
time but he was happy only when he was far from them, beyond their call, alone
or in the company of phantasmal comrades.</p>
<p> In the vestry a plump fresh-faced jesuit and an elderly man, in shabby blue
clothes, were dabbling in a case of paints and chalks. The boys who had been
painted walked about or stood still awkwardly, touching their faces in a gingerly fashion
<br><font color="green">{ms, 52}</font>
<br> with their furtive fingertips. In the middle of the vestry a young jesuit,
who was then on a visit to the college, stood rocking himself rhythmically from
the tips of his toes to his heels and back again, his hands thrust well forward
into his side-pockets. His small head set off with glossy red curls and his
newly shaven face agreed well with the spotless decency of his soutane and with his spotless shoes.</p>
<p> As he watched this swaying form and tried to read for himself the legend of
the priest&apos;s mocking smile there came into Stephen&apos;s memory a saying
which he had heard from his father before he had been sent to Clongowes, that
you could always tell a jesuit by the style of his clothes. At the same moment
he thought he saw a likeness between his father&apos;s mind and that of this
smiling well-dressed priest: and he was aware of some desecration of the priest&apos;s office or of the vestry
<br><font color="green">{ms, 53}</font>
<br> itself whose silence was now routed by loud talk and joking and its air
pungent with the smells of the gas-jets and the grease.</p>
<p> While his forehead was being wrinkled and his jaws painted black and blue by
the elderly man, he listened distractedly to the voice of the plump young jesuit
which bade him speak up and make his points clearly. He could hear the band
playing <u>The Lily of Killarney</u> and knew that in a few moments the curtain
would go up. He felt no stage fright but the thought of the part he had to play
humiliated him. A remembrance of some of his lines made a sudden flush rise to
his painted cheeks. He saw her serious alluring eyes watching him from among the
audience and their image at once swept away his scruples, leaving his will
compact. Another nature seemed to have been lent him: the infection of the
excitement and youth about him entered into and transformed his moody
<br><font color="green">{ms, 54}</font>
<br> mistrustfulness. For one rare moment he seemed to be clothed in the real
apparel of boyhood: and, as he stood in the wings among the other players, he
shared the common mirth amid which the drop scene was hauled upwards by two
able-bodied priests with violent jerks and all awry.</p>
<p> A few moments after he found himself on the stage amid the garish gas and
the dim scenery, acting before the innumerable faces of the void. It surprised
him to see that the play which he had known at rehearsals for a disjointed
lifeless thing had suddenly assumed a life of its own. It seemed now to play
itself, he and his fellow actors aiding it with their parts. When the curtain
fell on the last scene he heard the void filled with applause and, through a
rift in a side scene, saw the simple body before which he had acted magically deformed, the
<br><font color="green">{ms, 55}</font>
<br> void of faces breaking at all points and falling asunder into busy groups.</p>
<p> He left the stage quickly and rid himself of his mummery and passed out
through the chapel into the college garden. Now that the play was over his
nerves cried for some further adventure. He hurried onwards as if to overtake
it. The doors of the theatre were all open and the audience had emptied out. On
the lines which he had fancied the moorings of an ark a few lanterns swung in
the night breeze, flickering cheerlessly. He mounted the steps from the garden
in haste, eager that some prey should not elude him, and forced his way through
the crowd in the hall and past the two jesuits who stood watching the exodus and
bowing and shaking hands with the visitors. He pushed onward nervously, feigning
a still greater haste and faintly conscious of the smiles and
<br><font color="green">{ms, 56}</font>
<br> stares and nudges which his powdered head left in its wake.</p>
<p> When he came out on the steps he saw his family waiting for him at the first
lamp. In a glance he noted that every figure of the group was familiar and ran down the steps angrily.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I have to leave a message down in George&apos;s Street
&mdash;, he said to his father quickly &mdash; I&apos;ll be home after you &mdash;</p>
<p> Without waiting for his father&apos;s questions he ran across the road and
began to walk at breakneck speed down the hill. He hardly knew where he was
walking. Pride and hope and desire like crushed herbs in his heart sent up
vapours of maddening incense before the eyes of his mind. He strode down the
hill amid the tumult of sudden-risen vapours of wounded pride and fallen hope
and baffled desire. They streamed upwards before his anguished eyes in
<br><font color="green">{ms, 57}</font>
<br> dense and maddening fumes and passed away above him till at last the air was clear and cold again.</p>
<p> A film still veiled his eyes but they burned no longer. A power, akin to
that which had often made anger or resentment fall from him, brought his steps
to rest. He stood still and gazed up at the sombre porch of the morgue and from
that to the dark cobbled laneway at its side. He saw the word $eLotts</u> on the
wall of the lane and breathed slowly the rank heavy air.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That is horse piss and rotted straw &mdash; he thought
&mdash; It is a good odour to breathe. It will calm my heart. My heart is quite calm now. I will go back &mdash;</p>
<p class="set">xxx</p>
<p> Stephen was once again seated beside his father in
<br><font color="green">{ms, 58}</font>
<br> the corner of a railway carriage at Kingsbridge. He was travelling with his
father by the night mail to Cork. As the train steamed out of the station he
recalled his childish wonder of years before and every event of his first day at
Clongowes. But he felt no wonder now. He saw the darkening lands slipping away
past him, the silent telegraph-poles passing his window swiftly every four
seconds, the little glimmering stations, manned by a few silent sentries, flung
by the mail behind her and twinkling for a moment in the darkness like fiery grains flung backwards by a runner.</p>
<p> He listened without sympathy to his father&apos;s evocation of Cork and of
scenes of his youth, a tale broken by sighs or draughts from his pocket flask
whenever the image of some dead friend appeared in it or whenever the
evoker<a target="foot" id="fzz0037">&ordm;</a> remembered suddenly the purpose
of his actual visit. Stephen heard but could feel no pity. The images of the dead were
<br><font color="green">{ms, 59}</font>
<br> all strangers to him save that of uncle Charles, an image which had lately
been fading out of memory. He knew, however, that his father&apos;s property was
going to be sold by auction, and in the manner of his own dispossession he felt
the world give the lie rudely to his phantasy.</p>
<p> At Maryborough he fell asleep. When he awoke the train had passed out of
Mallow and his father was stretched asleep on the other seat. The cold light of
the dawn lay over the country, over the unpeopled fields and the closed
cottages. The terror of sleep fascinated his mind as he watched the silent
country or heard from time to time his father&apos;s deep breath or sudden
sleepy movement. The neighbourhood of unseen sleepers filled him with strange
dread, as though they could harm him, and he prayed that the day might come
quickly. His prayer, addressed neither to God nor saint, began with
<br><font color="green">{ms, 60}</font>
<br> a shiver, as the chilly morning breeze crept through the chink of the
carriage door to his feet, and ended in a trail of foolish words which he made
to fit the insistent rhythm of the train; and silently, at intervals of four
seconds, the telegraph-poles held the galloping notes of the music between
punctual bars. This furious music allayed his dread and, leaning against the
windowledge, he let his eyelids close again.</p>
<p> They reached Cork when it was still early morning and Stephen finished his
sleep in a bedroom of the Victoria Hotel. The bright warm sunlight streaming
through the window and he could hear the din of traffic. His father was standing
before the dressingtable, examining his hair and face and moustache with great
care, craning his neck across the water-jug and drawing it back sideways to see the better.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 61}</font>
<br> While he did so he sang softly to himself with quaint accent and phrasing:</p>
<p class="set">&apos;Tis youth and folly
<br> Makes young men marry,
<br> So here, my love, I&apos;ll
<br> No longer stay.
<br> What can&apos;t be cured, sure,
<br> Must be injured, sure,
<br> So I&apos;ll go to
<br> Amerikay.</p>
<p class="set">My love she&apos;s handsome,
<br> My love she&apos;s boney:
<br> She&apos;s like good whisky
<br> When it is new;
<br> But when &apos;tis old
<br> And growing cold
<br> It fades and dies like
<br> The mountain dew.</p>
<p> The consciousness of the warm sunny city outside his window and the tender
tremors with which his father&apos;s voice festooned the strange sad happy air,
drove off all the mists of the night&apos;s ill humour from Stephen&apos;s
brain. He got up quickly to dress and, when the song had ended, said:
<br><font color="green">{ms, 62}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That&apos;s much prettier than any of your other <u>come-all-you</u>s &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do you think so? &mdash; asked Mr Dedalus.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I like it &mdash; said Stephen.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It&apos;s a pretty old air &mdash; said Mr Dedalus,
twirling the points of his moustache &mdash; Ah, but you should have heard Mick
Lacy sing it! Poor Mick Lacy! He had little turns for it, grace notes that he
used to put in that I haven&apos;t got. That was the
boy<a target="foot" id="fzz0038">&ordm;</a> could sing a <u>come-all-you</u>, if you like. &mdash;</p>
<p> Mr Dedalus had ordered drisheens for breakfast and during the meal he
cross-examined the waiter for local news. For the most part they spoke at cross
purposes when a name was mentioned, the waiter having in mind the present holder
and Mr Dedalus his father or perhaps his grandfather.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, I hope they haven&apos;t moved the Queen&apos;s
College anyhow &mdash; said Mr Dedalus &mdash; for I want to show it to
<br><font color="green">{ms, 63}</font>
<br> this youngster of mine &mdash;</p>
<p> Along the Mardyke the trees were in bloom. They entered the grounds of the
college and were led by the garrulous porter across the quadrangle. But their
progress across the gravel was brought to a halt after every dozen or so paces by some reply of the porter&apos;s:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ah, do you tell me so? And is poor Pottlebelly dead? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, sir. Dead, sir &mdash;</p>
<p> During these halts Stephen stood awkwardly behind the two men, weary of the
subject and waiting restlessly for the slow march to begin again. By the time
they had crossed the quadrangle his restlessness had risen to fever. He wondered
how his father, whom he knew for a shrewd suspicious man, could be duped by the
servile manners of the porter; and the lively southern speech which had entertained him all the
<br><font color="green">{ms, 64}</font>
<br> morning now irritated his ears.</p>
<p> They passed into the anatomy theatre where Mr Dedalus, the porter aiding
him, searched the desks for his initials. Stephen remained in the background,
depressed more than ever by the darkness and silence of the theatre and by the
air it wore of jaded and formal study. On the desk he read the word
<u>Foetus</u> cut several times in the dark stained wood. The sudden legend
startled his blood: he seemed to feel the absent students of the college about
him and to shrink from their company. A vision of their life, which his
father&apos;s words had been powerless to evoke, sprang up before him out of the
word cut in the desk. A broad-shouldered student with a moustache was cutting in
the letters with a jack-knife, seriously. Other
<br><font color="green">{ms, 65}</font>
<br> students stood or sat near him laughing at his handiwork. One jogged his
elbow. The big student turned on him, frowning. He was dressed in loose grey clothes and had tan boots.</p>
<p> Stephen&apos;s name was called. He hurried down the steps of the theatre so
as to be as far away from the vision as he could be and, peering closely at his
father&apos;s initials, hid his flushed face.</p>
<p> But the word and the vision capered before his eyes as he walked back across
the quadrangle and towards the college gate. It shocked him to find in the outer
world a trace of what he had deemed till then a brutish and individual malady of
his own mind. His monstrous reveries came thronging into his memory. They too
had sprung up before him, suddenly and furiously, out
<br><font color="green">{ms, 66}</font>
<br> of mere words. He had soon given in to them and allowed them to sweep
across and abase his intellect, wondering always where they came from, from what
den of monstrous images, and always weak and humble towards others, restless and
sickened of himself when they had swept over him.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ay, bedad! And there&apos;s the Groceries sure enough!
cried Mr Dedalus &mdash; You often heard me speak of the Groceries, didn&apos;t
you, Stephen. Many&apos;s the time we went down there when our names had been
marked, a crowd of us, Harry Peard and little Jack Mountain and Bob Dyas and
Maurice Moriarty, the Frenchman, and Tom O&apos;Grady and Mick Lacey that I told
you of this morning and Joey Corbet and poor little good-hearted Johnny Keevers of the Tantiles &mdash;</p>
<p> The leaves of the trees along the Mardyke were astir and whispering in the sunlight. A team of
<br><font color="green">{ms, 67}</font>
<br> cricketers passed, agile young men in flannels and blazers, one of them
carrying the long green wicket-bag. In a quiet bystreet a German band of five
players in faded uniforms and with battered brass instruments was playing to an
audience of street arabs and leisurely messenger boys. A maid in a white cap and
apron was watering a box of plants on a sill which shone like a slab of
limestone in the warm glare. From another window open to the air came the sound
of a piano, scale after scale rising into the treble.</p>
<p> Stephen walked on at his father&apos;s side, listening to stories he had
heard before, hearing again the names of the scattered and dead revellers who
had been the companions of his father&apos;s youth. And a faint sickness sighed
in his heart. He recalled his own equivocal position in Belvedere, a free boy, a
leader afraid of his own authority, proud
<br><font color="green">{ms, 68}</font>
<br> and sensitive and suspicious, battling against the squalor of his life and
against the riot of his mind. The letters cut in the stained wood of the desk
stared upon him, mocking his bodily weakness and futile enthusiasms and making
him loathe himself for his own mad and filthy orgies. The spittle in his throat
grew bitter and foul to swallow and the faint sickness climbed to his brain so
that for a moment he closed his eyes and walked on in darkness.</p>
<p> He could still hear his father&apos;s voice.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; When you kick out for yourself, Stephen, (as I daresay
you will one of those days) remember, whatever you do, to mix with gentlemen.
When I was a young fellow I tell you I enjoyed myself. I mixed with fine decent
fellows. Everyone of us could do something. One fellow had a good voice, another
<br><font color="green">{ms, 69}</font>
<br> fellow was a good actor, another could sing a good comic song, another was
a good oarsman or a good racket-player, another could tell a good story and so
on. We kept the ball rolling anyhow and enjoyed ourselves and saw a bit of life
and we were none the worse of it either. But we were all gentlemen, Stephen (at
least I hope we were) and bloody good honest Irishmen too. That&apos;s the kind
of fellows I want you to associate with, fellows of the right kidney. I&apos;m
talking to you as a friend, Stephen. I don&apos;t believe a son should be afraid
of his father. No, I treat you as your grandfather treated me when I was a young
chap. We were more like brothers than father and son. I&apos;ll never forget the
first day he caught me smoking. I was standing at the end of the South Terrace one day
<br><font color="green">{ms, 70}</font>
<br> with some maneens like myself and sure we thought we were grand fellows
because we had pipes stuck in the corners of our mouths. Suddenly the governor
passed. He didn&apos;t say a word, or stop even. But the next day, Sunday, we
were out for a walk together and when we were coming home he took out his cigar
case and said: By the by, Simon, I didn&apos;t know you smoked: or something
like that. Of course I tried to carry it off as best I could: If you want a good
smoke<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">:</span></span> &mdash; he
said &mdash; try one of these cigars. An American captain made me a present of them last night in Queenstown &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen heard his father&apos;s voice break into a laugh which was almost a sob.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He was the handsomest man in Cork at that time, by God he
was! The women used to stand to look after him
<br><font color="green">{ms, 71}</font>
<br> in the street &mdash;</p>
<p> He heard the sob passing loudly down his father&apos;s throat and opened his
eyes with a nervous impulse. The sunlight breaking suddenly on his sight turned
the sky and clouds into a fantastic world of sombre masses with lakelike spaces
of dark rosy light. His very brain was sick and powerless. He could scarcely
interpret the letters of the signboards of the shops. By his monstrous way of
life he seemed to have put himself beyond the limits of reality. Nothing moved
him or spoke to him from the real world unless he heard in it an echo of the
infuriated cries within him. He could respond to no earthly or human appeal,
dumb and insensible to the call of summer and gladness and companionship,
wearied and dejected by his father&apos;s voice. He could scarcely recognize as his own thoughts: and
<br><font color="green">{ms, 72}</font>
<br> repeated slowly to himself:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I am Stephen Dedalus. I am walking beside my father whose
name is Simon Dedalus. We are in Cork, in Ireland. Cork is a city. Our room is
in the Victoria Hotel. Victoria and Stephen and Simon. Simon and Stephen and Victoria. Names &mdash;</p>
<p> The memory of his childhood suddenly grew dim. He tried to call forth some
of its vivid moments but could not. He recalled only names. Dante, Parnell,
Clane, Clongowes. A little boy had been taught geography by an old woman who
kept two brushes in her wardrobe. Then he had been sent away from home to a
college, he had made his first communion and eaten slim jim out of his cricket
cap and watched the firelight leaping and dancing on the wall of a little bedroom in the infirmary and dreamed of being
<br><font color="green">{ms, 73}</font>
<br> dead, of mass being said for him by the rector in a black and gold cope, of
being buried then in the little graveyard of the community off the main avenue
of chestnuts<a target="foot" id="fzz0039">&ordm;</a>. But he had not died then.
Parnell had died. There had been no mass for the dead in the chapel and no
procession. He had not died but he had faded out like a film in the sun. He had
been lost or had wandered out of existence for he no longer existed. How strange
to think of him passing out of existence in such a way, not by death but by
fading out in the sun or by being lost and forgotten somewhere in the universe!
It was strange to see his small body appear again for a moment: a little boy in
a grey belted suit. His hands were in his side-pockets and his trousers were tucked in at the knees by elastic
<br><font color="green">{ms, 74}</font>
<br> bands.</p>
<p> On the evening of the day on which the property was sold Stephen followed
his father meekly about the city from bar to bar. To the sellers in the market,
to the barmen and barmaids, to the beggars who importuned him for a lob Mr
Dedalus told the same tale, that he was an old Corkonian, that he had been
trying for thirty years to get rid of his Cork accent up in Dublin and that
Peter Pickackafox<a target="foot" id="fzz0040">&ordm;</a> beside him was his
eldest son but that he was only a Dublin jackeen.</p>
<p> They had set out early in the morning from Newcombe&apos;s coffee-house,
where Mr Dedalus&apos;s cup had rattled noisily against its saucer, and Stephen
had tried to cover that shameful sign of his father&apos;s drinking bout of the
night before by moving his chair and coughing. One humiliation had succeeded another:
<br><font color="green">{ms, 75}</font>
<br> the false smiles of the market sellers, the curvetings and oglings of the
barmaids with whom his father flirted, the compliments and encouraging words of
his father&apos;s friends. They had told him that he had a great look of his
grandfather and Mr Dedalus had agreed that he was an ugly likeness. They had
unearthed traces of a Cork accent in his speech and made him admit that the Lee
was a much finer river than the Liffey. One of them, in order to put his Latin
to the proof, had made him translate short passages from Dilectus and asked him
whether it was correct to say: Tempora mutantur et nos cum illis
mutamur<a target="foot" id="fzz0041">&ordm;</a> or Tempora mutantur et nos
mutamur cum<a target="foot" id="fzz0042">&ordm;</a> illis. Another, a brisk old
man, whom Mr Dedalus called Johnny Cashman, had covered him with confusion by asking him to say which were prettier, the
<br><font color="green">{ms, 76}</font>
<br> Dublin girls or the Cork girls.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He&apos;s not that way built &mdash; said Mr Dedalus
&mdash; Leave him alone. He&apos;s a level-headed thinking boy who doesn&apos;t
bother his head about that kind of nonsense &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Then he&apos;s not his father&apos;s son &mdash; said the little old man.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I don&apos;t know, I&apos;m sure &mdash; said Mr Dedalus, smiling complacently.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Your father &mdash; said the little old man to Stephen
&mdash; was the boldest flirt in the City of Cork in his day. Do you know that? &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen looked down and studied the tiled floor of the bar into which they had drifted.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Now don&apos;t be putting ideas into his head &mdash;
said Mr Dedalus &mdash; Leave him to his Maker &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yerra, sure I wouldn&apos;t put any ideas into his head.
I&apos;m old enough to be his grandfather. And I am a grandfather &mdash; said the little old man to Stephen &mdash; Do
<br><font color="green">{ms, 77}</font>
<br> you know that?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Are you? &mdash; asked Stephen.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Bedad I am &mdash; said the little old man &mdash; I have
two bouncing grandchildren out at Sunday&apos;s Well. Now, then! What age do you
think I am? And I remember seeing your grandfather in his red coat riding out to
hounds. That was before you were born &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ay, or thought of &mdash; said Mr Dedalus.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Bedad I did &mdash; repeated the little old man &mdash;
And, more than that, I can remember even your great-grandfather, old John
Stephen Dedalus, and a fierce old fire-eater he was. Now, then! There&apos;s a memory for you! &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That&apos;s three generations, four generations &mdash;
said another of the company &mdash; Why, Johnny Cashman, you must be nearing the century &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, I&apos;ll tell you the truth &mdash; said the little
<br><font color="green">{ms, 78}</font>
<br> old man &mdash; I&apos;m just twenty-seven years of age.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; We&apos;re as old as we feel, Johnny &mdash; said Mr
Dedalus &mdash; and just finish what you have there and we&apos;ll have another.
Here, Tim or Tom or whatever your name is, give us the same again here. By God,
I don&apos;t feel more than eighteen myself. There&apos;s that son of mine there
not half my age and I&apos;m a better man than he is any day of the week &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Draw it mild now, Dedalus. I think it&apos;s about time
for you to take a back seat &mdash; said the gentleman who had spoken before.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, by God! &mdash; asserted Mr Dedalus &mdash; I&apos;ll
sing a tenor song against him or I&apos;ll vault a five-barred gate against him
or I&apos;ll run with him after the hounds across the country as I did thirty
years ago along with the Kerry Boy and the best man for
<br><font color="green">{ms, 79}</font>
<br> it &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But he&apos;ll beat you here &mdash;, said the little old
man &mdash; tapping his forehead and raising his glass to drain it &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, I hope he&apos;ll be as good a man as his father.
That&apos;s all I can say &mdash; said Mr Dedalus.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; If he is, he&apos;ll do &mdash; said the little old man.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And thanks be to God, Johnny &mdash; said Mr Dedalus
&mdash; that we lived so long and did so little harm &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But did so much good, Simon &mdash; said the little old
man gravely &mdash; Thanks be to God we lived so long and did so much good &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen watched the three glasses being raised from the counter as his
father and his two cronies drank to the memory of their past. An abyss of
fortune or of temperament sundered him from them. His
<br><font color="green">{ms, 80}</font>
<br> mind seemed older than theirs: it shone coldly on their strifes and
happiness and regrets like a moon upon a younger earth. No life or youth stirred
in him as it had stirred in them. He had
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">n</span></span> known neither the
pleasure of companionship with others nor the vigour of rude male health nor
filial piety. Nothing stirred within his soul but a cold and cruel and loveless
lust. His childhood was dead or lost and with it his soul capable of simple joys
and he was drifting amid life like the barren shell of the moon.</p>
<p class="set"><u>Art thou pale for weariness
<br> Of climbing heaven and gazing on the earth,
<br> Wandering companionless</u>.....?</p>
<p> He repeated to himself the lines of Shelley&apos;s fragment. Its alternation
of sad human ineffectualness<a target="foot" id="fzz0045">&ordm;</a> with
<br><font color="green">{ms, 81}</font>
<br> vast inhuman cycles of activity chilled him and he forgot his own human and ineffectual grieving.</p>
<p class="set">xxx</p>
<p> Stephen&apos;s mother and his brother and one of his cousins waited at the
corner of quiet Foster Place while he and his father went up the steps and along
the colonnade where the highland sentry was parading. When they had passed into
the great hall and stood at the counter Stephen drew forth his orders on the
governor of the bank of Ireland for thirty and three pounds; and these sums, the
moneys of his exhibition and essay prize, were paid over to him rapidly by the teller in
<br><font color="green">{ms, 82}</font>
<br> notes and in coin respectively. He bestowed them in his pockets with
feigned composure and suffered the friendly teller, to whom his father chatted,
to take his hand across the broad counter and wish him a brilliant career in
after life. He was impatient of their voices and could not keep his feet at
rest. But the teller still deferred the serving of others to say that he was
living in changed times and that there was nothing like giving a boy the best
education that money could buy. Mr Dedalus lingered in the hall gazing about him
and up at the roof and telling Stephen, who urged him to come out, that they
were standing in the house of commons of the old Irish parliament</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; God help us! &mdash; he said piously &mdash; to think of
the men of those times, Stephen, Hely Hutchinson and Flood and Henry Grattan
<br><font color="green">{ms, 83}</font>
<br> and Charles Kendal Bushe, and the noblemen we have now, leaders of the
Irish people at home and abroad. Why, by God, they wouldn&apos;t be seen dead in
a ten acre field with them. No, Stephen, old chap, I&apos;m sorry to say that
they are only as I roved out one fine May morning in the merry month of sweet July &mdash;</p>
<p> A keen October wind was blowing round the bank. The three figures standing
at the edge of the muddy path had pinched cheeks and watery eyes. Stephen looked
at his thinly clad mother and remembered that a few days before he had seen a
mantle priced at twenty guineas in the windows of Barnardo&apos;s.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well that&apos;s done. &mdash; said Mr Dedalus.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; We had better go to dinner &mdash; said Stephen &mdash; Where? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Dinner? &mdash; said Mr Dedalus &mdash; Well, I suppose we had better, what? &mdash;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 84}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Some place that&apos;s not too dear &mdash; said Mrs Dedalus.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Underdone&apos;s? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes. Some quiet place &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Come along &mdash; said Stephen quickly &mdash; It doesn&apos;t matter about the dearness.</p>
<p> He walked on before them with short nervous steps, smiling. They tried to
keep up with him, smiling also at his eagerness.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Take it easy like a good young fellow &mdash; said his
father &mdash; We&apos;re not out for the half mile, are we? &mdash;</p>
<p> For a swift season of merrymaking the money of his prizes ran through
Stephen&apos;s fingers. Great parcels of groceries and delicacies and dried
fruits arrived from the city. Every day he drew up a bill of fare for the family
and every night led a party of three or four to the theatre to see
<u>Ingomar</u> or <u>The Lady of Lyons</u>. In his coat pockets he carried squares of Vienna
<br><font color="green">{ms, 85}</font>
<br> chocolate for his guests while his trousers&apos; pocket bulged with masses
of silver and copper coins. He bought presents for everyone, overhauled his
room, wrote out resolutions, marshalled his books up and down their shelves,
pored upon all kinds of price lists, drew up a form of commonwealth for the
household by which every member of it held some office, opened a
loans<a target="foot" id="fzz0046">&ordm;</a> bank for his family and pressed
loans on willing borrowers so that he might have the pleasure of making out
receipts and reckoning the interests on the sums lent. When he could do no more
he drove up and down the city in trams. Then the season of pleasure came to an
end. The pot of pink enamel paint gave out and the wainscot of his bedroom
remained with its unfinished and ill-plastered coat.</p>
<p> His household returned to its usual way of life. His mother had no further
occasion to upbraid him for squandering his money.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 86}</font>
<br> He too returned to his old life at school and all his novel enterprises
fell to pieces. The commonwealth fell, the
loans<a target="foot" id="fzz0047">&ordm;</a> bank closed its coffers and its
books on a sensible loss, the rules of life which he had drawn about himself fell into desuetude.</p>
<p> How foolish his aim had been! He had tried to build a break-water of order
and elegance against the sordid tide of life without him and to dam up, by rules
of conduct and active interest and new filial relations, the powerful recurrence
of the tides within him. Useless. From without as from within the waters had
flowed over his barriers: their tides began once more to jostle fiercely above the crumbled mole.</p>
<p> He saw clearly too his own futile isolation. He had not gone one step nearer
the lives he had sought to approach nor bridged the restless
<br><font color="green">{ms, 87}</font>
<br> shame and rancour that had divided him from mother and brother and sister.
He felt that he was hardly of the one blood with them but stood to them rather
in the mystical kinship of fosterage, foster child and foster brother.</p>
<p> He turned to appease the fierce longings of his heart before which
everything else was idle and alien. He cared little that he was in mortal sin,
that his life had grown to be a tissue of subterfuge and falsehood. Beside the
savage desire within him to realize the enormities which he brooded on nothing
was sacred. He bore cynically with the shameful details of his secret riots in
which he exulted to defile with patience whatever image had attracted his eyes.
By day and by night he moved among distorted images of the outer world. A figure
that had seemed to him by day demure and
<br><font color="green">{ms, 88}</font>
<br> innocent came towards him by night through the winding darkness of sleep,
her face transfigured by a lecherous cunning, her eyes bright with brutish joy.
Only the morning pained him with its dim memory of dark orgiastic riot, its keen
and humiliating sense of transgression.</p>
<p> He returned to his wanderings. The veiled autumnal evenings led him from
street to street as they had led him years before along the quiet avenues of
Blackrock. But no vision of trim front gardens or of kindly lights in the
windows poured a tender influence upon him now. Only at times, in the pauses of
his desire, when the luxury that was
wasting<a target="foot" id="fzz0048">&ordm;</a> gave room to a softer languor,
the image of Mercedes traversed the background of his memory. He saw again the small white house and the garden
<br><font color="green">{ms, 89}</font>
<br> of rosebushes on the road that led to the mountains and he remembered the
sadly proud gesture of refusal which he was to make there, standing with her in
the moonlit garden after years of estrangement and adventure. At those moments
the soft speeches of Claude Melnotte rose to his lips and eased his unrest. A
tender premonition touched him of the tryst he had then looked forward to and,
in spite of the horrible reality which lay between his hope of then and now, of
the holy encounter he had then imagined at which weakness and timidity and inexperience were to fall from him.</p>
<p> Such moments passed and the wasting fires of lust sprang up again. The
verses passed from his lips and the inarticulate cries and the unspoken brutal words rushed forth
<br><font color="green">{ms, 90}</font>
<br> from his brain to force a passage. His blood was in revolt. He wandered up
and down the dark slimy streets peering into the gloom of lanes and doorways,
listening eagerly for any sound. He moaned to himself like some baffled prowling
beast. He wanted to sin with another of his kind, to force another being to sin
with him and to exult with her in sin. He felt some dark presence moving
irresistibly upon him from the darkness, a presence subtle and murmurous as a
flood filling him wholly with itself. Its murmur besieged his ears like the
murmur of some multitude in sleep; its subtle streams penetrated his being. His
hands clenched convulsively and his teeth set together as he suffered the agony
of its penetration. He stretched out his arms in the street to hold fast
<br><font color="green">{ms, 91}</font>
<br> the frail swooning form that eluded him and incited him: and the cry that
he had strangled for so long in his throat issued from his lips. It broke from
him like a wail of despair from a hell of sufferers and died in a wail of
furious entreaty, a cry for an iniquitous abandonment, a cry which was but the
echo of an obscene scrawl which he had read on the oozing wall of a urinal.</p>
<p> He had wandered into a maze of narrow and dirty streets. From the foul
laneways he heard bursts of hoarse riot and wrangling and the drawling of
drunken singers. He walked onward, dismayed, wondering whether he had strayed
into the quarter of the Jews. Women and girls dressed in long vivid gowns
traversed the street from house to house. They were leisurely and perfumed. A trembling
<br><font color="green">{ms, 92}</font>
<br> seized him and his eyes grew dim. The yellow gas-flames arose before his
troubled vision against the vapoury sky, burning as if before an altar. Before
the doors and in the lighted halls groups were gathered arrayed as for some
rite. He was in another world: he had awakened from a slumber of centuries.</p>
<p> He stood still in the middle of the roadway, his heart clamouring against
his bosom in a tumult. A young woman dressed in a long pink gown laid her hand
on his arm to detain him and gazed into his face. She said gaily:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Good night, Willie dear! &mdash;</p>
<p> Her room was warm and lightsome. A huge doll sat with her legs apart in the
copious easy-chair beside the bed. He tried to bid his tongue speak that he might seem at ease, watching
<br><font color="green">{ms, 93}</font>
<br> her as he<a target="foot" id="fzz0049">&ordm;</a> undid her gown, noting
the proud conscious movements of her perfumed head.</p>
<p> As he stood silent in the middle of the room she came over to him and
embraced him gaily and gravely. Her round arms held him firmly to her and he,
seeing her face lifted to him in serious calm and feeling the warm calm rise and
fall of her breast, all but burst into hysterical weeping. Tears of joy and
relief shone in his delighted eyes and his lips parted though they would not speak.</p>
<p> She passed her tinkling hand through his hair, calling him a little rascal.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Give me a kiss &mdash; she said.</p>
<p> His lips would not bend to kiss her. He wanted to be held firmly in her arms,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 94}</font>
<br> to be caressed slowly, slowly, slowly. In her arms he felt that he had
suddenly become strong and fearless and sure of himself. But his lips would not bend to kiss her.</p>
<p> With a sudden movement she bowed his head and joined her lips to his and he
read the meaning of her movements in her frank uplifted eyes. It was too much
for him. He closed his eyes, surrendering himself to her, body and mind,
conscious of nothing in the world but the dark pressure of her softly parting
lips. They pressed upon his brain as upon his lips as though they were the
vehicles<a target="foot" id="fzz0050">&ordm;</a> of a vague speech; and between
them he felt an unknown and timid pressure, darker
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">then</span></span> than the swoon
of sin, softer than sound or odour.</p> </p>  </main>
