<p> The summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysterious embrace.
Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of
<a name="s13020f" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020f">all too</a> fleeting
day lingered lovingly on sea and strand, on the proud promontory of
<a name="s13009bv" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009bv">dear old</a> Howth
guarding as ever the waters of the bay, on the weedgrown rocks
along<a target="foot" id="foo0001">&ordm;</a> Sandymount shore and, last but not
least, on the quiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the
stillness the voice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a beacon ever
to the stormtossed heart of man, Mary,
<a name="s13001v" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13001v">star of the sea</a>.</p>
<p> The three girl friends were seated on the
rocks,<a target="foot" id="foo0002">&ordm;</a> enjoying the evening scene and
the air which was fresh but<a target="foot" id="foo0003">&ordm;</a> not too
chilly. Many a time and oft were they wont to come there to that favourite
<a name="s13013m" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013m">nook</a> to have a
cosy chat beside the
<a name="un5005aj" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5005aj">sparkling waves</a>
and <a name="s13020bg" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020bg">discuss matters
feminine</a>, Cissy Caffrey and Edy Boardman with the baby in the pushcar and
Tommy and Jacky Caffrey, two little curlyheaded boys, dressed in sailor suits
with caps to match and the name <i>H.M.S.
Belleisle</i><a target="foot" id="foo0004">&ordm;</a> printed on both. For Tommy
and Jacky Caffrey were twins, scarce four years old and very noisy and spoiled
twins sometimes<a target="foot" id="foo0005">&ordm;</a> but for all that darling
little fellows with bright merry faces and
<a name="s13009ce" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009ce">endearing ways</a>
about them. They were dabbling in the sand with their spades and buckets,
building castles as children do, or playing with their big coloured
ball,<a target="foot" id="foo0006">&ordm;</a> happy as the day was long. And Edy
Boardman was rocking the
<a name="s13009aa" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009aa">chubby</a> baby to
and fro in the pushcar while that young gentleman fairly chuckled with delight.
He was but eleven months and nine days old and, though still a tiny toddler, was
just beginning to lisp his first babyish words. Cissy  Caffrey bent over
to<a target="foot" id="foo0007">&ordm;</a> him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty dimple in his chin.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Now, baby, Cissy Caffrey said. Say out big, big. I want a
drink of water.<a target="foot" id="foo0008">&ordm;</a>
<br><font color="green">{u22, 332}</font> </p>
<p> And baby prattled after her:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="s13020l" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020l">A jink a jink a
jawbo.</a><a target="foot" id="foo0009">&ordm;</a></p>
<p> Cissy Caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of children, so
patient with <a name="s13020o" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020o">little
sufferers</a> and Tommy Caffrey could never be got
<a name="s13013bd" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013bd">to take his castor
oil unless it was Cissy Caffrey that held his nose</a> and promised him the
<a name="un6012ac" href="../../FF/unbs/un6all.htm#un6012ac">scatty heel of the
loaf</a> or<a target="foot" id="foo0010">&ordm;</a> brown bread with
<a name="un5005t" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5005t">golden syrup</a> on.
<a name="un4047s" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4047s">What a persuasive
power that girl had!</a> But to be sure baby was
<a name="s13018k" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13018k">as good as gold</a>, a
perfect little dote in his new fancy
<a name="s13018q" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13018q">bib</a>. None of your
<a name="s13021aa" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13021aa">spoilt beauties</a>
was Cissy Caffrey. A truerhearted girl never drew the breath of life, always
with a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her
<a name="s13016b" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13016b">cherryripe</a> red
lips, a girl <a name="s13020as" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020as">lovable
in the extreme</a>. And Edy Boardman laughed too at the quaint language of little brother.</p>
<p> But just then there was a slight altercation between
Master<a target="foot" id="foo0011">&ordm;</a> Tommy and Master Jacky.
<a name="s13009be" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009be">Boys will be
boys</a> and our<a target="foot" id="foo0012">&ordm;</a> two twins were no
exception to this rule. The apple of discord was a certain castle of sand which
Master Jacky had built and Master Tommy would have it right go wrong that it was
to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like the Martello tower had. But
if Master Tommy was headstrong Master Jacky was selfwilled too and, true to the
maxim that every little
<a name="un4054ad" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4054ad">Irishman&apos;s
house is his castle</a>, he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose that
the wouldbe assailant came to grief and (alas to relate!) the coveted castle
too. Needless to say the cries of discomfited Master Tommy drew the attention of the girl friends.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Come here, Tommy, his sister called imperatively, at once!
And you, Jacky, <a name="s13009ad" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009ad">for
shame</a> to throw poor Tommy in the dirty sand. Wait till I catch you for that.</p>
<p> <a name="s13020g" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020g">His eyes misty
with unshed tears</a> Master Tommy came at her call for their big sister&apos;s
word was law with the twins. And in a sad plight he was after his misadventure.
His little man-o&apos;-war top and  unmentionables were full of sand but Cissy
was a past mistress in the art of smoothing
over<a target="foot" id="foo0013">&ordm;</a> life&apos;s tiny troubles
and<a target="foot" id="foo0014">&ordm;</a> very quickly not one speck of sand
was to be seen on his smart little suit. Still the blue eyes were glistening
with <a name="s13009ae" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009ae">hot tears that
would well up</a> so she
<a name="un4018r" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4018r">kissed away the
hurtness</a> and shook her hand at Master Jacky the culprit and said
<a name="un4047aq" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4047aq">if she was near him
she wouldn&apos;t be far from him</a>, her eyes dancing in admonition.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <a name="s13009af" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009af">Nasty</a> bold Jacky! she cried.</p>
<p> She put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="s13004c" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13004c">What&apos;s your name? Butter and cream?</a>
<br><font color="green">{u22, 333}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="jn0070a" href="../../FF/unbs/jn0all.htm#jn0070a">Tell us who is your
sweetheart, spoke Edy Boardman. Is Cissy your sweetheart?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Nao, tearful Tommy said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Is Edy Boardman your sweetheart? Cissy queried.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Nao, Tommy said.</a></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I know, Edy Boardman said
<a name="s13020bd" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020bd">none too amiably</a>
with an arch glance from her shortsighted eyes. I know who is Tommy&apos;s
sweetheart.<a target="foot" id="foo0015">&ordm;</a>
<a name="jn0070a" href="../../FF/unbs/jn0all.htm#jn0070a">Gerty is Tommy&apos;s sweetheart.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Nao, Tommy said on the verge of tears.</a></p>
<p> Cissy&apos;s quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to Edy
Boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the
gentleman<a target="foot" id="foo0016">&ordm;</a> couldn&apos;t see and to mind
he didn&apos;t wet his new tan shoes.</p>
<p> But who was Gerty?</p>
<p> Gerty MacDowell who was seated near her companions,
<a name="s13012l" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13012l">lost in thought</a>,
<a name="s13010ac" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010ac">gazing far away into
the distance</a> was
<a name="s13013cc" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013cc">in very
truth</a><a target="foot" id="foo0017">&ordm;</a>
<a name="s13013cc" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013cc">as fair a specimen
of</a> <a name="s13003g" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13003g">winsome</a>
<a name="s13013cc" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013cc">Irish girlhood</a>
as one could wish to see. She was
<a name="s13012j" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13012j">pronounced
beautiful</a> by all who knew her though, as folks often said, she was
<a name="s13009am" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009am">more a Giltrap than
a MacDowell</a>. Her figure was slight and graceful, inclining even to fragility
but those iron jelloids she had been taking of late had done her a world of good
much <a name="un4018f" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4018f">better than</a>
the <a name="un4018cn" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4018cn">Widow
Welch&apos;s female pills</a> and she was much better of those
<a name="s13010ak" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010ak">discharges</a> she
used to get and that
<a name="un4019cd" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4019cd">tired feeling</a>.
The <a name="s13020bj" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020bj">waxen pallor of
her face was almost spiritual in its ivorylike purity</a> though her
<a name="un4041ca" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4041ca">rosebud</a>

Cupid&apos;s bow</a>,
<a name="un4018bp" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4018bp">Greekly perfect</a>.
Her hands were of  finely veined alabaster with
<a name="un4018ad" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4018ad">tapering fingers</a>
and as white as lemonjuice<a target="foot" id="foo0018">&ordm;</a> and queen of
ointments could make them though it was not true that she used to
<a name="un5003t" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5003t">wear kid gloves in
bed</a>. Bertha Supple told that once to Edy Boardman,
<a name="un4019bl" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4019bl">a deliberate
lie</a>, when she was black out
<a name="un4047g" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4047g">at daggers drawn</a>
with Gerty (the girl chums had of course their little tiffs from time to time
like the rest of mortals) and
<a name="s13004ap" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13004ap">she told her not

gave that haunting expression to the eyes, so becoming in leaders of

also the nice perfume of those good cigarettes and besides they were both of a
size and that was why Edy Boardman thought she was so frightfully clever because
he didn&apos;t go and ride up and down in front of her bit of a garden.</p>
<p> Gerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of

<p> Madcap Ciss with her

You had to laugh at her sometimes. For instance when she asked you would you
have some more Chinese tea and
<a name="s13014ac" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13014ac">jaspberry ram</a>
and when she drew the jugs too and the men&apos;s faces
<a name="un4019dn" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4019dn">on her nails</a>
with red ink make you split your sides or when she said she wanted to run and
pay a visit to <a name="s13009bb" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009bb">the
miss white</a>. That was just like
<a name="s13022au" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022au">Cissycums.</a> O,
and will you ever forget the evening she dressed up in her father&apos;s suit
and hat <a name="un6012f" href="../../FF/unbs/un6all.htm#un6012f">and the burned
cork moustache</a> and walked down Tritonville road, smoking a cigarette. There
was <a name="un4041aa" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4041aa">none to come up
to her</a> for fun. But she was sincerity itself,
<a name="s13022aq" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022aq">one of the bravest
and truest hearts heaven ever made</a>, not one of your twofaced things, too sweet to be wholesome. </p>
<p> And then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the pealing
anthem of the organ. It was the men&apos;s temperance retreat conducted by the
missioner, the reverend John Hughes
S.J.,<a target="foot" id="foo0047">&ordm;</a> rosary, sermon and benediction of
the Most Blessed Sacrament. They were there gathered together without
distinction of social class (and a most edifying spectacle it was to see) in
that simple fane beside the waves after the storms of this weary world, kneeling
before the feet of the immaculate, reciting the
<a name="un5005b" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5005b">litany of Our Lady of
Loreto</a>, beseeching her to intercede for them, the

hour at the rain falling on the rusty bucket,
<a name="un4019ea" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4019ea">thinking</a>. But
that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearths and homes had cast its
shadow over her childhood days. Nay, she had even witnessed in the home circle
deeds of violence caused by intemperance and had seen her own father, a prey to
the fumes of intoxication, forget himself completely for if there was one thing
of all things that Gerty knew it was
that<a target="foot" id="foo0048">&ordm;</a> the man who lifts his hand to a
woman save in the way of kindness deserves to be branded as the lowest of the low.</p>
<p> And still the voices sang in supplication to the Virgin most powerful,
Virgin most merciful. And Gerty, wrapt in thought, scarce saw or heard her
companions or the twins at their<a target="foot" id="foo0049">&ordm;</a> boyish
gambols or the gentleman off Sandymount green that Cissy Caffrey called the man
that was so like himself passing along the strand taking a short walk. You never
saw him anyway screwed but still and for all that
<a name="s13017au" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13017au">she would not like
him for a father because he was too old</a> or something or on account of his
face (it was a palpable case of doctor Fell) or his carbuncly nose with the
pimples on it <a name="un7015c" href="../../FF/unbs/un7all.htm#un7015c">and his
sandy moustache a bit white under his nose</a>. Poor father! With all his faults
she loved him still when he sang <i>Tell me, Mary, how to woo
thee</i><a target="foot" id="foo0050">&ordm;</a> or
<a name="un4018al" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4018al"><i>My love and
cottage  near Rochelle</i></a> and they had stewed cockles and lettuce with
salad dressing for supper and when he sang <i>The moon hath raised</i> with Mr
Dignam that died suddenly and was buried, God have mercy on him, from a stroke.
Her mother&apos;s birthday that was and Charley was home on his holidays and Tom
and Mr Dignam and Mrs and Patsy and Freddy Dignam and they were
<a name="s13005a" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13005a">to have had a group
taken</a>. No-one would have thought
<a name="s13025o" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13025o">the end was so
near</a><a target="foot" id="foo0051">&ordm;</a>. Now he was
<a name="s13025s" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13025s">laid to rest</a>. And
her mother said to him to let that be a warning to him for the rest of his days
and he couldn&apos;t even go to the funeral on account of the gout and she had
to go into town to bring him the letters and samples from his office about
Catesby&apos;s cork lino, artistic,<a target="foot" id="foo0052">&ordm;</a>

<p> A sterling good daughter was Gerty just like a second mother in the house, a
ministering angel too with a
<a name="un4041v" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4041v">little heart worth its
weight in gold</a>. And when her mother had those
<a name="un4047bd" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4047bd">raging</a> splitting
headaches who was it rubbed on the menthol cone on her forehead but Gerty though
she didn&apos;t like her mother taking pinches of snuff and that was the only
single thing they ever had words about, taking snuff. Everyone
<a name="un4047j" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4047j">thought the world of
her</a> for <a name="un4018av" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4018av">her
gentle ways</a>. It was Gerty who
<a name="s13009ac" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009ac">turned off the gas
at the main every night</a> and it was Gerty
<br><font color="green">{u22, 340}</font>
<br> who tacked up on the wall of
<a name="s13009t" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009t">that place</a> where
she never forgot every fortnight the
<a name="un4019e" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4019e">chlorate of lime</a>
Mr Tunney the grocer&apos;s christmas almanac the picture of halcyon days where
a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a threecornered hat
was offering<a target="foot" id="foo0053">&ordm;</a> a bunch of flowers to his
<a name="s13010u" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010u">ladylove</a><a target="foot" id="foo0054">&ordm;</a>
with <a name="s13025aa" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13025aa">oldtime
chivalry</a> through her
<a name="s13012b" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13012b">lattice</a> window.
You could see there was a
<a name="un4019cp" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4019cp">story behind it</a>.
The colours were done something lovely. She was in a
<a name="s13022al" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022al">soft clinging
white</a> in a <a name="un4041r" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4041r">studied
attitude</a> and the gentleman was in chocolate and he looked
<a name="s13010k" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010k">a thorough
aristocrat</a>. She often looked at them dreamily when she went there for a
certain purpose and thought about those times because she had found out in
Walker&apos;s pronouncing dictionary that
<a name="un4019am" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4019am">belonged to
grandpapa Giltrap</a><a target="foot" id="foo0055">&ordm;</a> about the halcyon days what they meant.</p>
<p> The twins were now playing in
<a name="s13022a" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022a">the most approved</a>
brotherly  fashion, till at last Master Jacky who was really
<a name="s13018j" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13018j">as bold as brass</a>
there was no getting behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he
could down towards the seaweedy rocks. Needless to say poor Tommy was not slow
to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was sitting there by
himself <a name="s13022c" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022c">came to the
rescue</a> and intercepted the ball. Our two champions claimed their plaything
with lusty cries and to avoid trouble Cissy Caffrey called to the gentleman to
throw it to her please. The gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then
threw it up the strand towards Cissy Caffrey but it rolled down the slope and
stopped right<a target="foot" id="foo0056">&ordm;</a> under Gerty&apos;s skirt
near the little pool by the rock. The twins clamoured again for it and Cissy
told her to kick it away and let them fight for it it so Gerty drew back her
foot but she wished their stupid ball hadn&apos;t come rolling down to her and
she gave a kick<a target="foot" id="foo0057">&ordm;</a> but she missed and Edy and Cissy laughed.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; If you fail try again, Edy Boardman said.</p>
<p> Gerty <a name="s13010s" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010s">smiled
assent</a> and <a name="un4019cu" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4019cu">bit
her lip</a>.<a target="foot" id="foo0058">&ordm;</a>
<a name="s13020t" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020t">A delicate pink crept
into her pretty cheek</a> but she was determined to let them see so she just
lifted her skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a
<a name="s13022af" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022af">jolly good</a> kick
and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down towards the shingle.
Pure jealousy of course it was nothing else
<a name="s13014ah" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13014ah">to draw
attention</a> on account of the gentleman opposite looking. She felt the warm
flush, a <a name="s13020al" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020al">danger
signal</a> always with Gerty MacDowell,
<a name="s13020p" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020p">surging</a> and
<a name="s13020al" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020al">flaming</a>
<a name="s13020p" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020p">into her cheeks</a>.
Till then they had only
<a name="s13022l" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022l">exchanged glances of
the most casual</a> but now under the brim of her new hat
<a name="s13020r" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020r">she ventured a
look</a> at him and
<a name="s13009bp" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009bp">the face</a> that
met her gaze there in the twilight, wan and
<a name="s13009bp" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009bp">strangely drawn</a>,
seemed to her <a name="s13020e" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020e">the saddest she had ever seen</a>.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 341}</font> </p>
<p> Through the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted and
with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain of original
sin, spiritual vessel,
<a name="un4045bq" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4045bq">pray for us</a>,
honourable vessel, pray for us, vessel of singular devotion, pray for us,
mystical rose. And careworn hearts were there and toilers for their
<a name="s13010f" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010f">daily bread</a> and
many who had erred and wandered, their eyes
<a name="s13010d" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010d">wet with
contrition</a> but for all that bright with hope for the reverend father Hughes
had told them what the great saint Bernard said in his famous prayer  of Mary,
the most pious Virgin&apos;s intercessory power that it was not recorded in any
age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever abandoned by her.</p>
<p> The twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of childhood
are but as passing summer showers. Cissy played with baby Boardman till he
crowed with glee, clapping
<a name="s13009ba" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009ba">baby hands</a> in
air.<a target="foot" id="foo0059">&ordm;</a>
<a name="s13018h" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13018h">Peep she cried</a>
behind the hood of the pushcar and Edy asked where was Cissy gone and then Cissy
popped up her head and cried ah! and, my word, didn&apos;t the little chap enjoy
that! And then she told him to say papa.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Say papa, baby. Say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa.</p>
<p> And baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for eleven
months everyone said and
<a name="un4019cn" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4019cn">big for his age</a>
and the <a name="un6012k" href="../../FF/unbs/un6all.htm#un6012k">picture of
health</a>, <a name="un4041ak" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4041ak">a
perfect little bunch of love</a>, and he would certainly turn out to be something great, they said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Haja ja ja haja.</p>
<p> Cissy wiped his little mouth with the
<a name="s13020aj" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020aj">dribbling bib</a>
and wanted him to sit up properly and say pa pa pa
but<a target="foot" id="foo0060">&ordm;</a> when she undid the strap she cried
out, holy saint Denis, that he was
<a name="s13004q" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13004q">possing wet</a> and to
double the half blanket the other way under him. Of course his infant majesty
was most obstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know it:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa.</p>
<p> And two great big lovely big
<a name="un4047o" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4047o">tears coursing down
his cheeks</a>. It was all no use soothering him with no, nono, baby, no and
telling him about<a target="foot" id="foo0061">&ordm;</a> the
<a name="s13022g" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022g">geegee</a> and where
was the <a name="s13018f" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13018f">puffpuff</a>
but Ciss, always<a target="foot" id="foo0062">&ordm;</a> readywitted, gave him
in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen was quickly appeased.</p>
<p> Gerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out of
that and not <a name="un4018i" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4018i">get on
her nerves</a>,<a target="foot" id="foo0063">&ordm;</a> no hour to be
out,<a target="foot" id="foo0064">&ordm;</a> and the little brats of twins. She
gazed out towards the distant sea. It was like
<a name="un5005n" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5005n">the paintings that man
used to do on the pavement</a> with all the coloured chalks the evening and the clouds coming
<br><font color="green">{u22, 342}</font>

perfume of <a name="s13010av" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010av">those</a>
incense they burned in the church. And while she gazed
<a name="s13001bs" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13001bs">her heart went
pitapat</a>. Yes, it was her he was looking at and
<a name="s13022ah" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022ah">there was meaning in

has it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy can never

<br> Conroy was helping Canon O&apos;Hanlon at the altar, carrying things in and
out with his eyes cast down. He looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was
so quiet and clean and dark and his hands were just like white wax and if ever
she <a name="un6012d" href="../../FF/unbs/un6all.htm#un6012d">became a Dominican
nun</a> in their white habit perhaps he might come to the convent for the

in this life and that that was no sin because that came from the nature of woman
instituted by God, he said, and that Our Blessed Lady herself said to the

<p> The little brats of twins began to quarrel again and Jacky threw the ball
out towards the sea and they both ran after it. Little monkeys common as
ditchwater. Someone ought to take them and give them a good hiding for
themselves to keep them in their places the both of them. And Cissy and Edy
shouted after them to come back because they were afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Jacky! Tommy! </p>
<p> Not they! What a great notion they had! So Cissy said it was the very last
time she&apos;d ever bring them out. She jumped up and called them and
then<a target="foot" id="foo0069">&ordm;</a> she ran down the slope past him,
tossing her hair behind her which had a good enough colour if there had been
more of it but with all the thingamerry she was always rubbing into it she
couldn&apos;t get it to grow long because it wasn&apos;t natural so she could
just go and throw her hat at it. She ran with long gandery strides it was a
wonder she didn&apos;t rip up her skirt at the side that was too tight on her
because there was a lot of the tomboy about Cissy Caffrey and she was a
<a name="un4019ct" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4019ct">forward piece</a>
whenever she thought she had a good opportunity to show off and just because she
was a good runner she ran like that so that he could see all the end of her
petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as possible. It would have
served her just right if she had tripped up over something
<a name="un4018cj" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4018cj">accidentally on
purpose</a> with her high
<a name="un4018cd" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4018cd">crooked</a> French heels on her to make her look tall and

<br> got a fine tumble.

That would have been a very charming expos&eacute; for a gentleman like that to witness.</p>
<p> Queen of angels, queen of patriarchs, queen of prophets, of all saints, they
prayed, queen of the most holy rosary and then Father Conroy handed the thurible
to Canon O&apos;Hanlon and he put in the incense and censed the blessed
sacrament and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and she was itching to give
them a good clip on the ear but she didn&apos;t because she thought he might be
watching but she never made a bigger mistake in her life because Gerty could see
without looking that he never took his eyes off of her and then Canon
O&apos;Hanlon handed the thurible back to Father Conroy and knelt down looking
up at the blessed sacrament and the choir began to sing <i>Tantum ergo</i> and
she just swung her foot in and out in time as the
<a name="un4047al" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4047al">music rose and
fell</a> to the <i>Tantumer gosa cramen tum</i>. Three and eleven she paid for
those stockings in Sparrow&apos;s of
George&apos;s<a target="foot" id="foo0070">&ordm;</a> street on the Tuesday, no
the Monday before Easter and there wasn&apos;t a brack on them and that was what
he was looking at, transparent, and not at her
<a name="un4041h" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4041h">insignificant</a> ones
that had neither shape nor form
(<a name="un4019da" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4019da">the cheek of
her!</a>) because he had eyes in his head to see the difference for himself. </p>
<p> Cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with her
hat anyhow on her on one side after her run and she did look a streel tugging
the two kids along with the
<a name="un4047f" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4047f">flimsy</a> blouse she
bought only a fortnight before like a rag on her back and
<a name="un4018bi" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4018bi">a bit of her
petticoat hanging</a> like a
<a name="un7015f" href="../../FF/unbs/un7all.htm#un7015f">caricature</a>. Gerty
just took off her hat for a moment to settle her hair and a prettier, a daintier
head of nutbrown
<a name="s13024e" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13024e">tresses</a> was never
seen on a girl&apos;s shoulders &mdash;<a target="foot" id="foo0071">&ordm;</a>
<a name="s13023j" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13023j">a radiant little
vision</a>, in sooth, almost
<a name="s13022bv" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022bv">maddening in its
sweetness</a>. You would have to travel many a long mile before you found a head
of hair the like of that. She could almost see the swift answering
flash<a target="foot" id="foo0072">&ordm;</a> of admiration in his eyes that
<a name="s13022cc" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022cc">set her tingling</a>
in every nerve. She put on her hat so that she could see from underneath the
brim and swung her buckled shoe faster for
<a name="s13020bn" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020bn">her breath
caught</a> as she caught the expression in his eyes. He was eying her
<a name="s13022ap" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022ap">as a
snake</a><a target="foot" id="foo0074">&ordm;</a>
<a name="s13022ap" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022ap">eyes its prey</a>.
Her woman&apos;s instinct told her that
<a name="s13009bs" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009bs">she had raised the
devil in him</a> and at the thought
<a name="s13020bl" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020bl">a burning scarlet
swept from throat to brow</a> till the lovely
<a name="s13023an" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13023an">colour of her face became a glorious rose</a>.</p>
<p> Edy Boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at Gerty, half
smiling, with her specs, like an old maid, pretending to nurse the baby.
Irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was why no-one could
get on with her, poking her nose into what was no concern of hers. And she said to Gerty:
<br><font color="green">{u22, 345}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <a name="s13013bu" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013bu">A penny for your thoughts.</a></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What? replied Gerty with
<a name="un4018bs" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4018bs">a smile reinforced
by the whitest of teeth</a>. I was only wondering was it late.</p>
<p> Because she wished to goodness they&apos;d take the snottynosed twins and
their baby<a target="foot" id="foo0075">&ordm;</a> home to the mischief out of
that so that was why she just gave a gentle hint about its being late. And when
Cissy came up Edy asked her the time and Miss Cissy, as glib as you like, said
it was <a name="s13009o" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009o">half past
kissing time</a>, time to kiss again. But Edy wanted to know because they were told to be in early.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Wait, said Cissy, I&apos;ll
ask<a target="foot" id="foo0076">&ordm;</a> my
<a name="s13004ak" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13004ak">uncle</a> Peter over
there what&apos;s the time by his conundrum.</p>
<p> So over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his hand
out of his pocket, getting nervous, and beginning to play  with his watchchain,
looking at the church. Passionate nature though he was Gerty could see that he
had enormous control over himself. One moment he had been there,
<a name="s13022bu" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022bu">fascinated by a
loveliness that made him gaze</a>,<a target="foot" id="foo0077">&ordm;</a> and
<a name="s13020bb" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020bb">the next moment it
was the quiet gravefaced gentleman, selfcontrol expressed in every line of
his</a>
<a name="un4019ag" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4019ag">distinguishedlooking</a>
<a name="s13020bb" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020bb">figure</a>.</p>
<p> Cissy said to excuse her would he mind telling her what was the right time
and Gerty could see him taking out his watch
<a name="un4018d" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4018d">listening</a> to it
and looking up and
<a name="un4019ao" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4019ao">clearing his
throat</a> and he said he was very sorry his watch was stopped but he thought it
must be after eight because the sun was set.
<a name="s13020c" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020c">His voice had a
cultured ring in it</a> and
<a name="un4047k" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4047k">though he spoke in
measured accents</a> there was
<a name="s13023b" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13023b">a suspicion of a
quiver in the mellow tones</a>. Cissy said thanks and came back with her tongue
out and said <a name="un6012l" href="../../FF/unbs/un6all.htm#un6012l">uncle
said</a> his waterworks were out of order.</p>
<p> Then they sang the second verse of the <i>Tantum ergo</i> and Canon
O&apos;Hanlon got up again and censed the blessed sacrament and knelt down and
he told Father Conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire to the
flowers and Father Conroy got up and settled it all right and she could see the
gentleman winding his watch and listening to the works and she swung her leg
more in and out in time. It was getting darker but he could see and he was
looking all the time that he was winding the watch or whatever he was doing to
it and then he put it back and put his hands back into his pockets. She felt a
kind of a sensation rushing all over her and she knew by the feel of her scalp
and that irritation against her stays that that thing must be coming on because
the last time too was when she clipped her hair on account of the moon. His dark
eyes fixed themselves on her again,<a target="foot" id="foo0078">&ordm;</a>
drinking in <a name="s13005k" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13005k">her
every</a> <a name="s13005ad" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13005ad">contour</a>,
<br><font color="green">{u22, 346}</font>
<br> literally
<a name="s13005ac" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13005ac">worshipping at her
shrine</a>. If ever there was undisguised admiration in a man&apos;s passionate
gaze it was there plain to be seen on that man&apos;s face.
<a name="s13022r" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022r">It is for you,
Gertrude MacDowell,</a> <a name="s13025m" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13025m">and you know it</a>.</p>
<p> Edy began to get ready to go and
<a name="un4018am" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4018am">it was high time</a>
for her and Gerty noticed that that<a target="foot" id="foo0079">&ordm;</a>
little hint she gave
<a name="s13014ae" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13014ae">had the desired
effect</a> because it was a long way along the strand to where there was the
place to push up the pushcar and Cissy took off the twins&apos; caps and tidied
their  hair to make herself attractive of course and Canon O&apos;Hanlon stood
up with his cope poking up at his neck and Father Conroy handed him the card to
read off and he read out <i>Panem de coelo praestitisti eis</i> and Edy and
Cissy were talking about the time all the time and asking her but Gerty could
pay them back in their own coin and she just
answered<a target="foot" id="foo0080">&ordm;</a> with
<a name="s13022h" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022h">scathing
politeness</a> when Edy asked her was she
<a name="s13022ai" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022ai">heartbroken</a>
about her best boy throwing her over.
<a name="s13015d" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13015d">Gerty winced
sharply.</a> A <a name="s13022u" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022u">brief
cold blaze shone from her eyes</a> that spoke
<a name="un4018bv" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4018bv">volumes</a> of

<a name="s13023n" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13023n">yes</a>, it cut deep

<a name="s13025a" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13025a">probing her

glanced at her new conquest for them to see.</p>

<p> Edy straightened up baby Boardman to get ready to go and Cissy tucked in the

<p> Gerty stifled a

exclamation</a> and gave a
<a name="un4018ce" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4018ce">nervous cough</a>
and Edy asked what and she was just going to tell her to
<a name="s13025u" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13025u">catch it while it was

simply passed it off with
<a name="un4041w" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4041w">consummate tact</a> by
saying that that was the benediction because just then the bell rang out from
the steeple over the quiet seashore because Canon O&apos;Hanlon was up on the
altar with the veil that Father Conroy put round him round his shoulders giving
the benediction with the blessed sacrament in his hands.</p>
<p> How moving the scene there in the gathering twilight, the last glimpse of
Erin, the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time a bat flew
forth from the<a target="foot" id="foo0089">&ordm;</a> ivied belfry through the
dusk, hither, thither, with a tiny lost cry. And she could see far away the
lights of the lighthouses so
<a name="un6012aa" href="../../FF/unbs/un6all.htm#un6012aa">picturesque</a> she
would have loved to do with
<a name="un7015aa" href="../../FF/unbs/un7all.htm#un7015aa">a box of paints</a>
and soon the lamplighter would be going his rounds
<a name="un7015o" href="../../FF/unbs/un7all.htm#un7015o">past the presbyterian
church grounds and along by shady Tritonville avenue</a> where the couples
walked and lighting the

window where Reggy Wylie used to turn
<a name="un4019bd" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4019bd">his freewheel</a>
like she read in that book <i>The Lamplighter</i> by Miss Cummins, author of

<a name="un5005aq" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5005aq">her dreams</a> that
no-one knew of. She loved to read poetry and she got a keepsake from Bertha

<p> Canon O&apos;Hanlon put the blessed sacrament back into the tabernacle and
the choir sang <i>Laudate Dominum omnes gentes</i> and then he locked the
tabernacle door because the benediction was over and Father Conroy handed him
his hat to put on and Edy asked was she coming but Jacky Caffrey called out:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O, look, Cissy!</p>
<p> And they all looked

<p> And they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church,
helterskelter, Edy with the pushcar with baby Boardman in it and Cissy holding
Tommy and Jacky by the hand so they wouldn&apos;t fall running.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Come on, Gerty, Cissy called. It&apos;s the bazaar

<p> But Gerty was
<a name="s13002t" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13002t">adamant</a>. She had
no intention of being
<a name="s13022bh" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022bh">at their beck and
call</a>. If they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she could see
from where she was. The eyes that were fastened upon her set her
<a name="s13023ao" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13023ao">pulses tingling</a>.
She looked at him a moment,
<a name="s13025r" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13025r">meeting his
glance</a>, and <a name="s13023af" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13023af">a
light broke in upon her</a>.
<a name="s13014am" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13014am">Whitehot passion</a>
was in that face, passion

hands and face were working</a> and
<a name="un4047an" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4047an">a tremour went over
her</a>. She leaned back far to look up where the
<a name="s13009bd" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009bd">fireworks</a> were
and she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall back looking up and there
was no-one to see only him and her when she
<a name="s13022bp" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022bp">revealed all her
graceful beautifully shaped legs</a> like that,
<a name="s13022bq" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022bq">supply  soft and
delicately rounded</a>, and she seemed to hear the panting of his
heart,<a target="foot" id="foo0101">&ordm;</a>
<a name="s13009cd" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009cd">his hoarse
breathing</a>, because she knew about the passion of men like that, hotblooded,
because Bertha Supple told her once in dead secret and made her
<a name="un7015al" href="../../FF/unbs/un7all.htm#un7015al">swear</a> she&apos;d
never about the gentleman lodger that was staying with them out of the
<a name="un4018bk" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4018bk">Congested Districts
Board</a> that had pictures cut out of
<a name="s13004be" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13004be">papers of those
skirtdancers</a> and
<a name="un4019bp" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4019bp">highkickers</a> and
she said he used to do something not very nice that you could imagine sometimes
in the bed. But this was
<a name="un4018n" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4018n">altogether</a>
different from a thing like that because there was all the difference because
she could almost feel him
<a name="s13024l" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13024l">draw her face to
his</a> and the first
<a name="s13024j" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13024j">quick hot touch of his
handsome lips</a>. Besides there was absolution so long as you didn&apos;t do
the other thing before being married and there ought to be women priests that
would understand without your telling out and Cissy Caffrey too sometimes had
that <a name="s13022e" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022e">dreamy</a> kind
of <a name="s13022e" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022e">dreamy</a> look in
her eyes so that she too, my dear, and besides it was on account of that other thing coming on the way it did.</p>
<p> And Jacky Caffrey shouted to look, there was another and she leaned back and
the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent and they all saw it
and shouted to look, look,<a target="foot" id="foo0102">&ordm;</a> there it was
and she leaned back ever so far to see the
<a name="s13009bd" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009bd">fireworks</a> and
something queer was flying about through the air, a soft
thing,<a target="foot" id="foo0103">&ordm;</a> to and fro, dark. And she saw a long Roman candle going up over
<br><font color="green">{u22, 350}</font>
<br> the trees up, up, and, in the
<a name="un4018ca" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4018ca">tense hush</a>, they
were all breathless with excitement as it went higher and higher and she had to
lean back more and more to look up after it, high, high, almost out of sight,
and her face was suffused with
<a name="s13020s" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020s">a divine, an
entrancing blush</a> from straining back and he could see her other things too,
nainsook <a name="s13021d" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13021d">knickers</a>,

hose, the green, four and eleven, on account of being white and she let him and
she saw that he saw and then it went so high it went out of sight a moment and
she was trembling in every limb from being bent so far back that he had a full
view high up above her knee where no-one ever not even on the
<a name="un6012aj" href="../../FF/unbs/un6all.htm#un6012aj">swing</a> or wading
and she wasn&apos;t ashamed and he wasn&apos;t either to look in that immodest
 way like that because he couldn&apos;t resist the sight of the
<a name="un4047q" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4047q">wondrous
revealment</a> like those skirtdancers behaving so immodest before gentlemen
looking and he kept on looking, looking. She would fain have cried to him
<a name="s13020bs" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020bs">chokingly</a>, held
out <a name="s13005aa" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13005aa">her</a>

everyone cried O! O!
<a name="un4047ap" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4047ap">in raptures</a> and
it gushed out of it a stream of rain gold hair threads and they shed and ah!
they were all greeny dewy stars falling with golden, O so
lovely!<a target="foot" id="foo0104">&ordm;</a> O so soft, sweet, soft!</p>
<p> Then all melted away dewily in the grey air: all was silent. Ah! She glanced
at him as she bent forward quickly, a
<a name="un4019du" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4019du">pathetic little</a>
glance of <a name="s13015e" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13015e">piteous
protest</a>, of shy reproach under which he
<a name="s13012h" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13012h">coloured like a

But there was an infinite store of mercy in those eyes, for him too a word of
pardon even though he had erred and sinned and wandered. That was their secret,
only theirs, alone in the hiding twilight and

<p> Cissy Caffrey whistled, imitating the boys in the football field to show
what a great person she was: and then she cried:<a target="foot" id="foo0107">&ordm;</a></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Gerty! Gerty! We&apos;re going. Come on. We can see from farther up.</p>
<p> Gerty had an idea, one of

without letting him and then slipped it back. Wonder if he&apos;s too far to.

dream of that till then, tomorrow, of her dream of

<p> Slowly without looking back she went down the uneven strand to Cissy, to
Edy, to Jacky and Tommy Caffrey, to little baby Boardman. It was darker now and
there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and slippy seaweed. She walked
with a certain quiet dignity characteristic of her but with care and very slowly
because &mdash;<a target="foot" id="foo0108">&ordm;</a> because Gerty MacDowell was&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
