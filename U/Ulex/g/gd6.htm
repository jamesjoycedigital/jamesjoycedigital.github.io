councillor, the Manx parliament. Tourists, you know, from the isle of Man.
Catches the eye, you see. Can you do that?</p>
<p> I could ask him perhaps about how to pronounce that <i>voglio</i>. But then
if he didn&apos;t know only make it awkward for him. Better not.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; We can do that, the foreman said. Have you the design?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I can get it, Mr Bloom said. It was in a Kilkenny paper.
He has a house there too. I&apos;ll just run out and ask him. Well, you can do
that and just a little par calling attention. You know the usual. Highclass licensed premises. Longfelt want. So on.</p>
<p> The foreman thought for an instant.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; We can do that, he said. Let him give us a three months&apos; renewal.</p>
<p> A typesetter brought him a limp galleypage. He began to check it silently.
Mr Bloom stood by, hearing the loud throbs of cranks, watching the silent typesetters at their cases.

<p class="di">&mdash; Who wants a dead cert for the Gold cup? he asked. Sceptre with O. Madden up.</p>
<p> He tossed the tissues on to the table.</p>
<p> Screams of newsboys barefoot in the hall rushed near and the door was flung
open. Professor MacHugh strode across the room and seized the cringing urchin by
the collar as the others scampered out of the hall and down the steps. The
tissues rustled up in the draught, floated softly in the air blue scrawls and under the table came to earth.</p>

<p class="di">&mdash; <i>Pardon, monsieur</i>, Lenehan said, clutching him for an instant and making a grimace.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; My fault, Mr Bloom said, suffering his grip. Are you hurt? I&apos;m in a hurry.</p>

<p> He made a comic face and whined, rubbing his knee:</p>

<p> He went to the door and, holding it ajar, paused. The noise of two shrill
voices, a mouthorgan, echoed in the bare hallway from the newsboys squatted on the doorsteps:</p>

<p> He looked indecisively for a moment at their faces. The editor who,
<br><font color="green">{u22, 125}</font>
<br> leaning against the mantelshelf, had propped his head on his hand, suddenly stretched forth an arm amply.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Go, he said. The world is before you.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Back in no time, Mr Bloom said, hurrying out.</p>
<p> J.J. O&apos;Molloy took the tissues from Lenehan&apos;s hand and read them without comment.

It sounds nobler than British or Brixton. The word reminds one somehow of fat in the fire.</p>
<p> Myles Crawford blew his first puff violently towards the ceiling.</p>

<p> Mr O&apos;Madden Burke, tall in copious grey, came in from the hallway.
Stephen Dedalus, behind him, uncovered as he entered.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>Entrez, mes enfants!</i> Lenehan cried.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I escort a suppliant, Mr O&apos;Madden Burke said melodiously.</p>

<p class="di">&mdash; We were always loyal to lost causes, the professor said.
Success for us is the death of the intellect and of the imagination. We were
never loyal to the successful. We serve them. I teach the blatant Latin
language. I speak the tongue of a race the acme of whose mentality is the maxim:
time is money. Material domination. <i>Dominus!</i> Lord! Where is the
spirituality? Lord Jesus! Lord Salisbury? A sofa in a westend club. But the Greek!

<p> He strode away from them towards the window.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; They went forth to battle, Mr O&apos;Madden Burke said greyly, but they always fell.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Boohoo! Lenehan wept with a little noise.</p>

<p> Myles Crawford crammed the sheets into a sidepocket.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That&apos;ll be all right, he said. I&apos;ll read the rest after. That&apos;ll be all right.</p>
<p> Lenehan extended his hands in protest.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; But my riddle! he said. What opera is like a railway line?
<br><font color="green">{u21, 151}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Opera? Mr O&apos;Madden Burke&apos;s vague face repeated.</p>
<p> Lenehan announced gladly:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>The Rose of Castile</i>. See the wheeze? Rows of cast steel. Gee!</p>
<p> He poked Mr O&apos;Madden Burke mildly in the spleen. Mr O&apos;Madden Burke
fell back with grace on his umbrella, feigning a gasp.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Help! he sighed.</p>
<p> Lenehan, rising to tiptoe, fanned his face rapidly with the rustling tissues.</p>
<p> The professor, returning by way of the files, swept his hand across
Stephen&apos;s and Mr O&apos;Madden Burke&apos;s loose ties.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Paris, past and present, he said. You look like communards.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Like fellows who had blown up the Bastille, J.J.
O&apos;Molloy said in quiet mockery. Or was it you shot the lord lieutenant of
Finland between you? You look as though you had done the deed. General Bobrikoff.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 130}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; We were only thinking about it, Stephen said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; All the talents, Myles Crawford said. Law, the classics&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The turf, Lenehan put in.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Literature, the press.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; If Bloom were here, the professor said. The gentle art of advertisement.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And Madam Bloom, Mr O&apos;Madden Burke added. The vocal muse. Dublin&apos;s prime favourite.</p>
<p> Lenehan gave a loud cough.</p>

<p class="di">&mdash; You like it? J.J. O&apos;Molloy asked Stephen.</p>
<p> Stephen, his blood wooed by grace of language and gesture, blushed. He took
a cigarette from the case. J.J. O&apos;Molloy offered his case to Myles
Crawford. Lenehan lit their cigarettes as before and helped

the opal hush poets: A. E. the mastermystic? That Blavatsky woman started it.
She was a nice old bag of tricks. A. E. has been telling some

<br><font color="green">{u21, 158}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; No, thanks, professor MacHugh said, waving the
cigarettecase aside. Wait a moment. Let me say one thing. The finest display of
oratory I ever heard was a speech made by John F. Taylor at the college
historical society. Mr Justice Fitzgibbon, the present lord justice of appeal,
had spoken and the paper under debate was an essay (new for those days) advocating the revival of the Irish tongue.</p>
<p> He turned towards Myles Crawford and said:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You know Gerald Fitzgibbon. Then you can imagine the style of his discourse.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He is sitting with Tim Healy, J.J. O&apos;Molloy said,
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black"><a name="un4007dh" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4007dh">rumour

<p class="di">&mdash; He is sitting with a sweet thing in a child&apos;s frock, Myles Crawford said. Go on. Well?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It was the speech, mark you, the professor said, of a
finished orator, full of courteous haughtiness and pouring

I will not say
<br><font color="green">{u22, 136}</font>
<br> the vials of his wrath but pouring the proud man&apos;s contumely upon the
new movement. It was then a new movement.</p>
<p> He closed his long thin lips an instant but, eager to be on, raised an
outspanned hand to his spectacles and, with trembling thumb and ringfinger
touching lightly the black rims, steadied them to a new focus.</p>
<p class="headline"><font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black"><a name="un5022ab" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5022ab">IMPROMPTU</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font></p>
<p> In ferial tone he addressed J.J. O&apos;Molloy:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Taylor had come there, you must know, from a sick bed.
That he had prepared his speech I do not believe. His dark lean face had a
growth of shaggy beard round it. He wore a loose neckcloth and altogether he looked (though he was not) a dying man.</p>
<p> His gaze turned at once towards Stephen&apos;s face and then bent at once to
the ground, seeking. His unglazed linen collar appeared behind his bent head,
soiled by his withering hair. Still seeking, he said:
<br><font color="green">{u21, 159}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; When Fitzgibbon&apos;s speech had ended John F. Taylor
rose to reply. As well as I can bring them to mind his words were these.</p>
<p> He raised his head firmly. His eyes bethought themselves once more. Witless
shellfish swam in the gross lenses to and fro, seeking outlet.</p>
<p> He began:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>Mr chairman, ladies and gentlemen:</i>

listening to the speech of some highpriest of that land addressed to the youthful Moses.</i></p>
<p> His listeners held their cigarettes poised to hear, smokes ascending in
frail stalks that flowered with his speech. <i>And let our crooked smokes</i>.
Noble words coming. Look out. Could you try your hand at it yourself?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>And it seemed to me that I heard the voice of that

Ra. Yours serfdom, awe and humbleness: ours thunder and the seas. Vagrants and
daylabourers are you called: the world trembles at our name.</i></p>
<p> A dumb belch of hunger cleft his speech. He lifted his voice above it boldly:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>But, ladies and gentlemen, had the youthful Moses
listened to and accepted that view of life, had he bowed his head and bowed his
will and bowed his spirit before that arrogant admonition he would never have
brought the chosen people out of their house of bondage, nor followed the pillar
of the cloud by day. He would never have spoken with the Eternal amid lightnings
on Sinai&apos;s mountaintop nor ever have come down with the light of
inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the tables of the
law, graven in the language of the outlaw.</i></p>
<p> He ceased and looked at them, enjoying silence.</p>

moneybox. They shake out threepenny bits and a sixpence and coax out the pennies
with the blade of a knife. Two and three in silver and one and seven in coppers.
They put on their bonnets and best clothes and take their umbrellas for fear it may come on to rain.</p>

of panloaf at the north city diningrooms in Marlborough street from Miss Kate
Collins, proprietress &nbsp;&hellip; They purchase four and twenty ripe plums
from a girl at the foot of Nelson&apos;s pillar to take off the thirst

turnstile and begin to waddle slowly up the winding staircase, grunting,
encouraging each other, afraid of the dark, panting, one asking the other have
you the brawn, praising God and the Blessed Virgin, threatening to come down,
peeping at the airslits. Glory be to God. They had no idea it was that high.</p>
