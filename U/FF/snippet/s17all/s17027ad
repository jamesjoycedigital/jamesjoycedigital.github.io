They told me that evening that the fowls had done the same a little later, returning to the hen-house as though it had been night, and that the small <mark>children</mark> (who were very numerous at Elche, where the population is certainly not diminishing) <mark>left off their games</mark>, and came back to their mothers&apos; skirts. The birds flew anxiously to their nests. The ants in one garden were excessively agitated, no doubt disconcerted in their strategics. The <mark>bats came out</mark>. <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> The light of the day lessens and is transformed. A sense of oppression is felt by all nature, the <mark>birds are hushed</mark>, the dog takes refuge with his master, the chickens hide beneath their mother&apos;s wing, <mark>the wind drops, the temperature falls</mark>, an appalling stillness is everywhere perceptible, as though the universe were on the verge of some imminent catastrophe. <mark>Men&apos;s faces assume a cadaverous hue</mark> similar to that given at night by the flame of spirits of wine and salt, a livid funereal light, the sinister illumination of the world&apos;s last hour. <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> Light considerably diminished, becoming wan, strange, and sinister.
