The reason is that the sensation of heat or of cold depends on the rate at which heat is entering the hand in one case, or is being withdrawn from the hand in the other. Now <mark>iron, being a better conductor of heat than wood, imparts heat to the hand faster than wood</mark> in the first case, but withdraws it faster from the hand in the second case. <small> Wentworth and Hill, <a name="TBOP" href="/udra/udex.htm#TBOP"><cite title="source">A Text-Book of Physics</cite></a> (1904), 130</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
