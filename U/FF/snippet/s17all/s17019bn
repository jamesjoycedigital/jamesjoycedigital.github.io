Every body, whatever its temperature, is constantly radiating heat at a rate depending on the nature of its surface and its temperature, but <i>not</i> on the temperature of the surrounding bodies. Thus, a red-hot iron ball radiates heat just as fast when placed in the middle of a furnace as when hung up in an ice house. <small> Wentworth and Hill, <a name="TBOP" href="/udra/udex.htm#TBOP"><cite title="source">A Text-Book of Physics</cite></a> (1904), 134</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
