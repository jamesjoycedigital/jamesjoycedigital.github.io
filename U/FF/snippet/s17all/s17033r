Weeping for him he made harangue and spake among them: &lsquo;Friends, a great deed truly hath this man devised against the Achaeans. Some with his ships he led away, many men and noble, and his hollow ships hath he lost, and utterly lost of his company, and others again, and those far the best of the Cephallenians he hath slain on his coming home. Up now, before ever he gets him swftly either to Pylos or to fair Elis, where the Epeians bear sway, let us go forth ; else even hereafter shall we have shame of face for ever. For a scorn this is even for the ears of men unborn to hear, if we avenge not ourselves on the slayers of our sons and of our brethren. Life would no more be sweet to me, but rather would I die straightway and be with the departed. Up, let us be going, <mark>lest these fellows</mark> be beforehand with us and get them over the sea.&apos; <small> Butcher &amp; Lang, trans. <a name="OHBL3" href="/udra/udex.htm#OHBL3"><cite title="source">The Odyssey Of Homer</cite></a> (1906), 401f</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
