But an attempt made by his son, Lord James Butler, to surprise Offaly recoiled on his own head, and he was only rescued from his dilemma by the news that the citizens of Dublin had turned on the besiegers of the castle and made prisoners of them. Having concluded a short truce with him, Offaly <mark>marched rapidly on Dublin</mark>. An assault made by him on the castle was repulsed with loss, and in a gallant sortie the citizens succeeded in completely routing his army. He himself narrowly escaped capture, <mark>being obliged to conceal himself in the Abbey of Grey Friars in Francis Street</mark>. <small> <a name="DNBF" href="/udra/udex.htm#DNBF"><cite title="source">Dictionary of National Biography</cite></a> (1889), &ldquo;Thomas Fitzgerald&rdquo;</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c16233d" href="../../../F/FF/fnbs/c16all.htm#c16233d">VI.C.16:233(d)</a> </dd> </dd></dl>
