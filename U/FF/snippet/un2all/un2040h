That this must date from very early days is evident from the fact that the best quality of iron, perhaps steel, took its ordinary name from them. In Homer iron is still a rarity, and used only for small implements. The knife of Achilles (11. xviii. 34), the arrow-head of Pandaros (iv. 485), may well have been fashioned near Tripolis and brought to Troy in Paphlagonian or Halizonian bottoms; even the <mark>lump of pig-iron which Achilles gives as a prize</mark> may have come hence. <small> Walter Leaf, <a name="WLAS" href="/udra/udex.htm#WLAS"><cite title="source">Troy: A Study in Homeric Geography</cite></a> (1912), 294</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c16268c" href="../../../F/FF/fnbs/c16all.htm#c16268c">VI.C.16:268(c)</a> </dd> </dd></dl>
