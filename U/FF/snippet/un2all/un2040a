Given certain economical and political conditions, Troy proclaims itself an ideal site for such exploitation. <mark>M. Victor B&eacute;rard, in Les Ph&eacute;niciens et l&apos;Odyss&eacute;e,</mark> starting from this correct assumption, offers a solution which, like so much of his work, is suggestive and attractive, but on inquiry appears to be untenable. He has called attention to the dominant influence on Mediterranean commerce of the combination, constantly found through the whole region, of winds and promontories. <small> Walter Leaf, <a name="WLAS" href="/udra/udex.htm#WLAS"><cite title="source">Troy: A Study in Homeric Geography</cite></a> (1912), 257</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c16267b" href="../../../F/FF/fnbs/c16all.htm#c16267b">VI.C.16:267(b)</a> </dd> </dd></dl>
