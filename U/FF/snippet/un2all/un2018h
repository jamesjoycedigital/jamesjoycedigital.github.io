Voysey, Annesley Lodge, Hampstead, London NW </blockquote> <dd class="well"><mm class="note">Note: This is the name and home address of Charles Voysey, the founder of the Theistic Church. Where Joyce got it, and why he wrote it down in his notebook, is a complete mystery. Voysey died in July 1912, so that Joyce could hardly have been corresponding with him in 1917, and certainly not at his earthly address. The <cite>Times</cite> did announce his Services, along with many others, each Saturday in June 1904, but invariably gave as address the Theistic Church, Swallow Street, Piccadilly, London W.  <br>Raphael transcription: <a name="c16246c" href="../../../F/FF/fnbs/c16all.htm#c16246c">VI.C.16:246(c)</a></mm></dd> </dd></dl>
