Not only are they prominent alike in war and counsel, but they alone are represented by their royal house. Nowhere else is any leader of the allies said to be the king of his country; but the Lykians are <mark>led by both their kings</mark>, the heads of the two branches of the royal family, as is set out for us in great detail in the famous meeting of Diomedes and <mark>Glaukos</mark>. In war, <mark>Sarpedon</mark> is second in importance only to Hector himself, and receives divine burial with more solenm circumstance than the Trojan prince. <small> Walter Leaf, <a name="WLAS" href="/udra/udex.htm#WLAS"><cite title="source">Troy: A Study in Homeric Geography</cite></a> (1912), 321f</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c16267a" href="../../../F/FF/fnbs/c16all.htm#c16267a">VI.C.16:267(a)</a> </dd> </dd></dl>
