We can thus identify, if not the names themselves, at least their elements somewhat differently arranged, along the coast in the neighbourhood of the mouths of the Halys and the Lycus. <small> Walter Leaf, <a name="WLAS" href="/udra/udex.htm#WLAS"><cite title="source">Troy: A Study in Homeric Geography</cite></a> (1912), 293f</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c16268e" href="../../../F/FF/fnbs/c16all.htm#c16268e">VI.C.16:268(e)</a></dd> </dd></dl>
