An expression of disbelief, evasive declaration that the person addressed is a liar. Perhaps the finest example extant of colloquial exclamations reaching to-day from pre-Reformation times. St Martin was, and is, the patron saint of beggars. The prayer to St Martin opens, &lsquo;<mark>0, mihi, beate Martine</mark>.&lsquo; This phrase was used by English mendicants (and is still used by South-Italian beggars) when asking for alms. When indiscriminate charity &lsquo;went out&rsquo; in England at the date of the Reformation, this phrase fell into bad repute as representing a lazy and lying class. It is still used by the commoner classes as an expression of doubt, though it has been very widely superseded by &lsquo;humbug&rsquo; (<i>q.v.</i>). <small> J.
