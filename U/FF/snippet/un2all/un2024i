The prison van, probably Anglicizing &lsquo;Black V.R.&rsquo;, this public conveyance being ink-coloured, and bearing V.R. on each side of it. To the ignorant V.R. would have no meaning; while Maria would; or it may be a rhyming effort. The New York prison van, though of course very different from the English carriage, bears the same name. He &lsquo;protested&rsquo; against entering the Black Maria, and on the way up &lsquo;would not admit&rsquo; that he was going to the Workhouse, but by this time he probably feels at home up there.&mdash;<cite>N.
