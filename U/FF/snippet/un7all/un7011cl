They doubtless exert some amount of protective influence over the entrance to the vagina, and in this way correspond to the lips of the mouth after which they are called. They fulfill, however, one very definite though not obviously important function which is indicated by the mythologic name they have received. There is, indeed, some obscurity in the origin of this term, nymph&aelig;, which has not, I believe, been satisfactorily cleared up. It has been stated that the Greek name &nu;&#973;&mu;&pi;&eta; has been transferred from the clitoris to the labia minora. Any such transfer could only have taken place when the meaning of the word had been forgotten, and &nu;&#973;&mu;&pi;&eta; had become the totally different word nymph&aelig;, the <mark>goddesses</mark> who presided over streams. The old anatomists were much exercised in their minds as to the meaning of the name, but on the whole were inclined to believe that it referred to the action of the labia minora in directing the <mark>urinary stream</mark>. <small> Havelock Ellis, <a name="HEPS2" href="/udra/udex.htm#HEPS2"><cite title="source">Studies in the Psychology of Sex</cite></a> (1906), vol.
