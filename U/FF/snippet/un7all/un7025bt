An indication of the high value placed on these treasured family heirlooms can be gauged from the payment of 140 milch cows that Aed &Oacute;g &Oacute; Domhnaill (Hugh &Oacute;g O&apos;Donnell), lord of T&iacute;r Conaill, paid The Mac Donnchaid (MacDonough) of Corann and Tirerril for the Book of Ballymote in 1522, one hundred years after it was written. This was a fortune at the time and was a payment equal to three times the &lsquo;honour price&rsquo; of The MacDonough himself (the restitution price fixed by Brehon Law for any serious offence committed against him). </mm> </dd></dl>
