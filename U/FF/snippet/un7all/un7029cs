So would the number 12. Thus we should have <mark>11=12</mark>; therefore the successor of 10 would be the same as the successor of 11, although 10 would not be the same as 11. Thus we should have two different numbers with the same successor. This failure of the third axiom cannot arise, however, if the number of individuals in the world is not finite. <small> Bertrand Russell, <a name="BRIM" href="/udra/udex.htm#BRIM"><cite title="source">Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy</cite></a> (1919), 24</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
