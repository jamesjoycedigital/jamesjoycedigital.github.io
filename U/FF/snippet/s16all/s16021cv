And quickly they embarked and sat upon the benches. And Telemachus bound his goodly sandals beneath his feet, and seized a mighty spear, shod with sharp bronze, from the deck of the ship and his men loosed the hawsers. So they thrust off and sailed to the city, as Telemachus bade them, the dear son of divine Odysseus. <small> Butcher &amp; Lang, trans. <a name="OHBL2" href="/udra/udex.htm#OHBL2"><cite title="source">The Odyssey Of Homer</cite></a> (1906), 257</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
