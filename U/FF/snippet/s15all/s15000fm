An ignorant loutish British private. Joyce seems to have selected the name Carr solely to reflect his (unjustified) contempt for Henry Carr, an individual he (unsuccessfully) sued in the period when he was involved with the English Players in Zurich. Carr was employed in the British Consulate in Zurich, having been invalided from his Black Watch Regiment. Joyce was happy to engage him as an actor. There was a dispute between them regarding payment to Carr, who subsequently pronounced Joyce a swindler and a cad, which in this instance he undoubtedly was. </mm> </dd></dl>
