Paul de Kock (1793–1871) was a French novelist. His books, dealing with Parisian life and amounting to more than a hundred titles, were out of print by major publishers for over a century, but many of them are now available (e.g., <a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/search?searchTerm=paul+de+Kock&search=Find+book" target="_blank">Bookdepository</a>. In his lifetime he was immensely popular among all classes of readers: the statesman as well as the commercial traveller and the schoolboy, the great ladies in society and the <i>grisettes</i>. Molly asks Bloom to pick up something of his for her to read while he is out, as she likes his writing: <br>&ldquo;Get another of <mark>Paul de Kock&apos;s</mark>. Nice name he has.&rdquo; </mm> </dd></dl>
