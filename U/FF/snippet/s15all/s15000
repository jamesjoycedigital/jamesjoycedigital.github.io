It was evidently intended to assist him in the particular inclusiveness of &ldquo;characters&rdquo; he wanted for that hallucinatory episode. <br>The text reference, here and elsewhere in this list of persons, is to the earliest (draft) citation of the character in the &lsquo;Circe&rsquo; episode, at which point Joyce would have marked the worksheet entry/character as now included (in such context as he then created). <br>In the list the episodes are each designated by a corresponding number (eg, 1 = &lsquo;Telemachus&rsquo;) prefixed to each group. The fifteen sets of names are neatly arranged in a series of boxes: 8 in two columns (1–4 and 5–8) on &lsquo;Circe&rsquo; sheet 20, and 7 (which prospectively includes &lsquo;Circe&rsquo; itself) also in two columns (9-12 and 13–15) on sheet 21. The organizing grid with its numbers was evidently laid out before any names were entered, as in some of the boxes the entries are compressed to fit. </div>
