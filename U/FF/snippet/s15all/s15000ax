See <a name="s15064u" href="s15all.htm#s15064u">Sheet 15.064(u)</a>. The priest officiating in the mortuary chapel: <br>&ldquo;<mark>Father Coffey</mark>. I knew his name was like a coffin. <i>Dominenamine</i>. Bully about the muzzle he looks. Bosses the show. Muscular christian. Woe betide anyone that looks crooked at him: priest. Thou art Peter. Burst sideways like a sheep in clover Dedalus says he will. With a belly on him like a poisoned pup. Most amusing expressions that man finds. Hhhn: burst sideways.&rdquo; </mm> </dd></dl>
