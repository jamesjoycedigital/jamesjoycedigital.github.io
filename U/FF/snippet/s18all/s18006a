Now the soul of the son of Peleus spake to him first, saying: &lsquo;Son of Atreus, verily we deemed that thou above all other heroes wast evermore dear to Zeus, whose joy is in the thunder, seeing that thou wast lord over warriors, many and mighty men, in the land of the Trojans where we Achaeans suffered affliction. But lo, thee too was deadly doom to visit early, the doom that none avoids of all men born. Ah, would that in the fulness of thy princely honour, thou hadst met death and fate in the land of the Trojans! So would all the Achaean host have builded thee a barrow, yea and for thy son thou wouldst have won great glory in the aftertime. But now it has been decreed for thee to perish by a most pitiful death.&rsquo; <small> Butcher &amp; Lang, trans. <a name="OHBL4" href="/udra/udex.htm#OHBL4"><cite title="source">The Odyssey Of Homer</cite></a> (1906), 388</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
