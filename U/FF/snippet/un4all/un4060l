A very difficult question that, for readers answer it one way and writers another. Some writers are Futuristic on alternate days, or every seventh day. One of these is Enrico Cavacchioli, a Sicilian living in Milan, the dramatic critic of the <cite>Secolo</cite> and the director of <cite>Il Mondo</cite> and of the publishing-house of Vitagliano. His reputation as a man of letters stands in no relation to his futurist poems. It does, however, to his compositions for the theatre, and especially to his great success, &ldquo;<mark>Uccello del Paradiso</mark>&rdquo; (&ldquo;Bird of Paradise&rdquo;). His last contribution, &ldquo;<mark>Quella che t&apos;assomiglia</mark>&rdquo; (&ldquo;That Which Resembles You&rdquo;), which he calls a vision in three acts, is a satire on the present-day interest in the occult and supernatural. <small> Joseph Collins, <a name="JCII" href="/udra/udex.htm#JCII"><cite title="source">Idling in Italy</cite></a> (1920), 84</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
