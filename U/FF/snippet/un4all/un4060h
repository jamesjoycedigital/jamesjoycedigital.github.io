It is difficult now to believe that C&eacute;zanne, Courbet, Renoir, Picasso, Henri Rousseau, Gauguin, Van Gogh, and the school of impressionists and neo-impressionists was so little known in Italy as they were at the time of the appearance of these articles from the pen of <mark>Ardengo Soffici</mark>, a painter by training and profession enrolled in the Futuristic movement. He was, in reality, the first to speak in Italy with appreciation and intelligence of the tendencies in French art shown in the last half-century which have to-day had such a stamp of profound approval put upon them. These criticisms attracted much attention from the first, and they have since been republished under the title of &ldquo;Scoperte e Massacri&rdquo; (&ldquo;Discoveries and Massacres&rdquo;), and to-day they constitute a trustworthy guide to the schools mentioned both in presentation and in description. <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> <p>The next book, a very small one, &ldquo;<mark>La Giostra dei Sensi</mark>&rdquo; (&ldquo;The Joust of the Senses&rdquo;), is a portrayal of the capacity shown by a &ldquo;lost soul&rdquo; for radiating unselfish love upon an individual who comes to her for meretricious contact but who stays to add to his spiritual stature. The scene is laid in Naples and the author utilizes the sheer beauty of the place and picturesqueness of the people to give an artistic setting for the description of the jousts. It could not possibly be published in England unless the publisher aspired to &ldquo;languish&rdquo; in prison.</p> <small> Joseph Collins, <a name="JCII" href="/udra/udex.htm#JCII"><cite title="source">Idling in Italy</cite></a> (1920), 76, 78f</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: Ardengo Soffici, <cite>La Giostra dei Sensi</cite> (Firenze: Edizioni Della Voce, 1918), a comedy in 3 acts. </mm> </dd></dl>
