For twenty years after this he was a pariah of the English press, writing odious, vulgar, extremely intelligent books, in which he extended his paradoxical thesis that private vices are public benefits. Mandeville was a daring thinker, who permitted no traditional prejudice, no habit of decency, to interfere with the progression of his ideas. <small> Edmund Gosse, <a name="EGSH" href="/udra/udex.htm#EGSH"><cite title="source">A Short History of Modern English Literature</cite></a> (1897), 225</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: Bernard Mandeville (1670-1733), Dutch-born satirist. <cite>Fable of the Bees</cite> appeared in 1714. </mm> </dd></dl>
