Ascham, whose authority with the university wits of the succeeding generation was potent, had deliberately stigmatised rhyme as barbarous. This notion exercised many minds, and was taken up very seriously by that charming paladin of the art, <mark>Sir PHILIP SIDNEY</mark>. His experiments may be glanced at in the pages of the <cite>Arcadia</cite>, and they were widely imitated. They followed, but were of the same order as the stilted Seneca tragedies, to which we shall presently refer, and, like them, were violently in opposition to the natural instinct of English poetry. Spenser would now have none of these "reformed verses," and in one of his early pieces, "The Oak and the Briar," went far to vindicate by his practice a freedom of prosody which was not to be accepted until the days of Coleridge and Scott. <small> Edmund Gosse, <a name="EGSH" href="/udra/udex.htm#EGSH"><cite title="source">A Short History of Modern English Literature</cite></a> (1897), 86f</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: Sir Philip Sidney (1554-1586), English stateman and writer.
