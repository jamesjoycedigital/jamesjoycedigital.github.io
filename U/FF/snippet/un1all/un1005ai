With his magnificent gaiety and buoyancy, Wycherley exaggerated and disfigured the qualities which should rule the comic stage, but they were there; he was a ruffian, but a ruffian of genius. <small> Edmund Gosse, <a name="EGSH" href="/udra/udex.htm#EGSH"><cite title="source">A Short History of Modern English Literature</cite></a> (1897), 191</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: William Wycherley (1640-1715), English dramatist. <cite>The Plain Dealer</cite> appeared in 1677.
