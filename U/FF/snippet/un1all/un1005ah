It would, of course, be very narrow-minded to judge the whole age by its plays. It had its pure divines, its refined essayists and scholars, its austere philosophers. But we cannot go far wrong in taking that redoubtable gossip Pepys as a type of the whole. <small> Edmund Gosse, <a name="EGSH" href="/udra/udex.htm#EGSH"><cite title="source">A Short History of Modern English Literature</cite></a> (1897), 195</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: Thomas Southerne (1660-1746), playwright, was born in Dublin. </mm> </dd></dl>
