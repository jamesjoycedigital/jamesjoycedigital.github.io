He speaks of the English of the time in other terms than those which we, looking forward and backward, are now inclined to use; but he asserts certain laws which it is easy for us to see were those which most of the Tudor writers of that age, men as unlike as Cavendish and Ascham, Bale and Leland, were unanimous in following. Writers, according to Wilson, ought "to speak as is commonly received," and who does that more than Latimer? They are not "to seek to be overfine, nor yet overcareless," and we are reminded of the wholesome, elegant roughness of the <cite>Toxophilus</cite> (1545). "To speak plainly and nakedly after the common sort of men in few words" is the motto of this simple critic, and in no work of that or any age is this ideal more bluntly lived up to than it is in GEORGE CAVENDISH&apos;S breezy and familiar <cite>Life of Wolsey</cite>. <small> Edmund Gosse, <a name="EGSH" href="/udra/udex.htm#EGSH"><cite title="source">A Short History of Modern English Literature</cite></a> (1897), 64</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: On the same line as Sidney.
