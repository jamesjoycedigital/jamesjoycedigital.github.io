Aristotle does not here define art; he says only, &ldquo;Art imitates Nature&rdquo; and means that the artistic process is like the natural process . . . . . . . . . . . . <p class="spbr">. . . . . . . . It is false to say that sculpture, for instance, is an art of repose if by that be meant that sculpture is noassociated with movement. Sculpture is associated with movement in as much as it is rhythmic; for a work of sculptural art must be surveyed according to its rhythm and this surveying is an imaginary movement in space. It is not false to say that sculpture is an art of repose in that a work of sculptural art cannot be presented as itself moving in space and remain a work of sculptural art.</p> <p class="duup"> (JasAJoyce / 27 March 1903 / Paris)</p> <p class="duup"> &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p></blockquote> </dl>
