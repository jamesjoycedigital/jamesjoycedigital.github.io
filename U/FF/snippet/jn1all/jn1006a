All art which excites in us the feeling of joy is so far comic and according as this feeling of joy is excited by whatever is substantial or accidental in human fortunes the art is to be judged more or less excellent: and even tragic art may be said to participate in the nature of comic art so far as the possession of a work of art (a tragedy) excites in us the feeling of joy. From this it may be seen that tragedy is the imperfect manner, and comedy the perfect manner, in art. All art, again, is static for the feelings of terror and pity on the one hand and of joy on the other hand are feelings which arrest us. It will be seen afterwards how this <feeling of> rest is necessary for the apprehension of the beautiful&mdash;the end of all art, tragic or comic&mdash;for this rest is the only condition under which the images, which are to excite in us terror or pity or joy, can be properly presented to us and properly seen by us. For beauty is a quality of something seen but terror and pity and joy are states of mind.</p> <p class="diip"> (JasAJoyce. / Feb.13.1903 / Paris)</p> </blockquote> <dd class="well"><mm class="note">Note: Continued from <a name="jn1005a" href="jn1all.htm#jn1005a">JN1 (NLI.2A):005(a)</a>.
