MARTHA of Bethany</mark>, A.D. 84, July 29. Patron saint of cooks and housewives. The old legends always regard Mary Magdalene as identical with Mary of Bethany, and according to them it was Martha who guided her sinning sister to the feet of Christ. After the Ascension, when the whole family were driven to Marseilles (see the legend of S. MARY MAGDALENE), Martha taught the people in the neighbourhood of Aix. Now at that time a terrible dragon, called the &ldquo;Tarasque,&rdquo; lived in the River Rhone, and ravaged all the country. But when Martha came there she completely overcame him, by sprinkling him with holy water, and bound him fast by her girdle, so that the people were able to approach and slay him. Afterwards a church was built on the spot, and the city of Tarascon rose around it. She spent her whole life in good works, and the honour has been assigned to her of being the first to found a religious community of women. She died peacefully, surrounded by her own people. <small> E. A.
