BARBARA</mark>, A.D. 303, Dec. 4. Patron saint of Ferrara and Mantua, arms, armourers, and fortifications, and against thunder and lightning. S. Barbara was the only daughter of Dioscorus, a noble of Heliopolis. Her father loved her so much, that fearing he should lose her by marriage, he hid her from the eyes of man in a high tower. Here she spent her time in thought and study, which brought her to the conclusion that her father&apos;s gods could not be the true ones. Hearing of the fame of Origen she wrote to him for instruction, and he sent her one of his disciples in the disguise of a physician, who converted and baptized her. One day, after this, she told the workmen engaged on her tower to build three windows, instead of two as they had planned, saying to her father that she desired it because it was through three windows (the Trinity) that the soul received light. Thus he saw she was a Christian, and filled with rage would have killed her, but she escaped to the top of her tower, and was carried thence by angels. A shepherd showed Dioscorus her place of concealment, whence he dragged her by the hair, and finding imprisonment and ill-treatment powerless to move her, he gave her up to the proconsul. Under his orders she suffered cruel tortures; but as all was in vain, her father carried her off to a mountain and beheaded her himself. As he was descending the mountain a great storm of thunder and lightning arose, and utterly consumed him. <small> E. A.
