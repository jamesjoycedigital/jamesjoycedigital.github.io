MARY of Egypt</mark>, A.D. 433, April 2, was a native of Alexandria, who even exceeded Mary Magdalene in the wickedness of her life. After nearly twenty years of complete abandonment to sin, she felt a sudden desire to join a large company whom she beheld embarking for Jerusalem to celebrate the Feast of the Cross. She accompanied them on their journey, but when she attempted, like them, to enter the Church of Jerusalem, some invisible power held her back, and it was impossible for her to cross the threshold. Then she knew it was by reason of her sins, and was struck with remorse and horror at her former evil life. She prayed earnestly, and humbled herself before God, and at last was enabled to enter the church on her knees. Full of repentance she determined to spend the rest of her life in solitude and penance; and taking with her nothing but three loaves, she went forth into the desert. Here she dwelt alone for forty-seven years, her loaves by a miracle never failing, and her hair growing long enough to be a covering when her garments dropped to pieces. At length she was discovered by an aged priest, named Zosimus, whom she begged to keep silence about her, and to return at the end of a year to administer the last sacraments to her before her death. He complied with her request, but on his return found himself unable to cross the Jordan, and Mary was miraculously brought over it to come to him. Having received the Blessed Sacrament, and absolution from all her sins, she once more desired Zosimus to depart for a year. On his second return he found her lying dead, with a request that he would bury her written on the sand near her. As he was too old to accomplish this alone, a lion came out of the desert and helped him. Then Zosimus went back and spread abroad the story of God&apos;s mercy to the penitent woman. <small> E. A.
