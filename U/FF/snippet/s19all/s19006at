ISIDORE the Ploughman</mark>, A.D. 1170, May 10, was a poor ignorant labourer, whose cruel master would not allow him time for devotion; until going into the fields one day he saw S. Isidore wrapt in prayer, while two angels were ploughing for him; after which he treated him with greater respect. Another day, when his master thirsted, S. Isidore struck a rock with his ox goad, and water immediately flowed from it. He restored to life his master&apos;s child who had fallen into a well, and performed various other miracles. <small> E.
