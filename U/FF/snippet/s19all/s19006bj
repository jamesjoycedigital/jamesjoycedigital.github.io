URSULA AND THE ELEVEN THOUSAND VIRGINS</mark>, A.D. 237, or 383, or 451, Oct 21. S. Ursula is the patron saint of girls, especially schoolgirls, and women occupied in the education of their own sex. She was the daughter of the King of Brittany, and the fame of her beauty and learning spread so far that many princes desired to marry her; but she rejected them all. Among her suitors was Conon, son of the King of Britain, to whom she sent a message that under three conditions only would she accept him; first, that he must be baptized; secondly, that he would give her as companions ten of the noblest ladies of his kingdom, each with a thousand virgins as attendants, and a thousand also for herself; thirdly, that they should spend three years in visiting sacred shrines. She thought that her demand was impossible, or, if by any means it could be fulfilled, eleven thousand virgins would be saved. The messengers took back such an account of Ursula&apos;s wisdom and beauty, that Conon did not rest till he had gathered together eleven thousand virgins, and brought them to Brittany. Then S. Ursula assembled them in a green meadow, and there preached to them so eloquently, that they were all converted, and received baptism in a stream flowing near. A large fleet of ships was prepared to take the virgins on their voyage. Accounts differ as to whether Conon accompanied them or remained in Brittany, but many bishops went with them. They had no sailors, the virgins themselves managing the vessels with the greatest skill; yet by some mistake they sailed north instead of south, and were driven up the Rhine as far as Cologne. Here it was revealed to S. Ursula that she and her companions should suffer martyrdom on that spot, and they all rejoiced greatly. They then proceeded up the river, and having crossed the Alps by the miraculous aid of angels, at length reached Rome. The Pope Cyriacus was much amazed at beholding such a company; but, when Ursula explained the cause of their coming and implored his blessing, he received them gladly. Now Conon, impatient at the absence of his bride, had followed her by a different route, and arrived in Rome the same day. He knelt with Ursula before the Pope, and received baptism at his hands, after which he no longer desired to marry her, but only to share her crown of martyrdom. Having performed their devotions at the shrine of SS. Peter and Paul, the whole company set out to return home. But at Cologne a tribe of Huns, instigated by some wicked officers, who feared that the whole Roman army in Germany would become converted, fell upon the virgins and slew them all. They met their fate without resistance, and rejoicing at their martyrdom. The King of the Huns was greatly struck by the noble bearing of S. Ursula, and wished to make her his wife; but she rejected him with scorn. This so enraged the barbarian that he bent his bow and pierced her with three arrows. Thus she died, and her spirit was born by angels to heaven. <small> E. A.
