And of the <mark>gifts</mark>, such as are treasures stored in my house, <mark>I will give thee</mark> the goodliest and greatest of price. I will give thee a mixing bowl beautifully wrought; it is all of silver and the lips thereof are finished with gold; it is the work of Hephaestus; and the hero Phaedimus the king of the Sidonians, gave it to me when his house sheltered me, on my coming thither. This cup I would give to thee.&rsquo;</p> <p>Therewith the hero Atrides set the double cup in his hands. And the strong Megapenthes bare the shining silver bowl and set it before him. And <mark>Helen</mark>, of the fair cheeks, came up, with the robe in her hands, and spake and hailed him:</p> <p>&lsquo;Lo! <mark>I too give thee this gift, dear child,</mark> a memorial of the hands of Helen, against the day of thy desire, even of thy marriage. But meanwhile let it lie by thy mother in her chamber. And may joy go with thee to thy well-builded house, and thine own country.&rsquo;</p> <small> Homer, <a name="OHBL0" href="/udra/udex.htm#OHBL0"><cite title="source">The Odyssey</cite></a>, trans.
