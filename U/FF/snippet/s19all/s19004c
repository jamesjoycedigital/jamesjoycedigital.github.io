He was far from prim himself, but he held that if people were not &ldquo;won over to Christ&rdquo; by preaching, it was idle to bait the hook with mere sensationalism. Yet by a strange irony his closest friends, in announcing his death to his flock, actually improved on the extravagance of the Salvationists. Here is a copy of the telegram that was affixed to the rails of the Metropolitan Tabernacle the morning after his decease: <p>Mentone, 11.50. / Spurgeon&apos;s Tabernacle, London.</p> <p>Our beloved pastor <mark>entered heaven 11.5 Sunday night</mark>.</p> <p>How could his soul enter heaven at the very same moment? Is heaven in the atmosphere? He who asserts it is a very bold speculator. Is it out in the ether? If so, where? And how is it our telescopes cannot detect it? If heaven is a place, as it must be if it exists at all, it cannot very well be within the astronomical universe. Now the farthest stars are inconceivably remote. Our sun is more than 90,000,000 miles distant, and Sirius is more than 200,000 times farther off than the sun. There are stars so distant that their light takes more than a thousand years to reach us, and light travels at the rate of nearly two hundred thousands miles per second! It is difficult to imagine Spurgeon&apos;s soul travelling faster than that; and if heaven is somewhere out in the vast void, beyond the sweep of telescopes or the register of the camera, <mark>Spurgeon&apos;s soul has so far not "entered heaven"</mark> that its journey thither is only just begun.</p> <small> G.
