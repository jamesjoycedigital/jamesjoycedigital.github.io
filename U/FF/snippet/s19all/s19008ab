Yea and godlike Deiphobus went with thee on thy way. <mark>Thrice thou didst go round about the hollow ambush and handle it, calling aloud on the chiefs of the Argives by name, and making thy voice like the voices of the wives of all the Argives</mark>. Now I and the son of Tydeus and goodly Odysseus sat in the midst and heard thy call; and verily we twain had a desire to start up and come forth or presently to answer from within; but <mark>Odysseus stayed and held us there</mark>, despite our eagerness. <small> Homer, <a name="OHBL0" href="/udra/udex.htm#OHBL0"><cite title="source">The Odyssey</cite></a>, trans.
