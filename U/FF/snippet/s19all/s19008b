Say, shall we loose their swift horses from under the yoke, or send them onward to some other host who shall receive them kindly?&rsquo;</p> <p>Then in sore displeasure spake to him Menelaus of the fair hair: &lsquo;<mark>Eteoneus son of Boethous, truly thou wert not a fool aforetime, but now for this once, like a child thou talkest folly</mark>. Surely ourselves ate much hospitable cheer of other men, ere we twain came hither, even if in time to come Zeus haply give us rest from affliction.&rsquo;</p> <small> Homer, <a name="OHBL0" href="/udra/udex.htm#OHBL0"><cite title="source">The Odyssey</cite></a>, trans.
