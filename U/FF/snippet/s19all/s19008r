And I thought to welcome him <font color="green">[Ulysses]</font> on his coming more nobly than all the other Argives, if but Olympian Zeus, of the far-borne voice, had vouchsafed us a return over the sea in our swift ships,&mdash;that such a thing should be. And in Argos <mark>I would have given him a city to dwell in, and stablished for him a house, and brought him forth from Ithaca with his substance and his son and all his people</mark>, making one city desolate of those that lie around, and are in mine own domain. Then ofttimes would we have held converse here, and nought would have parted us, the welcoming and the welcomed, ere the black cloud of death overshadowed us. <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font>&rsquo; <small> Homer, <a name="OHBL0" href="/udra/udex.htm#OHBL0"><cite title="source">The Odyssey</cite></a>, trans.
