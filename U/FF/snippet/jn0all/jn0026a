The <br>path leads me down to an obscure pool. <br>Something is moving in the pool; it is an <br>arctic beast with a rough yellow coat. I <br>thrust in my stick and as he rises out of <br>the water I see that his back slopes towards <br>the croup and that he is very sluggish. I <br>am not afraid but, thrusting at him often <br>with my stick drive him before me. He <br>moves his paws heavily and mutters words <br>of some language which I do not understand. </blockquote> <dd class="well"><mm class="note">Note: Silverman/La Hune no. VII.
