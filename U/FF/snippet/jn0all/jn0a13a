In amity we rest together, well content, no more remembering the deviousness of the ways that we have come, What moves upon me from the darkness subtle and murmurous as a flood, passionate and fierce with an indecent movement of the loins? What leaps, crying in answer, out of me, as eagle to eagle in mid air, crying to overcome, crying for an iniquitous abandonment? </blockquote> <dd class="well"><mm class="note">Note: Cornell 17, p.53.
