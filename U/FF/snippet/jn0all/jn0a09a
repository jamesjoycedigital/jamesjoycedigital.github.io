I&apos;ll say another Prayer&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I am hungry; yet I would like to stay here in this quiet chapel where the mass has come and gone so quietly&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Hail, holy Queen, Mother of Mercy, our life, our sweetness and our hope! Tomorrow and every day after I hope I shall bring you some virtue as an offering for I know you will be pleased with me if I do. Now, goodbye for the present&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. O, the beautiful sunlight in the avenue and O, the sunlight in my heart! </blockquote> <dd class="well"><mm class="note">Note: Cornell 17, pp.46-47. In Stanislaus Joyce&apos;s hand.</mm> </dd></dl>
