Go down before the people, young boy, and dance for them&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He runs out darkly-clad, lithe and serious to dance before the multitude. There is no music for him. He begins to dance far below in the amphitheatre with a slow and supple movement of the limbs, passing from movement to movement, in all the grace of youth and distance, until he seems to be a whirling body, a spider wheeling amid space, a star. I desire to shout to him words of praise, to shout arrogantly over the heads of the multitude &ldquo;See! See!&rdquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. His dancing is not the dancing of harlots, the dance of the daughters of Herodias. It goes up from the midst of the people, sudden and young and male, and falls again to earth in tremulous sobbing to die upon its triumph. </blockquote> <dd class="well"><mm class="note">Note: Cornell 17, pp.50-51.
