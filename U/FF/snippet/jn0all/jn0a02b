Not so faint now as they near the bridge, and as they pass under the dark windows, the air is cloven by alarm as with an arrow. They are heard now far away, hoofs that shine through the heavy night like diamonds, hurrying beyond the grey marshes to what journey&apos;s end &mdash; what heart &mdash; bearing what tidings. </blockquote> <dd class="well"><mm class="note">Note: Cornell 4.151v.
