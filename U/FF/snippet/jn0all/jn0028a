The scene related presumably occurred soon after Joyce published <a href="https://archive.org/details/twoessaysforgott00skefrich" target="_blank"><cite>The Day of the Rabblement</cite></a> (November 1901). It appeared together with an essay by Francis Joseph Skeffington. Skeffington married Hanna Sheehy in 1903 and changed his name to Sheehy-Skeffington. He was killed on 26 April 1916 by an illegal British Army firing-squad.</mm> </dd></dl>
