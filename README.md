## Notes for contributors
#### (In increasing level of technical confidence) 

### Github UI

1. Select branch development. There is a drop down labeled main (initally) above the listed folders and files.

2. Navigate to the file you wish to change say /f/ff/snippet/c01all/c01001. If you are having difficulty finding the file copy 
https://github.com/jamesjoycedigital/jamesjoycedigital.github.io/blob/development/f/ff/snippet/c01all/c01001 into the UI and update the url accordingly (say change the notebook entry code). This technique can be useful as at this point there is more files in some folders than can actually be displayed in the browser UI. 

3. Click the edit button ( a pencil icon top right of the raw content).

4. Make changes. Then scroll to the bottom and click commit changes. Before this you can optionally add a title and some extra information about what you are up to. 

5. Once you have made all the changes you wish to (you can make as many changes and commits as you like) click the pull request button. It is on the middle nav bar between issues and actions.

6. On the pull request page click the green 'New Pull Request' button.

7. Under Compare Changes select base:main and compare:development, Then create pull request. 

8. At this point you can navigate to files changed to see exactly what has changed.
