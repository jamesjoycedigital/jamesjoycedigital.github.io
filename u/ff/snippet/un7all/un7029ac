It was Pythagoras who <mark>discovered the existence of incommensurables, and, in particular, the incommensurability of the side of a square and the diagonal</mark>. If the length of the side is 1 inch, the number of inches in the diagonal is the square root of 2, which appeared not to be a number at all. <small> Bertrand Russell, <a name="BRIM" href="/udra/udex.htm#BRIM"><cite title="source">Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy</cite></a> (1919), 4</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
