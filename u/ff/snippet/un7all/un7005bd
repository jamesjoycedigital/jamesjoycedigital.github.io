He served as chief of general staff 1915-1918, and was made a baronet in 1919. Phillip Herring suggests that this unit derives from a <a href="../../ff/ubiog/robertson.pdf" target="_blank">table on page 387</a> of Robertson&apos;s own <cite>From Private to Field-Marshal</cite> (London: Constable, 1921).
