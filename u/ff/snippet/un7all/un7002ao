The precise object of its construction is unknown, for the common report, that it was intended to be of an elevation sufficient to overlook <mark>Cadiz Bay</mark>, deserves little attention: it stands on an elevated projecting point of the rock, in a commanding position, but although the remains of buildings, apparently for a guard-house, adjoin it, there are none indicative of a battery. The view from it is equally grand and magnificent; and immediately below it lies <mark>the table land, called Windmill Hill, with its fine range of barracks</mark>, the Jews&apos; burial ground, Europa point, Rosia, the arsenal, &amp;c. <small> An Old Inhabitant, <a name="TTHG" href="/udra/udex.htm#tthg"><cite title="source">The traveller's handbook for Gibraltar</cite></a> (1844), 48f</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
