This argument is fallacious, partly because &ldquo;being&rdquo; is not a term having any definite meaning, and still more because, if a definite meaning were invented for it, it would be found that <mark>numbers do not have being</mark> they are, in fact, what are called &ldquo;<mark>logical fictions</mark>,&rdquo; as we shall see when we come to consider the definition of classes. <small> Bertrand Russell, <a name="BRIM" href="/udra/udex.htm#brim"><cite title="source">Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy</cite></a> (1919), 138</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
