Under his rule, Tara flourished. He is credited for building many of the monuments there, such as the Banqueting Hall, Cormac&apos;s house and Grainne&apos;s Enclosure, named after his daughter, Gr&aacute;inne. <p>Cormac choked to death on a salmon bone. Some versions ascribe this on a curse laid by a druid because Cormac had converted to Christianity. The <cite>Annals of the Four Masters</cite> date his reign to 226-266. (An entry in the Annals of Ulster, however, dates his death as late as 366.) The annals date Patrick&apos;s arrival in Ireland at 432, but they were compiled in the mid-sixth century at the earliest. The date 432 was probably chosen to minimise the contribution of Palladius who was known to have been sent to Ireland in 431, and maximise that of Patrick. A variety of dates are given for his death. In 457 &lsquo;the elder Patrick&rsquo; (Patraic Sen) is said to have died: this may refer to the death of Palladius, who according to the Book of Armagh was also called Patrick. In 461/2 the annals say that &lsquo;Here some record the repose of Patrick&rsquo;; in 492/3 they record the death of &lsquo;Patrick, the arch-apostle (or archbishop and apostle) of the Scoti&rsquo;, on 17 March, at the age of 120.</p> </mm> </dd></dl>
