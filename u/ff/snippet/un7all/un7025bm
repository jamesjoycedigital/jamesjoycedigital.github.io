This treaty gave a formal legal and constitutional foundation to the rights of citizenship and other privileges that Irish exiles and emigr&eacute;s enjoyed in Habsburg Spain, Habsburg Austria and Habsburg Netherlands (present-day Belgium and Luxembourg), from the sixteenth to the early twentieth centuries. <p>Don Gonzalo Fernandez, who arrived in Dingle in 1529 wrote of his meeting with the Earl of Desmond: &ldquo;The earl himself is from 30 to 40 years old and is rather above the middle height. He keeps better justice throughout his dominions than any other chief in Ireland. Robbers and homicides find no mercy and are executed out of hand. His people are in high order and discipline. They are armed with short bows and swords. The earl&apos;s guard are in mail from neck to heel and carry halberds. He has also a number of horse some of whom know how to break a lance. They all ride admirably without saddle or stirrup.&rdquo;</p> </mm> </dd></dl>
