Before the anointing we accompanied the Queen into St. Edward&apos;s Chapel&mdash;as unlike a chapel to all appearances as possible&mdash;where she was robed in a sort of white muslin wrapper, trimmed with very fine Brussels lace, and the <mark>dalmatic</mark>, a robe of cloth-of-gold, worked with the rose, shamrock, and thistle in colors, and lined with crimson. The diamond circlet was taken off, and the mantle (to our great relief), and she reappeared in the Abbey bareheaded, and simply wearing the dalmatic. <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> After the homage we returned with the Queen to the chapel, where her <mark>mantle</mark>&mdash;now a <mark>purple</mark> one&mdash;was fastened on, and we waited for three-quarters of an hour for the procession to form in the same manner as on entering the Abbey. <small> Marquis of Lorne, <a name="VRIL" href="/udra/udex.htm#VRIL"><cite title="source">V.R.I.
