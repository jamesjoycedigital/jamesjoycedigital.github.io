King. </blockquote> <dd class="well"><mm class="note">Note: Following his failed rebellion in 1565, Sir James FitzMaurice Fitzgerald submitted to the authority of Elizabeth I and was pardoned, but he lost all his own holdings to the English and was removed from the stewardship of the Earl of Desmond&apos;s territories. English Protestant adventurers such as Peter Carew and Sir Walter Raleigh coveted the Catholic-held estates in Munster, and FitzMaurice, fearing for his safety, decided to flee to the Continent. So it was that in 1575 he, with his wife and children sailed to the French port of St. Malo. In France, he sought an audience at the French court with the intention of winning support for an invasion of Ireland. This was declined, but Catherine de Medici, the Queen Consort, granted him a pension of 5,000 crowns. He then travelled to Spain where he approached King Phillip II for help. He put forward a proposal that Don John of Austria, Phillip&apos;s brother, would become king of Ireland. Again his plans were rebuffed. </mm> </dd></dl>
