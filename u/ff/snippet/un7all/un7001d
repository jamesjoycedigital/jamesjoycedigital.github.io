Several varieties are cultivated in gardens, where the fruit arrives at great perfection, and trees of great size have been grown, one having been measured at 48 feet in circumference, and supposed to be upwards of 200 years old. Cf. &ldquo;The Gardens are beautifully situated between the British and Spanish towns. Luxuriant and tropical vegetation produces a horticultural effect which would be hard to surpass. Geraniums 10 feet in height and heliotrope in profusion add beauty to the scene and fill the air with fragrance. Pepper, coffee, and fig trees flourish here also.&rdquo; (<cite>U.S. Navy Ports of the World: Gibraltar</cite> [Washington, Govt. Print. Off.; 1920), p.16. </mm> </dd></dl>
