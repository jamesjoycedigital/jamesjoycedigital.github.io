As an infant, Paris was left to die, as his destiny was foretold in a dream to Hecuba, but he survived and was reared by a shepherd, but eventually returned to his family, to reclaim his birthright as prince. After the war, Hecuba was given to Odysseus. She is said to have died either at the hands of the Greek people, or by throwing herself off Odysseus&apos; ship in the middle of sea. </mm> </dd></dl>
