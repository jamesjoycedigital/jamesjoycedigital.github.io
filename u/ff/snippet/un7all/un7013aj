It is regarded to be the first comic strip magazine to feature a recurring character, Ally Sloper, a lazy, idle schemer often found &lsquo;sloping&rsquo; through alleys to avoid his landlord and other creditors. Ally had debuted in 1867 in the humour magazine <cite>Judy</cite>, and was created by writer and fledgling artist Charles Henry Ross and inked and later fully illustrated by his French wife Emilie de Tessier (&lsquo;Marie Duval&rsquo;). Joyce intends that Bloom be so imagined. The name later entered popular language as &lsquo;a dissipated-looking old man with a red and swollen nose&rsquo; (see Ware&apos;s <cite>Passing English of the Victorian Era</cite>, <a href="https://archive.org/details/passingenglishof00wareuoft/page/6/mode/2up" target="_blank">p. 6</a>. </mm> </dd></dl>
