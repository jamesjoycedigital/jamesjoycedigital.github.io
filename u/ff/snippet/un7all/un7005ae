It is called into fatal activity by some autumnal atmospherical peculiarity. The average visitation is about every twelve years. The quarantine regulations, especially as regards ships coming from the Havana and Alexandria, are severe: they are under the control of the captain of the port. There is an excellent civil hospital here, arranged in 1815 by Gen. Don. in which Protestants, Roman Catholics, and Jews have their wards separate, like their creeds. <small> Richard Ford, <a name="RFHG" href="/udra/udex.htm#rfhg"><cite title="source">A Handbook for Travellers in Spain</cite></a> (1855), 274</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
