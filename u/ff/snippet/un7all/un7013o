The sound marks the time (just after 11 on a Sunday morning) as well as the location of the boarding house where Mrs. Mooney sits conspiring to collect her &lsquo;reparations&rsquo; from Bob Doran, who has been carrying on an affair with her daughter Polly. It has a fine set of bells, the gift in 1828 of its munificent architect, Francis Johnson, Esq. I don&apos;t know their names (the bells). </mm> </dd></dl>
