He (being near a / burial ground) said to them: <u>Signori, voi / mi potete dire a casa vostra cio che vi / piace</u>. His speculations (he held the views / of Epicurus) <u>eran solo in cercare se / trovar si potesse che Iddio non fosse</u> (Bocc 6.viii) </blockquote> <dd class="well"><mm class="note">Note: The following is a transalation of the relevant passage. <p class="set">Amongst these societies of gentlemen there was one of which Signor Betto Brunelleschi was the principal, who was desirous always of procuring Guido Cavalcanti to be one of their body, and not without reason; for, besides his being one of the best logicians in the world, as well as natural philosopher, for which they had no great regard, he was a most polite good-natured man, as well as an excellent companion, and nobody knew what belonged to a gentleman better than himself: besides this, he was very rich, and ready always to reward merit wherever he found it. But Signor Betto was never able to draw him into their assembly, which they all attributed to his speculative way of life; and because he was said to hold some of the Epicurean doctrines, the vulgar used to report that all this study of his was only to learn whether there was a God or not. One day he was passing from St. Michael&apos;s Church along by the Ademari to St. John&apos;s, which was his usual walk, and the large marble tombs, such as are now at St. Reparata&apos;s, were then about the church: and he chanced to be amongst them, the church door being shut, when Betto and his company came riding through the square; who, getting sight of him, spurred their horses and came up to him before he perceived them; whilst one of them said, &ldquo;Guido, thou refusest to be of our society: but when thou hast found out that there is no God, what good will it have done thee?&rdquo; He, seeing himself surrounded, immediately replied, &ldquo;Gentlemen, you may use me as you please in your own territories;&rdquo; and, laying his hand upon one of the arches, he leaped nimbly over it and so made his escape.
