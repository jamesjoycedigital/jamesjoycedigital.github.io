Reuben J. Dodd was a Dublin-based solicitor and moneylander, to whom John Joyce became heavily indebted. Dodd&apos;s son (also named Reuben) was a student in the same class as Joyce at Belvedere College. On 2 December 1911 the younger Dodd threw himself in desperation into the Liffey in an attempt at ending his life. He swum about a little but failed to make meaningful use of a lifebuoy thrown to him by a passing docker, one Moses Goldin, who had, it was reported, in recent years saved some twenty persons from drowning in the same river. After fishing Dodd out, Goldin was taken to a hospital as he suffered from pulmonary trouble brought about by the past exertions. On being visited by Goldin&apos;s wife, who had lost a day&apos;s wages (a shilling) through absence from the sack factory that employed her, the senior Dodd (after much delay) informed the poor woman that her husband should have minded his own business. After further unsolicited and unwelcomed advice, the solicitor handed over 2s./6d. to assist her. The newspaper article reporting the events concludes: &ldquo;Mr. Dodd thinks his son is worth half-a-crown. We wouldn&apos;t give that amount for a whole family of Dodds&rdquo;. </mm> </dd></dl>
