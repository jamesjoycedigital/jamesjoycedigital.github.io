Bella Cohen, Joyce&apos;s man-hating Orc, was not fictitious; her maiden name was Bella. She ran her shop out of 82 Tyrone Street, lower, not (as cited in &lsquo;Circe&rsquo;) at No. 81. No 81, in 1904, was rented by a Miss Callan. Curiously, the correct address {no. 82) is cited in &lsquo;Ithaca&rsquo;. At one time in the late 1890s No. 82 housed a Midnight Mission set up by some Protestant clergymen with the fervent desire of reforming the whores of Dublin. Joyce&apos;s portrait of the massive whore-mistress may borrow something from another well-known madam, Mrs Peggy Arnott. She ruled the roost at No. 83 and was by repute herself a fine figure of a woman. She lived in a large, eminently respectable house elsewhere in Dublin and sent her daughter to a finishing-school in England. And all out of the takings from No. 83. </mm> </dd></dl>
