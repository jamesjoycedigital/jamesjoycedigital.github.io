He was lying apart from the rest of my men on the housetop of Circe&apos;s sacred dwelling, very fain of the cool air, as one heavy with wine. Now when he heard the noise of the voices and of the feet of my fellows as they moved to and fro, he leaped up of a sudden and minded him not to descend again by the way of the tall ladder, but fell right down from the roof, and his neck was broken from the bones of the spine, and his spirit went down to the house of Hades. <small> Butcher &amp; Lang, trans. <a name="OHBL1" href="/udra/udex.htm#ohbl1"><cite title="source">The Odyssey Of Homer</cite></a> (1906), [Book X] 171</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: Cf. <cite>UG</cite> 15.3377ff.
