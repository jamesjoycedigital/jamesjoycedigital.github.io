See UN4044(bi). Gerty&apos;s friends, squinty Eddy Boardman and gawky Cissy Caffrey, stand in for Nausicaa&apos;s slave girls. These run off when Odysseus pops naked out of his hiding place. The misplaced ball occurs in both texts precisely at the moment when the hero makes his appearance. The time of day, however, is upside down. Nausicaa encounters Odysseus towards noon, whereas Gerty and Bloom meet at sunset. </mm> </dd></dl>
