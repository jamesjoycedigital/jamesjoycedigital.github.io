Joyce shaped his account of Patrick Dignam&apos;s funeral on that of Matthew F. Kane, the chief clerk in the crown solicitor&apos;s office, Dublin. Kane died of heart disease on 13 July 1904, at the young age of 40. He had been bathing from a boat in Dublin Bay. Kane&apos;s wife was an alcoholic and, according to Stanislaus Joyce, a &ldquo;consummate whore&rdquo;. Joyce, who attended the funeral, long retained a newspaper cutting of the event. A second source of inspiration for Joyce was the funeral of his brother George, whose death is poignantly related (under the guise of being a sister, Isabel) in <i>Stephen Hero</i>. George died on 14 March 1902, aged fourteen, some months before James left University College. </mm> </dd></dl>
