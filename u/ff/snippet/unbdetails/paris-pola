<dl id="Paris-Pola">   <dt><h4>Pre-<cite>Ulysses</cite> Notebooks</h4>   </dt>   <dd>Although they were availed of in its composition, these notes predate the beginning of Joyce's writing of <cite>Ulysses</cite>. They also appear to predate Joyce's habit of crossing out entries once used, though he may have desisted from doing so as the notebooks had sentimental value to him. Their initial usage was likely on now lost drafts, but we have indicated in the JJDA the earliest <i>extant</i> drafts where the material appears.   </dd>   </dl>
