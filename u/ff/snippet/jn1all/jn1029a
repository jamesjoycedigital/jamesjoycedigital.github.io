Thomas Aquinas.</p> <p class="spbr">The good is that towards the possession of which an appetite tends: the good is the desirable. The true and the beautiful are the most persistent orders of the desirable. Truth is desired by the intellectual appetite which is appeased by the most satisfying relations of the intelligible; beauty is desired by the esthetic appetite which is appeased by the most satisfying relations of the sensible. The true and the beautiful are spiritually possessed; the true by intellection, the beautiful by apprehension, and the appetites which desire to possess them, the intellectual and esthetic appetites, are therefore spiritual appetites . . . . . . <p class="duup"> JAJ</p> <p class="duup"> Pola.7.XI.04.</p> </blockquote> <dd class="well"><mm class="note">Note: Copied onto Yale 1.1-2.
