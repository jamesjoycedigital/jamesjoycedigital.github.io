The act of apprehension, however, in its most complete form involves three activities &mdash; the third being the activity of satisfaction. By reason of the fact that these three activities are all pleasant themselves every sensible object that has been apprehended must be doubly and may be trebly beautiful. In practical esthetic philosophy the epithets &ldquo;beautiful&rdquo; and &ldquo;ugly&rdquo; are applied with regard chiefly to the third activity, with regard, that is, to the nature, degree and duration of the satisfaction resultant from the apprehension of any sensible object and therefore any sensible object to which in practical esthetic philosophy the epithet "beautiful" is applied must be trebly beautiful, must have encountered, that is, the three activities which are involved in the act of apprehension in its most complete form. Practically then the quality of beauty in itself must involve three constituents to encounter each of these three activities . . . . <p class="duup"> JAJ</p> <p class="duup"> Pola. 16.XI.04.</p></blockquote> </dl>
