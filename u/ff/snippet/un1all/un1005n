This interesting satirist displayed a survival of the eighteenth-century temper in nineteenth-century forms, and thought of Voltaire when the rest of the world was thinking of Scott, whom Peacock considered "amusing only because he misrepresented everything." The new was singularly odious to him; it was only in the old, the classical, the Attic, that he could take any pleasure. The poetry of Peacock, both serious and ludicrous, has a charm of extreme elegance but the qualities of his distinguished mind are best observed in his curious satirical or grotesque romances, seven in number, of which <mark><cite>Headlong Hall</cite></mark> (1816) was the first, and <mark><cite>Nightmare Alley</cite></mark> (1818) doubtless the most entertaining. His latest novel, <cite>Gryll Grange</cite>, appeared so late as 1860, and Peacock outlived all his contemporaries, dying at a great age in 1866. <small> Edmund Gosse, <a name="EGSH" href="/udra/udex.htm#egsh"><cite title="source">A Short History of Modern English Literature</cite></a> (1897), 330f</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: Thomas Love Peacock (1785-1866), English satirist. </mm> </dd></dl>
