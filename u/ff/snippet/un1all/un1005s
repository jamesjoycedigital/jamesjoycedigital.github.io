His <cite>Constitutional History of England</cite> came nine years later. In his old age Hallam made a track through the previously pathless waste of general European literature. His gravity is supported by a vast basis of solid knowledge, his judgment is sane and balanced, and to his immediate contemporaries his style appeared remarkable for "succinctness and perspicuous beauty." But the modern writer is not so well pleased with Hallam, who begins to be the Georgian type of the falsely impressive. <small> Edmund Gosse, <a name="EGSH" href="/udra/udex.htm#egsh"><cite title="source">A Short History of Modern English Literature</cite></a> (1897), 325f</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: Henry Hallam (1777-1859), English Historian. </mm> </dd></dl>
