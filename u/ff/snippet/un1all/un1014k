On p. 321, the writer states: <mark>&lsquo;When the tension of oxygen in the inhaled air descends below 8 per cent., any acquisition of memory becomes absolutely impossible, as the metabolism of fixation has been brought to a standstill.&rsquo;</mark> This reminds us immediately of Mr. Leadbeater&apos;s statement in the same series of articles in the December number (1909), p. 381, that in the future for educational uses at school the various brain-centres of the children will be &lsquo;sprayed&rsquo; with the influences of light, color, sound and electricity. It is certainly conceivable that by such a proceeding the metabolism of memory and other mental processes might be stimulated, as they are dulled by others.&rsquo; <br> Translation and commentary by Johan van Manen. <small> <a name="THoct1910" href="/udra/udex.htm#thoct1910"><cite title="source">The Theosophist</cite></a> (October 1910), Henri Pi&eacute;ron, &ldquo;THE EVOLUTION AND SOCIALISATION OF MEMORY&ldquo; p.125</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: Copied to <a name="un5003g" href="un5all.htm#un5003g">UN5 (NLI.5B):003(g)</a> for <cite>UG</cite> 4.136.</mm> </dd></dl>
