In medi&aelig;val alchemical symbolism, which continued the tradition of the age-old secret, the symbolic figure of the Mystery of many names has <mark>one hand pointing upward</mark> and <font color="green">[end of 367]</font> <mark>the other downward</mark>; above the one is the legend <mark>&ldquo;Solve&rdquo;</mark> and below the latter <mark>&ldquo;Coagula&rdquo;</mark>&mdash;the injunctions to separate and unite. But indeed the symbolism is widespread and a lengthy treatise could be written upon it; the Right is always regarded as the place of honour and the Left of dishonour, the &ldquo;sheep&rdquo; are to be set on the right hand and the &ldquo;goats&rdquo; on the left. <small> <a name="THRdec1908" href="/udra/udex.htm#thrdec1908"><cite title="source">The Theosophical Review</cite></a> (December 1908), G.
