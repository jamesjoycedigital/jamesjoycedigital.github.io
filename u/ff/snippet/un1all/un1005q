From that interesting Scottish author, Mary Brunton, whose <cite>Self-Control</cite> (1811) and <cite>Discipline</cite> (1814) are excellent precursors of a long series of "kail-yard" fiction, there naturally descended the delightful <mark>Miss Ferrier</mark>, whose <mark><cite>Marriage</cite></mark> (1818) charmed not only the author of <cite>Waverley</cite>, but a host of lesser readers, by its lively humour and its delicious satire of many types of Scotch womanhood. Miss Ferrier would be a Doric Jane Austen, were her skill in the evolution of a plot a little better trained, and her delineation of character a little more sternly restrained from caricature. The story of her delicate tact in soothing the shattered faculties of Sir Walter Scott has endeared Miss Ferrier to thousands who never read her three amusing novels. <small> Edmund Gosse, <a name="EGSH" href="/udra/udex.htm#EGSH"><cite title="source">A Short History of Modern English Literature</cite></a> (1897), 327</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: Susan Edmonstone Ferrier (1782-1854), Scottish novelist.</mm> </dd></dl>
