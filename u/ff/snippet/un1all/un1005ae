In his own day respected, but not highly regarded as a writer, he has gradually so strengthened his hold upon us by the purity of his taste, that in an age of predominance in prose we regard him as a master. In spite of Shaftesbury, Berkeley is the greatest English thinker between Locke and Hume, and as a pure metaphysician he is perhaps without a rival. His person and his character were as charming as his genius, and when he came up to London for the first time in 1713 he conquered all hearts. Pope expressed everybody&apos;s conviction when he declared that there had been given "to Berkeley every virtue under heaven." He had at that time already circulated his curious hypothesis of phenomenalism, his theory that what we see and touch is only a symbol of what is spiritual and eternal&mdash;that nothing is, but only seems to be. His writings, long pondered and slowly produced, culminated in 1744 in the brilliant and paradoxical treatise on the merits of tar-water, which was afterwards called <mark><cite>Siris</cite></mark>. <p>Locke had almost removed philosophy outside the confines of literature; Shaftesbury had shown that the philosopher could be elegant, florid, and illustrative; it remained for Berkeley to place it for a moment on the level of poetry itself. There had, perhaps, been written in English no prose so polished as that of Berkeley. Without languor or insipidity, with a species of quiet, unstrained majesty, Berkeley achieved the summit of a classic style. No student of the age of Anne should fail to study that little volume of dialogues which Berkeley issued under the title of <mark><cite>Hylas and Philonous</cite></mark>.</p> <small> Edmund Gosse, <a name="EGSH" href="/udra/udex.htm#EGSH"><cite title="source">A Short History of Modern English Literature</cite></a> (1897), 228f</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: George Berkelely (1685-1753), Irish philosopher. <cite>Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous</cite> was published in 1713, and <cite>Siris</cite> in 1744. </mm> </dd></dl>
