We call <mark><cite>Tristram Shandy</cite></mark> (1760-67) and <cite>A Sentimental Journey</cite> (1768) novels, because we know not what else to call them; nor is it easy to define their fugitive and rare originality. Sterne was not a moralist in the mode of Richardson or of Fielding; it is to be feared that he was a complete ethical heretic; but he brought to his country as gifts the strained laughter that breaks into tears, and the melancholy wit that saves itself by an outburst of buffoonery. He introduced into the coarse and heavy life of the eighteenth century elements of daintiness, of persiflage, of moral versatility; he prided himself on the reader&apos;s powerlessness to conjecture what was coming next. <small> Edmund Gosse, <a name="EGSH" href="/udra/udex.htm#EGSH"><cite title="source">A Short History of Modern English Literature</cite></a> (1897), 244</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: Laurence Sterne (1713-1767), Irish writer. </mm> </dd></dl>
