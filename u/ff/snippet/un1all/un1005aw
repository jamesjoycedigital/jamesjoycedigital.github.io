In 1489 this curious person was created Poet Laureate at the University of Oxford, and in 1493 made laureate to the King at Cambridge, being habited for the occasion in a green and white dress, with a wreath of laurel, and the word <i>Calliope</i> embroidered in golden letters of silk on his gown. From the earliest infancy of the Duke of York (afterwards Henry VIII.) Skelton was his tutor, and Erasmus called him the <i>decus et lumen</i> of British letters. He has the reputation of disgusting ribaldry, but when he chooses to be sober, Skelton is delicately ornate to affectation. <small> Edmund Gosse, <a name="EGSH" href="/udra/udex.htm#EGSH"><cite title="source">A Short History of Modern English Literature</cite></a> (1897), 67</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: On the same line as Lyly.
