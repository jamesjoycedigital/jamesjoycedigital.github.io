This species of chamber-music instantly became the fashion, and remained so for at least some quarter of a century. It was necessary to find words for these airs, and the poems so employed were obliged to be lucid, liquid, brief, and of a temper suited to the gaiety and sadness of the instrument. The demand created the supply, and from having been heavy and dissonant to a painful degree, English lyrics suddenly took a perfect art and sweetness. <small> Edmund Gosse, <a name="EGSH" href="/udra/udex.htm#EGSH"><cite title="source">A Short History of Modern English Literature</cite></a> (1897), 89</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: Thomas Tallis (c. 1515-1585), &ldquo;the father of English cathedral music&rdquo;, wrote many anthems, responses and Te Deums. </mm> </dd></dl>
