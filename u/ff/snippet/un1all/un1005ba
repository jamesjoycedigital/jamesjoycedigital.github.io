Piers Plowman</blockquote> <dd class="well"> <blockquote class="sources">The earliest poem of high value which we meet with in modern English literature is the thrilling and mysterious <mark><cite>Vision of Piers Plowman</cite></mark>. According to the view which we choose to adopt, this brilliant satire may be taken as closing the mediaeval fiction of England or as starting her modern popular poetry. <cite>Visio willelmi de petro plowman</cite> is the only title of this work which has come down to us, and the only contemporary hint of its authorship. <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> <p>There is little doubt that his name was <mark>WILLIAM LANGLAND</mark> (or William of Langley); that he was born, about 1332, at Cleobury Mortimer, in Shropshire; that he was of humble birth, though not of the humblest; that he was brought up for the Church, but never passed out of the lesser orders; that he suffered the loss of most that was dear to him in the great plague of 1349; that he came up to London and became a canonical singer became, in fact, a chaunter at St. Paul&apos;s, by which he contrived to eke out a poor livelihood for Kit, his wife, and for Nicolette, his daughter. <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font></p> <p>To this, the proper <cite>Vision of Piers Plowman</cite>, are appended the three long poems, in the same metre, named <cite>Do-well</cite>, <cite>Do-bet</cite> (that is <cite>better</cite>), and <cite>Do-best</cite>. These defy analysis, for they proceed upon no distinct lines. <cite>Do-well</cite> is mainly didactic and hortative; its sermons made a deep impression on the contemporary conscience. Modern readers, however, will turn with greater pleasure to <cite>Do-bet</cite>, which contains the magnificent scene of the <mark>Harrowing of Hell</mark>, which was not equalled for pure sublimity in English poetry until Milton wrote.</p> <small> Edmund Gosse, <a name="EGSH" href="/udra/udex.htm#EGSH"><cite title="source">A Short History of Modern English Literature</cite></a> (1897), 7, 10</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: William Langland (c. 1332-1400), English poet.</mm> </dd></dl>
