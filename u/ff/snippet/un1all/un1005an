To an amalgam of Carew and Donne (whose poems, also, were first published posthumously, in 1633) most of the fashionable poetry written in England between 1630 and 1660 may be attributed. Carew invented a species of love-poetry which exactly suited the temper of the time. It was a continuation of the old Elizabethan pastoral, but more personal, more ardent, more <mark>coarse</mark>, and more virile. He was the frankest of hedonists, and his glowing praise of woman has genuine erotic force. <small> Edmund Gosse, <a name="EGSH" href="/udra/udex.htm#EGSH"><cite title="source">A Short History of Modern English Literature</cite></a> (1897), 146</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: Thomas Carew (c. 1598-1639), English poet. . </mm> </dd></dl>
