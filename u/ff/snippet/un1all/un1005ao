He is the noblest of the religious writers of England between Hooker and Jeremy Taylor; and the qualities which mark his astonishing poems, their occasional majesty, their tossing and foaming imagination, their lapses into bad taste and unintelligibility, the sinister impression of a strange perversity of passion carefully suppressed in them all these, though to a less marked degree, distinguish the prose of Donne. Its beauties are of the savage order, and they display not only no consciousness of any rules which govern prose composition, but none of that chastening of rhetoric which had been achieved under Elizabeth by Hooker. Such books of Donne&apos;s as his paradox of suicide, the Biathanatos, unquestionably exhibit sympathy with what was morbid in the temper of the time; they are to theology what the tragedies of Ford are to drama. <small> Edmund Gosse, <a name="EGSH" href="/udra/udex.htm#egsh"><cite title="source">A Short History of Modern English Literature</cite></a> (1897), 135</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: John Donne (1573-1631), English poet.</mm> </dd></dl>
