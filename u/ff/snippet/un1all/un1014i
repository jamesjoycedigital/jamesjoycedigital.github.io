Religions should make it very clear to their uneducated followers that blood-sacrifices <font color="green">[end of 1506]</font> are criminal, however much they may be sanctioned by Biblical or Sh&#257;s&#7789;ric texts. It may be freely admitted that there are <mark>blood-thirsty entities on the astral plane</mark> who delight in the slaying of helpless victims, the carnivorous lions and tigers of the nether world; but their cruel cravings should no more be satisfied than those of their congeners in the jungle. <small> <a name="THsep1910" href="/udra/udex.htm#THsep1910"><cite title="source">The Theosophist</cite></a> (September 1910), &ldquo;ON THE WATCH-TOWER&ldquo; p. 1507</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: Copied to <a name="s12015a" href="s12all.htm#s12015a">Sheet 12.015(a)</a> for <cite>UG</cite> 12.349. </mm> </dd></dl>
