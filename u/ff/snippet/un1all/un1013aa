It was only after this great moment, this immediate experience, that he began to declare the Unknown Father who had been revealed to him and was now revealed through him,2 it was only then that he began to do mighty works, that is, show forth Divine powers, or signs of Divinity. The Christ, however, left Jesus&mdash;<mark>the Dove &ldquo;flew Home&rdquo;&mdash;before the historic passion and death</mark>; after the departure of the Christ no more wonders were wrought, no more signs shown. <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> As to the Christ, their contention seems to have been that, seeing that the Saviour is a Spiritual Being, and that too immediately emanating from God Himself, He was naturally incapable of suffering. He was the Saving Power, the Power from Above, who descended precisely to overcome the Powers of that Fate which caused all the suffering. <mark>He Himself, therefore, could not suffer</mark>; for indeed His Presence was the immediate ceasing of all sorrow; He was Everlasting Life, the antipodes of death and change, Everlasting Joy that causes all sorrow to flee away. <small> <a name="THRdec1908" href="/udra/udex.htm#THRdec1908"><cite title="source">The Theosophical Review</cite></a> (December 1908), G.
