It is on record that <mark>George Hemmings, an ironmonger, was born at the same time as King George III</mark>, and it is said that the course of the two lives ran absolutely parallel, promotion, marriage, and death occurring on the same day to the two men. It is, therefore, clear that the horoscopal indications must needs be interpreted in terms of the social status of the individual. <small> <a name="THmay1910" href="/udra/udex.htm#THmay1910"><cite title="source">The Theosophist</cite></a> (May 1910), Alan Leo, &ldquo;The Soul of Astronomy&rdquo; p. 1016</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: Hemmings was born on the 4th of June 1738 at around the same time as George III; he went into business for himself in October 1760 when George III came to the throne; he married on the 8th of September 1761, the same day as the king; and they both died on Saturday, January 29th 1820, again at around the same time.  <br>Raphael transcription: <a name="c07258d" href="../../../F/FF/fnbs/c07all.htm#c07258d">VI.C.07:258(d)</a></mm></dd> </dd></dl>
