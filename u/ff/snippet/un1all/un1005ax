Dunbar: Ballad to Our Lady</blockquote> <dd class="well"> <blockquote class="sources">The life of <mark>WILLIAM DUNBAR</mark> is very imperfectly known to us. It is probable that he was born in 1460, and that he died soon after 1520. He was a Lothian man, educated at St. Andrews. After the murder of James III., in 1488, Dunbar seems to have passed over to France, as a secular priest, preaching his way through Picardy to Paris, where a great many young Scotchmen, some of them afterwards to be eminent, were then studying. He seems to have travelled widely, visiting even Holland, Spain, and Norway. In 1500 we find him back in Scotland, and attached for the remainder of his life to James IV. as Court poet, taking, among the many versifiers of the age, the predominant appellation of "Rhymer of Scotland" or Poet Laureate. <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> <p>Dunbar&apos;s <mark><cite>Ballad to Our Lady</cite></mark> is one of the most extraordinary feats in the language. </p> <small> Edmund Gosse, <a name="EGSH" href="/udra/udex.htm#egsh"><cite title="source">A Short History of Modern English Literature</cite></a> (1897), 49, 51</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: William Dunbar (c. 1460-1520), Scottish poet. </mm> </dd></dl>
