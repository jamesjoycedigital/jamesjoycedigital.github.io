They are in the pastry cook&apos;s, chattering, crushing little fabrics of pastry, or seated silently at tables by the caf&eacute; door, or descending from carriages with a busy stir of garments soft as the voice of the adulterer. They pass in an air of perfumes: under the perfumes their bodies have a warm humid smell&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. No man has loved them and they have not loved themselves: they have given nothing for all that has been given them. </blockquote> <dd class="well"><mm class="note">Note: Cornell 17, pp.51-52.
