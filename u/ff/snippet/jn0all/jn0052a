A fat woman passes, <br>her dress lifted boldly, her face nuzzling in <br>an orange. A pale young man with a Cockney <br>accent does tricks in his shirtsleeves and <br>drinks out of a bottle. A little old man has <br>mice on an umbrella; a policeman in <br>heavy boots charges down and seizes the <br>umbrella: the little old man disappears. <br>Bookies are bawling out names and prices; <br>one of them screams with the voice of a <br>child &mdash; &ldquo;Bonny Boy!&rdquo; &ldquo;Bonny Boy!&rdquo;&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Human <br>creatures are swarming in the enclosure, <br>moving backwards and forwards through <br>the thick ooze. Some ask if the race is going <br>on; they are answered &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;No.&rdquo; A <br>band begins to play&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. A beautiful brown <br>horse, with a yellow rider upon him, flashes <br>far away in the sunlight. </blockquote> <dd class="well"><mm class="note">Note: Silverman/La Hune no. XVI.
