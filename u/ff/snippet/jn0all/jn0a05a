Where three roads meet and before a swampy beach a big dog is recumbent. From time to time he lifts his muzzle in the air and utters a prolonged sortowful howl. People stop to look at him and pass on; some remain, arrested, it may be, by that lamentation in which they seem to hear the utterance of their own sorrow that had once its voice but is now voiceless, a servant of laborious days. Rain begins to fall.</blockquote> <dd class="well"> <ul class="list-inline" id="jn0a05a"><li>Stephen Hero <a href="../../ulex/ap/lexsh.htm#jn0a05a">ED</a> </li><li><ms href="#jn0a05a">MS Harvard 550</ms> </li><li>JJA 8:119 </li><li><a name="sh.1" href="../udra/shda.htm#sh11d">Usage</a> </li><li><a href="../../ulex/ap/sh11d.htm#jn0a05a">Draft: sh.1</a></li> </ul><mm class="note">Note: Cornell 17, pp.42.
