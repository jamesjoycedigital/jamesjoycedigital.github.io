The sea is uneasy, charged with dull anger like the eyes of an animal which is about to spring, the prey of its own pitiless hunger. The land is flat and thinly wooded. Many people are gathered on the shore to see what ship it is that is entering their harbour. </blockquote> <dd class="well"><mm class="note">Note: Cornell 17, p.57.
