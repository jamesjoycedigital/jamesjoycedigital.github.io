He revises this twice as indicated below (from 12 o&apos;clock, clockwise). Stephen is in each case seated at the bottom end of the table. Dixon is further out, as if a little behind the rest of the company. In the top left corner of the page Joyce has listed a number of units drawn directly and ecclectically from the Oxen sheets. These are transcribed below. </mm> </dd></dl></div>
