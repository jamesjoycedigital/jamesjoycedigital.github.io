A greater gulf can hardly be imagined than that between the geography of the one and the other. There is nothing in the geography of Homer which can be shown to differ from facts still to be verified; it may almost be said that beyond the Propontis there is nothing in the Argo legend which bears any relation to reality. <small> Walter Leaf, <a name="WLAS" href="/udra/udex.htm#WLAS"><cite title="source">Troy: A Study in Homeric Geography</cite></a> (1912), 327f</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c16265b" href="../../../F/FF/fnbs/c16all.htm#c16265b">VI.C.16:265(b)</a> </dd> </dd></dl>
