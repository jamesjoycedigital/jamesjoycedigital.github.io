On it stood the town of Nicaea, now Isnik, which gives the lake its modern name. It lies N.E. of Brusa, and close to the sharp bend where the Sangarius, now Sakaria, suddenly changes its course firom N.W. to N.E by the town of Lefke. An easy pass across the <mark>watershed</mark> between the lake and the river gives access to the great and fertile Daskylian plain from the valley which is the natural highway to the Phrygian uplands. By this road must have passed all the traffic of the river valley so long as trade centred round the mouth of the Hellespont; the land passage is in this case much shorter and easier than by sea from the river-mouth. <small> Walter Leaf, <a name="WLAS" href="/udra/udex.htm#wlas"><cite title="source">Troy: A Study in Homeric Geography</cite></a> (1912), 300</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c16269g" href="../../../f/ff/fnbs/c16all.htm#c16269g">VI.C.16:269(g)</a> </dd> </dd></dl>
