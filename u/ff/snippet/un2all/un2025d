Here there is no common sense whatever, nor fun, wit, nor anything but absurdity. Probably another instance of a proper name being changed to a common or even uncommon word. May be drunk as Abel Doyle which would suggest an Irish origin like many incomprehensible proverbs too completely Anglicised. It is a well-known fact in natural history that a parrot is the only bird which can sing after partaking of wines, spirits, or beer; for it is now universally agreed by all scientific men who have investigated the subject that the expression, &lsquo;Drunk as a boiled owl&rsquo;&apos; is a gross libel upon a highly respectable teetotal bird which, even in its unboiled state, drinks nothing stronger than rain-water.&mdash;<cite>D. T.</cite>, 12th December 1892. Also whitish, washed-out countenance, with staring sleepy eyes. Both were admirably made up, and Twiss had just the boiled-owlish appearance that is gained by working all night in a printing-office.&mdash;<cite>Ref.</cite>, 31st May 1885.
