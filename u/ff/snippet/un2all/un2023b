Berlin &mdash; Steglitz Schloss-str 69 </blockquote> <dd class="well"><mm class="note">Note: The Berlin street-directories c. 1917 indicate that a &lsquo;Rosa Elzholz&rsquo; lived at this Berlin address. Was Rosa Hella&apos;s mother or sister? Was Hella the subject of one of Joyce-Bloom&apos;s attempted epistolary romances, love by letter? Ellmann (1982, pp.418-9) recounts the story of how Joyce while in Locarno in late 1917 met a young German doctor, Gertrude Kaempffer, and attempted to entrap her into an intimate correspondence with him, using as his address the poste restante in Z&uuml;rich. It would appear that she was staying at the time in Lugano, having come thence from Berlin.  <br>Raphael transcription: <a name="c16247f" href="../../../f/ff/fnbs/c16all.htm#c16247f">VI.C.16:247(f)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
