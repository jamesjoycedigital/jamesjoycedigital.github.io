He had to meet this time Zinfandel and Sceptre, who had been first and second in the Coronation Cup at Epsom and, as he had not shown to advantage in France this season, he had very few friends, the race being regarded as a match between the two others; for little or no attention was paid to the fourth runner, Throwaway, whose chances were regarded as so remote that odds of 20 to one were offered against him. <mark>The point of interest was whether Zinfandel would confirm her Epsom running with Sceptre or whether she would turn the tables on him, and as he looked very well when seen in the paddock, he started favourite.</mark> <small> <a name="TT17jun04" href="/udra/udex.htm#tt17jun04"><cite title="source">The Times</cite></a> (London, 17 June 1904), 12/1</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c16235b" href="../../../f/ff/fnbs/c16all.htm#c16235b">VI.C.16:235(b)</a>, <a name="c16236a" href="../../../f/ff/fnbs/c16all.htm#c16236a">VI.C.16:236(a)</a></dd> </dd></dl>
