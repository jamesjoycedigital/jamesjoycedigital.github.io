The karo-la is again occupied, and all <mark>the jongs on the road to Lhasa</mark> are held. No preparations are being made for the defence of Lhasa, but the apparent intention is to appeal for help from China. At Gyangtse every effort has been made to induce the Tibetans to attack the mission camp, but without success. On Monday night a detachment of Gurkhas cut off a Tibetan convoy, killing nine men and taking four prisoners. <small> <a name="TT16jun04" href="/udra/udex.htm#tt16jun04"><cite title="source">The Times</cite></a> (London, 16 June 1904), 9/2</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c16242e" href="../../../f/ff/fnbs/c16all.htm#c16242e">VI.C.16:242(e)</a> </dd> </dd></dl>
