But they delayed their efforts too long, and Throwaway was never caught, winning by a length from Zinfandel, who thus occupied the same position that his owner&apos;s Rising Glass did last year. Sceptre was never dangerous, and the French horse was last throughout. <small> <a name="TT17jun04" href="/udra/udex.htm#tt17jun04"><cite title="source">The Times</cite></a> (London, 17 June 1904), 12/1</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
