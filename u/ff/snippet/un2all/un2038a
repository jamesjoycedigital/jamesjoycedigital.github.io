On purely sentimental grounds the thoughts of statesmen turned more than once to the idea of making Troy the great city of the world; but the disabilities of its position were too much for them. <mark>Alexander&apos;s projects resulted only in the greatness of a rival neighbour, Alexandria Troas,</mark> where an artificial harbour was a possibility. <small> Walter Leaf, <a name="WLAS" href="/udra/udex.htm#wlas"><cite title="source">Troy: A Study in Homeric Geography</cite></a> (1912), 325</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
