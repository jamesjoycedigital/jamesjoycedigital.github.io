Drunk as a boiled owl. Here there is no common sense whatever, nor fun, wit, nor anything but absurdity. Probably another instance of a proper name being changed to a common or even uncommon word. May be drunk as <mark>Abel Doyle</mark> which would suggest an Irish origin like many incomprehensible proverbs too completely Anglicised. <small> J.
