Enete or Enetae is said to be the place &ldquo;whence comes the race of <mark>wild mules</mark>.&rdquo; Mules in the strict sense are of course sterile, and there can be no wild race of them. The word &hellip; is certainly used here to indicate the wild ass or onager, which in some three varieties, now referred to a single species, the <i>Equus onager</i>, is found in the deserts of Asia, from Syria to Persia and Western India. <small> Walter Leaf, <a name="WLAS" href="/udra/udex.htm#wlas"><cite title="source">Troy: A Study in Homeric Geography</cite></a> (1912), 287f</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c16268a" href="../../../f/ff/fnbs/c16all.htm#c16268a">VI.C.16:268(a)</a> </dd> </dd></dl>
