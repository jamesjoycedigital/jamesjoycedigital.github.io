When driving into Homburg this morning to weigh he had a bad side-slip and broke his <mark>hinder wheel</mark>. Every one regrets this, more especially as it was the only Swiss car entered, and the only car with eight cyclinders, so that for another year the vexed question of whether four or more cylinders are better for a racing car will remain unsetttled. <small> <a name="TT17jun04" href="/udra/udex.htm#TT17jun04"><cite title="source">The Times</cite></a> (London, 17 June 1904), 7/1</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c16238g" href="../../../F/FF/fnbs/c16all.htm#c16238g">VI.C.16:238(g)</a> </dd> </dd></dl>
