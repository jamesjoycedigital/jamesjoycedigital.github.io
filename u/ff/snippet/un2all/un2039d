The booths were deserted, and Priam and his retainers sat down to feast through the winter months on the toll they had taken. <mark>The &ldquo;great town&rdquo; of Troy vanished</mark> till next year, and the Trojan country-folk returned to their villages. <small> Walter Leaf, <a name="WLAS" href="/udra/udex.htm#WLAS"><cite title="source">Troy: A Study in Homeric Geography</cite></a> (1912), 315</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c16265g" href="../../../F/FF/fnbs/c16all.htm#c16265g">VI.C.16:265(g)</a> </dd> </dd></dl>
