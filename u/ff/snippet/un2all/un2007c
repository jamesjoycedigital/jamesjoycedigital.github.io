The occasion was a picnic in connexion with the Church Sunday School. The day was a perfect one. The children and their mothers, dressed in their best and carrying flags, marched to the pier, headed by a band. The destination of the steamer, which had been specially chartered for the picnic, was Forest Grove, Long Island Sound. <small> <a name="TT17jun04" href="/udra/udex.htm#tt17jun04"><cite title="source">The Times</cite></a> (London, 17 June 1904), 5/6</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
