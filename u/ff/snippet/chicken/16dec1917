<div class="nbunit" id="16Dec1917"><font color="red">PM 16 December 1917</font>, <cite>Letters II</cite> (JJ to Claud Sykes): Sunday. I send you M.O. (10 frs) and second episode to be typed as soon as possible. They [L.R.] promise to send me &pound;10 when I send MS of first part &mdash; of which there is a third episode. Please leave a good margin on the <i>left</i> side of the page not on the right. Two small alterations. In account of Sir John Blackwood place also after the second Day! (&hellip;) dots as after the first so (Day! &hellip; Day! &hellip;). In Mr Deasy&apos;s speech beginning &lsquo;You think me an old fogey&rsquo; place after &lsquo;I remember the famine&rsquo; the date &lsquo;in &apos;46.&rsquo; Hope you will not find the MS difficult. I tried to write it in a very legible hand but there are interlineations, very important. Hope you can make them out. When sending back please send registered. Can you do 3 copies as last time? Is it the same for you. It is in case one goes astray. Please let me know if MO&apos;s sent square accounts, including of course postage and expenses of Dienstmann. P.S. I hope you will like the MS.</div>
