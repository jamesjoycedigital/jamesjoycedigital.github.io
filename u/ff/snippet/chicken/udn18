<div class="nbunit" id="udn18"> A good question is when and how Bloom put the money down. It cannot have been while at Glasnevin, as might seem plausible, as he didn&apos;t have enough cash on him to cover it. He is at this point the possessor of two shilling and ten pence (&ldquo;two and ten&rdquo;). This consideration helps to explain why, immediately after the funeral, in Aeolus, we find a group from Hades hanging around the offices of the Freeman&apos;s Journal instead of being ensconced in a pub (their intended destination). At least two coaches must have returned to the city centre, depositing Bloom, Simon Dedalus, Cunningham, Power, Lambert, and Hynes in O&apos;Connell Street. These would have proceeded directly to the adjacent offices of the Freeman&apos;s Journal, but for different reasons. Bloom, Power and Cunningham would have gone there primarily for Bloom to collect what was due to him in commission, thereby allowing him to transfer the promised five shillings, with Power witness to the transaction. Cunningham and Power would then have left together, still bent on Dignam&apos;s affairs, while Bloom remained behind to attend to his own business over the ad. Lambert and Dedalus would have gone in to ask the editor to join them for the premeditated drink, and Hynes would have gone in to file his report of the funeral. This is the situation when the episode opens, with Power and Cunningham already out of the picture.  </div>
