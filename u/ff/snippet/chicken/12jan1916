<div class="nbunit" id="12Jan1916"><font color="red">12 January 1916</font>, <cite>BLHW</cite> (Ezra Pound to Harriet Weaver): I have just had a desperate letter from Joyce. He has &ldquo;answered 60 newspaper ads.&rdquo; etc. etc. NO WORK. If you haven&apos;t already written to him, can you send him &pound;5. at once, as a loan, as advance payment, as anything?</div>
