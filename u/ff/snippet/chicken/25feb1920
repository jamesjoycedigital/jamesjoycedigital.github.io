<div class="nbunit" id="25Feb1920"><font color="red">25 February 1920</font>, <cite>Selected Letters</cite> (JJ to Harriet Weaver): &hellip; several letters sent by me (including two to you) went astray it seems &hellip; About three weeks ago I sent the <cite>Nausikaa</cite> episode in duplicate to Mr Pound. If he has not sent it on to you will you please write to him for it. I heard from him this morning much to my relief for I feared that too had gone astray and the prospect of doing it all over again was not pleasant &hellip; I am now working on the <cite>Oxen of the Sun</cite> the most difficult episode in an odyssey, I think, both to interpret and to execute &hellip; Mr Huebsch writes rather urgently about <cite>Ulysses</cite>. I shall tell him that it may be finished for publication late in autumn but without engagement on my side. If the type for the first half were set early in summer I could perhaps revise it then. I do not know whether they have my complete typescript in New York. It would be creating trouble  to set from the <cite>Little Review</cite>, as many passages are omitted and hopelessly mixed.</div>
