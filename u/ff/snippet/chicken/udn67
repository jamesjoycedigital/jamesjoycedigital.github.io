<div class="nbunit" id="udn67"> Of the Achaean generals only Nestor had an uneventful return. He was one of the very few Greek leaders who continued to rule, prosperous and undisturbed, after the Trojan war. He is fabled to have been incapable of uttering an untruth, of being extremely articulate (words poured from his mouth &ldquo;like honey&rdquo;) and immensely wise, and of being the greatest of the &ldquo;tamers of horses&rdquo;.  </p><p> Pylos was one of the principal market towns for the trade in horses. It had good pasture land and was also good for cattle, unlike most of rocky Greece. It was also, singularly, the centre of the worship of Hades, god of the underworld.  </div>
