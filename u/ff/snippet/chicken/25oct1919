<div class="nbunit" id="25Oct1919"><font color="red">25 October 1919</font>, <cite>Pound/Joyce</cite> (Ezra Pound to John Quinn): Last ms. chapter of Joyce perhaps the best thing he has done &hellip; parody of styles, a trick borrowed from Rabelais, but never done better, even in Rab. Our James is a grrreat man. I hope to God there is a foundation of truth in the yarn he wrote me about a windfall. Feel he may have done it just to take himself off my mind.</div>
