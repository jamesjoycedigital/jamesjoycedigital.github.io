<div class="nbunit" id="udn81"> Ogygia, and indeed that other mysterious place, the island of Phaeacia,  have been identified with the now-sunken island of Atlantis. A different tradition, begun by Euhemerus in the late fourth century B.C. and endorsed by Callimachus, identifies it with the Maltese island of Gozo.  (Eustathius, the Byzantine grammarian, argued that Gozo was the first name for Egypt.) B&eacute;rard suggests that Kalypso&apos;s isle is close to Gibraltar.   </div>
