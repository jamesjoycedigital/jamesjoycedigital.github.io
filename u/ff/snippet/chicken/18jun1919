<div class="nbunit" id="18Jun1919"><font color="red">18 June 1919</font>, <cite>Potts</cite> (JJ as quoted by Borach): &lsquo;I finished the Sirens chapter during the last few days. A big job. I wrote this chapter with the technical resources of music. It is a fugue with all musical notations: <i>piano, forte, rallentando</i>, and so on. A quintet occurs in it, too, as in the <cite>Meistersinger</cite>, my favourite Wagner opera. The barmaids have the upper parts of women and the lower of fish. From in front you see bosom and head. But if you stand behind the bar, you see filth, the empty bottles on the floor, the ugly shoes of the women, and so on. Only disgusting things.&rsquo;</div>
