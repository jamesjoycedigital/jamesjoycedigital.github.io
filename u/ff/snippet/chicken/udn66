<div class="nbunit" id="udn66"> The protocol of propitiation among the Greeks was highly ritualized. The animal was taken to the altar set up for the purpose by the sacrificers, whose hands had been washed as an aid to purity. Barley was then scattered onto the animal and it was stunned by a blow to the head. Its head was then tugged back and its throat slit. The skin was then excoriated and such parts of the body as were to be dedicated to the gods were removed: the thighbones and sometimes the tongue. The former was wrapped in a double layer of fat and the outside laced with small strips of meat. This offering was then burnt and the smoke that arose therefrom was believed to placate and please the gods. Drops of wine were likewise dedicated to the gods, and poured onto the burned offering. If the animals were sacrificed in the morning, as here, the dedication were put aside until the late evening.  </p><p> The sacrificers ate the inner organs first and only then the meat, and they drank a mixture of wine and water.  </div>
