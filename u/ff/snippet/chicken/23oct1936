<div class="nbunit" id="23Oct1936"><font color="red">23 October 1936</font> <i>NLJL</i> (from John Lane to Paul L&eacute;on): I have now heard from our reader who corrected the proofs, who says that in looking through about 100 pages &mdash; from 7-21 inclusive and 235-259 and others &mdash; he found the following two mistakes <br>  Page 8 line 9 There should be a full stop after "brood" <br>  Page 242 last line but one: There should be a paragraph.  <br> We are letting him have a copy of the book to go through carefully in his spare time, so as to rule out any possible mistakes in the general trade edition which we are publishing next year. Incidentally, if you should come across any further misprints yourself &hellip; let me know so that we can have them dealt with. </div>
