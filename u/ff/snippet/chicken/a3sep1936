<div class="nbunit" id="a3Sep1936"><font color="red">3 September 1936</font> <i>NLJL</i> (from Paul L&eacute;on to John Lane The Bodley Head): The printing of ULYSSES &hellip; the first 300 pages went very well but since there has been a lull and the printers seem to have reached page 550 with difficulty. On the other hand the queries which they direct to me cannot be attended as swiftly as heretofore Mr Joyce being away and as I want every reply I make to be verified by him &hellip; hurry them up with the rest of the queries, which means after all some 250 odd pages more. Anyhow these corrections which for the best part are signs of punctuation and hyphens can in case it is necessary to keep to a schedule be attended to simply by your reader as by now he must be conversant with the peculiarities of Mr Joyce&apos;s orthography (as little hyphens as possible, all participial phrases in commas etc.) </div>
