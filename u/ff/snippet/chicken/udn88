<div class="nbunit" id="udn88"> The <cite>Odyssey</cite> had a now-lost sequel, the Telegony, otherwise the Thesprotis, concerning Telegonos, son to Odysseus by Kirke; one most probably composed in the sixth century B.C. This was not written by Homer and was in antiquity usually attributed to Eugamon or Eugammon of Kyrene or to Cinaethon of Sparta. Only two lines of the original text survive. A summary account of the work, however, can be found in the Chrestomathy of Proclus.  According to this, the Telegony opens with the burial of the suitors. Odysseus makes sacrifices to the mystic nymphs of the damp grotto in which he had buried his treasure. He leaves for Elis to visit Polyxenos, who gives him a bowl depicting the story of Trophonios, before returning to Ithaca and from there going on to Thesprotia to perform the rituals ordered by Antinoos in Od. 11.  </p><p> While in Thesprotia, Odysseus marries Queen Kallidike and they have a child. Naturally, he aids these people in their war against the Brygoi, a neighbouring tribe. Even the gods, Ares pitched against Athene, participate in this war. Apollo intervenes to end it. Kallidike, however, is killed and their son, Polypoites, succeeds to the kingdom. Odysseus then returns to Ithaca.  </p><p> Kirke, on her island of Aiaia, gave birth to an older son of Odysseus, Telegonos, half-brother to Telemachos. Telegonos grows up on Aiaia and from Kirke learns the identity of his absent father. At one point, at Kirke&apos;s request, Hephaistos fashions for him a magical spear out of a marine sting-ray. Armed with this, he sets out in quest of his father and happens to put in at the island of Ithaca to rustle the cattle there. Odysseus challenges the stranger and in the course of the ensuing tussle is mortally wounded, as seemingly foretold by Antinoos, who warned him that death would come to him eks halos, &ldquo;out of the sea&rdquo; (i.e., from the poison of the fish).  As Odysseus dies, he and Telegonos recognize each other. Dismayed at killing him, Telegonos takes the body back with him to Aiaia for burial. He also brings Penelope and Telemachos along, and Kirke makes these immortal. Telegonos then marries Penelope, and Telemachos marries Kirke.  </p><p> This version of things, however, is a misinterpretation of the Homeric expression &ldquo;eks halos&rdquo;, which properly means &ldquo;away from the sea:&rdquo;  that is, far distant from the sea. Antinoos, moreover, foretells a gentle death (Od. 11.135) in comfortable old age, which is far from dying in agony from the poison of a sting-ray. What Homer suggests is that Odysseus will cease to be a seafarer and will travel inland to places where his oar is unknown as an oar and is taken instead for a winnowing-fan (both are bladed implements made of fir, similar in appearance and size). There he is to bury his oar in the ground, renounce his former sea-life, and, in propitiation of the god Poseidon, promote his worship in this new place.  </p><p> Sophocles&apos; now-lost <cite>Odysseus Acanthoplex</cite> also has Odysseus slain by Telegonos.  </p><p> There exist traces of yet another variant on his death, one in which Telegonos plays no part: a bird defecates on the hero&apos;s head, and he perishes from a poisonous sting embedded in the excrement.  </div>
