<div class="nbunit" id="6Jan1920"><font color="red">6 January 1920</font>, <cite>Selected Letters</cite> (JJ to Harriet Weaver): [re AP MS] Of course if all or any of it goes astray I shall write it out again for you but it would be better for you to have the original. The &lsquo;original&rsquo; original I tore up and threw into the stove about eight years ago in a fit of rage on account of the trouble over <cite>Dubliners</cite>. The charred remains of the MS were rescued by a family fire brigade and tied up in an old sheet where they remained for some months. I then sorted them out and pieced them together as best I could and the present MS is the result &hellip; I am working at the <cite>Nausikaa</cite> episode &hellip; I hope to finish this episode during January &hellip; hope to complete my book during the year.</div>
