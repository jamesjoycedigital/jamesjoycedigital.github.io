I often go to vespers at Notre Dame or at Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois. I never go to the theatre&mdash;as I have no money. I have no money either to buy books. Synge was over here selling out and gave me his play to read&mdash;a play which is to be produced by the Irish Literary Theatre. I criticized it. Synge says I have a mind like Spinoza! (Spinoza was great Hebrew philosopher): I am at present up to the neck in AristotleÂ’s Metaphysics and read only him and Ben Jonson (a writer of songs and plays).</div>
