<div class="nbunit" id="22Feb1937"><font color="red">22 February 1937</font> <i>NLMS</i> (Paul L&eacute;on to Messrs Monro Saw): Ulysses &hellip; the new John Lane Co. &hellip; they should use the Albatross edition as their text &hellip; the text of the limited Lane edition is full of unwarranted misprints (there are 8 of them between pgs 268-373) as well as the Appendix. But there are incorporated in the limited edition about a hundred corrections chiefly of punctuation. They should therefore use the limited edition as their basis correcting words from the Albatross. It will also be a good thing if they could send me the proofs of the Appendix which contains some serious blunders. </div>
