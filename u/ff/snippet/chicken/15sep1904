<div class="nbunit" id="15Sep1904"><font color="red">15 September 1904</font>, <cite>Selected Letters</cite> 29 (JJ to James S. Starkey): 7 S. Peter's Terrace, Cabra, Dublin. <br>Dear Starkey My trunk will be called for at the Tower tomorrow (Saturday) between 9 and 12. Kindly put into it&mdash;a pair of black boots, a pair of brown boots, a blue peaked cap, a black cloth cap, a black felt hat, a raincoat and the MS of my verses [<cite>Chamber Music</cite>] which are in a roll on the shelf to the right as you enter. Also see that your host [Oliver St. John Gogarty, the model for Buck Mulligan] has not abstracted the twelfth chapter [Chapter XII] of my novel [<cite>Stephen Hero</cite>] from my trunk. May I ask you to see that any letters coming to the Tower for me are redirected to my address at once? Please rope the trunk as it has no lock.</div>
