<div class="nbunit" id="udn31"> The Sirens interlude proves to be costly for Bloom. The first item (a twopenny packet of notepaper and envelopes) is described allusively but definitively. He now has one pound, three shillings and sixpence in his pocket. His dinner of liver and bacon washed down with cider sets him back one shilling and ninepence and a threepenny tip. Whilst writing to Martha, he decides to send her a postal-order for two shillings and sixpence as a &ldquo;little present&rdquo;; to which add a penny for the poundage on the postal-order and a penny for a stamp for the letter.  </div>
