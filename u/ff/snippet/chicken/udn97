<div class="nbunit" id="udn97"> According to this account, once Odysseus had returned and seen to the usurpers, he travels overland to Thesprotia where he marries Queen Kallidike and they have a son named Polypoetes. Odysseus later leads her people in war against the Brygeians, but is defeated. When Kallidike dies, Odysseus leaves their son in charge of affairs and again returns alone to Ithaca and to Penelope. In some sense, Kallidike is thus a Calypso-like figure (a woman other than his wife with whom Odysseus has an extended sexual engagement).  </div>
