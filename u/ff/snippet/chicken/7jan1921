<div class="nbunit" id="7Jan1921"><font color="red">7 January 1921</font>, <cite>Letters I</cite> (JJ to John Quinn): &hellip; terms of offer to Huebsch &hellip; <cite>Circe</cite> is finished and is being typed. When it reaches New York the whole book so far can be set up and sent to me. I shall return it corrected a few days after receipt, with the <cite>Eumeus</cite> episode and probably <cite>Ithaca</cite> also. The second revise can be sent me then and I shall return it with the final episode, <cite>Penelope</cite>. This last is a short episode &mdash; can be checked by the proofreader, in whom I have more confidence now that your continent is &lsquo;dry&rsquo; &hellip; I wrote the <cite>Circe</cite> episode nine times from first to last. </div>
