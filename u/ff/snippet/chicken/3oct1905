<div class="nbunit" id="3Oct1905"><font color="red">Postmark 3 October 1905</font>, <cite>Letters II</cite> 113-4 (JJ to Stanislaus Joyce): Via S. Nicolo 30, II&deg;, Trieste, Austria. <br>Where is the MS of my novel? It is most thoughtless of Curran to give it to anyone without my permission. I did not send it to Dublin to have it circulated from hand to hand. I added Currans name to yours and Cosgraves because he treated me very kindly. I must pass a week of torture until I know whether it is safe or not. You must get it from Kettle <i>at once</i> and send it to me safely registered. Kettle, of course, is a decent kind of a fellow but some of these impostors might wheedle it from him. He is too polite to suspect treachery. Have you any idea what I suffer from all this incertitude? Send me <i>A Mother</i> back.</div>
