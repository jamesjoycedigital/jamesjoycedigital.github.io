<div class="nbunit" id="26Sep1921"><font color="red">26 September 1921</font>, <cite>Buff</cite> (Maurice Darantiere to JJ): Sections 1 and 2 that your courier sent us this afternoon are definitively printed [d&eacute;finitivement tir&eacute;s]. The sole correction from page 31 can still be executed on the [verg&eacute; d&apos;]Arches copies, because we are obliged to re-impose them by 4 pages [r&eacute;imposer par quatre pages] because of the format of this paper.  We have reread the bons &agrave; tirer for the first five signatures. The corrections for pages <br>17&hellip; Agenbite of Inwit <br>21&hellip; and lips and breastbone <br>25&hellip; Oh <br>were not indicated.  Those on pages 3 (except for the word jesuit  which was written with a capital letter), 14, 22, 31, are our fault. The error on page 3 is the most ridiculous ; if you would like, we could re-pull a four page cancel [carton de quatre pages] that will be exchanged in the stitching.</div>
