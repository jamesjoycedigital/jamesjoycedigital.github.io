<div class="nbunit" id="7Jun1921"><font color="red">7 June 1921</font>, <cite>Selected Letters</cite> (JJ to A.F. Bruni): [in Larbaud&apos;s flat] The episode of <cite>Ithaca</cite> is now all geometry, algebra, and mathematics, and then finally <cite>Penelope</cite>! I&apos;d like to dip my head in  a sea of ice. The book is already in press and I expect the first proofs day after tomorrow. It will be published only in October or November. Three expensive editions being involved, misprints have to be avoided. The colours of the binding (chosen by me) will be white letters on a blue field &mdash; the Greek flag though really of Bavarian origin and imported with the dynasty. Yet in a special way they symbolize the myth well &mdash; the white islands scattered over the sea &hellip; I have become a monument &mdash; no, a vespasian.</div>
