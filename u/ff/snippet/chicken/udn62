<div class="nbunit" id="udn62"> In contrast, in Dante&apos;s <cite>Divine Comedy</cite>, Odysseus, alongside Diomedes, is placed in the flaming eighth bolgia of the Inferno (Canto 26): that is, in almost the lowest pit. Dante and his guide meet Ulisse among the false counsellors and learn from him a variant account of his death from the sea, after a prohibited five-month journey beyond the Pillars of Herakles. As the Achaean ship approaches the Mountain of Purgatory, it is wholly spun thrice by a whirlpool and sucked into the deep, with the drowning of all hands.  </p><p> Dante&apos;s fascination with Odysseus, who, like the Algerian Augustine (<cite>Confessions</cite> 10.35), he nevertheless condemns, is that of a man with an antihero. No Greek source was available to Dante. He would, rather, have read the Latin recensions of Dictys and Dares. Two things in particular he would have found most reprehensible. First (according to Virgil), the entering of Odysseus and Diomedes into the citadel of Troy through a secret passage and their theft and removal of the heaven-born paladion, a wooden statue (or xoanon) of Athene that protected the city. (According to legend, it was removed ultimately to Rome to become one of the great symbols of its imperium.) When the thieves took it into their camp, its eyes emitted flames. The second opprobrium was the conceit of the hollow Wooden Horse and the swearing of false vows. The Trojans believed that the Achaeans had at last given up and departed, leaving behind the horse (an offering to Athene) crafted by Epeius. They cut a vertical extension into the opening gates to admit it. During the night, the Achaeans secreted within ? thirty of the best warriors hidden in the horse&apos;s body and two hidden as spies in its mouth ? slipped out through a secret door and, opening the citadel&apos;s gates from within, allowed the returned Achaeans to enter. The city was ultimately destroyed by fire.  </p><p> Historically, there are a number of reasons why the Wooden Horse was mythologized in this particular way. It may have been that the &ldquo;wooden horse&rdquo; was a siege-engine, covered in damp hides against flaming arrows, or it may have been a ship, in the hull of which the Achaeans were hiding, a ship decorated with a horse&apos;s head. Other scholars suggest that the myth followed a misrepresentation of the actual cause of the fall of Troy, whose walls were originally built by the sea-god Poseidon: an earthquake.  </div>
