<div class="nbunit" id="udn23"> Joyce had personal dealings with Father Conmee. He (the Jesuit) had been appointed rector of Clongowes Wood College in 1885 (as related in <cite>A Portrait</cite>), leaving it in the same year (1891) as did Joyce. John Joyce could no longer afford the inflated fees. Conmee, however, saw to it that the Joyce boys were spared the humiliation of schooling in some Mickey-Muck Christian Brother school and got them (free) into Belvedere. Poor James, however, had to spend a short while in 1893 being taught by the Christian Brothers alongside working-class boys.  </div>
