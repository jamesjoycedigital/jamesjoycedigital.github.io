<div class="nbunit" id="25Feb1919"><font color="red">25 February 1919</font>, <cite>Letters II</cite> (JJ to Harriet Weaver): I appreciate very much your friendly words about the Scylla-Charybdis episode of my book <cite>Ulysses</cite> but am sorry that it deprived you of sleep &hellip; I sent some days ago the episode Wandering Rocks to Mr Pound who is ill also. If he has not sent it to you could you write to him. As soon as I am able to work again I shall finish the Sirens and send it &hellip; for five weeks I could do little or nothing except lie constantly near a stove &hellip; I hope I shall be able to finish the book this year or early next year. It is as difficult for me to write it as for my readers to read it</div>
