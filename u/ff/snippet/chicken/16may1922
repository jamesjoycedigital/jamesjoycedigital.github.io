<div class="nbunit" id="16May1922"><font color="red">16 May 1922</font>, <cite>BLHW</cite> (JJ to Harriet Weaver): (also partly I) I think it will be a long time before the Paris edition is finished. In the last two months, Miss Beach tells me, only 5 copies of the 250 francs edition were sold (this is in confidence) &hellip; there are some loose sheets of <cite>Ulysses</cite> lying about. If I sent them to you could you, when you have time, put in the corrections you speak of. That would leave me free for the correction of the text only. But the printer says that the changes are to be as few as possible.</div>
