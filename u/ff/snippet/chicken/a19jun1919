<div class="nbunit" id="a19Jun1919"><font color="red">19 June 1919</font>, <cite>Selected Letters</cite> (JJ to Frank Budgen): I sent on your dream book and hope it reached you &hellip; Pound writes disapproving of the <cite>Sirens</cite>, then modifying his disapproval and protesting against the close and against &lsquo;obsession&rsquo; wanting to know whether Bloom &hellip; could not be relegated to the background and Stephen Telemachus brought forward. The chapter of the <cite>Cyclops</cite> is being lovingly moulded in the way you know. The Fenian is accompanied by a wolfhound who speaks (or curses) in Irish. He unburdens his soul about the Saxo-Angles in the best Fenian style and with colossal vituperativeness alluding to their standard industry. The epic proceeds explanatorily &lsquo;He spoke of the English, a noble race, rulers of the waves, who sit on thrones of alabaster, silent as the deathless gods&rsquo;.</div>
