<div class="nbunit" id="27May1905"><font color="red">27 May 1905</font>, <cite>Letters II</cite> 90 (JJ to Stanislaus Joyce): Via S. Nicolo 30, II&deg;, Trieste, Austria. <br>Please send me my chapters back at once. In a few days you will receive fifty copies of The Holy Office and in a fortnight the University college episode of eleven chapters. I have offered my book of verse to John Lane. [&hellip;] You know the martyrdom my life is here and its dullness. I think the title of the novel is justified. [&hellip;] I have changed the scope of the novel very much and intend to rewrite some of the beginning which, I think is not well written.</div>
