<div class="nbunit" id="13Mar1906"><font color="red">13 March 1906</font>, <cite>Letters II</cite> 131-2 (JJ to Grant Richards): Via Giovanni Boccaccio 1, II&deg;, Trieste, Austria. <br>I am obliged to you for your letter and copy of the contract. If <i>Dubliners</i> cannot be published in May I should prefer September. I shall send you in a week or so the last story which is to be inserted between <i>The Boarding House</i> and <i>Counterparts</i> so that you may proceed with the printing of the book. [&hellip;] You suggest that I should write a novel in some sense autobiographical. I have already written nearly a thousand pages of such a novel, as I think I told you, 914 pages to be accurate. I calculate that these twenty-five chapters, about half of the book, run to 150,000 words. But it is quite impossible for me in present circumstances to think the rest of the book, much less to write it. This novel also has the defect of being about Ireland. <p>I shall be glad to hear from you again when you have decided in what form you will bring out <i>Dubliners</i>.</p></div>
