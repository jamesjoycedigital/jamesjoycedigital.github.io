<dl id="sh3"><dt><a href="../../ff/fnbs/sh3all.htm">Sheets III</a> </dt> <dd> <ul><li>DATE: 1933 Summer-Winter : Switzerland, Paris. <br>Recycled matter from notebooks. In compiling these sheets Joyce seems to have read through the notebooks several times, each time drawing material for a different chapter of Book III. In doing this, he either kept the notebooks together in an undisturbed pile, as each chapter listing follows the same notebook sequence, or (and more probably), after finishing with N41 (the first notebook resorted to) he began to transcribe simultaneously onto not one sheet but onto <i>four</i> sheets (or perhaps <i>five</i> sheets, see <a name="sh4" href="#sh4">Sheets IV</a> below), marked  &ldquo;<big><font face="wake">D</font></big>a&rdquo;, &ldquo;<big><font face="wake">D</font></big>b&rdquo;, &ldquo;<big><font face="wake">D</font></big>c&rdquo;, and &ldquo;<big><font face="wake">D</font></big>d&rdquo;, sorting the material as he saw fit as he proceeded ONCE through the set of notebooks. <br> In incorporating the material into <i>Work in Progress</i>, Joyce and his helpers worked directly from the sheets, occasionally mistranscribing elements in the process. The elements do not seem to have been dictated, as is evidenced by such entries as we find on MS 47486a-310b (61:016) [Sheet iii-10]. </li><li>First use: revision of FW Book III <i>transitions</i> (first set) <br>TEXT ENTRY LEVELS: III&sect;1A.12/1B.3/1C.9/1D.12 / III&sect;2A.13/2B.11/2C.13 / III&sect;3A.10 / III&sect;4.7 <br>ORIGIN: N41 (VI.B.33), N3 (VI.B.3), N29 (VI.B.21), N44 (VI.B.34) [in reverse], N21 (VI.B.20), N22 (VI.B.17),  VI.C.1, VI.C.3, VI.C.2 </li><li>PHOTO-REPLICATE: <cite>James Joyce Archive</cite> (New York: Garland, 1978), vol. 61 </li></ul> </dd> </dl>
