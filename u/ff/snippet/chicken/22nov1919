<div class="nbunit" id="22Nov1919"><font color="red">22 November 1919</font>, <cite>NYPL</cite> (John Quinn to JJ):: I should be willing to pay a reasonable sum for the MS. of &lsquo;Ulysses&rsquo; when it is all finished. I was going to write that to you but it has been impossible to write before today &hellip; I am cabling you today as follows: James Joyce Twenty-nine Universitatstrasse Zurich Switzerland Willing cable advance twenty-five pounds account manuscript Ulysses but do not understand words your cable via Sanita two Trieste. Please cable definite instructions regarding cabling money. I think &pound;25 would be a reasonable advance to you on account of the completed MS. of Ulysses. I should not want a fragment but only the completed MS. I could not give you an estimate of what the completed MS. would be worth until I had seen it and knew the number of pages in it and so on. </div>
