<div class="nbunit" id="udn54"> This was a week-long festival celebrating the best of the city&apos;s capacity to entertain ? much like the week leading up to Bloomsday currently is in Dublin. It opened with a grand procession to the Parthenon, one that was more important than the games themselves.  For this, a special robe (the peplos) was woven by the women of Athens for the statue of the goddess Athene, which was hoisted up and carried to the Parthenon. There was also a large sacrifice made to Athene, the hekatombe (that is, the sacrifice of a hundred oxen), and the meat from the sacrificed animals was used in a banquet on the final night of the festival, the pannychis (the &ldquo;all-nighter&rdquo;).  The biannual Joyce Symposium ends with a fancy dinner for all of the participants. Many scholars believe that this procession is the theme of the inner Ionic Parthenon Frieze, indicating its importance to the Athenian people to warrant inclusion in a temple.  </p><p> Award ceremonies included the giving of amphorae, large ceramic vessels that contained olive oil given as prizes. The winner of the chariot race (the horse-race of its day), for example, received a prize of one hundred and forty of these amphorae.  </div>
