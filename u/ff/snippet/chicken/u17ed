<div class="nbunit" id="u17ed"><h4><cite>Ulysses</cite> by James Joyce, edited by Danis Rose and John O'Hanlon (London: The Folio Society, 2017).</h4> <p>This edition is the second critically edited text of Ulysses, the first being that of Hans Walter Gabler and colleagues in 1984. Unlike the Gabler edition, which was based on the Rosenbach manuscript, it is grounded on the text as submitted by Joyce to his publishers: first, to the <cite>Little Review</cite> (New York) and second, to Shakespeare &amp; Company (Paris). This is because, for most of the book, the manuscript is either out of the line of transmission or it comes before a missing draft level, thus making editorial decisions difficult and often moot. </p><p>At the present time, the 2017 edition is available only from <a href="http://www.foliosociety.com/book/YSS/ulysses" target="_blank">The Folio Society</a>. Though relatively expensive, the book is full-sized, well-bound, and readable. It includes some beautiful illustrations by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSb_Amkp--4" target="_blank">John Vernon Lord</a> and was awarded the 2018 Victoria and Albert Museum <a href="https://www.vam.ac.uk/b/villa-2018/2018-book-illustration" target="_blank">Book Illustration Award</a>. <br>Note: Though the pagination has been retained, the 2017 text used in the JJDA has been corrected to match 2021: the emendationd are as follows: <ul> <li>(u17, p. 63, line 8) brillantined  &rarr; brilliantined (see U21, p. 76 line 9)  <li>(u17, p. 134, line 5) The Plums  &rarr; the Plums (see U21, p. 167 line 9)  <li>(u17, p. 153, line 14) musterred  &rarr; mustered (see U21, p. 191 line 7)  <li>(u17, p. 161, line 21) brillantined  &rarr; brilliantined (see U21, p. 201 line 20)  <li>(u17, p. 494, line 4 from end) Aurora  &rarr; Amora (see U21, p. 602 line 9 from end)  <li>(u17, p. 549, line 11 from end) Hugh C  &rarr; Hugh C.
