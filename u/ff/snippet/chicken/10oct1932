<div class="nbunit" id="10Oct1932"><font color="red">10 October 1932</font> <i>NLAB</i> (from RHB to JJ): The Albatross have requested me to adhere strictly to the 1930 Shakespeare and Company edition and to eliminate only the "literals" contained therein. They have also requested me to write direct to you, should any difficulties arise. I am at present reading the 1930 edition and, as soon as I have finished it, I will send you a list of any corrections which I consider it advisable to make. On receipt of your approval to these, I will see that they are indicated on the proofs. Meanwhile, there is a point on which I should be glad of your immediate decision, as composition is due to begin at the end of this week. The Shakespeare and Co. edition follows, where dialogues are concerned, the French custom, i.e. a long dash is placed before the beginning of each speech. In all Albatross books hitherto (including the Albatross edition of &lsquo;Dubliners&rsquo;), we have followed the English custom, i.e. using quotation marks, which are more familiar to the English reader and are also preferable from the typographical point of view. I notice that quotation marks are also used in the Rhein-Verlag edition of the German translation of &lsquo;Ulysses&rsquo;, and therefore imagine that you will have no objection to their being substituted for the dashes in the Albatross English edition. In all other matters I wll adhere strictly to the Shakespeare and Company edition </div>
