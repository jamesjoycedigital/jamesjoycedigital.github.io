In a number of cases, the precise extract from the source that Joyce used is difficult to determine, there being multiple uses of the word or phrase in question. In these cases we use an exemplary extract based on the cluster in which it is found. Joyce's focus was on approximate sense rather than exact sense, and the incorporation (however far-fetched in an Eccles Street context) of a scientific pedigree to the elements used (eg, the &lsquo;false balance&rsquo; of Molly's mind). It provides, at the same time, much lighthearted humour to this otherwise rather dry episode. </li> </ul> </dd> </dl>
