<div class="nbunit" id="2or3May1905"><font color="red">2 or 3 May 1905</font>, <cite>Selected Letters</cite> 60-1 (JJ to Stanislaus Joyce): Via S. Nicolo 30, II&deg;, Trieste, Austria. <br>I want my verses to be published in the autumn. I have finished Chaps XV. XVI. XVII. XVIII. XIX. XX and XXI. I am now at Chap XXII. I would write another &lsquo;Dubliner&rsquo; if I knew definitely the result of &lsquo;Hallow Eve&rsquo;. I do not think I can write any more verse. [&hellip;] My entering for this [prize puzzle] competition has kept me a very long time on Chap XXII but you may expect to receive the chapters of the University College episode in a few weeks. I have written to Grant Richards asking for my manuscript [of verses] and if he is done for I shall send a copy of the verses to John Lane as I want them published by the end of the year.</div>
