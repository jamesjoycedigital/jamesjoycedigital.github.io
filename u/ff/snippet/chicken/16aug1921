<div class="nbunit" id="16Aug1921"><font color="red">16 August 1921</font>, <cite>Selected Letters</cite> (JJ to Frank Budgen): First of all send me that <cite>Sieges of Gibraltar</cite> and also Conan Doyle&apos;s <cite>History of the South African War</cite> published by same house Nelson in their cheap collection &hellip; registered and express &hellip; As regards that 60pp book would it be too much to suggest to you the following: get an exercise book and detach the leaves of it. If you read rapidly through the book again you could jot down on the sheets anything <i>in the words of the book</i> you think interesting and a quick sketch of those views (not artistic I am <i>not</i> an artist) this plan you might follow with the other books and then simply put the sheets in an envelope and send them on to me. <cite>Penelope</cite> is the <i>clou</i> [Fr. star-turn] of the book. The first sentence contains 2500 words. There are eight sentences in the episode. It begins and ends with the female word <i>yes</i>. It turns like the huge earth ball slowly surely and evenly round spinning, its four cardinal points being the female breasts, arse, womb and cunt expressed by the words <i>because</i>, <i>bottom</i> (in all senses bottom button, bottom of the class, bottom of the sea, bottom of his heart), <i>woman</i>, <i>yes</i>. Though probably more obscene than any preceding episode it seems to me to be perfectly sane full amoral fertilisable untrustworthy engaging shrewd limited prudent indifferent <i>Weib</i>. <i>Ich bin der</i> [sic] <i>Fleisch der stets bejaht.</i></div>
