<div class="nbunit" id="20Mar1918"><font color="red">20 March 1918</font>, <cite>Letters I</cite> (JJ to Harriet Weaver): You are very kind to send me payment for the serial rights of a book (<cite>Ulysses</cite>) which is causing you and your paper so much trouble &hellip; I have sent the first episode of the Odyssey [&lsquo;Calypso&rsquo;] to Mr Pound but I must apologise for the very bad typescript. I shall try to have the following episodes done better. I hope it is legible in spite of the typist&apos;s mistakes &hellip; Mr Pinker wrote me some time ago about ceding to you the book rights of <cite>Ulysses</cite>. I do so gladly &hellip; Mr Richards is entitled by contract to a right of refusal which expires on 15 June 1919. The novel will hardly have run to its end then and in any case I do not think he would consider it for publication at any time.</div>
