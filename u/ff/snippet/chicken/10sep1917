<div class="nbunit" id="10Sep1917"><font color="red">10 September 1917</font>, <cite>Pound/Joyce</cite> (Ezra Pound to Nora Joyce): The Egoist is going to serialize Ulysses, that much you can tell James. So long as he gets paid fairly soon I don&apos;t suppose it matters what month the  actual printing of the story begins. The Little Review is ready to hold down the American copyright for him, and print to synchronize with Egoist &hellip; Still I think the chances of James getting &pound;100 altogether for serial rights to &ldquo;Ulysses&rdquo; (or as much as printers will print) are fairly good.</div>
