<div class="nbunit" id="22Jun1920"><font color="red">22 June 1920</font>, <cite>JML</cite> (JJ to Margaret Anderson): I shall be obliged if you will pass on to Mr Huebsch the typescript of <cite>Ulysses</cite>, as he is signing a contract for publication which my agent has drawn up. The last adventure <cite>Circe</cite> is being written; that of <cite>Oxen of the Sun</cite> was sent on to you by Mr Pound from Sirmione, Italy, some weeks ago. The close of the book is also drafted and I shall send it in the autumn. I hope to leave Trieste in a week or so for Paris. Having worked very hard I need a few months&apos; rest. Letters sent to me here will be forwarded by my brother.</div>
