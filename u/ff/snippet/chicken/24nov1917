The first episode of the Telemachia has to be typed as quickly as possible so that the printers can get to work. I am sending it and you will get it Tuesday morning. Please let me hear from you then. On Monday will you please arrange with Mr Goldschmidt about beginning the typing on Tuesday &hellip; I remit M.O. 20 francs in advance as per our agreement.
