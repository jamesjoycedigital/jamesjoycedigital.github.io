Frankly I didn&apos;t like the size of the page (which in volume form is likely to fall out of the reader&apos;s hands when the narrative is more than usually unintelligible) but they tell me it is the usual form for such editions &hellip; I saw Mr Pound. He has read <cite>Circe</cite> and <cite>Eumeus</cite> about which he appears to be very excited </div>
