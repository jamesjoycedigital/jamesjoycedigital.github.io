<div class="nbunit" id="udn15"> The original <i>lotos</i> was a kind of clover [shamrock] on which horses chewed (and hence the presence in the episode of horses and horse-racing).  On a larger canvas, the theme of the 1904 Gold Cup race is of great importance in <cite>Ulysses</cite>. It surfaces here and re-appears in Aeolus, Lestrygonians, Wandering Rocks, Cyclops, Oxen, Eumeus, Ithaca and Penelope. Joyce had to hand two accounts of it. The first was from the London <cite>Times</cite>; the second from the Dublin <cite>Evening Telegraph</cite>.  </div>
