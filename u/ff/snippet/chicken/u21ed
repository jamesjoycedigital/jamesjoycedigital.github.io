<div class="nbunit" id="u21ed"><h4><cite>Ulysses</cite> by James Joyce, edited by Danis Rose and John O'Hanlon (London: Quercus: riverrun editions, 2021).</h4> <p>Other than a very few further corrections (see <a name="u17ed" href="#">below</a>), the text of this handsome paperback edition is the same as that of the 2017 Folio Press edition. The pagination, however, is different. As the size of the riverrun page is smaller, it was decided to increase the number of pages in order to maintain the clear readability of the 2017 edition.</p> <p>Some obvious errors are evident on collation with the manuscripts. Apart from these relatively few, the 2021/2017 text is based primarily on the typescripts, proofs, and lifetime corrections of the author, pursuant to a methodology once argued by Peter du Sautoy, late Trustee of the James Joyce Literary Estate: a proper edition should be the printing of what it was the author sent to his publishers to be published.</p> <p>The 2021 edition is available at some earthly bookshops and at most internet booksellers (e.g. <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ulysses-James-Joyce/dp/152940553X/ref=sr_1_19?dchild=1&keywords=ulysses+james+joyce&qid=1624869604&s=books&sr=1-19"  target="_blank">Amazon</a>), or direct from the  <a href="https://www.quercusbooks.co.uk/?s=ulysses" target="_blank">publishers</a>. The price (Â£9.99) is quite cheap for such a substantial book and accordingly, unlike the case with the 2017 Folio edition, readers should not fuss over annotating it or marking it up in any way.</p>  </div>
