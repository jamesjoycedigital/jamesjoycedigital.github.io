<div class="nbunit" id="22Dec1917"><font color="red">PM 22 December 1917</font>, <cite>Letters II</cite> (JJ to Claud Sykes): Please change the word  &lsquo;captive&rsquo; in phrase  &lsquo;Mr Deasy held his nose captive for a few moments&rsquo; etc to  &lsquo;tweaked&rsquo;. The reason I trouble you so often is that I make notes on stray bits of paper which I then forget in the most unlikely places, in books, under ornaments and in my pockets and on the back of advertisements. I hope you arranged about the machine.</div>
