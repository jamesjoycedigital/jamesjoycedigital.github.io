My intention is to remain here three months in order to write the last adventure <u>Circe</u> in peace (?) and also the first episode of the close. For this purpose I brought with me a recast of my notes and MS and also an extract of insertions for the first half of the book in case it be set up during my stay here. The book contains (unfortunately) one episode more than you suppose in your last letter. I am very tired of it and so is everybody else.&rdquo;</em> (<cite>Letters I</cite>, 142: to Harriet Weaver, <a name="12Jul1920" href="../ulett/ulett.htm#12Jul1920">12 July 1920</a>)  <p>In the following two notebooks, which form a pair, the notes are sorted according to <i>Ulysses</i> episodes. They were initially compiled for the purpose of revising (and expanding) already-drafted episodes. </p></dd>   </dl>
