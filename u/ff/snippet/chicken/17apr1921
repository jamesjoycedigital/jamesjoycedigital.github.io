<div class="nbunit" id="17Apr1921"><font color="red">17 April 1921</font>, <cite>Letters I</cite> (JJ to Harriet Weaver): I hoped to send you the first trial proofs with this letter &hellip; but they have not come &hellip; To my surprise I received a card from Mr Pound who is now in Paris. I met him yesterday and at his request gave him <cite>Circe</cite> and <cite>Eumeus</cite> to read and he will send them on to you (if he survives them) as before. As regards the former, the final typescript which arrived only yesterday, it is very difficult to follow on account of the medley of papers and types. Moreover, after p. 112 there should be a blank indicated where the scene or scenes burned by Mr Harrison will be replaced when I rewrite them. P.113 is not the proper sequence. The scene which intervenes covers an episode outside the door, a hue and cry in the street (imaginary) after Bloom and the opening scene of the quarrel.</div>
