<div class="nbunit" id="27Nov1934"><font color="red">27 November 1934</font> <i>NLPK</i> (from Paul L&eacute;on to J. Ralph Pinker): Nothing has been arranged for the proofreading of ULYSSES and certainly I could not do it as a foreigner. Mr Joyce himself is also not in a position to do it. At the time the Albatross went to the press, they asked Mr Gilbert to do the proof-reading but as it involved an expense I dare not suggest it to Lane. In England I daresay they will find a specialist without any suggestion from us, the important part is however that they should realise this is not a trifling matter and should give it some thought. </div>
