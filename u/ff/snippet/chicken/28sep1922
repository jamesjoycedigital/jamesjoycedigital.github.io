<div class="nbunit" id="28Sep1922"><font color="red">28 September 1922</font>, <cite>BLHW</cite> (JJ to Harriet Weaver): (also partly I) Mr Rodker sent me the list of misprints (which I should prefer to errata if it did not involve a slight depreciation of the printer). I am sending it back to him through you as it is better for you to explain my corrections. The lines cancelled in red pencil, bought in Paris, are to stand. These are not mistakes but beauties of my style hitherto undreamt of. The red cross at the top is not a signal to posterity to cease fire. It means that the paging is wrong. I have not checked the paging from p.680 on as my head was reeling after the effort. The corrections in black pencil are mistakes in the setting. Mr Rodker wants the proof at once so will you please let him have it. A revised proof should be sent to you which you could keep so that as soon as the second edition is out the printers could start to alter the plates for a third edition.</div>
