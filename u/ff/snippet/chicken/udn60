<div class="nbunit" id="udn60"> The impiety was not exactly his, but that of his companions. The offenses began well before the blinding of Polyphemos and the proscribed killing of the cattle of the sun-god, Helios. During the capture and sacking of Troy, Ajax, a king of the Locrenses in Greece, son to Oileus, raped Cassandra (the daughter of King Priam) in a temple dedicated to Athene, where she had sought sanctuary. The Achaeans failed to punish Ajax for this outrage, and Athene responded by causing stormy winds to blow most of their ships off-course on their return. Ajax was struck by her with lightning, just as he approached his homeland. This lesser mortal is not to be confused with another, greater Ajax, commander of the Salaminians in the Trojan war and the strongest Greek next Achilles, son to the sea goddess Thetis. Angered that the Achaean princes adjudged Odysseus to have the arms and armour of Achilles (armour crafted by the god Hephaestus, and offered up by Achilles&apos; mother after his death at the hands of Paris, son of Priam of Troy), Ajax committed suicide.  </p><p> According to Ovid, Ajax was turned into a flower: the hyacinth, or violet.  </div>
