<div class="nbunit" id="9Apr1917"><font color="red">9 April 1917</font>, <cite>Selected Letters</cite> (JJ to Ezra Pound): I have nothing ready &hellip; As regards excerpts from <cite>Ulysses</cite>, the only thing I could send would be the Hamlet chapter, or part of it &mdash; which, however, would suffer by excision &hellip; I have been thinking all day what I could do or write. Perhaps there is something if only I could think of it. Unfortunately I have very little imagination. I am also a very bad critic &hellip; I wonder if you will like the book I am writing? I am doing it, as Aristotle would say, by different means in different parts. Strange to say, in spite of my illness I have written enough lately. </div>
