<div class="nbunit" id="19Apr1921"><font color="red">19 April 1921</font>, <cite>Letters III</cite> (JJ to John Quinn): I understand that the typescript of <cite>Ulysses</cite> is on its way back, as I instructed. The publication of <cite>Ulysses</cite> (complete) was arranged here in a couple of days. I hope you received the MS of <cite>Circe</cite> and <cite>Eumeus</cite>. As a curiosity I threw in the 8th draft of the former &hellip; [Mrs Harrison] What I am concerned with is there is now a lacuna of several pages in the typescript, which has already gone to the printer, and I must write it in &hellip; Six or seven pages after Bloom&apos;s exit (which you will find at a glance by the long catalogue of persons in pursuit) will suffice  </div>
