Curran): Dublin. <br>I have finished the awful chapter&mdash;102 pages&mdash; [possibly Chapter XI) and Russell (A.E.) has the book now. I shall send you the chapter in a week. I am writing a series of epiclets&mdash;ten&mdash;for a paper. I have written one. I call the series <cite>Dubliners</cite> to betray the soul of that hemiplegia or paralysis which many consider a city. [&mdash;] S.D.</div>
