<div class="nbunit" id="6Dec1917"><font color="red">6 December 1917</font>, <cite>Letters I</cite> (JJ to Claud Sykes): At the beginning of the MS (page 9 of rough copy, probably 6 or 5 of yours) is the phrase &lsquo;He folded his razor and with the feeling <i>polpastrelli</i> of the fingers of his right hand touched his jaws and chin&rsquo;. In the version you have I changed the phrase but please tell me what is there now as I want to change it slightly again. Sorry to trouble you but it means only the addition of one or two words. You may remember I found some difficulty there. Glad to hear from Mr K that you have the machine &hellip; Cat and others well. Will send more MS I hope very soon. [Note by Sykes: Romeo Rogers &mdash; Cat&apos;s name &mdash; brought from Z to Loc.]</div>
