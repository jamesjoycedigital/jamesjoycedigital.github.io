<div class="nbunit" id="8Mar1918"><font color="red">8 March 1918</font>, <cite>SB</cite> (Harriet Weaver to JJ): I enclose draft of 525 francs (&pound;25), the second payment from the Egoist for the serial rights of your novel <cite>Ulysses</cite>. The novel is bitter reading to me at least &mdash; difficult too, the third section &mdash; but of vital interest. I am sorry to say our printers are making difficulties over it. The first episode is in type but at the last moment before going to press for the March number they refused to print it &mdash; even with deletions. </div>
