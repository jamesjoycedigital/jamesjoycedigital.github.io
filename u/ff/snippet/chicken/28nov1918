<div class="nbunit" id="28Nov1918"><font color="red">28 November 1918</font>, <cite>JJQ</cite> (Carl Bleibtreu to JJ): I am afraid I have little interest in this terrible time for details of that controversy. Yet occasionally I wrote something this summer about the sonnets in behalf of Oscar Wilde&apos;s theory. Your first question I do not understand. No, not before June 1904. 2) I do not know. The family Estates are mostly in Warwickshire, at the time of Lord Roger there was even a countie of Rutland. 3) The Sonnets allude to no man whatever, but to Shakespeare&apos;s own genius &mdash; the power of conseption [sic] &mdash;, separated from the Muse &mdash; the power of technical construction &mdash; personated by the Black Lady, wayward and fickle, as the Muse is, we poets know her ladyship. All that rumour about Mary Fulton is trash, she was fair (not &lsquo;black&rsquo;) and the love-passage between her and Lord Pembroke has nothing to do with the symbolism of the Sonnets. Only there is a possibility and probablility that Shakepeare&apos;s ever plastic and creative imagination took some personal observations from active life as a colouring of his allegorical composition. This would be in accordance with his dramatical instinct. 4) Mr W.H. is Mr. William Herbert (Lord Pembroke), the cousin of Rutland and afterwards executor of his intellectual will (Folio). Apparently he had a manuscript-copy of the Sonnets, as afterwards of many unknown plays in the Folio, and gave them to the editor Thorpe with the obligation to publish them <cite>anonymously</cite>, perhaps with the permission of Rutland or perhaps not. Thus he, W.H., is the &lsquo;begetter&rsquo;, by whom Thorpe <i>got it</i>. Considering that most of the Sonnets were written in the Tower, as I think certain (&lsquo;When in disgrace with fortune and men&apos;s eyes I all alone beweep my outcast state &hellip;&rsquo; &lsquo;Thus comes it, that my name does bear a brand&rsquo;), most things clear up, otherwise unintelligible. And the allusion &lsquo;from hence your memory death cannot take, although in me each part shall be forgotten&rsquo; &lsquo;my name entombed with my body be&rsquo; (I quote from memory, this last verse is not verbal) or the grandiloquent prophecy of eternal immortality for the adored &lsquo;lover&rsquo; (lover means in antique English &lsquo;admirer&rsquo; or admired one) till &lsquo;all the breathers of this world are dead&rsquo; &lsquo;even in the eyes of all posterity, which wears the world out to the ending doom&rsquo; &lsquo;till the day of judgement shall arise, you still shall live and love in lovers eyes&rsquo; is so distinct as possible: the adored one is no mortal, to whom such promise of eternal fame would be ridiculous. How could he get fame at all, if even the name of this mystical personage is never revealed? (Except &lsquo;Hughes&rsquo; in Wilde&apos;s absurdity.) But of course there is no need for that, for the name is exactly that name all the world knows: Shakespeare, the nom de guerre of His own genius. And from that name he, the <i>person</i> of The Poet, is entirely <i>separated</i> and will be buried <i>without</i> this his real name of his immortal self &mdash; he will be buried as the simple Lord Rutland, not under the name of the greatest mortal that ever lived. &lsquo;My name entombed with my body be.&rsquo; Now the Sonnets are the only inheritance we have of Shakespeares real personal life, a sort of lyrical and mystical (not mystifying) diary, and it is most significant that the Baconians evade any touch with the Sonnets like poison, because here is absolutely nothing in them which would not be in absolute contradction to Bacons life. It is quite the same with the life of the Stratford vulgarian, and the only allusion which the Stratford scholars grasp: &lsquo;my name bears a brand&rsquo; as a stage-player, is downright nonsence [sic], because we know the good position of actors like Burbridge and others &mdash; whereas it is as clear as daylight for a person condemned to lifelong imprisonment for <i>high-treason</i>. 5) This is not part of my theory, because it is only a suggestion, first emanated by an American Baconian. But it is possible; then I should think Pembroke or Ben Jonson did it. 6) I do not understand, you must have mis-read. 7) In summer 1904 I was undoubtedly in Berlin and was nearly every day in the Caf&eacute; Kaiserhof, the centre of chess=players and visited by many literary people. 9) The monthly of the New Jersey Shakesperian [sic] Society, which has send [sic] me one [or] two numbers, contained the statement, that Sid. Lee was Simon Lazarus, clothed in the ironical question, why other people as Shakespeare had sometimes the hobby to change their names. 8) This fool I know very well because I have ridiculed very often his collossal [sic] ignorance in quoting Marlowes [sic] &lsquo;Faustus&rsquo; about Hamlets [sic] &lsquo;Wittenberg&rsquo;. (The academical scholar Marlowe did not know Wittenberg, he spells it Wirtenberg, Wortenberg, Wartenberg, only the last edition long after his death spells rightly Wittenberg, corrected after Hamlet &mdash; but the ignorant Stratford comedian should have known this German university, known it too as the university where all Danish and Swedish noblemen studied &mdash; especially Rosencrans and Gyldenstjerne!) &hellip; I  have read once a rather mediocre, but well-intentioned essay of Dowden about Othello, but the way of his polemics in defence of the Stratford clown is worthy even of Sidney Lee. You must have forgotten my book, for I mention there Dowden often enough. </div>
