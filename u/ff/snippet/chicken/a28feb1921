<div class="nbunit" id="a28Feb1921"><font color="red">28 February 1921</font>, <cite>Selected Letters</cite> (JJ to Frank Budgen): <cite>Circe</cite> is finished long ago, also <cite>Eumeus</cite> and I am writing <cite>Ithaca</cite>. I have dreadful worries about a typist. Four declined to do <cite>Circe</cite>, at last one admirer(ess) volunteered. She started but when she had done 100 pp her father got a seizure in the street (a Circean episode) and now my MS is written out in a fair hand by someone who passes it to someone else who sends it to be typed. I sent <cite>Eumeus</cite> to a third typist &hellip; No word [from] Trieste where I wrote asking for the forwarding of certain MSS &hellip; I am writing <cite>Ithaca</cite> in the form of a mathematical catechism. All events are resolved into their cosmic physical, psychical etc. equivalents, e.g. Bloom jumping down the area, drawing water from the tap, the micturation in the garden, the cone of incense, lighted candle and statue so that not only will the reader know everything and know it in the baldest coldest way, but Bloom and Stephen thereby become heavenly bodies, wanderers like the stars at which they gaze. The last word (human, all too human) is left to Penelope. This is the indispensible countersign to Bloom&apos;s passport to eternity &hellip; I am heaping all kinds of lies into the mouth of that sailorman in <cite>Eumeus</cite> which will make you laugh. At one time I thought the slaughter of the sailors un-Ulyssean. In my present frame of mind, I have modified my opinion</div>
