<div class="nbunit" id="26Oct1918"><font color="red">26 October 1918</font>, <cite>Letters I</cite> (JJ to Harriet Weaver): I have had no letter from Mr Pound for a long time and I hope he is not ill. I am surprised that you have not received from him the seventh episode (Eolus) which I sent a long time ago. I sent yesterday the eight episode (Lestrygonians) so perhaps you can ask him to send you both together &hellip; I must also apologise for the slow rate at which I deliver the chapters. But I hope they will be dispatched some day. I am writing now the Hamlet episode (Scylla and Charybdis).</div>
