<div class="nbunit" id="17Oct1922"><font color="red">17 October 1922</font>, <cite>BLHW</cite> (JJ to Harriet Weaver): (also partly I) At Dijon I spoke to Mr Darantiere who thinks that the correction of plates ought to be begun at once so that when ever a third edition is called for the book can appear letter perfect. He says the cost will be about 1 fr. per &lsquo;operation&rsquo; (agreeable word) that is change of letter or word or line. He asked me if the list of errata prepared was final. I said it was not but that I would read through the book and prepare the final list. Meanwhile if you approve we could begin with your list and my additions. I am reading steadily through the book and am preparing the list though it is not amusing work and I cannot do more than 30pp a day. When I send it to you of course it will include the errors you collected but these can be struck out. If I had your list I would do it. There are a few general remarks to be added. The impression of certain pages of the second edition seems to me rather faint. Also will it be possible to change those broken &lsquo;f&apos;s which are very irritating? There are some misprints also in the leaflet of press extracts. And, finally, experts say (and Mr Darantiere agrees) that the only blemish in the book is the type of capitals used in the Eolus episode. The book is set in Elzevir and these are Grasset. There are no Elzevir capitals it seems. I suggest (and Mr Darantiere agreed) that it would be better to substitute block capitals especially as these are the type used by newspapers.</div>
