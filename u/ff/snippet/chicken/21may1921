<div class="nbunit" id="21May1921"><font color="red">21 May 1921</font>, T.S. Eliot to JJ: I am returning your three mss by registered post as you require and am exceedingly obliged for a taste of them. I think they are superb &mdash; especially the Descent into Hell, which is stupendious. Only, in detail, I object to one or two phrases of Elijah: &lsquo;ring up&rsquo; is English, &lsquo;call up&rsquo; American; &lsquo;trunk line&rsquo;, if applied to the telephone service, is English, the American is, if I remember, &lsquo;long distance&rsquo;. I don&apos;t quite like the wording of the coon transformation of Elijah, either, but I cannot suggest any detailed alteration. But otherwise, I have nothing but admiration, in fact, I wish, for my own sake, that I had not read it.</div>
