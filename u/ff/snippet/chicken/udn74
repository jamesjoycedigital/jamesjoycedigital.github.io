<div class="nbunit" id="udn74"> Anciently, the winds were conceived of as horse-shaped spirits. The floating Aeolian island of Homer, Aiolia, was in the time of Pausanias believed to be Lipara, and this or Strongyle was accordingly regarded in later times as the place in which the god of the winds dwelled. Other accounts locate it elsewhere, in Thrace or near Rhegium in Italy.  The adjective &lsquo;aiolos&rsquo;  (= glittering) was applied to the starry night-sky.  </div>
