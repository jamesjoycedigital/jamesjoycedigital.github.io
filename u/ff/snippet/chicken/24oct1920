<div class="nbunit" id="24Oct1920"><font color="red">24 October 1920</font>, <cite>Selected Letters</cite> (JJ to Frank Budgen): Flat hunting &hellip; Must leave here on Friday or Saturday. A dreadful job and of course <cite>Circe</cite> put aside completely &hellip; The problems raised in <cite>Circe</cite> (of good taste, tact, technique, etc) are taking up all my time. In order to solve them I must be delivered of all other cares &hellip; P.S. Last night I thought of an <i>Entr&apos;acte</i> for Ulysses in middle of book after 9th episode <cite>Scylla and Charybdis</cite>. Short with absolutely no relation to what precedes or follows like a pause in the action of a play. It would have to be balanced by a <i>matutine</i> (very short) before the opening and a <i>nocturne</i> (also short) after the end. What? I agree about the explanation of syphilis. I always thought the etymology was syn philein (together with loving, connected with it) but a man named Bradley says the other. Moly could also be absinthe the cerebral impotentising (!!) drink or chastity. Damn Homer, Ulysses, Bloom and all the rest.</div>
