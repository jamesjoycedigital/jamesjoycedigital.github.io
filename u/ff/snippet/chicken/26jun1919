<div class="nbunit" id="26Jun1919"><font color="red">26 June 1919</font>, <cite>NYPL</cite> (John Quinn to JJ):: Would you care to dispose of the manuscript of &lsquo;Ulysses&rsquo;? How many pages will it run? If it is not finished and you wish to dispose of it, to me, I should be glad to send you a draft on account &hellip; P.S. If you wish to trade with me for the MS. of &lsquo;Exiles&rsquo; [sic, means &lsquo;Ulysses&rsquo;], please do not send it without having it carefully wrapped, fully insured, and sent by registered post. But there is no hurry about sending it.</div>
