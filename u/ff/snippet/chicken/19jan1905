<div class="nbunit" id="19Jan1905"><font color="red">19 January 1905</font>, <cite>Selected Letters</cite> 50-1 (JJ to Stanislaus Joyce): 7 Via Medolino, 1&deg;. Pola, Austria. <br>I send you the fourth story of &lsquo;Dubliners&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Hallow Eve&rsquo;&mdash;which I want you to offer at once to the Editor of Irish Homestead.[&hellip;] You know I have no-one to talk to. Nora, of course, doesn't give a rambling damn about art [&hellip;] when she saw me copy Epiphanies into my novel ]<cite>Stephen Hero</cite>] she asked would all that paper be wasted&mdash;which made me think of Heine. She wants me to hurry up the novel and get rich and go to live in Paris. Paris and Zurich she likes very much but Pola is a queer old place.</div>
