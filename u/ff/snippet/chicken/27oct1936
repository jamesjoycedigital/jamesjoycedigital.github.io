<div class="nbunit" id="27Oct1936"><font color="red">27 October 1936</font> <i>NLJL</i> (from Paul L&eacute;on to John Lane The Bodley Head): As far as the misprints are concerned it seems that the pages which were opened at random proved particularly unhappy. I gave your brother the list of misprints on pages 368-373 (eight or nine). Since Mr Joyce read page 600-610 and found one misprint only. </div>
