<div class="nbunit" id="5Dec1918"><font color="red">5 December 1918</font>, <cite>Yale</cite> (JJ to Ezra Pound): Many thanks for your kind &hellip; words about my book <cite>Ulysses</cite>. The book is in 18 episodes: Telemachia (3), Wanderings (12), Nostos (3). If regularly sent and printed it should run till the autumn of next year. I cannot possibly deliver any faster than I am doing. I suppose you understand this already. If sometimes a month goes by without my contribution I cannot help it. I cannot send any episode till it is quite finished. However, I send you an inclusive receipt which may be of use (or detriment?) to you if you are looking for someone to finance the review after April next. If any other money comes in I shall be glad to receive more &hellip; very soon I shall send you the <cite>Scylla and Charybdis</cite> episode (Hamlet) and immediately afterwards the Wandering rocks. I hope that Mrs Pound, if she ever honours me by reading the former, will not take amiss certain words of Telemachus about her illustrious ex-namesake.</div>
