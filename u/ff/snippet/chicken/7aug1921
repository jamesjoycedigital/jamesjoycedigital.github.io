<div class="nbunit" id="7Aug1921"><font color="red">7 August 1921</font>, <cite>BLHW</cite> (JJ to Harriet Weaver): (also partly I) I am advised to go to Aix-les-Bains but am in Ithaca instead. I write and revise and correct with one or two eyes about twelve hours a day I should say &hellip; I believe some 5000 prospectuses went out and the capture is 260 but people ought not to be told this figure &hellip; I have the greater part of <cite>Ithaca</cite> but it has to be completed, revised and rearranged above all on account of its scheme. I have also written the first sentence of <cite>Penelope</cite> but as this contains about 2500 words the deed is more than it seems to be. The episode consists of eight or nine sentences equally sesquipedalian and ends with a monosyllable. Bloom and all the Blooms will soon be dead, thank God</div>
