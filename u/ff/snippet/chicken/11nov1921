<div class="nbunit" id="11Nov1921"><font color="red">11 November 1921</font>, <cite>Letters III</cite>(JJ to Valery Larbaud): Here is my copy of the book so far for you to look through to refresh your memory. I should like to have it back as soon as possible &mdash; even piecemeal &mdash; as I need it to refer to. One copy of each page proof coming in will also be sent you. I add the unrevised pages (galley) of the Messianic scene from <cite>Circe</cite></div>
