<div class="nbunit" id="19Jun1918"><font color="red">19 June 1918</font>, <cite>SB</cite> (Harriet Weaver to JJ): Many thanks for your letter. I had hoped there would have been something definite to say before this as to the appearance of your novel <cite>Ulysses</cite> in the form of a supplement but the matter is still unsettled. Unfortunately Mr and Mrs Woolf &hellip; would have liked to do it as they were very much interested in the first four episodes which they read &hellip; Mr Pound sent his copy of the typescript to America and the book started in the <cite>Little Review</cite> for March. I hope all will go well with the writing of the rest of it. It is not tiresome to me to hear how your book is written: I like to hear it.</div>
