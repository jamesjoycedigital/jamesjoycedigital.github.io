<div class="nbunit" id="19Oct1937"><font color="red">19 October 1937</font> <i>NLHW</i> (from Harriet Weaver to Paul L&eacute;on): And now I must express regret that I did not send you months ago a list of errors I noticed in the English edition of <i>Ulysses</i>. The reason I did not send it was that, as you yourself had spoken of the many errors Mr Joyce had noticed, I imagined that the type for the trade edition would be reset from the text used for the <i>de luxe</i> edition and not from that edition itself, as, I can see, it has been, the paging being precisely the same and many of the errors being repeated. It seems to be chiefly the errors in the <i>Oxen of the Sun</i> episode that have been corrected. I enclose now, all too late, those on the list I made that occur again in the trade edition, a few of which are rather unfortunate ones. I regret very much not having sent them to you in time for the corrections to be made in the new edition. </div>
