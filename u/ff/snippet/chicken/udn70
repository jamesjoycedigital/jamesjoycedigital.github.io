<div class="nbunit" id="udn70"> Cape Malea is a peninsula and cape in the southeast of Greece and is the south-easternmost cape in continental Europe. It overlooks a strategic sea-passage in the eastern Mediterranean that joins the Aegean with the Ionian Islands and western Europe. The seas around the cape have traditionally been treacherous and difficult to navigate. The island of Cythera (or Kythira) is strategically located between the Greek mainland and Crete at the southwestern exit from the Aegean Sea, behind Cape Malea.  </p><p> In Ancient Greek mythology, here was believed to lie the island of Aphrodite, the Goddess of love, and from ancient times (and onward until the mid-nineteenth century) it was a crossroads of merchants, sailors, and war expeditions. It has had a long and varied history and has been influenced by many cultures and civilizations. The sea-snail that produces the prized Tyrian purple dye is native to the island.  </div>
