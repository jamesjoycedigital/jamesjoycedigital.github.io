Ralph Pinker to Paul L&eacute;on):eacute;on): I have a letter from Lane this morning as follows: "We have now had our first slip proof in of "Ulysses" and there are a number of queries which we think should be put to Mr Joyce before proceeding. <br>  In the first 41 pages taken from the Albatross edition from which we are working, we would like you to query the following: <br> Page 15, line 14. Should there not be a comma after "loaf" [Paul L&eacute;on: Yes] <br> Page 28, line 13. Should there not be a question mark after "death" [Yes] <br> Page 36, line 10. Should not "boy&apos;s" be "boys" [boys&apos;] <br> Page 36, line 26. "which so often in our history" Is this correct [Yes correct] <br> Page 41, line 1.  "crik, crick". Is this right or should both words be spelt the same "crick, crick" [both ck] [Answered July 6, 1936] </div>
