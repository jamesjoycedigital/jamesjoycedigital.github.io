<div class="nbunit" id="24Jul1917"><font color="red">24 July 1917</font>, <cite>Yale</cite> (JJ to Ezra Pound): As soon as Mr Quinn&apos;s remittance [for <cite>Exiles</cite> MS] or my next instalment of money arrives in a  few days I shall send my wife and family for the holidays to Lago Maggiore. I did not hear from Mr Quinn. Has he now all the acts of the play? If not, please send him acts two and three. If they are lost I shall recopy them for him &hellip; As regards <cite>Ulysses</cite> I write and think and write and think all day and part of the night. It goes on as it has been going these five or six years. But the ingredients will not fuse until they have reached a certain temperature &hellip;</p> <p class="set">Now let awhile my messmates be <br>My ponderous Penelope <br>And sly Ulysses born anew <br>In Dublin as an Irish jew. <br>With them I&apos;ll sit, with them I&apos;ll drink <br>Nor heed what press and pressmen think <br>Nor leave their rockbound house of joy <br>For Helen or for windy Troy </div>
