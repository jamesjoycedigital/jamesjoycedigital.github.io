<div class="nbunit" id="20Mar1920"><font color="red">20 March 1920</font>, <cite>Selected Letters</cite> (JJ to Frank Budgen): I thought if you came you could bring the MS of <cite>Ulysses</cite> &hellip; Am working hard on <cite>Oxen of the Sun</cite>, the idea being the crime committed against fecundity by sterilizing the act of coition. Scene, lying-in hospital. Technique:  a nine-parted epsiode without divisions introduced by a Sallustian-Tacitean prelude (the unfertilized ovum), then by way of earliest English alliterative and monosyllabic and Anglo-Saxon (&lsquo;Before born the babe had bliss. Within the womb he won worship.&rsquo; &lsquo;Bloom dull dreamy heard: in held hat stony staring&rsquo;) then by way of Mandeville (&lsquo;there came forth a scholar of medicine that men clepen etc&rsquo;) then Malory&apos;s <cite>Morte d&apos;Arthur</cite> (&lsquo;but that franklin Lenehan was prompt ever to pour them so that at the least way mirth should not lack&rsquo;), then the Elizabethan chronicle style (&lsquo;about that present time young Stephen filled all cups&rsquo;), then a passage solemn, as of Milton, Taylor, Hooker, followed by a choppy Latin-gossipy bit, style of Burton-Browne, then a passage Bunyanesque (&lsquo;the reason was that in the way he fell in with a certain whore whose name she said is Bird in the Hand&rsquo;) after a diarystyle bit Pepys-Evelyn (&lsquo;Bloom sitting snug with a party of wags, among then Dixon jun., Ja. Lynch, Doc. Madden and Stephen D. for a languor he had before and was now better, he having dreamed tonight a strange fancy and Mistress Purefoy there to be delivered, poor body, two days past her time and the midwives hard put to it, God send her quick issue&rsquo;) and so on through Defoe-Swift and Steele-Addison-Sterne and Landor-Pater-Newman until it ends in a frightful jumble of Pidgin English, nigger English, Cockney, Irish, Bowery slang and broken doggerel. This progression is also linked back at each part subtly with some foregoing episode of the day and, besides this, with the natural stages of development in the embryo and the periods of faunal evolution in general. The double-thudding Saxon motive recurs from time to time (&lsquo;Loth to move from Horne&apos;s house&rsquo;) to give the sense of the hoofs of Oxen. Bloom is the spermatozoon, the hospital the womb, the nurse the ovum, Stephen the embryo. How&apos;s that for high? </div>
