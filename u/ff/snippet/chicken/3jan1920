<div class="nbunit" id="3Jan1920"><font color="red">3 January 1920</font>, <cite>Selected Letters</cite> (JJ to Frank Budgen): For six weeks after my arrival I neither read nor wrote nor spoke. But as it cannot go on so I started <cite>Nausikaa</cite> and have written less than half. Perhaps I can finish it for February 2. No reply from Mrs M. It seems that gentility cannot be acquired in a single generation. Quinn replied after a month offering 700 frs down on account of <cite>Ulysses</cite> MS. I did not answer. He now offers 1500 frs down, without naming the ultimate sum. I shall write to Mrs M. to know if she wants it &hellip; To abandon the book now would be madness. First half of <cite>Cyclops</cite> appeared in November with excision of the erection allusion &hellip; <cite>Nausikaa</cite> is written in a namby-pamby jammy marmalady drawersy (alto l&agrave;!) style with effects of incense, mariolatry, masturbation, stewed cockles, painter&apos;s palette, chitchat, circumlocutions, etc etc. Not so long as the others. </div>
