<div class="nbunit" id="5Jan1920"><font color="red">5 January 1920</font>, <cite>Selected Letters</cite> (JJ to Aunt Josephine): Will you please send me a bundle of other novelettes and any penny hymnbook you can find as I need them? &hellip; Another thing I wanted to know is whether there are trees (and of what kind) behind the Star of the Sea church in Sandymount visible from the shore and also whether there are steps leading down at the side of it from Leahy&apos;s terrace. If you can find out these facts for me quickly I shall be glad.</div>
