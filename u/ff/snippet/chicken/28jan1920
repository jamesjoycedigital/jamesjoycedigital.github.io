<div class="nbunit" id="28Jan1920"><font color="red">28 January 1920</font>, <cite>SB</cite> (Harriet Weaver to JJ): I am doubly glad that the whole manuscript has arrived intact because, although I am touched that you should suggest copying out for me any or all of it that might fail to reach me, I should have been very sorry for you to waste your time in such a way &hellip; In view of what happened to the &lsquo;original&rsquo; original it is fortunate that the chapters of <cite>Ulysses</cite> are typed out as soon as they are written and the typescript dispatched to safer keeping in England and America!</div>
