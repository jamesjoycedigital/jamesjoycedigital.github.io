<div class="nbunit" id="udn52"> Hyperion's son Helios was referred to in early mythological writings as Helios Hyperion (&ldquo;Sun High-one&rdquo;). In the <cite>Odyssey</cite>, Hesiod&apos;s <cite>Theogony</cite> and the Homeric <cite>Hymn to Demeter</cite>, the Sun is once in each work called Hyperionides (&ldquo;son of Hyperion&rdquo;), and in other writings Hesiod certainly imagines Hyperion as a separate being. In later Greek literature, Hyperion is distinguished from Helios; the former was ascribed the characteristics of the &ldquo;God of Watchfulness, Wisdom and the Light,&rdquo; while the latter became the physical incarnation of the Sun. Hyperion is an obscure figure in Greek culture and mythology, mainly appearing in lists of the twelve Titans.   </div>
