<div class="nbunit" id="fh13ed"><h4><cite>Finn's Hotel</cite> by James Joyce, edited by Danis Rose (Dublin: Ithys Press, 2013).</h4> </p><p>This book is a serio-comic collection of &lsquo;little epics&rsquo; that James Joyce wrote in 1923 just before he began to work seriously on the hugely complex enterprise that became <cite>Finnegans Wake</cite>. Its existence and significance were discovered some decades ago &hellip; and its publication thwarted for twenty years. The first edition (2013) is edited and arranged by Danis Rose, introduced by Seamus Deane, illustrated by Casey Sorrow, and designed &amp; printed in letterpress by Michael Caine. Further details may be found on the <a href="https://ithyspress.wordpress.com/titles/finns-hotel-by-james-joyce/" target="_blank">Ithys Press</a> website. </p><p>Unfortunately, there is at present no cheap edition, though the book is available in a number of translations, including German, Greek, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, and Spanish. Links to the publishers of those editions can be found on the <a href="https://ithyspress.wordpress.com/translations-trade-editions/" target="_blank">Ithys Press</a> website.</p>  </div>
