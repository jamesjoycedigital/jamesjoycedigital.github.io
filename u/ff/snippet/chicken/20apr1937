<div class="nbunit" id="20Apr1937"><font color="red">20 April 1937</font> <i>NLMS</i> (from Paul L&eacute;on to Messrs Monro Saw): As far as the text is concerned I am afraid that I have not yet been able to make myself understood. The text of the John Lane edition is the latest and revised text by Mr Joyce in so far as he has given about 100 or 150 corrections and verifications of this text by letter in reply to queries from John Lane. Unfortunately however the text of the John Lane presents an unwarranted number of new mistakes, which are not to be found in the Albatross text. There are for instance some 8 unwarranted misprints on pages 368-373 of the Lane edition which are not in the Albatross. The new firm must have found in the files of the old the numerous letters I have written in reply to queries about the text. The best way to proceed is to go by the Albatross text introducing all these replies to queries. Otherwise I see no other way to proceed than to keep to the Albatross text combining for the punctuation the later Lane text. Still this latter course is less secure as I do not remember all the queries sent and some of them may have also referred to actual words and not only to punctuation. <br>The same applies to the Appendix which has such incredible mistakes as a date "37th of December" or a title "A please for university coeducation". But here it is easier to proceed as I could easily have these misprints corrected myself provided I get the galleys of proofs. But again they must have all the documents which went to constitute the Appendix in the files of the former John Lane company&apos;s archives. </div>
