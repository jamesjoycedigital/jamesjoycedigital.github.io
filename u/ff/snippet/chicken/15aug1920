<div class="nbunit" id="15Aug1920"><font color="red">15 August 1920</font>, <cite>NYPL</cite> (John Quinn to JJ):: I received July 13 your letter &hellip; June 24, 1920 &hellip; There was received at my office in a parcel marked &lsquo;Via Cherbourg&rsquo; day before yesterday, August 13, nine separately fastened sections of MS. &hellip; These sections make a total of 235 MS. pages &hellip; I am cabling to Thomas Cook and Sons, Paris, on your account, 3400 francs, which is the equivalent of $250 at the present rate of exchange &hellip; It is difficult, in fact impossible, to put a price upon a MS. until it is completed. Perhaps when I receive the nine further chapters or episodes I might send you a further advance on account of the total price of the MS.</div>
