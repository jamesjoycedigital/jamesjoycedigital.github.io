<div class="nbunit" id="a22Apr1917"><font color="red">22 April 1917</font>, <cite>Pound Letters</cite> (Ezra Pound to LR): I have sent on Joyce&apos;s letter to Quinn, a short formal letter and a long gay one. Perhaps you had better announce simply &ldquo;James Joyce has written to say that he will be among the early contributors to the magazine&rdquo; &hellip;I should like room for more prose from Yeats, AND for Joyce&apos;s next novel, when finished.</div>
