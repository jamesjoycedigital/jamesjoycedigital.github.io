<div class="nbunit" id="udn95"> Odysseus was effectively Kalypso&apos;s lover for six or seven years. Indeed, Hesiod relates that he had two sons by her, Nausithoos and Nausinoos. In the <cite>Odyssey</cite> on the night before launching his raft they copulate one last time, for old time&apos;s sake, so to speak.  </div>
