<div class="nbunit" id="a12Jan1916"><font color="red">12 January 1916</font>, <cite>Pound/Joyce</cite> (Ezra Pound to JJ): I dont know whether they would let me have some money in the spring to make advance purchases with. I dont even know what you have that I could use. I should want, I think, some of some prose you once wrote of, and the continuation of the &ldquo;Artist&rdquo; when it is ready.</div>
