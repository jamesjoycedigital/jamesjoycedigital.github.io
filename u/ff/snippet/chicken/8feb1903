[&hellip;] Words cannot measure my contempt for AE at present (I believe he didn't write to Lady Gregory) and his spiritual friends. I did well however to leave my MSS with him for I had a motive. However I shall take them back as my latest additions to &lsquo;Epiphany&rsquo; might not be to his liking.</div>
