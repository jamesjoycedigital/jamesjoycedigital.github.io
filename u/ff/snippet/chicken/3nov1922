At the end of the cahier are the names of Group B to whom I should like copies of the new leaflet A (on different coloured paper) to be forwarded. I hope you can read my handwriting as I could only scribble &hellip; can you send me one for myself and also the July number which has an article on Monsieur Proust</div>
