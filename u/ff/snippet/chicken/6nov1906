I am waiting for the <i>S.F.</i> [Sinn Fein] policy to make headway in the hope that he will join it, for no doubt whatever exists in my mind but that, if he gets the chance and the moment comes, he will play the part of [betrayers] MacNally and Reynolds. I do not say this out of spleen. It is my final view of his character: a very native Irish growth, and if I begin to write my novel again it is in this way I shall treat them. It is not far-fetched to say that my action, and that of men like Ibsen &amp;c, is a virtual intellectual strike. I would call such people as Gogarty and Yeats and Colm the blacklegs of literature. Because they have tried to substitute us, to serve the old idols at a lower rate when we refused to do so for a higher.</div>
