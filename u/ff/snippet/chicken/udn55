<div class="nbunit" id="udn55"> Digamma, or wau, &ldquo;&gammad;&rdquo;, was part of the original archaic Greek alphabet as initially adopted from Phoenician [waw] and stood in the sixth position in the alphabet, between epsilon and zeta.  It has principally remained in use as a Greek numeral for 6; as such, it was called episemon during the Byzantine era and is now known as stigma  after the Byzantine ligature combining sigma and tau. As an alphabetic letter, it is attested in archaic and dialectal ancient Greek inscriptions until the classical period.  </div>
