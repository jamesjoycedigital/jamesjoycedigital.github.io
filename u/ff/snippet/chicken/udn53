<div class="nbunit" id="udn53"> The rhapsodes were celebrated reciters and singers of poetry and often well-to-do. The Homeridae were those scholarly preservers of the text who recited the poems &ldquo;by right of succession&rdquo;.  These were perhaps akin to nit-picking modern-day Joyce scholars. Originally, the Poems would have been spoken, or more exactly sung, perhaps in fragments, by the rhapsodes to the accompaniment of a lyre. They were not written down, but memorized and extemporized. Their roots are thus strictly in what is now termed orature. Their maker (known as The Poet, after poetas or &ldquo;maker&rdquo;), or (better) collocator  ?  Homer ?  is not unambiguously known, as the poem was creatively transmitted through a succession of individuals since its inception. The popular tradition that it was composed <i>ab initio</i> in some ur-form by a blind bard some time between the late eighth and late seventh century B.C., somewhere in Ionia (the Greek coastal region of Anatolia in present-day Turkey) is a simplification.  </div>
