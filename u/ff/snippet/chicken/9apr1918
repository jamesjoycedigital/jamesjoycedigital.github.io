<div class="nbunit" id="9Apr1918"><font color="red">9 April 1918</font>, <cite>Yale</cite> (JJ to Ezra Pound): I have received your card and letter &hellip; and am glad to hear that the first part of the Telemachia has appeared in your review &hellip; Since it seems that the appearance of the book in the <cite>The Egoist</cite> will be delayed I request you to change the amount against the balance of serial rights coming to me &hellip; I shall send you tomorrow the second episode of the odyssey, the Lotophagos. I am sorry you do not like the Calypso-Penelope episode. The text however is to remain exactly as I wrote it &hellip; I am also well enough but suffer occasionally &hellip; the price of all things go up and up. I shall look forward to a renewal of the treasury grant made me two years ago and need scarcely say that if it be doubled I shall be doubly grateful.</div>
