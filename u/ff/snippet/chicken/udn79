<div class="nbunit" id="udn79"> In the <cite>Metamorphoses</cite> of Ovid (12-14),  Skylla was said to have transformed by a jealous Kirke into a monster. She is elsewhere identified with Skylla, daughter to and betrayer of King Nisus of Megara, out of love for Minos, king of Crete.  She was often rationalized in antiquity as a rock or reef. In mythology, Charybdis aided her father Poseidon in a feud with her paternal uncle Zeus and, as such, helped him engulf lands and islands in water. Zeus, enraged by this, caused her to be chained to the sea-bed and transformed into a grotesque monster with fish&apos;s limbs and an unquenchable thirst for seawater.  </div>
