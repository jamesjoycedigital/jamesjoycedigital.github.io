<div class="nbunit" id="31May1920"><font color="red">31 May 1920</font>, <cite>Selected Letters</cite> (JJ to Ezra Pound): I am in need of a long holiday (by this I don&apos;t mean abandonment of <cite>Ulysses</cite> but quiet in which to finish it) away from here &hellip; I &hellip; have had great difficultyu in securing time and peace enough to write those two chapters &hellip; I spend the greater part of my time sprawled across two beds surrounded by mountains of notes &hellip;[I] buy the <cite>Daily Mail</cite> &hellip; So I propose to spend three months in Ireland in order to write <cite>Circe</cite> and the close of the book. I should return here with my family in October (if anyone finds a flat for us in the meantime) or, if not, without them in order to write the end of it &hellip; I hope you received safely the <cite>Oxen of the Sun</cite> and have sent it off to London and New York. I was bringing down another copy this morning. </div>
