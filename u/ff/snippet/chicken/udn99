<div class="nbunit" id="udn99"> Traditionally, the lotos was a kind of clover (or shamrock) on which horses fed. The Cyrenean lotus was really a shrub, the fruit of which was eaten by some natives. B&eacute;rard (whose work Joyce read preparatory to writing <cite>Ulysses</cite>) holds that lotos derives from the Semitic word lot, meaning perfume or incense, and he identifies the plant as an edible species of water-lily that grows along the Libyan coast.  </div>
