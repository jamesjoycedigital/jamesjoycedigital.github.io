<div class="nbunit" id="18May1918"><font color="red">18 May 1918</font>, <cite>Letters I</cite> (JJ to Harriet Weaver): Will you please write to him [Huebsch] and say I could not, for many reasons, undertake to deliver the entire typescript of <cite>Ulysses</cite> during the coming autumn, If the <cite>Little Review</cite> continues to publish it regularly he may publish as a cheap paperbound book the <cite>Telemachia</cite>, that is the first three episodes &mdash; under the title, <cite>Ulysses I</cite> &hellip; The second part, the <cite>Odyssey</cite>, contains eleven episodes. The third part, <cite>Nostos</cite>, contains three episodes. In all seventeen episodes of which, including that which is now being typed and will be sent in a day or two, <cite>Hades</cite>, I have delivered six. It is impossible to say how much of the book is really written. Several other episodes have been drafted for the second time but that means nothing because although the third episode of the <cite>Telemachia</cite> has been a long time in the second draft I spent about 200 hours over it before I wrote it out finally. I fear I have little imagination &hellip; if all goes well the book should be finished by the summer of 1919. If it be set up before it could then be published at once. It is not quite clear from Mr Pound&apos;s last letter whether he is transmitting my typescript to New York or not. However I am sending the next episode also through him.</div>
