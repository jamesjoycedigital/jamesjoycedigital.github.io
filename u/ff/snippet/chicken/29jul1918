I am sorry that the other episodes of <cite>Ulysses</cite> have been delayed. A few days [ago] I sent the sixth episode &lsquo;Hades&rsquo; to Mr Pound with a copy for you and very soon I shall send the seventh &lsquo;Eolus&rsquo;. I received also <cite>The Voyage Out</cite> by Mrs Woolf and shall now begin to read it &hellip; the fourth episode of <cite>Ulysses</cite> as published in the June issue of the <cite>Little Review</cite> is not my full text &hellip; received this evening Mr Lewis&apos;s novel <cite>Tarr</cite></div>
