<div class="nbunit" id="udn76"> Aiaia is the &ldquo;(island of the) sea-hawk&rdquo;. It is said of Kirke that she poisoned her husband, the king of the Scythians, and was exiled by the citizens to Italy, where, cast out, she dwelt in a promontory called the Cape of Kirke. While there, she magically changed Skylla into a sea monster and Picus, king of the Latin people, into a woodpecker. Berard identifies Kirke with the Roman goddess Feronia, the &ldquo;freer of slaves&rdquo; and her cave with a grotto at an isthmus close to the Pontine swamp. When slaves were freed at her temple, they were ritually shaved (thus Odysseus&apos; men, turned into slaves [pigs)] by Kirke, on being liberated from their suine shape stand erect and &ldquo;lose their bristles&rdquo;).  </div>
