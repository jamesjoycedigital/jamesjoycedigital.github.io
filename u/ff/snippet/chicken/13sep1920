<div class="nbunit" id="13Sep1920"><font color="red">13 September 1920</font>, <cite>Letters III</cite> (JJ to John Rodker): I have not received that copy of <cite>The Oxen of the Sun</cite> but perhaps you have read part of the <cite>Nausikaa</cite> episode. The best plan is to ask Miss Weaver to let you see these two episodes so that you may judge of their length.</div>
