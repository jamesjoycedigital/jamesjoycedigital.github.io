<div class="nbunit" id="18Dec1917"><font color="red">18 (not 19) December 1917</font>, <cite>Letters II</cite> (Ezra Pound to JJ): Pages 1-17, in duplicate rec&apos;d. Since you will get yourself reviewed in modern Greek and thereby suggest new spellings of the name Daedalus &hellip; There was a passage on page three that made me question it for a moment, but I cant, on rereading find anything wrong &hellip; I wonder about the adjective  &lsquo;merry&rsquo; in &rsquo;merry over the sea&rsquo; page 8. And the movement of the sentence  &lsquo;another now yet the same&rsquo;. Also  &lsquo;fro&rsquo; and &lsquo;glow&rsquo; in paragraph 4 of that page, look like an accidental rhyme &hellip; Your 17 pages have no division marks. Unless this is the first month&apos;s lot, instead of the first three months, as you wrote it would be, I shall divide on page 6, after the statement that the Sassenach wants his bacon, and at the very top of page 12. Hope to forward a few base sheckles in a few days time. Wall, Mr Joice, I recon your a damn fine writer, that&apos;s what I recon&apos;. An&apos; I recon&apos; this here work o&apos; yourn is some concarn&apos;d litterchure. You can take it from me, an&apos; I&apos;m a jedge.</div>
