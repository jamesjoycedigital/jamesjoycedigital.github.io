<div class="nbunit" id="27Jan1936"><font color="red">27 January 1936</font> <i>NLMS</i> (from Paul L&eacute;on to Messrs Monro Saw): As it is the Director of Public Prosecutions has published his lecture on Obscene Literature in Law and Practice which is a simple revival of the Regina v/Hickling doctrine of 1868. I have made a rather harsh review of it and hope to have it published in the next Law Quarterly or the POLITICA (the organ of the London University where the lecture was delivered). But as this will hardly carry any weight I am trying to have a question put in the H.o.C. arguing that a civil servant cannot publish his views on a question de lege ferenda. But this is much harder and the ground much less secure, than an academic review. &hellip; Please keep this information confidential as though both editors are personal friends of mine I doubt very much whether they will have the courage to publish the review. </div>
