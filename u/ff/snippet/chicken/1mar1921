<div class="nbunit" id="1Mar1921"><font color="red">1 March 1921</font>, <cite>BLHW</cite> (JJ to Harriet Weaver): A fortnight ago when nearly 100 pages of <cite>Circe</cite> (about half) were typed the father of my typist had a seizure in the street (a Circean episode as it happens) and consequently the work came to an end. Now a fair copy is made from my MS and and then passed on to another typist who will finish the episode slowly. I sent the first half of <cite>Eumeus</cite> to still another typist and I am told it is almost finished. I am writing out the fair copy of the end of it and shall send it on in a few days. // I am now working on <cite>Ithaca</cite>. This episode and <cite>Penelope</cite> will take all my time till May. As I needed for both of them my notes left in Trieste I have been writing express registered letters to my relatives there and certain friends without success till yesterday when I got a letter saying that a person who is coming to Paris shortly will bring them</div>
