<div class="nbunit" id="25Nov1921"><font color="red">25 November 1921</font>, <cite>BLHW</cite> (JJ to Harriet Weaver): I had an interview yesterday with the printer. From what I can gather a crisis seems to have been reached as a result of which I need &pound;75 to pay him a draft falling due on the 30 November and to keep myself alive till the first week in December &hellip; Anyhow for the last two or three weeks the printer has shelved my book in favour of McAlmon&apos;s (who, I take it, paid promptly and in advance). This latter is now out but for the past week not a single word has been set, the printers confining themselves to executing my corrections &hellip; The printer told me that I have made such alterations in <cite>Ulysses</cite> as reduce my estimated gain (on total sale) by about &pound;600 &mdash; and this after 7&frac12; years labour. I cannot help it. I must give as much as I can. He says the book will weigh about 4 lbs. I suggest it be sold by the ounce. Typing has been a heavy item for me personally as I had certain parts done over three or four times to facilitate the printer in setting. Also I am afraid I must have the proofs of <cite>Ithaca</cite> (the ugly duckling of the book and therefore, I suppose, my favourite) read by a competent person &mdash; which will be another expense &hellip; I made out a rough chart of the book for Mr Larbaud in order to help him to confuse the audience a little more &hellip; I hope when all is over you will give me a position as gardener though I shall spend as much time as possible sitting on the wheelbarrow.</div>
