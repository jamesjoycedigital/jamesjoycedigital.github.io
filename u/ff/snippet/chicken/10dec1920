<div class="nbunit" id="10Dec1920"><font color="red">10 December 1920</font>, <cite>Selected Letters</cite> (JJ to Frank Budgen): Thanks for the papers.  Now I want you to do another favour for me and in a great hurry. The whirligig movement in <cite>Circe</cite> is on the refrain <cite>My Girl&apos;s a Yorkshire</cite> etc, but to unify the action the preceding <i>pas seul</i> of S.D. which I intended to balance on the gramophone of the opposite kip should be on the air of that same ditty played on Mrs Cohen&apos;s pianola with lights. I enclose 10 francs. Will you be so kind as to apply to any vendor (a big one) of musichall airs. It was popular between 1904 and 1908. I want words and music. I have a piano here and telephone (Saxe 34-33). I hope to finish <cite>Circe</cite> before Christmas &hellip; My mood grows bitterer on account of Trieste and other things. At first I had not thought of the slaughter of the suitors as in Ulysses&apos; character. Now I see it can be there too. I am going to leave the last word with Molly Bloom &mdash; the final episode <cite>Penelope</cite> being written through her thoughts and body Poldy being then asleep. <cite>Eumeus</cite> you know so there remains only to think out <cite>Ithaca</cite> in the way I suggest &hellip; I have &hellip; been botching and patching that bloody old Circe since last June. The <cite>Nauiskaa</cite> case comes on next Monday &hellip; A point about Ulysses (Bloom). He romances about Ithaca (Oi want teh gow beck teh the Mawl Enn Rowd, s&apos;elp me!) and when he gets back it gives him the pip.</div>
