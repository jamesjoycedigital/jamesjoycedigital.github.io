<div class="nbunit" id="udn33"> Joyce wrote to Georges Borach on 18 June,1919, that he had finished the &ldquo;big job&rdquo; of writing Sirens during the last few days. &ldquo;I wrote this chapter with the technical resources of music. It is a fugue with all musical notations: piano, forte, rallentando, and so on. A quintet occurs in it, too, as in Die Meistersinger, my favourite Wagnerian opera ? Since exploring the resources and artifices of music and employing them in this chapter, I haven&apos;t cared for music any more. I, the great friend of music, can no longer listen to it. I see through all the tricks and can&apos;t enjoy it any more.&rdquo;  </p><p> On reading the typescript of the episode, Ezra Pound was horrified. Joyce, he felt, had finally lost the plot: &ldquo;obsessions arseore-ial, cloacal, deist, aesthetic as opposed to arsethetic, any obsession or tic shd be very carefully considered before being turned loose&rdquo; (<cite>Pound/Joyce</cite> p. 157, letter of 10 June 1919).  </p><p> Joyce, whose vaunted musicological knowledge was technically amateurish, confuses <i>fuga per canonem</i> (to order) with fugue (a movement in canonic form) and he is incorrect in his belief that there is anything resembling a strict &ldquo;eight part&rdquo; construction to it. The episode, moreover, only very loosely and impressionistically breaks into a &ldquo;musical&rdquo; form. As he had his friend Stuart Gilbert explain for him, the episode is intended to correspond to a fugue with soggetto or subject (female sexual seduction, the allure of the sirens: lively Miss Douce and sad Miss Kennedy), answer (dejected Mr Bloom), counter-subject (the seducing male, Blazes Boylan), and diversions or divertimenti (the sentimental songs sung in the bar), the whole ending in a stretto in which all the voices take part.  </p><p> More restrictedly, the fugal aspect is more particularly to be found at the micro-level of the sentence, there being throughout the episode a style of conflation of various almost-parallel sentences from different narrative points of view ? e.g., he heard, she heard, they heard, being rolled palimpsest-like into the more succinct: he she they heard.  </div>
