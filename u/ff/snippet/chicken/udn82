<div class="nbunit" id="udn82"> The Phaeacians took no part in the Trojan war. Many of their characteristics, their seafaring life and generosity, are suggestive of Minoan Crete. The walls of the palace there that &ldquo;shone like the sun&rdquo; are covered perhaps not with bronze but with orichalcum. The location of the land of the Phaeacians is uncertain, though Corfu (anciently, Corcyra) has been suggested. It cannot have been close to Ithaca, as its people call Odysseus a stranger and it takes some time to reach Ithaca from Scheria, even on a magical ship a gyr-falcon could not out-speed: a ship steered by thought alone.  </div>
