<div class="nbunit" id="11Aug1917"><font color="red">11 August 1917</font>, <cite>BLHW</cite> (JJ to Harriet Weaver): If you are short of copies [of <cite>A Portrait</cite>] perhaps the printer could do you a hundred for next month before I correct the proofs. I suppose there are not many mistakes, my corrections could then be used for the rest of the edition. It would be pity to lose orders.</div>
