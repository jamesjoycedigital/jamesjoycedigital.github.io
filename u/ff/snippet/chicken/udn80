<div class="nbunit" id="udn80"> In Greek mythology, Lampetia (&ldquo;shining&rdquo;) was the daughter of Helios and Neaera. She was the personification of light. With Phaethusa she was taken by Neaera to safeguard the cattle and sheep of Thrinakria, the &ldquo;Isle of the Trident&rdquo;. With a silver crock Lampetia shepherded the sheep; with a copper staff, Phaethusa the cattle.  </p><p> These daughters of Neaira, known as the Neairides (or &ldquo;new risings&rdquo;), seem to represent the measure of days and nights in the year. The word phaeth&ocirc; (&ldquo;shining&rdquo;) was usually associated with the sun while lampeta&ocirc; (&ldquo;to shine like a lamp&rdquo;) was associated with the moon. Each sister tended a total of seven herds of fifty: one for each of the seven days of the week. The total number (350) is fifteen days short of 365; however, the ancient Greeks customarily divided the year into twelve lunar months, and added a thirteenth month every few years to correct the imperfection. The herds were divided into fifty animals, representing the number of lunar months in a Great Year, a four-year cycle in which solar and lunar calendars were believed to coincide.  </div>
