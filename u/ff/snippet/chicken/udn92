<div class="nbunit" id="udn92"> That is, Joachim of Fiore [Gloacchino da Fiore] (c. 1135 ? 30 March 1202), a mystic and theologian from Calabria in Italy. Joachim visited the Holy Land and some event there precipitated his conversion to monasticism. On his return to Italy he lived as a hermit for many years. Subsequently he joined the Cistercian abbey as a lay brother, and was ordained in 1168. He was intellectually most concerned with escatology and studied the arcane messages buried in the Bible, in particular in John&apos;s Revelation. He was highly regarded as a holy man and founded the Order of San Giovanni in Flore in the mountains of Calabria.  </p><p> His three great works outlining his theological views were hugely influential and he advocated three great ages or epochs of history, to culminate in the impending Age of the Holy Spirit, in which all things would appear lucidly to mankind, the church would no longer be necessary as a guide, and an era of peace would ensue. At the Synod of Arles, his theories (but not the man himself) were declared heretical. Even so, he is venerated as a beatus, on May 29.  </p><p> Thomas Aquinas confuted Joachim in his <cite>Summa Theologica</cite>.  </p><p> What Stephen was reading, however, was not the mystical work of Joachim, but that of imitators, who put out books of prophecies under his name.  </div>
