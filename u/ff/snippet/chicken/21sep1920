<div class="nbunit" id="21Sep1920"><font color="red">21 September 1920</font>, <cite>Letters I</cite> (JJ to Carlo Linati): it would be better to send you a sort of summary &mdash; key &mdash; skeleton &mdash; scheme (for your personal use only). Perhaps my idea will appear clearer to you when you have the text. I have given only catchwords in my scheme but I think you will understand it all the same. It is an epic of two races (Israelite &mdash; Irish) and at the same time the cycle of the human body a well as a little story [storiella] of a day (life).</div>
