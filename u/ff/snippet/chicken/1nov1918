<div class="nbunit" id="1Nov1918"><font color="red">1 November 1918</font>, <cite>Yale</cite> (JJ to Ezra Pound): I hope you are not ill &hellip; as it is a long time since I heard from you &hellip; The above is my new address &hellip; I sent you lately the 8th episode (Lestrygonians) and before that the 7th (Eolus) but have had no acknowledgment of receipt &hellip; I hope to be able to send you the ninth episode (Scylla and Charybdis) shortly &hellip; I should be pleased to receive from you copies of the <cite>Little Review</cite> for August, September and October. I hope the chapters have appeared intact &hellip; I should like to put the play [<cite>Exiles</cite>] in the hands of some active agent. A Mr Marion L. Bloom wrote to me a long time ago but my illness made me forget his proposal. The name is rather curious, is it not? But so many of these strange coincidences happen. But whether he would like to take on the representation for <cite>Ulysses</cite> is, I suppose, doubtful. </div>
