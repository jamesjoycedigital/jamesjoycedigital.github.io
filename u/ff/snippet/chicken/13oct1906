<div class="nbunit" id="13Oct1906"><font color="red">13 October 1906</font>, <cite>Letters II</cite> 179 (JJ to Grant Richards): Via Frattina 52, II&deg;, Rome. <br>Finally, one word as to my novel I am not in a fit state of mind to complete it. For two years I have been living in hope and now that I see that these two years of waiting and hoping have availed me nothing it is really too much to expect that I should put my two completed books on one side and continue to write the third: and then to wait and hope again. For I am sure we should have the same objections and the same letters. It is true that I stand in need of a publisher, but the publisher I need must at least be prepared to risk something for what he esteems highly and in the meantime I am glad that my position, modest though it be, enables me to save my work from mutilation and my talent from corruption.</div>
