<div class="nbunit" id="19Nov1904"><font color="red">19 November 1904</font>, <cite>Letters II</cite> 71 (JJ to Stanislaus Joyce): Via Giulia 2, Pola, Austria. <br>I have not written much of my novel&mdash;only the end of the 11th [12th] chapter in Z&uuml;ric. I have written about half of &lsquo;Xmas Eve&rsquo; and  about five long pages of &lsquo;Esthetic Philosophy&rsquo;. [&hellip;] I am afraid I cannot finish my novel for a long time. I am discontented with a great deal of it and yet how is StephenÂ’s nature to be expressed otherwise. Eh? </div>
