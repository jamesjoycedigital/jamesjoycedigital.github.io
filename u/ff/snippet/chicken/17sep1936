<div class="nbunit" id="17Sep1936"><font color="red">17 September 1936</font> <i>NLMS</i> (from Paul L&eacute;on to Messrs Monro Saw): A slight difficulty has arisen with Lane in course of the reading of the proofs which have all been corrected from here as regards the documents to be inserted in the Appendices. I mean that they forwarded them to me very late and I needed three days for the rearrangement and the additional matter of these Appendices. I think that they are quite good from a legal point of view. </div>
