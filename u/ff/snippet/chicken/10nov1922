<div class="nbunit" id="10Nov1922"><font color="red">10 November 1922</font>, <cite>Selected Letters</cite> (JJ to Aunt Josephine): I told you to read the <cite>Odyssey</cite> first. As you have not done so I asked my publisher to send you an article which will throw a little light on it. Then buy at once the <cite>Adventures of Ulysses</cite> (which is Homer&apos;s story told in simple English much abbreviated) by Charles Lamb. You can read it in a night and can buy it at Gill&apos;s or Browne and Nolan&apos;s for a couple of shillings. Then have a try at <cite>Ulysses</cite> again &hellip; Send me any news you like, programmes, pawntickets, press cuttings, handbills. I like reading them.</div>
