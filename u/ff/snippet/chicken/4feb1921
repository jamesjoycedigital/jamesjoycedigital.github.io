<div class="nbunit" id="4Feb1921"><font color="red">4 February 1921</font>, <cite>Letters I</cite> (JJ to Harriet Weaver): I ought to have acknowledged before with thanks Mr [Allen] Upward&apos;s book [<cite>The Divine Mystery</cite>, 1913], the first part of which seems to me like a running marginal comment on <cite>Circe</cite> &hellip; I finished that episode some weeks ago and sent it to be typed &hellip; [trouble with typists] &hellip; will not be ready for some weeks more &hellip; On Monday I hope to deliver to another typist the first part of the <cite>Eumeus</cite> episode and the rest in a week or a fortnight. This will  leave me the time I need for composing the two final and shorter episodes &hellip; I hope the projected (U.S.) edition of <cite>Ulysses</cite> will come out in June</div>
