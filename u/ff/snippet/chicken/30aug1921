<div class="nbunit" id="30Aug1921"><font color="red">30 August 1921</font>, <cite>Letters I</cite> (JJ to Harriet Weaver): I have been obliged to reduce my working from about sixteen hours daily to about six in consequence of an attack I got, some kind of syncope &hellip; looking &hellip; to see if there is any place where I could throw Bloom with a 56lb weight tied to his feet. I have made a great deal of additions to the proof so far (up to the end of <cite>Scylla and Carybdis</cite>). Perhaps you would like to see them. If so I shall send them on. I have also added a messianic scene to <cite>Circe</cite> but the printer has not reached that yet.</div>
