<div class="nbunit" id="28Feb1921"><font color="red">28 February 1921</font>, <cite>Selected Letters</cite> (JJ to Frank Budgen): <cite>Circe</cite> is finished long ago, also <cite>Eumeus</cite> and I am writing <cite>Ithaca</cite>. I have dreadful worries about a typist. Four declined to do <cite>Circe</cite>, at last one admirer(ess) volunteered. She started but when she had done 100 pp her father got a seizure in the street (a Circean episode) and now my MS is written out in a fair hand by someone who passes it to someone else who sends it to be typed.</div>
