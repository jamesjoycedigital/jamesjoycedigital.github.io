<div class="nbunit" id="20Jul1919"><font color="red">20 July 1919</font>, <cite>Selected Letters</cite> (JJ to Harriet Weaver): &hellip; you write me that the last episode sent [<cite>Sirens</cite>] seems to you to show a weakening or diffusion of some sort. Since the receipt of your letter I have read this chapter again several times. It took me five months to write it and always when I have finished an episode my mind lapses into a state of blank apathy &hellip; Mr Pound wrote to me in hasty disapproval &hellip; Mr Brock also &hellip; If the <cite>Sirens</cite> have been found so unsatisfactory I have little hope that the <cite>Cyclops</cite> or later the <cite>Circe</cite> episode will be approved of: and, moreover, it is impossible for me to write these episodes quickly. The elements needed will fuse only after a prolonged existence together &hellip; the progress of the book is in fact like the progress of some sandblast &hellip; I shall feel very thankful to you if you will accept from me the MS of [<cite>A Portrait</cite>]. It is in Trieste and, as soon as circumstances are more favourable, I shall get it and forward it to you.</div>
