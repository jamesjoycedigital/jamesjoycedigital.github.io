<div class="nbunit" id="30May1919"><font color="red">30 May 1919</font>, <cite>Pound/Joyce</cite> (Ezra Pound to JJ): In face of <i>mss</i> just arrived, I think however I may adjoin personal op. that you have once again gone &lsquo;down where the asparagus grows&rsquo; and gone down as far as the lector most bloody benevolens can be expected to respire. I dont arsk you to erase &mdash; But express opinion that a few sign posts. perhaps twenty words coherent in bunches of 3 to 5 <i>wd.</i> not only clarify but even improve 1st. page &hellip; I am sending <i>mss</i> today to Egoist and L.R. and if you have any relentings, please communic. direct to said offices &hellip; Also even the assing girouette of a postfuturo Gertrudo Steino protopublic dont demand a new style per chapter</div>
