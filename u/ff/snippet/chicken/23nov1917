<div class="nbunit" id="23Nov1917"><font color="red">re ca. 23 November 1917</font> (Attributed to Claud Sykes; 1931): In November 1917, Joyce asked me to type the opening chapters of Ulysses, which Miss Weaver had arranged to publish in serial form. I tackled the M.S. as he sent it to me and remember that I found his handwriting very difficult to read; I fear I made many mistakes, which he subsequently corrected with much patience. I continued this work till the spring of 1918, though I cannot remember how much I did altogether </div>
