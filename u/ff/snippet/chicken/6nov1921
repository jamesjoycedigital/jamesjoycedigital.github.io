<div class="nbunit" id="6Nov1921"><font color="red">6 November 1921</font>, <cite>Letters I</cite> (JJ to Harriet Weaver): Since the completion of <cite>Ulysses</cite> I feel more and more tired but I have to hold on till the proofs are revised. I am extremely irritated by all those printer&apos;s errors. Working as I do amid piles of notes at a table in an hotel I cannot possibly do this mechanical part with my wretched eye  and a half. Are these to be perpetuated in future editions? I hope not. I am glad the first proofs I sent didn&apos;t go astray &hellip; I sent you a new batch yesterday. Will you please read them as quickly as you can and send them back as I sometimes need them to refer to. </div>
