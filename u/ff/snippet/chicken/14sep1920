<div class="nbunit" id="14Sep1920"><font color="red">14 September 1920</font>, <cite>Letters III</cite> (JJ to Stanislaus Joyce): Have written <cite>Circe</cite> about five times &hellip; The M.S. I sent Quinn from Triest on 10 June never reached him (by his letter of 17 August) while that sent from Paris 6 weeks later did &hellip; He sent 3500 francs on the first batch and will send more if the other parcel arrives. I suppose I have to write it out all over again! Curse them again! He will give 20,000 Lire for the entire MS of <cite>Ulysses</cite> but wants the end of it and the corrected proofs</div>
