<div class="nbunit" id="7Feb1905"><font color="red">7 February 1905</font>, <cite>Selected Letters</cite> 52-4 (JJ to Stanislaus Joyce): 7 Via Medolino, 1&deg;. Pola, Austria. <br>Your criticism of my novel is always interesting. The sentence &lsquo;to sustain in person &amp;c&rsquo; is not legitimate if the phrase, &lsquo;and to protect thereby&rsquo; is between commas but is legitimate if the phrase is in brackets {neither phrase is in the surviving manuscript of <cite>Stephen Hero</cite>]. I shall change the verb however. Mrs Riordan who has left the house in Bray returns you have forgotten, to the Xmas dinner-table in Dublin. The immateriality of Isabel is intended. The effect of the prose piece [partly at begining of extant manuscript: Chapter XIV]  &lsquo;The spell of arms&rsquo; is to mark the precise point between boyhood (pueritia) and adolescence (adulescentia)&mdash;17 years. Is it possible you remark no change? Again, no old toothless Irishman would say &lsquo;Divil an elephant&rsquo;: he would say &lsquo;divil elephant&rsquo; [page 488 of extant manuscript]. Nora says &lsquo;Divil up Ill get till you come back&rsquo;. Naif sequence! Your criticism of two aposopeias [aposiopesis: a figure in which the speaker suddenly halts in his utterance] is quite just but I think full dress is not always necessary. Stephens change of mind is not effected by that sight as you seem to think, but it is that small event so regarded which expresses the change. His first skin falls. Fulham [page 479 of extant manuscript] is not old Sheehy&mdash;he comes in later. [&hellip;] I intend to dedicate &lsquo;Dubliners&rsquo; to you&mdash;do you mind?&mdash;because you seem to find the stories to your taste. [&hellip;] I am &lsquo;working in&rsquo; Hairy Jaysus [Skeffington: &lsquo;McCann&rsquo; in Chapter XVI] at present. Do you think the search for heroics damn vulgar&mdash;and yet how are we to describe Ibsen? I have written some fine critical sentences lately [in Chapters XV and XVI]. [&hellip;] I have finished Chap XV and Chap XVI and am now at Chap XVII. [&hellip;] I am sure however that the whole structure of heroism is, and always was, a damned lie and that there cannot be any substitute for of all I the individual passion as the motive power of everything&mdash;art anf =d philosophy included. For this reason Hairy Jaysusseems to be the bloodiest imposter of all I have met.</div>
