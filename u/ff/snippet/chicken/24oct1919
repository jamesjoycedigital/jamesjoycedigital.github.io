<div class="nbunit" id="24Oct1919"><font color="red">24 October 1919</font>, <cite>Yale</cite> (JJ to Ezra Pound): Thanks for your amusing and encouraging letter. I left Zurich with my family on the 14 as I was afraid to face the long damp winter there. The removal expenses were enormous and conditions here are very difficult. On the 12 I cabled to Mr Quinn to remit me by cable a maximum advance on the MS of <cite>Ulysses</cite> which he had offered to do some months ago. I expected to find the remittance here on my arrival but have now been here ten days and have received neither money nor message &hellip; Possibly he did so and the order has been rejected &hellip; may I ask you to cable him at once to remit it to you and you can send it on to me &hellip; by cheque in a registered express letter. I shall be able to live from the 1 January on when the first interest of the &pound;5000 comes in but this move here has cost me about 3000 francs. I am aware that it is foolish of me to dispose of the MS in this way as I shall receive only a fraction of its eventual value &mdash; or so I think &mdash; but I must get a large sum of money within the next week or ten days at latest &hellip; [dreadful conditions] I shall be obliged, to my infinite disgust, to resume teaching in order to supplement my income &hellip; If [Quinn&apos;s] silence be due to a wish to revoke his proposal I want to know it at once so that I may dispose of the MS elsewhere. When this trouble is over I hope to be allowed time and leisure to set to work on <cite>Nausikaa</cite> (the next episode).</div>
