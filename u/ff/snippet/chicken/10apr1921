<div class="nbunit" id="10Apr1921"><font color="red">10 April 1921</font>, <cite>Letters I</cite> (JJ to Harriet Weaver): On Saturday night I received a packet from Mrs Harrison containing the rest of the MS of <cite>Circe</cite> &hellip; Only some pages which she had left on her table have been destroyed. I shall have to go over the notes of the scene again and recreate it which is not so easy as since writing it I wrote the end and all the <cite>Eumeus</cite> episode and a good part of <cite>Ithaca</cite> &hellip; On receipt of Mr Huebsch&apos;s letter forwarded by you I cabled Mr Quinn to withdraw the entire typescript of <cite>Ulysses</cite> from Mr Huebsch and all other American publishers and return it to me immediately. Not that I need it but in order to break off relations definitely. Mr Huebsch will not pirate an edition of <cite>Ulysses</cite> (as he kindly suggested) in the United States but not because of consideration for the writer. The next day I arranged for a Paris publication to replace the American one &mdash; or rather I accepted a proposal made to me by <i>Shakespeare</i> and Co., a bookseller&apos;s here &hellip; The proposal is to publish here in October an edition (complete) of the book &hellip; Today I delivered the first sheets to the printer and am to receive trial proofs on Saturday together with his estimate. The actual printing will begin as soon as the number of orders covers approximately the cost of printing which they estimate at 20,000 to 25,000 francs &hellip; about 150 copies &hellip; The form of the book is to be <i>carr&eacute;</i>, the type which they call here no 9 and it will make about 600 pages if that &hellip; in the months between now and September I can write with comfort the two last episodes &hellip; I shall send you the two episodes [Circe and Eumeus] in a day or so when the end of Circe is typed.</div>
