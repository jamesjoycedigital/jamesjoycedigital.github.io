<div class="nbunit" id="udn30"> Farrell is based on &ldquo;Endymion&rdquo; Farrell, a well-known Dublin eccentric who walked about the city bearing two swords, a fishing rod and an umbrella. He sported a red rose in his buttonhole and, for added ventilation, had his tight bowler hat perforated with several large holes. He came from a brewer's family in Dundalk and is reputed to have fallen into a vat in the brewery, an experience from which, evidently, he never recovered.  </div>
