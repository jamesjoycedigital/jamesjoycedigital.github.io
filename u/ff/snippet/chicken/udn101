<div class="nbunit" id="udn101"> Bloom thinks: &ldquo;Now who is that lankylooking galoot over there in the macintosh? Now who is he I&apos;d like to know? Now, I&apos;d give a trifle to know who he is. Always someone turns up you never dreamt of.&rdquo; The interloper&apos;s presence seems significant: &ldquo;Mr Bloom stood far back, his hat in his hand, counting the bared heads. Twelve. I&apos;m thirteen. No. The chap in the macintosh is thirteen. Death&apos;s number. Where the deuce did he pop out of? He wasn&apos;t in the chapel, that I&apos;ll swear. Silly superstition that about thirteen.&rdquo; </p><p> He reappears in Wandering Rocks: &ldquo;In Lower Mount street a pedestrian in a brown macintosh, eating dry bread, passed swiftly and unscathed across the viceroy&apos;s path.&rdquo; And later in Circe: &ldquo;A man in a brown macintosh springs up through a trapdoor.&rdquo; </p><p> The mysterious macintosh man is mentioned eleven times in all in the novel, yet with almost no detail. In Cyclops we learn that the &ldquo;man in the brown macintosh loves a lady who is dead,&rdquo; and in Ithaca the question is posed: &ldquo;What selfinvolved enigma did Bloom risen, going, gathering multicoloured multiform multitudinous garments, voluntarily apprehending, not comprehend? Who was M&apos;Intosh?&rdquo; </p><p> While Mr Duffy seems the best contender,  in his Cornell University lectures on <cite>Ulysses</cite>, Vladimir Nabokov suggested (unlikely as it is) that the &ldquo;chap in the macintosh&rdquo; is none other than James Joyce himself. In Scylla and Charybdis Stephen Dedalus explains that Shakespeare &ldquo;has hidden his own name, a fair name, William, in the plays, a super here, a clown there, as a painter of old Italy set his face in a dark corner of his canvas.&rdquo; This, Nabokov holds, &ldquo;is exactly what Joyce has done ? setting his face in a dark corner of his canvas. The Man in the Brown Macintosh who passes through the dream of the book is no other than the author himself. Bloom glimpses his maker!&rdquo;  </div>
