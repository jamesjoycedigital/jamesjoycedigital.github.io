<div class="nbunit" id="29Dec1934"><font color="red">29 December 1934</font> <i>NLPK</i> (from Paul L&eacute;on to J. Ralph Pinker): I have not heard from Mr Joyce about the edition of ULYSSES to be followed. As he has not read either of them I think and take it upon myself to advise the American one though it would be necessary to verify it according to the Albatross. As I know Mr Gilbert made some hundreds of corrections for the latter and I do not know if Mr Cerf followed this text. </div>
