<div class="nbunit" id="3Apr1921"><font color="red">3 April 1921</font>, <cite>BLHW</cite> (JJ to Harriet Weaver): (partly I) Four copies of <cite>Circe</cite> and <cite>Eumeus</cite> have been delivered to me at last. Unfortunately there are only 122 pages of the former as the present typist &hellip; can work only an hour or so at night. They (the copies) are so irritating that I wish I knew where to throw them. It is risky to send them to Mr Pound &hellip; and Mr Rodker or the <cite>Little Review</cite> or Mr Quinn or Mr Huebsch may not want them either. The <cite>Circe</cite> episode, typed by several different typists using different machines and all colours and kinds of paper is a horrible thing to look at &mdash; much less to read &hellip; I received safely about a fortnight ago the bag full of notes for <cite>Ulysses</cite> &hellip; <cite>Ithaca</cite> and <cite>Penelope</cite> are progressing as well as the worries here set forth permit</div>
