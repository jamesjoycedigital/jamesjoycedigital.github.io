<div class="nbunit" id="udn108"> The Sirens were not, as is half-suggested by Joyce in this episode, types of mermaids, with the upper body of a sensual woman and the lower body of a fish. They were classically imagined as half-women and half-birds of prey. One of the duo, Parthenope, is said to have drowned herself because she could not shipwreck Odysseus through the sweetness of her voice. Appropriately, the city of Naples is dedicated to her. Odysseus, being bound, has no choice but to spurn their charms. So also is Bloom, bound by his passivity and the vicarious nature of his desires. He is stuck in the bar, twiddling his thumbs, while saucy Boylan jingles his way to the front door of the house in Eccles Street to seduce his wife.  </div>
