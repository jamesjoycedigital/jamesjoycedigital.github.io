<div class="nbunit" id="10Oct1905"><font color="red">10 October 1905</font>, <cite>Letters II</cite> 114-20 (Stanislaus Joyce to JJ): 7 Whitworth Place, Drumcondra, Dublin. <br>I'm afraid you're becoming irascible, but here's some answers to your questions: <br>A priesr is buried in a habit if he belongs to an order which wears a habit. Otherwise so far as I can find out he is buried in his vestments: I cannot find out for certain if there is any canonical law on the point. Fr O'Malley, who had his parish taken from him was buried in his vestments. <br>A Municipal Election <i>might</i> take place in October but it is highly improbable. It would be a bye-electioj (for instance if a councillor or alderman died or resigned) and according to the general rule if it occurred so late would be held over till January. Aungier St is in Royal Exchange Ward. <br>The City Ambulance would be called out to Sydney Parade at the time id supposed to have occurred *The Pembrojke Ambulance from Ballsbridge would go now) but in all proability the body would have been sent in on the tram. I know a man who was injured at Raheny Junction was sent in to Jervis St on the tram. <p>It seems to me that your book &lsquo;Dubliners&rsquo; is becoming almost as important as your novel. [Follows with extended commentary on the stories.] [&hellip;] I have read Renan's monogram [sic] on Jesus Christ. [&hellip;] Your postcard received. I have been all day copying out your story to send it back. I thought I told you that as soon as Charlie told me Curran had lent your MS. I dressed and went down to Kettles office. I called four times there and once at Currans house. I got your MS. back next morning at ten. I said to Curran and to Kettle precisely what is in your postcard. Kettle said I was quite right but that your MS. would be safe in his hands. Curran said he was very sorry but I think he thought I neednt have made a fuss about it.</p></div>
