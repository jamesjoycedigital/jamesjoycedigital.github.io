<div class="nbunit" id="24Nov1920"><font color="red">24 November 1920</font>, <cite>Letters III</cite> (JJ to John Quinn): The complete notes fill a small valise &hellip; The insertions (chiefly verbal or phrases, rarely passages) must be put in for book publication. Before leaving Trieste I did this sorting for all episodes up to and including <cite>Circe</cite>. The episodes which have the heaviest burden of addenda are <cite>Lotus-eaters</cite>, <cite>Lestrygonians</cite>, <cite>Nausikaa</cite> and <cite>Cyclops</cite>. Therefore I must stipulate that I have three sendings of proofs (preferably a widemargined one must be pulled), namely: (1) a galley-page proof of all the book up to and including <cite>Circe</cite>, (2) A similar proof of the three chapters of the <cite>Nostos</cite>, (3) A complete proof of the book in page form &hellip; I hope to finish the <cite>Circe</cite> episode before Christmas. <cite>Eumeus</cite>, being already drafted, I could send on in January &hellip; write the <cite>Ithaca</cite> and <cite>Penelope</cite> episodes which, however, have been sketched since 1916 and are very short in comparison with the <cite>Circe</cite> episode</div>
