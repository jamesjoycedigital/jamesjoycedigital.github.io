<div class="nbunit" id="udn65"> Nestor&apos;s father was King Neleus of Pylos. His own brothers were slain by Herakles and he was reared in Gerenia, a city in Messinia. In due course he became leader of the Pylians in the Greek coalition against Troy. By the time of the war, he had already lived two generations and was thus already an old man, relatively speaking, and unfit for warfare, but his wisdom helped the Greeks to maintain civilized ways in the midst of that war&apos;s barbarity. His sons Antinoos and Thrasymedes fought nobly there.  </p><p> Nestor&apos;s great age was granted him by Apollo. The god killed the brothers and sisters of Nestor&apos;s mother Chloris (the famed Niobids) and he sought to make redress by granting to Nestor &ldquo;the years not yet lived of the slain&rdquo;.  </p><p> After the sacking of Troy, by his own account, Nestor and Diomedes put to sea together and then joined Menelaos in Lesbos.  Menelaos was subsequently caught up in a storm and, losing the rest of his fleet, was blown to Egypt with only five ships remaining afloat. He did, however, eventually return safely to Sparta after wandering for seven years.  Diomedes returned to Argos, but finding sedition there he fled for Italy.   </div>
