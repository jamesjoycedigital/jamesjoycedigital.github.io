<div class="nbunit" id="udn71"> Herodotus, writing in the fifth century B.C., believed that the lotopagoi or lotophages still existed in his day, in coastal Libya.  As they once did, in San Francisco, for example, and parts of present-day Ballydehob. He writes: &ldquo;A promontory jutting out into the sea from the country of the Gindanes is inhabited by the lotus-eaters, who live entirely on the fruit of the lotus-tree. The lotus fruit is about the size of the lentisk berry and in sweetness resembles the date. The lotus-eaters even succeed in obtaining from it a sort of wine.&rdquo;  </p><p> Polybius, and later Strabo,  locates them differently, in the island of Djerba (anciently, Meninx) off the Tunisian coast.  As for the plant, it was possibly Nymphaea caerulea, N. lotus, or N. stellata. The first-mentioned, the &ldquo;blue lily&rdquo; of the Nile, has psychotropic and soporific properties. Traditionally, the plant was believed to be Ziziphus lotus, a relative of the jujube. There are many other contending plants, such as the opium poppy, each with similar narcotic properties. The Greek word lotos means simply &ldquo;the fruit that brings oblivion to those who eat it&rdquo;.  </div>
