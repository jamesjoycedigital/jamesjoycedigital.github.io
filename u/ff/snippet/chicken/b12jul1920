<div class="nbunit" id="b12Jul1920"><font color="red">re ca. 12 July 1920</font>, <cite>Shakespeare and Co</cite> (Sylvia Beach): Joyce &hellip; had spent his entire savings on the removal to Paris. He must look for pupils &hellip; I wondered when Joyce found time to write. At night, he said, after the lessons were over &hellip; Did he sometimes dictate? &lsquo;Never!&rsquo; he exclaimed. He always wrote by hand. He liked to be held back, would otherwise go too fast. He had to see his work as he shaped it word by word &hellip; It appeared that John Quinn, the brillant Irish-American lawyer in New York, was buying the manuscript of <cite>Ulysses</cite> bit by bit. As soon as Joyce completed an instalment, he made a fair copy and sent it off to Quinn, who, in return, sent Joyce the sum agreed on &mdash; small sums, but they helped. </div>
