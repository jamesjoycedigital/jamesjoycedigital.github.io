They are in the pastry cook's, chattering, crushing little fabrics of pastry, or seated silently at tables by the caf√© door, or descending from carriages with a busy stir of garments soft as the voice of the adulterer. They pass in an air of perfumes: under the perfumes their bodies have a warm humid smell&rsquo;&mdash;</div>
