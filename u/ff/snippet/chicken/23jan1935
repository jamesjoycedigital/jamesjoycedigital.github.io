<div class="nbunit" id="23Jan1935"><font color="red">23 January 1935</font> <i>NLPL</i> (from Paul L&eacute;on to John Lane): Mr Joyce is opposed to any headlines on the top of the page &hellip; As far as the text is concerned I raised this point because I was under the impression that the American edition was set from the Albatross one. This after my inquiries does not seem to be the fact. It is therefore necessary for you to obtain the Albatross edition which has been corrected by Mr Gilbert. I want only to draw your attention to the fact that on page 141 of the first issue there is a mistake in the second title. This should be LINKS WITH BYGONE DAYS (the wi have jumped to the end of the sentence. I believe the reissue has the misprint corrected though I am not sure). </div>
