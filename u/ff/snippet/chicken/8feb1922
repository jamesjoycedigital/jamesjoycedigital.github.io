<div class="nbunit" id="8Feb1922"><font color="red">8 February 1922</font>, <cite>Selected Letters</cite> (JJ to Harriet Weaver): &hellip; an English edition. I hope it will be possible in that event to correct the numerous misprints &hellip; Thanks also for the prompt return of the <cite>Penelope</cite> episode &hellip; It did not arrive too late &hellip; I have rejected the usual interpretation of her as a human apparition &mdash; that aspect being better represented by Calypso, Nausikaa and Circe, to say nothing of the pseudo Homeric figures. In conception and technique I tried to depict the earth which is prehuman and presumably posthuman.</div>
