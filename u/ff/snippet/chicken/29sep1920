<div class="nbunit" id="29Sep1920"><font color="red">29 September 1920</font>, <cite>Selected Letters</cite> (JJ to Frank Budgen): Have met Sargent several times and dined. He is held up here for a week. The stories he tells me of mob manners in London are almost incredible. Have worked some of it into <cite>Circe</cite> &hellip; It gets wilder and worse and more involved but I suppose it will all work out. Thanks for the papers you send which, though very onesided, are most useful. Tomorrow I send you another 10 francs. I see there is or was a paper by Lord Alfred Douglas <cite>Plain English</cite>. Can you lay hold of any copies? In fact anything in that line will be useful. I am sorry you do not think your ideas on <cite>Circe</cite> worth sending. As I told you  a catchword is enough to set me off. <i>Moly</i> is a tough nut to crack. My latest is this. Moly is the gift of Hermes, god of public ways, and is the invisible influence (prayer, chance, agility, <i>presence of mind</i>, power of recuperation) which saves in case of accident. This would cover immunity from syphilis (&sigma;&#973; &phi;&iota;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf; = swine-love?). Hermes is the god of signposts: i,e, he is, specially for a traveller like Ulysses, the points at which roads parallel merge and roads contrary also. He is an accident of providence. In this special case his plant may be said to have many leaves, indifference due to masturbation, pessimism congenital, a sense of the ridiculous, sudden fastidiousness in some detail, experience. It is the only occasion in which Ulysses is not helped by Minerva but by her male counterpart and inferior. Curious that Sargent should be an authority on animals. His character, also, it seems to me, may have been like his namesake in the Nestor episode &hellip; Are you strong on costume? I want to make <cite>Circe</cite> a costume episode also. Bloom for instance appears in five or six different suits. What a book! &hellip; Hell, I must get <cite>Circe</cite> finished and <cite>Eumeus</cite> under way before I move anywhere.</div>
