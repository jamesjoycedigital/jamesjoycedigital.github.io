<div class="nbunit" id="3Sep1921"><font color="red">3 September 1921</font>, <cite>Letters III</cite> (JJ to Robert McAlmon): I sent on that lot of <cite>Penelope</cite> to Budgen but he hasn&apos;t written yet about it. If you see him please ask him to send it back. I have now written in a great lot of balderdash all over the damn book and the first half is practically as it will appear. I shall give Molly another 2000 word spin, correct a few more episodes and write all over them and then begin to put the spectral <cite>Ithaca</cite> into shape &hellip; If you ever find anything relating to what I am doing throw it into an envelope and perhaps it will go into the stew. No more subscriptions for <cite>Ulysses</cite>. Only 4 or 5 last month.</div>
