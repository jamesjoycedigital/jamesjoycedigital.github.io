<div class="nbunit" id="30Oct1921"><font color="red">30 October 1921</font>, <cite>Letters III</cite>(JJ to Valery Larbaud): My typist has sent you extracts (of course uncorrected) from the beginning and middle of <cite>Ithaca</cite>. In a few days she will send you extracts from the end. I will send you the proof of the Messianic [scene] from <cite>Circe</cite> when I get it back. I finished <cite>Ithaca</cite> last night so that now the writing of <cite>Ulysses</cite> is ended, though I have some weeks of work in revising the proofs.</div>
