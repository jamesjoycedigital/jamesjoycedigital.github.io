<dl id="rd3"> <dt><a href="../../ulex/r/rd3.htm">u16.3</a> &nbsp; </dt> <dd>This draft level (which is a "virtual" level) represents the changes, mainly in punctuation, made in preparing the typescript from the manuscript. It is not clear whether these changes, or some of them, were authorised. Nevertheless, most of them were (at the very least) accepted by Joyce and became part of the further development of the episode. Only one category of change&mdash;the conversion of dialogue dashes to inverted commas&mdash;is not included, as it was immediately reversed <i>in toto</i>. Nevertheless, it too may have been authorised: February 1921 (see <cite>Letters</cite> I, <a name="4Feb1921" href="../ulett/ulett.htm#4Feb1921">4 February</a> and <a name="b28Feb1921" href="../ulett/ulett.htm#28Feb1921">28 February</a> 1921). <ul><li>MS: missing </li></ul> </dd> </dl>
