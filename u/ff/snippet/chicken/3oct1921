She never lived in Belvedere College, however. After the divorce court proceedings she was confined in Gaulstown, Co. Westmeath, the old seat of the family, near Belvedere House by the shore of Lough Ennel, a new residence just completed by the Earl. The Countess Mary died about 1780. Belvedere House (now Belvedere College) was not completed by the second Earl (the builder of it), until 1786.</div>
