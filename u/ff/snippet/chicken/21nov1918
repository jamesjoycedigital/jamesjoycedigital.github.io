<div class="nbunit" id="21Nov1918"><font color="red">21 November 1918</font>, <cite>JJQ</cite> (JJ to Carl Bleibtreu): In the book I am writing <cite>Ulysses</cite> there is an allusion to your interesting Shakespearean theory, but, in order to refresh my memory, I should be glad to have your book [<cite>Die L&ouml;sung der Shakespear-Frage: Eine neue Theorie</cite> Leipzig: Thomas, 1907] for 2 or 3 days. Mr Sykes has mislaid his copy and I cannot get one at libraries. Would you let have your book for a day or two? Moreover I should like to know had you this idea for many years or can you tell me what year you began to make research. Your book was published in &apos;07 or &apos;08, if I remember. Another small point of interest is the date of your visit to the present Duke of Rutland. If you could let me know any impression of that event and also the name of his county-seat I should be obliged.</div>
