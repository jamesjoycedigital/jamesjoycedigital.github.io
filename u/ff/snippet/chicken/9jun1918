<div class="nbunit" id="9Jun1918"><font color="red">9 June 1918</font>, <cite>Letters I</cite> (JJ to James B. Pinker): If my publisher there wants to do it he can publish the first three episodes of <cite>Ulysses</cite> in autumn as a paperbound book and episodes 4 to 13 also when I have sent them and finally episodes 14, 15, 16 &hellip; send against my account a copy of Mr Lawrence&apos;s novel <cite>The Rainbow</cite>. I hope that my eyes will soon allow me to set to work again, if only for a time, on <cite>Ulysses</cite>. I believe Miss Weaver cannot find anyone to print it. </div>
