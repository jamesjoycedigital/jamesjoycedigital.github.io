<div class="nbunit" id="31Oct1918"><font color="red">31 October 1918</font>, <cite>Letters I</cite> (Ben Huebsch to Harriet Weaver): Miss Anderson says that the excisions in <cite>Ulysses</cite> had been made in pencil in the copy that she received and she is under the impression that they represent Mr Pound&apos;s ideas. She says that she made absolutely no changes herself. Her manuscript appears to be mislaid and she will search for it, but you know that missing manuscripts are never found, so that you had better see to it that I receive a duplicate copy in the form in which it should appear in the volume.</div>
