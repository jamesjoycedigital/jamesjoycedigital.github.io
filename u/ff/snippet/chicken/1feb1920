I want that information about the Star of the Sea church, has it ivy on its seafront, are there trees in Leahy&apos;s terrace at the side or near and, if so, what, are there steps leading down to the beach? I also want all the information you can give, tittletattle, facts etc about Holles Street maternity hospital. Two chapters of my book remain unfinished till I have these so I shall feel very grateful if you &hellip; write me a long letter with details.</div>
