Ralph Pinker): Meanwhile, don&apos;t you think it would be better if Monsieur Leon let me have any corrections which may be necessary before we set up from the American edition. This is going to save us a lot of time and trouble at the outset. It seems to me to be rather foolish to set up from copy which we already know contains some mistakes. If Mr Gilbert made some hundreds of corrections for the Odyssey Press edition, wouldn&apos;t it surely be better to set up from this. In any case, I think that Monsieur Leon should certainly supply us with a perfect copy of either one or the other edition or &hellip; perhaps send us a letter embodying the necessary corrections to whichever edition he wishes to set it from. </div>
