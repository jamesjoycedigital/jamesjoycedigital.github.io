<div class="nbunit" id="udn43"> Richard Ellmann suggests that Florry may be named after Miss Fleury Crawford, a real-life kip whore, and that Kitty is based on another true-to-life prostitute, Miss Becky Cooper. There is little evidence adduced for this and, besides, Becky was a madam in the cheaper houses.  </div>
