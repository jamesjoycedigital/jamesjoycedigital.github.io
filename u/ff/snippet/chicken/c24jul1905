<div class="nbunit" id="c24Jul1905"><font color="red">c. 24 July 1905</font>, <cite>Selected Letters</cite> 76-7 (JJ to Stanislaus Joyce): Via S. Nicolo 30, II&deg;, Trieste, Austria. <br>Please send me the information I ask you for as follows: <br><i>The Sisters</i>: Can a priest be buried in a caul? <br><i>Ivy Day in the Commitee Room</i>&mdash;Are Aungier St and Wicklow in the Royal Exchange Ward? Can a muniicipal election be held in October? <br><i>A Painful Case</i>&mdash;Are the police at Sydney Parade of the D division? Would the cty ambulance be called out to Sydney Parade for an accident? Would an accident at Sydney Parade be treated at Vincent's Hospital? <br><i>After the Race</i>&mdash;Are the police supplied with provisians by government or by privste contrsctd? <p>Kindly answer these questions as quickly as possible. I sent mmy story <i>The Clay</i> (which I had slightky rewritten) to The LITERARY World [Hellip;] I wrote to Heinemann telling him about <i>Dubliners</i> and asking him would he read it and consider it. I shall send you on  Wednesday or Thursday the tenth story <i>A Mother</i> and the book will be finished by the first of November. You might let me know what you think of it as I intend to dedicate it to you. You are a long time sitting on my novel. I wish youd say what you think of it. The only book I know like it is Lermontoffs <i>Hero of Our Days</i>. Of course mine is much longer and Lermontoffs hero is an aristocrat and a tired man and a brave animal. But there is a likeness in the aim and title and at times in the acid treatment.</p></div>
