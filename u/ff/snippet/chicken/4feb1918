<div class="nbunit" id="4Feb1918"><font color="red">PM 4 February 1918</font>, <cite>Letters II</cite> (JJ to Claud Sykes): Arranged matters with Mr and Mrs G. You can go tomorrow after ten. Can you arrange perhaps for some other hour or so before Saturday as I want to get rid of the episode? There is, I find, an omission in the lot you have. After words  &lsquo;upward in the fog&rsquo; (v. Clerkenwell allusion) insert sentence.  &lsquo;Shattered glass and toppling masonry&rsquo;. The sun was in my eyes as I copied.</div>
