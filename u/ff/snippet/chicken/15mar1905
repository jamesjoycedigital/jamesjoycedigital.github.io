<div class="nbunit" id="15Mar1905"><font color="red">15 March 1905</font>, <cite>Selected Letters</cite> 58-9 (JJ to Stanislaus Joyce): Piazza Ponterossa 3, III, Trieste, Austria. <br>I have finished Chapters XV. XVI. XVII. XVIII and will send them if you like. The U. College episode will take about ten chapters and I thought of keeping all till it was ended. On the other hand that is a hell of a time for you to wait. I have received your letter which interested me very much but if you knew what the feuilletons and short sketches in French papers [are] you would understand my embarrassment. [SJ perhaps wrote suggesting JJ translate some of the Dubliners stories for the French press.] Is Starkey's book any good? I think Gogarty muse use a typewriter: I do not thnk he could write consecutively enough for an article without some mechanical aid.</div>
