<div class="nbunit" id="14Oct1921"><font color="red">14 October 1921</font>, <cite>Selected Letters</cite> (JJ to Aunt Josephine): Thanks for prompt reply to my letter. <cite>Ulysses</cite>, a huge book of about 800 pages, about 11 inches by 7, ought to be out in about three weeks or so. The cheapest copies cost &pound;3 each, the dearest &pound;7 each. I shall send you one &hellip; I want all the information, gossip or anything you remember about the Powells &mdash; chiefly the mother and daughters. Were any of them born abroad? When did Mrs Powell die? I never heard of a third brother, only Gus and Charley. The women were Mrs Gallaher, Mrs Clinch, Mrs Russell. Where did they live before marriage? When did the major, if that was his rank, die? Also any information you have about the Dillons (Mat Dillon and his bevy of daughters, Tiny, Floey, Atty, Sara, Nannie, and <i>Mamie</i>, especially the last, the cigarette smoker and Spanish type). Get an ordinary sheet of foolscap and a pencil and scribble any God damn drivel you may remember about these people &hellip; Also I forgot to ask what do you know about Hunter who lived in Clonliffe road and Alf Bergan etc etc. I mean what has become of them. I know what the relations were there.</div>
