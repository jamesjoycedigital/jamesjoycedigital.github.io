<div class="nbunit" id="12Dec1934"><font color="red">12 December 1934</font> <i>NLPK</i> (from Paul L&eacute;on to J. Ralph Pinker): The arrangement for the proof reading seems to me to be allright. I do not know though from what edition the type is set. The Albatross edition contains two misprints which I discovered on a perusal otherwise I am told it is very correct. I have not read the American edition so I cannot say anything about it. </div>
