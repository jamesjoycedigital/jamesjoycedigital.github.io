You must be misinformed unless it is a brandnew regulation. Well, can you obtain for me <cite>Reynolds</cite> or <cite>Lloyd&apos;s Weekly News</cite> or <cite>News of the World</cite> for the weeks ending? Keep them till my next card when I shall tell you where to send them either to Paris or to London. </div>
