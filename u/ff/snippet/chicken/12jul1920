<div class="nbunit" id="12Jul1920"><font color="red">12 July 1920</font>, <cite>Selected Letters</cite> (JJ to Harriet Weaver): I arrived here with my family three days ago. My intention is to remain here three months in order to write the last adventure <cite>Circe</cite> in peace (?) and also the first episode of the close. For this purpose I brought with me a recast of my notes and MS and also an extract of insertions for the first half of the book in case it be set up during my stay here &hellip; I hope you duly received <cite>Oxen of the Sun</cite> which Mr Pound sent you on from Italy &hellip; I hope also I shall be able to finish the twelfth adventure at my ease. Like its fellows it presents for me great technical difficulties and for the reader something worse. A great part of the nostos or close was written several years ago and the style is quite plain &hellip; The whole book &hellip; will be finished about December</div>
