<div class="nbunit" id="udn51"> Joyce confused himself when researching the details of the fugue and, in his haste, misunderstood the specific canonical form of the fuga per canonem. In this regard, consult Susan Brown, &ldquo;The Mystery of the Fuga per Canonem Solved&rdquo; in <cite>Genetic Joyce Studies</cite> (Spring 2007): http://www.geneticjoycestudies.org/GJS7/GJS7brown.html. She writes that the entry for the fugue written by Ralph Vaughn Williams in the 1906 edition of Grove&apos;s <cite>Dictionary of Music and Musicians</cite> is the source for Joyce&apos;s fuga per canonem notes. These appear in Italian on the cover of his Sirens copybook (NLI II.ii.3).  </div>
