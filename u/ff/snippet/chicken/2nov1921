<div class="nbunit" id="2Nov1921"><font color="red">2 November 1921</font>, <cite>Selected Letters</cite> (JJ to Aunt Josephine): Thanks for the information &hellip; Two more questions. Is it possible for an ordinary person to climb over the area railings of no 7 Eccles street, either from the path or the steps, lower himself from the lowest part of the railings till his feet are within 2 feet or 3 of the ground and drop unhurt. I saw it done myself but by a man of rather athletic build. I require this information in detail in order to determine the wording of a paragraph. Secondly. Do you know anything of Mat Dillon&apos;s daughter Mamy who was in Spain? If so, please let me know. Did any of your girlfriends ever go there? Thirdly and last, Do you remember the cold February of 1893. I think you were in Clanbrassil street. I want to know if the canal was frozen and if there were any skating.</div>
