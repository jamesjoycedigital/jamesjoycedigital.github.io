<div class="nbunit" id="28Feb1905"><font color="red">28 February 1905</font>, <cite>Selected Letters</cite> 56 (JJ to Stanislaus Joyce): 7 Via Medolino, 1&deg;. Pola, Austria. <br>It seems to me that what astonishes most people in the length of the novel is the extraordinary energy in the writer and his extraordinary patience. It would be easy for me to do short novels if I chose but what I want to wear away in this novel cannot be worn away except by constant dropping. Gogarty used to pipe &lsquo;63&rsquo; in treble when I told him the number of the chapters. I am not quite satisfied with the title &lsquo;Stephen Hero&rsquo; and am thinking of restoring the original title of the article &lsquo;A Portrait of the Artist&rsquo; or perhaps better &lsquo;Chapters in the Life of a Young Man&rsquo;. [&hellip;] I have come to accept my present situation as a voluntary exile&mdash;is it not so? This seems to me important both because I am likely to generate out of it a sufficiently personal future to satisfy CurranÂ’s heart and also because it supplies me with the note on which I propose to bring my novel to a close.</div>
