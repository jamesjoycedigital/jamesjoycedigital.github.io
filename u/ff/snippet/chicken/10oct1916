<div class="nbunit" id="10Oct1916"><font color="red">10 October 1916</font>, <cite>Letters II</cite> (JJ to Harriet Weaver): I thank you also for your kind enquiry about the book I am writing. I am working at it as well as I can. It is called <cite>Ulysses</cite> and the action takes place in Dublin in 1904. I have almost finished the first part and have written out part of the middle and end. I hope to finish it in 1918.</div>
