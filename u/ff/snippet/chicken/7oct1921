<div class="nbunit" id="7Oct1921"><font color="red">7 October 1921</font>, <cite>Letters I</cite> (JJ to Harriet Weaver): I am here again with MSS and pencils (red, green and blue) and cases of books &hellip; nearly snowed up in proofs and nearly crazed with work. <cite>Ulysses</cite> will be finished in about three weeks &hellip; and ought to be published early in November. I sent the <cite>Penelope</cite> episode to the printer &hellip; the <cite>Ithaca</cite> episode which precedes it I am now putting in order. It is in reality the end as <cite>Penelope</cite> has no beginning, middle or end. I expect to have early next week about 240 pages of the book as it will appear ready and will send on. <cite>Eolus</cite> is recast. <cite>Hades</cite> and the <cite>Lotuseaters</cite> much amplified and the other episodes retouched a good deal. Not much change has been made in the <cite>Telemachia</cite> (the first three episodes of the book).</div>
