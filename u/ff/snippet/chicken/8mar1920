<div class="nbunit" id="8Mar1920"><font color="red">8 March 1920</font>, <cite>JML</cite> (JJ to Jane Heap): The <cite>Nausikaa</cite> episode was sent off about a month ago and I hope has reached you. I am writing the <cite>Oxen of the Sun</cite> and shall send as soon as it is finished. There remains of the adventures <cite>Circe</cite> and the close of the book, the nostos proper, part of which is already written, divided, like the Telemachia, into three episodes.</div>
