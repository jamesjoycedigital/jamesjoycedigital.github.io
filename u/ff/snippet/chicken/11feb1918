<div class="nbunit" id="11Feb1918"><font color="red">11 February 1918</font>, <cite>JML</cite> (JJ to Ezra Pound): I hope you are now better and out again. I shall be looking forward to a letter from you. I sent you this morning the third (and last) episode of the Telemachia. The spelling and mechanical construction used by me are to be followed by the printer even when words are misspelled and the grammar is at fault.</div>
