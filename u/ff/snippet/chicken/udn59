<div class="nbunit" id="udn59"> Most scholars now hold the two epics to be from different lines of transmission, with different origins, and believe that The <cite>Iliad</cite> is the earlier composed. The latter tells the tale of the conflict of two warrior kings, Agamemnon of Mycenae and Achilles of Thessaly, and is believed to mythologize the downfall of a lost Mycenaean civilization through civil war. The <cite>Odyssey</cite> likewise mythologizes ancient Mycenaean grandeur.  </div>
