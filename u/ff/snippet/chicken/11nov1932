<div class="nbunit" id="11Nov1932"><font color="red">11 November 1932</font> <i>BLHW</i> (to Harriet Weaver): No trace of the MS. Your bundle of notes came safely. Mr Jolas is afraid some unscrupulous person may have the MS and wants me to complete the instalment without delay. I typed the last four pages from memory and shall have to start again on the notes tomorrow with what calm you can imagine. Unforunately Stuart Gilbert cannot help me. The Albatross Press flung the whole printed test of <i>Ulysses</i> (about 900 pp) into his hall yesterday and he has to check it &hellip; Faber and Faber are bringing out for Xmas &lsquo;The Mookse&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Ondt&lsquo; &hellip; Reece &hellip; liked her alphabet and has written to the manager of Burns and Oates about using these <i>lettrines</i> for a reprint of Chaucer&apos;s A.B.C. poem &hellip; Reece lent Lucia a stack of books about this kind of work &hellip; Jolas has just come so I must go down. </div>
