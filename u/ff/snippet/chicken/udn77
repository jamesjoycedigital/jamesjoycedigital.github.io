<div class="nbunit" id="udn77"> Teiresias, the inventor of augury, was a blind prophet of Apollo in Thebes. He was son to the shepherd Everes and the nymph Charlico, and is reputed to have understood the language of birds. He could divine the future from signatures in fire, or smoke; however, it was the communications of the dead that he most relied on, menacing them when they came late to attend him.  </p><p> He is most noted for having been changed into a woman and, years later, refashioned as a man. Tradition has it that on Mount Cyllene in the Peloponnese he came upon a pair of coupling serpents and struck them with a stick. The goddess Hera was displeased and punished him by transforming him into a woman. As a woman, she (he) became a priestess of Hera, married and had a child. After seven years, she (he) again encountered mating snakes and trampled on them, and with this, was released from womanhood and turned back into a man.  </div>
