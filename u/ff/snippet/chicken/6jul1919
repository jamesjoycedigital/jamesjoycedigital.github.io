I have since made arrangements with another firm and they are bringing out the next number this week. Half of the sixth episode will appear in it; the other half in the following number &hellip; I remember mentioning this new plan [to suspend the <cite>Egoist</cite> and concentrate on book publishing] &hellip; the mananger, a Roman Catholic Irishman, had been much interesterd in your first novel. He has now seen the first ten chapters of <cite>Ulysses</cite> and &hellip; will be willing to print the complete text &hellip; Mr Pound sent me the Sirens episode a little time ago</div>
