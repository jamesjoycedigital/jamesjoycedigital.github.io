<div class="nbunit" id="12Jul1905"><font color="red">12 July 1905</font>, <cite>Selected Letters</cite> 63-41 (JJ to Stanislaus Joyce): Via S. Nicolo 30, II&deg;, Trieste, Austria. <br>I send you tomorrow the fifth story of &lsquo;Dubliners&rsquo; that is &lsquo;The Boarding House&rsquo;. [&hellip;] I have also written the sixth story &lsquo;Counterparts&rsquo; and shall send it to you on Saturday if I have made a copy by then. It is my intention to complete &lsquo;Dubliners&rsquo; by the end of the year and to follow it by a book &lsquo;Provincials&rsquo;. I am uncommonly well pleased with these stories. [&hellip;] You will remember the circumstances in which I left Dublin nine months ago. Like everything else that I have done in my life it was an experiment. I can hardly say with truth that it was an experiment which has failed seeing that in those nine months I have begotten a child, written 500 pages of my novel, written 3 of my stories, learned German and Danish fairly well, besides discharging the intolerable (to me) duties of my position and swindling two tailors. I believe, besides, that I write much better now than when I was in Dublin and the incident in Chap. XXIII(?) [XXIV] where Stephen makes &lsquo;love&rsquo; to Emma Clery I consider a remarkable piece of writing.</div>
