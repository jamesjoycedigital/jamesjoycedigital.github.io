<div class="nbunit" id="6Jan1918"><font color="red">6 January 1918</font>, <cite>Yale</cite> (JJ to Ezra Pound): I leave Locarno today. My address in Zurich for the moment will be c/o Sig. Ugo Moggi, Friedenstrasse 7, Zurich. It was not possible to remain on here as I have no lessons to supplement my income and my New York publisher writes that the sales of my novel have come to a standstill &hellip; I have no choice. The business of looking for and finding some tolerable quarters will take up some of my time and may delay for a week or so the sending of the third episode of the Telemachia. I suggest, however, that you print the <i>whole first episode in one number</i> and the second in the next. I confirm my postcard and repeat here the corrections on the typescript which I beg you to forward at once to the <cite>Little Review</cite> and Egoist. Episode 1, p.4, par 9 for  &lsquo;Crauly&apos;s&rsquo; read &lsquo;Cranly&apos;s&rsquo; : Episode 1, p.10, par 8 after  &lsquo;I am, ma&apos;am, Buck etc&rsquo; read &lsquo;Look at that now, she said.&rsquo; ; Episode 1, p.13, par 7 for  &lsquo;We&apos;re always tired&rsquo; etc read  &lsquo;I&apos;m [always tired]&rsquo;. I am sure there are other mistakes. My bad eyesight and the condition in which my typing is done are to blame.</div>
