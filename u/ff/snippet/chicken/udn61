<div class="nbunit" id="udn61"> Odysseus sought to avoid being involved in the military struggle by feigning madness when Palamedes was sent by Agamemnon to Ithaca to recruit him. To show that he was mentally unfit for military service, he yoked an ox and a horse together to his plough, and sowed salt into the ground instead of seed. Palamedes was not taken in by these ruses and placed Odysseus&apos; infant son, Telemachos, in the plough&apos;s way, and Odysseus had little choice but to swerve aside and admit his sanity. He never forgave Palamedes for his insistence that he join the other squadrons and, characteristically, when the chance arose he lured him into a well and crushed him with stones.  </p><p> Palamedes is credited with inventing eleven of the letters of the Greek alphabet.  </div>
