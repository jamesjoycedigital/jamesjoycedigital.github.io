<div class="nbunit" id="fw39ed"><h4><cite>Finnegans Wake</cite> by James Joyce, first edition (London: Faber and Faber, 4 May 1939).</h4> </p><p>Most of the copies of <cite>Finnegans Wake</cite> now available in bookshops or on the internet are either straight reproductions of the 1939 first edition or (as in the case of the Viking Press, <a href="https://www.faber.co.uk/9780571217359-finnegans-wake.html" target="_blank">Faber and Faber</a>, and more recent <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/finnegans-wake-9780199695157?lang=en&cc=fr" target="_blank">Oxford University Press</a> reprints) reproductions incorporating the list of errata prepared by Joyce with Paul L&eacute;on's help in 1940. These corrections were so few in number and so minor in detail (adding commas, etc.) that they did not require a resetting of the text, which would have been very difficult to achieve at the time, hence the page and line numbers in all these editions are the same. The Oxford University Press edition, referred to above, includes an Introduction by Finn Fordham and textual notes (including suggested emendations) by Robbert-Jan Henkes and Erik Bindervoet. </p><p>Eric Rosenbloom has prepared a <a href="http://www.rosenlake.net/fw/FWeditions.html" target="_blank">chronological list</a> of the several reprintings made to date.</p>  </div>
