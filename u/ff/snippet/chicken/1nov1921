What remains is the revision of the proofs of the last four episodes &hellip; About 400 subscriptions are made &hellip; <cite>Ulysses</cite> began on 1 March (birthday of a friend of mine, a cornish painter [Frank Budgen]} and was finished on Mr Pound's birthday [30 October]), he tells me. I wonder on whose it will be published.</div>
