<div class="nbunit" id="13Oct1919"><font color="red">13 October 1919</font>, <cite>Letters II</cite> (Mrs McCormick to JJ): Thank you for your fine manuscript, &mdash; which I am glad to keep for you with the understanding that, when for any reason, you want it, you have only to write for it. As the Bank told you, I am not able to help you any longer financially, but now that the difficult years of the war are past, you will find publishers and come forward yourself, I  know.</div>
