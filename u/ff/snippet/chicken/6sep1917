<div class="nbunit" id="6Sep1917"><font color="red">6 September 1917</font>, <cite>SB</cite> (Harriet Weaver to JJ): Mr. Pound told me you had written that your book <cite>Ulysses</cite> was likely to be finished in January and that you suggested its appearance as a serial in the <cite>Egoist</cite> and <cite>Little Review</cite> simultaneously. We should be very glad indeed to have it and the <cite>Egoist</cite> could pay you fifty pounds &mdash; half of it now and half of it in six months time if that suits you.</div>
