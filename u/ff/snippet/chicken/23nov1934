<div class="nbunit" id="23Nov1934"><font color="red">23 November 1934</font> <i>NLPK</i> (from J. Ralph Pinker to Paul L&eacute;on): Thank you for your letter of yesterday. With regard to the point you raise about the proof reading of Ulysses, I understand that this is a very important matter, but I thought that this would have been done by someone in Paris under yours or Mr Joyce&apos;s supervision. If you definitely decide that it would be better for it to be done by Lanes, I will ask them to undertake this. </div>
