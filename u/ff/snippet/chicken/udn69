<div class="nbunit" id="udn69"> The Kikones dwelt on the southwestern coast of Thrace. They sided with Troy against the Achaeans during the Trojan War and were led by Euphemos (son to Troezenos, son to Ceas). They vanish historically and are remembered most notably by the story of Orpheus, the Thracian lyrist who sought his lover Eurydice in the underworld. He is said to have been ripped to pieces by Kikonian women after he rejected their advances. He was subsequently reincarnated as a swan, or, as Ovid writes, his disembodied head bobbed on the sea until it came to rest on the island of Lesbos, where it continued to speak, uttering prophesies.  </div>
