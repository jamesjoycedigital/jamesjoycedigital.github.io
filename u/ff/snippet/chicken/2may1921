<div class="nbunit" id="2May1921"><font color="red">2 May 1921</font>, <cite>Letters I</cite> (JJ to Harriet Weaver): I would have sent on the typescript of <cite>Oxen of the Sun</cite> with this for Mr Eliot but that this with all the copies of the <cite>Little Review</cite> was lent to Mrs Harrison to enable her, as she said, to follow the names and allusions in <cite>Circe</cite> when typing &hellip; Nevertheless I shall present the typescript [of <cite>Oxen</cite>] to [Pound] (another copy) for forwarding as I have done hitherto knowing that it will never appear in the review &hellip; Tomorrow evening I hope to send you a proof of the prospectus</div>
