She leans back against the / pillowed wall: odalisque-featured in the luxurious / obscurity. Her eyes have drunk my thoughts: and / into the moist warm yielding welcoming darkness / of her womanhood my soul, itself dissolving, / has streamed and poured and flooded a liquid / and abundant seed . . . . . . Take her now who will! . . . . </blockquote> <dd class="well"><mm class="note">Note: Cf. <a href="https://archive.org/details/cu31924060276882/page/n235/mode/2up" target="_blank">page 262, paragraph 3</a> of <cite>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</cite> (New York: B.W.
