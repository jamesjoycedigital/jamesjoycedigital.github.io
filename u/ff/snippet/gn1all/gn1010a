Tawny gloom in the vast gargoyled / church. It is cold as on that morning: <i>quia frigus erat</i>. Upon / the steps of the far high altar, naked as the body of the / Lord, the ministers lie prostrate in weak prayer. The voice / of an unseen reader rises, intoning the lesson from Hosea. / <i>Haec dicit Dominus: in tribulatione sua mane consurgent / ad me. Venite et revertamur ad Dominum</i> . . . . She stands / beside me, pale and chill, clothed with the shadows of the / sindark nave, her thin elbow at my arm. Her flesh recalls / the thrill of that raw mist-veiled morning, hurrying / torches, cruel eyes. Her soul is sorrowful, trembles and / would weep. Weep not for me, O daughter of Jerusalem! </blockquote> <dd class="well"><mm class="note">Note: <i>Quia frigus erat</i> means &ldquo;for it was cold&rdquo;. The longer Latin piece was used to begin the Good Friday Mass. The expression &ldquo;Night&apos;s sindark nave&rdquo; reappears in Joyce&apos;s poem &ldquo;Nightpiece&rdquo; (dated Trieste 1915). </mm> </dd></dl>
