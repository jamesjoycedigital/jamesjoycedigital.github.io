The carriage / passes through the lane of canvas stalls, its wheel-spokes / spinning in the glare. Make way! Her father and his son / sit in the carriage. They have owls&apos; eyes and owls&apos; wisdom. / Owlish wisdom stares from their eyes brooding upon the / lore of their <i>Summa contra Gentiles</i>. </blockquote> <dd class="well"><mm class="note">Note: Cf. <cite>UG</cite> 10.306: &lsquo;shamefaced peaches&rsquo;.</mm> </dd></dl>
