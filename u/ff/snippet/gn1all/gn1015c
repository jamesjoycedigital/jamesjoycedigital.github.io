A narrow Parisian / room. The hairdresser lay here but now. I kissed her stocking and / the hem of her rustblack dusty skirt. It is the other. She. / Gogarty came yesterday to be introduced. <cite>Ulysses</cite> is the / reason. Symbol of the intellectual conscience . . . . Ireland / then? And the husband? Pacing the corridor in list shoes / or playing chess against himself. Why are we left here? The / hairdresser lay here but now, clutching my head between / her knobby knees . . . . Intellectual symbol of my race. Listen! / The plunging gloom has fallen. Listen! <p class="flush">&mdash; I am not convinced that such activities of the mind / or body can be called unhealthy &mdash;</p> <p>She speaks. A weak voice from beyond the cold stars. Voice / of wisdom. Say on! O, say again, making me wise! This / voice I never heard.</p> <p>She coils towards me along the crumpled lounge. I cannot / move or speak. Coiling approach of starborn flesh. Adultery / of wisdom. No. I will go. I will.</p> <p class="flush">&mdash; Jim, love! &mdash;</p> <p>Soft sucking lips kiss my left armpit: a coiling kiss / on myriad veins. I burn! I crumple like a burning / leaf! From my right armpit a fang of flame leaps out. / A starry snake has kissed me: a cold nightsnake. I am lost! <p class="flush">&mdash; Nora! &mdash;</p></blockquote> </dl>
