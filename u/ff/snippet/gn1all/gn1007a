She cannot: no, she cannot. / She moves backwards towards me mutely. I raise my / arms to help her: her arms fall. I hold the websoft / edges of her gown and drawing them out to hook them / I see through the opening of the black veil her / lithe body sheathed in an orange shift. It slips its / ribbons of moorings at her shoulders and falls / slowly: a lithe smooth naked body shimmering with / silvery scales. It slips slowly over the slender buttocks / of smooth polished silver and over their furrow, a / tarnished silver shadow . . . . Fingers, cold and / calm and moving . . . . A touch, a touch.</blockquote> </dl>
