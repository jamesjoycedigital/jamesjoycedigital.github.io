She stands in the yellow / shadow of the hall, a plaid cloak shielding from / chills her sinking shoulders: and as I halt / in wonder and look about me she greets me / wintrily and passes up the staircase darting / at me for an instant out of her sluggish / sidelong eyes a jet of liquorish venom.</blockquote> </dl>
