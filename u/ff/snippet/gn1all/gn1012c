The sodden walls ooze a steamy damp. A symphony / of smells fuses the mass of huddled human forms: sour / reek of armpits, nozzled oranges, melting breast ointments, / mastick water, the breath of suppers of sulphurous / garlic, foul phosphorescent farts, opoponax, the frank / sweat of marriageable and married womankind, the soapy / stink of men . . . . . . All night I have watched her, all night / I shall see her: braided and pinnacled hair and olive / oval face and calm soft eyes. A green fillet upon her / hair and about her body a green-broidered gown: the / hue of the illusion of the vegetable glass of nature / and of lush grass, the hair of graves.</blockquote> </dl>
