The quaint name of the old Dutch musician makes all / beauty seem quaint and far. I hear his variations for the clavichord / on an old air: <cite>Youth has an end</cite>. In the vague mist of old / sounds a faint point of light appears: the speech of the soul / is about to be heard. Youth has an end: the end is here. It / will never be. You know that well. What then? Write it, damn / you, write it! What else are you good for? </blockquote> <dd class="well"><mm class="note">Note: See also <a name="s16021v" href="s16all.htm#s16021v">Sheet 16.021(v)</a>. </mm> </dd></dl>
