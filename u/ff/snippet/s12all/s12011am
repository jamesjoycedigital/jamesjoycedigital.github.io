Timanthes (a contempory of Zeuxis and Parrhasius) was a Greek painter of great renown, though few of his paintings are known to us. Of these, one is a small panel on which he painted an image of a sleeping cyclops; to convey an adequate idea of the giant&apos;s size, he introduced a group of satyrs measuring its thumb with a thyrsus. </mm> </dd></dl>
