When the Austrians moved southward the city of Genoa opened its gates to him, and he subsequently commanded the imperialist troops that crossed the Var and entered France, establishing their outposts a few miles from Toulon. His withdrawal from Genoa was considered a masterly operation. After the convention of Pizza in 1749 he returned to Vienna, and held command in Transylvania and Bohemia. He became a field-marshal in 1753. At the outbreak of the <mark>seven years&apos; war</mark> he was in Silesia, and <mark>commanded the Austrians at the battle of Lobositz</mark>. Believing a dual command, as proposed by Maria Theresa, to be prejudicial to public interests, Brown offered to serve <mark>under the orders of Prince Charles of Lorraine</mark>, the empress&apos;s favourite, in Bohemia, and there, <mark>while heading a bayonet-charge</mark> of grenadiers on the Prussian line before the walls of <mark>Prague</mark>, on 6 May 1757, was struck by a cannon-shot, which shattered one of his legs. He was carried from the field, and <mark>died</mark> of the wound at Prague, on 26 June following, leaving behind him the reputation of a consummate general and an able and successful negotiator. His biography was published in German and in French in 1757. <small> <a name="DNBB" href="/udra/udex.htm#dnbb"><cite title="source">Dictionary of National Biography</cite></a> (1886), BROWN or BROWNE, ULYSSES MAXIMILIAN von (1705-1757)</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
