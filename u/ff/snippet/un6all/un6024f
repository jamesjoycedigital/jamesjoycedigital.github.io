In 8 cases out of 2200 Bergh found the pubic hair forming a large curly wig extending to the iliac spines. The individual hairs have occasionally been found so stiff and brush-like as to render coitus difficult. <small> Havelock Ellis, <a name="HEPS" href="/udra/udex.htm#heps"><cite title="source">Studies in the Psychology of Sex</cite></a> (1906), vol.
