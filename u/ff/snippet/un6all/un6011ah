The arms of Munster are &lsquo;azure, three antique crowns, or&rsquo;. The three-crown device can be traced to the fourteenth century, when it was borne by Robert de Vere as Lord of Ireland. The three crowns were borne as the arms of Ireland in the funeral procession of Henry V, in 1413. [These reappear in Finnegans Wake in &lsquo;the three crowns round your draphole&rsquo; in III.3]. <p>The leader of the Milesians, who had defeated the Tuatha De Danann and become masters of Ireland, was Goidel (or Gael), and the &lsquo;sons&rsquo; of Milesius were the Gaels. These were believed to have been the legitimate progeny of the three sons of Milesius, Hiber (or Eber), Heremon (or Eiremon), and Ith. Ith was slain by by the Tuatha de Danaans. The Gaels are held to have come to Ireland by way of Spain, and to have originated in Egypt.</p> </mm> </dd></dl>
