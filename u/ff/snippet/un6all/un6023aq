Before the day passes, however, he has established himself in one of these temporary abodes; and although there cannot be spared for him, at first, a whole room, he soon finds that the warmth of the atmosphere, and the exhilaration of spirits, produced by a brilliant sky, induce him to loiter abroad, rather than seek the interior of his dwelling. This is in the middle of the town, the <mark>Commercial Square</mark>, formerly the Grand Parade, afterwards the Alameda; and to an Englishman, quitting for the first time his native land, there can nowhere be presented a more animating scene. <small> An Old Inhabitant, <a name="TTHG1" href="/udra/udex.htm#tthg1"><cite title="source">The traveller's handbook for Gibraltar</cite></a> (1844), 9f</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c07248k" href="../../../f/ff/fnbs/c07all.htm#c07248k">VI.C.07:248(k)</a> </dd> </dd></dl>
