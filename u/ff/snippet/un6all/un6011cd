He served as Prefect of the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith from 1879 until his death in 1892. He was made cardinal in 1875. The &lsquo;Plan of Campaign&rsquo; was a resistance policy of &lsquo;boycott&rsquo; adopted in Ireland between 1886 and 1891, co-ordinated by Irish politicians for the benefit of tenant farmers, in opposition to mainly (English) absentee and rack-rent landlords. It was denounced by Simeoni and the other clergy.  <br>Raphael transcription: <a name="c07238b" href="../../../f/ff/fnbs/c07all.htm#c07238b">VI.C.07:238(b)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
