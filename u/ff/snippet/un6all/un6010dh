She was making love to her father&apos;s mare after a singular fashion. Stripping her right arm, <mark>she formed her fingers into a cone, and pressed on the mare&apos;s vulva</mark>. I was astonished to see the beast stretching her hind legs as if to accommodate the hand of her mistress, which she pushed in gradually and with seeming ease <mark>to the elbow</mark>. At the same time, she seemed to experience the most voluptuous sensation, crisis after crisis arriving. <small> Havelock Ellis, <a name="HEPS" href="/udra/udex.htm#heps"><cite title="source">Studies in the Psychology of Sex</cite></a> (1906), vol.
