He was, more honestly, &lsquo;an admirable captain, an adequate major, a barely satisfactory colonel and a disastrous general&rsquo;. His leadership as commander of the Natal Field Force in the second Boar War was appalling, and, before his replacement, he was repeatedly defeated. He remained as second-in-command and was successful in the Battle of the Tulega Heights, lifting the siege of Ladysmith on 28 February 1900, in which action the Royal Dublin Fusiliers fought. </mm> </dd></dl>
