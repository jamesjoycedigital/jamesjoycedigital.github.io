At the age of 20, he married his cousin Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. They had nine children. He died at the relatively young age of 42, following a long illness. Victoria was so devastated at the loss of her husband that she entered into a deep state of mourning and wore black for the rest of her life. On her death in 1901, their eldest son succeeded as Edward VII.</mm> </dd></dl>
