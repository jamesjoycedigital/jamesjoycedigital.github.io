In women every phase of sexual life&mdash;puberty, menstruation, coitus, pregnancy&mdash;tends to affect the voice and always by giving it a deeper character. The deepening of the voice by sexual intercourse was an ancient Greek observation, and Martial refers to a woman&apos;s good or bad singing as an index to her recent sexual habits. Prostitutes tend to have a deep voice. <small> Havelock Ellis, <a name="HEPS" href="/udra/udex.htm#HEPS"><cite title="source">Studies in the Psychology of Sex</cite></a> (1906), vol.
