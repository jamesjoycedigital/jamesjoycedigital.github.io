Burial of the dead was an inviolable practice in the Church. Cremation was considered a pagan custom often accompanied by rites incompatible with the Catholic Faith. Under Boniface VIII whoever practiced cremation was excommunicated and the remains even of the corpse were refused Christian burial. <p>Canon 1176 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law, paragraph 3, permits cremation, though burial is earnestly recommended, but it is only the recommendation of a pious custom. Funeral rites are forbidden for those who have chosen cremation for a reason contrary to the Christian Faith (canon 1184). It is also forbidden to scatter the ashes or to have them in your home; they must be buried or placed in a vault in a cemetery.</p></mm> </dd></dl>
