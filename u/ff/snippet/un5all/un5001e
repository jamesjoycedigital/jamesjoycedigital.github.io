Formerly, farmers used them to bring salt-butter to market. Coopers made these firkins from logs of wood sawn into staves and a thresh hoop was put around the top and another was put around the bottom. Then a small fire was put in the middle of the barrel to bring the staves together. Then hoops made out of salleys were nailed on with &lsquo;dholls&rsquo;, nails with two points. </mm> </dd></dl>
