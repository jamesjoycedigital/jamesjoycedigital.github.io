Leopold de Rothschild&apos;s great hope for the Derby in 1896 was his horse, <i>St. Frusquin</i> who entered the race as favourite. But after a close race he was beaten by a neck by the Prince of Wales&apos;s <i>Persimmon</i>. At their next meeting <i>St. Frusquin</i> was the victor; but his nerve failed in training for the St Leger and so there was not to be the eagerly awaited public rematch. In tribute to the horse, Marie, Leopold&apos;s wife, had a silver model cast of him by Faberg&eacute; for Leopold&apos;s 67th birthday. Twelve smaller bronze figures were made for friends. Despite <i>St. Frusquin</i>&apos;s uneven performance, Leopold headed the list of winning owners in 1896, with some &pound;46,766 to his credit. </mm> </dd></dl>
