The units were based on English measure but used a linear perch measuring 7 yards (6.4 m) as opposed to the English rod of 5.5 yards (5.0 m). Thus, linear units such as the furlong and mile, which were defined in terms of perches, were longer by a factor of 14:11 (27 percent more) in Irish measure, while areas such as the rood or acre were larger by 196:121 (62 percent more). After the Act of Union in 1800, Ireland was part of the United Kingdom, whose Parliament passed the Weights and Measures Act (1824) that established English measure in Ireland as &lsquo;Imperial measure&rsquo; or &lsquo;statute measure&rsquo;. Imperial measure soon replaced Irish measure in the use of the Irish Government, but Irish measure persisted in local government, and longer still in private use. </mm> </dd></dl>
