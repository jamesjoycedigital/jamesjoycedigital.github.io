It is commonly held that Thomas Gray began work on what was then called &lsquo;Elegy, Wrote in a Country Church-yard&rsquo; in 1742 and completed it in 1750. It was first published anonymously in February 1751 and was an instant success. The likely setting for the poem is the St. Giles churchyard of the village of Stoke Poges in Buckinghamshire. &lsquo;Elegy&rsquo; established Grey as one of the pre-Romantic &lsquo;Graveyard school&rsquo; along with Oliver Goldsmith, William Cowper, Robert Blair, and Edward Young. </mm> </dd></dl>
