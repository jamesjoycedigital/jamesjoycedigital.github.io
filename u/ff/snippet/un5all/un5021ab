According to Suetonius in the his <cite>Lives of the Twelve Caesars</cite> (121 AD) the emperor Caligula planned to make his horse Incitatus a consul and that the horse would &lsquo;invite&rsquo; dignitaries to dine with him in a house outfitted with servants there to entertain such events. He also wrote that he had a stable of marble, with an ivory manger, purple blankets, and a collar of precious stones. Cassius Dio (155-235 AD) indicated that the horse was attended by servants and was fed oats mixed with gold flake, and that Caligula made the horse a priest. </mm> </dd></dl>
