The new synagogue was Dublin&apos;s fourth, following short-lived synagogues at Crane Lane, off Dame Street; Marlborough Green, off Marlborough Street; and the converted rooms on an upper floor of a private house at 40 Stafford Street, now Wolfe Tone Street. Saint Mary&apos;s Abbey, which gives its name to nearby Abbey Street, was founded by the French Cistercians in 1147 on the site of an older Benedictine foundation. It was dissolved at the Reformation in 1539 and its lands divided. See also <a name="s17031l" href="s17all.htm#s17031l">Sheet 17.031(l)</a>. </mm> </dd></dl>
