For six days we sailed by day and night continually; but when Zeus, son of Cronos, added the seventh day thereto, then <mark>Artemis, the archer, smote the woman</mark> that she fell, as a sea-swallow falls, with a plunge into the hold. And they cast her forth to be the prey of seals and fishes, but I was left stricken at heart. And wind and water bare them and brought them to Ithaca, where <mark>Laertes bought me</mark> with his possessions. And thus it chanced that mine eyes beheld this land. <small> Butcher &amp; Lang, trans. <a name="OHBL2" href="/udra/udex.htm#ohbl2"><cite title="source">The Odyssey Of Homer</cite></a> (1906), 255</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
