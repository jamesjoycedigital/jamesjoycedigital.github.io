This <mark>the swineherd <font color="green">[Eumaeus]</font> had builded by himself</mark> for the swine of his lord who was afar, and his mistress and the old man Laertes knew not of it. With stones from the quarry had he builded it, and coped it with a fence of white thorn, and he had split an oak to the dark core, and without he had driven stakes the whole length thereof on either side, set thick and close; and within the courtyard he made twelve styes hard by one another to be beds for the swine, and in each stye fifty grovelling swine were penned, brood swine; but <mark>the boars slept without</mark>. Now these were far fewer in number, the godlike wooers minishing them at their feasts, for the swineherd ever sent in the best of all the fatted hogs. And their tale was three hundred and threescore. And <mark>by them always slept four dogs</mark>, as fierce as wild beasts, which the swineherd had bred, a master of men. <small> Butcher &amp; Lang, trans. <a name="OHBL2" href="/udra/udex.htm#ohbl2"><cite title="source">The Odyssey Of Homer</cite></a> (1906), 222</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
