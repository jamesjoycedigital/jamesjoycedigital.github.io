And when their hollow ship was now laden to depart, they <mark>sent a messenger</mark> to tell the tidings to the woman. There came a man versed in craft to my father&apos;s house, <mark>with a golden chain</mark> strung here and there with amber beads. Now the maidens in the hall and my lady mother were handling the chain and gazing on it, and <mark>offering him their price</mark>; but he had signed silently to the woman, and therewithal gat him away to the hollow ship. Then she took me by the hand and led me forth from the house. <small> Butcher &amp; Lang, trans. <a name="OHBL2" href="/udra/udex.htm#OHBL2"><cite title="source">The Odyssey Of Homer</cite></a> (1906), 254f</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
