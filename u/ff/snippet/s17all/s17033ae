Thou hast fifty women-servants in thy halls, that we have taught the ways of housewifery, how to card wool and to bear bondage. Of these <mark>twelve in all have gone the way of shame</mark>, and honour not me, nor their lady Penelope. <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> &lsquo;Begin ye now to carry out the dead, and bid the women help you, and thereafter <mark>cleanse the fair high seats and the tables with water and porous sponges</mark>. <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> With that word he tied the cable of a dark-prowed ship to a great pillar and flung it round the vaulted room, and fastened it aloft, that none might touch the ground with her feet. And even as when thrushes, long of wing, or doves fall into a net that is set in a thicket, as they seek to their roostingplace, and a loathly bed harbours them, even so <mark>the women held their heads all in a row, and about all their necks nooses were cast, that they might die by the most pitiful death</mark>. And they writhed with their feet for a little space, but for no long while. <small> Butcher &amp; Lang, trans. <a name="OHBL3" href="/udra/udex.htm#ohbl3"><cite title="source">The Odyssey Of Homer</cite></a> (1906), 372ff</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
