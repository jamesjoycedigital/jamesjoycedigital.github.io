After a time the stopper will be violently expelled from the flask, and if the water is sufficiently heated, a cloud of steam will issue from the mouth of the flask. Work has been done in propelling the cork from the flask, and the only source of this work is the heat which has been applied. <small> Wentworth and Hill, <a name="TBOP" href="/udra/udex.htm#TBOP"><cite title="source">A Text-Book of Physics</cite></a> (1904), 244</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
