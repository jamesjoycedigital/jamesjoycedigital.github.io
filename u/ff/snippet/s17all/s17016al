When a person jumps, the shock to that most delicate organ, the brain, is partly broken by the <mark>elastic arches of the feet, and still farther by the elastic fibers and discs in the body,</mark> so that there is a gradual arrest of the downward movement of the head. Were it not for this, the brain would be ruptured by a very small leap. <small> Wentworth and Hill, <a name="TBOP" href="/udra/udex.htm#tbop"><cite title="source">A Text-Book of Physics</cite></a> (1904), 23</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
