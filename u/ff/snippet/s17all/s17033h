He goes on to pretend he once met an Ithacan - Odysseus - and treated him generously, giving him gifts of gold and silver, a dozen cloaks and as many rugs. Laertes replies that it is indeed Ithaca, but a place now lying under the shadow of anomie, and that that man was his own son, if son he had and had not dreamt him.]</font> <small> Butcher &amp; Lang, trans. <a name="OHBL3" href="/udra/udex.htm#ohbl3"><cite title="source">The Odyssey Of Homer</cite></a> (1906), 396ff</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
