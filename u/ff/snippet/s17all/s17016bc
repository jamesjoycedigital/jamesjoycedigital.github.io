It is a round tower 188 ft. high, built of white marble, with eight circular stories which gradually diminish in diameter from the base towards the top. A plumb line suspended from the top strikes the ground 15 ft. from the base; but the C. G. is so low down that a vertical line through it falls within the base. <small> Wentworth and Hill, <a name="TBOP" href="/udra/udex.htm#TBOP"><cite title="source">A Text-Book of Physics</cite></a> (1904), 47</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
