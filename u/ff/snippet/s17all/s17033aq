Shrouded in night are your heads and your faces and your knees, and kindled is the voice of wailing, and all cheeks are wet with tears, and the walls and the fair main-beams of the roof are sprinkled with blood. And the porch is full, and full is the court, of ghosts that hasten hellwards beneath the gloom, and the sun has perished out of heaven, and an evil mist has overspread the world.&rsquo; <small> Butcher &amp; Lang, trans. <a name="OHBL3" href="/udra/udex.htm#ohbl3"><cite title="source">The Odyssey Of Homer</cite></a> (1906), 341f</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
