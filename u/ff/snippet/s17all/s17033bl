And around it was a thicket of alders that grow by the waters, all circlewise, and down the cold stream fell from a rock on high, and above was reared an altar to the Nymphs, whereat all wayfarers made oflfering. In that place Melanthius, son of Dolius, met them, leading his goats to feast the wooers, the best goats that were in all the herds; and two herdsmen bare him company. <small> Butcher &amp; Lang, trans. <a name="OHBL3" href="/udra/udex.htm#ohbl3"><cite title="source">The Odyssey Of Homer</cite></a> (1906), 281</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
