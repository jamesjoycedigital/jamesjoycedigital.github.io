In order to determine as accurately as possible the tonality of the light of the eclipse, had prepared seven great sheets, each painted boldly in the colors of the spectrum, <mark>violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, red</mark>; and similar series in pieces of silk. These colors were laid at our feet upon the terrace where my wife, as well as Countess de Baume, were watching with me. We then saw the first four disappear successively and entirely and turn black in few seconds, in the following order: violet, indigo, blue, green. The three other colors were considerably attenuated by the darkness, but remained visible. It should be noted that in the normal order of things&mdash;that is, every evening&mdash;the contrary appears; violet remains visible after the red. <small> Camille Flammarion, <a name="CFAA" href="/udra/udex.htm#CFAA"><cite title="source">Astronomy for Amateurs</cite></a> (1904), 278f</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: See also <a name="un4041aq" href="un4all.htm#un4041aq">UN4 (NLI.5A):041(aq)</a> for <cite>UG</cite> 13.1075.</mm> </dd></dl>
