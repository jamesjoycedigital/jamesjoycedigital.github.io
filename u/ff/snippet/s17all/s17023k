It takes about four times as much heat to heat a given mass of water 1&deg; C. as to heat an equal mass of the solid earth. Hence, the ocean acts as a great <mark>moderator</mark> of temperature. During the hot season it absorbs a vast amount of heat without rising much in temperature, and during the winter months it slowly gives up this heat to the land and the air. This explains why maritime countries enjoy a more equable climate than regions situated far from the sea. There are islands in the Pacific Ocean where the temperature does not vary more than 5&deg; or <mark>6&deg;</mark> during the whole year. <small> Wentworth and Hill, <a name="TBOP" href="/udra/udex.htm#TBOP"><cite title="source">A Text-Book of Physics</cite></a> (1904), ? 116</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
