STEPHEN, Protomartyr</mark>, Dec. 26. Nothing is related of S. Stephen beyond what we read in the Acts of the Apostles There is a legend which tells that, 400 years after his death, Gamaliel appeared in a vision to a priest, and revealed to him that he had buried the body of S. Stephen in his own garden, together with that of Nicodemus and other saints. The relics were found, and attested by many miracles, and those of S. Stephen were brought to Rome and deposited in the sepulchre of S. Laurence. <small> E. A.
