BRIDGET, or <mark>BRIDE</mark>, of Ireland, A.D. 500, Feb. 1, was baptized by S. Patrick, and as she grew up devoted herself to good works in the service of God. She was very beautiful, and her father was anxious she should marry a powerful chief, but she utterly refused, retreating for solitude to a grove of oaks once sacred to idol-worship. Here she worked so many miracles that crowds gathered round her, and thus she formed the convent of Kildare, (or &ldquo;place of the oak&rdquo;), which afterwards became so celebrated. <small> E. A.
