GERVASIUS and PROTASIUS</mark>, A.D. 69, June 19, were twin brothers, who suffered martyrdom at Milan at the same time as SS. Nazarus and Celsus, S. Gervasius being beaten to death with loaded scourges, and S. Protasius beheaded. Their bodies had been buried by one of the Christians in his garden, and the site, having been forgotten, the Church of SS. Nabor and Felix had been built over it. Here, 300 years later, S. Ambrose was praying, being at that time filled with the desire to obtain some relics for a new church he had just built, when he had a vision of SS. Peter and Paul, leading two young men clothed in white, and he was told they were the martyrs Gervasius and Protasius, and that their bodies reposed beneath the church. Search having been made, two gigantic bodies were found, with the heads severed, and in the tomb a writing revealing their history. These relics were carried in grand procession, healing all who touched them, to the new church, which was dedicated in the names of SS. Gervasius and Protasius. But later S. Ambrose himself was buried there, and it thenceforward took his name, and is still famous as S. Ambrogio Maggiore. <small> E. A.
