HERMAN-JOSEPH</mark>, A.D. 1236, April 7, was born at Cologne, of very poor parents. Once, while praying before an image of the Blessed Virgin, he longed to make her an offering, and having nothing but an apple, which was all he had for his dinner, he offered that to her in trustful love. This was so pleasing to her, that she took the apple and gave it to the Infant Christ in her arms, and both smiled upon Herman. Herman afterwards entered the Order of the Premonstratesians, and the Blessed Virgin favoured him with many visions, in one of which she put a ring on his finger and called him her espoused, and in consequence of this he received the second name of Joseph. <small> E.
