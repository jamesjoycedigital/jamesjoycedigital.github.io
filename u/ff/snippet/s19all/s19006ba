JOHN NEPOMUC</mark>, A.D. 1393, May 16. Patron saint of silence, and against slander, of bridges and running water, and protector of the Order of the Jesuits. He was confessor to the wife of Wenceslaus IV., Emperor of Germany, a bad and cruel man, who endeavoured to extract from him by bribes and threats the confessions of the Empress. Furious at finding all his endeavours vain, the Emperor threw S. John into a dungeon and tortured him. The Empress, deeply distressed, at length succeeded in obtaining his release, and tended his wounds with her own hands. He returned for a short time to the court, but the Emperor soon repeated his demand, and, mad with rage at the silence of the saint, ordered his guards to throw him from a bridge into the river Moldau. As he sank five stars in the form of a crown appeared over the spot. When the Emperor saw it he fled in terror from his palace to the fortress of Carlstein; but the empress found the body, and buried it with all honour in the Church of the Holy Cross. <small> E. A.
