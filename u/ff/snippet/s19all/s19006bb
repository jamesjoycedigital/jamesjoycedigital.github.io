JULIAN HOSPITATOR</mark>, A.D. 313, Jan. 9, patron saint of travellers, boatmen, and wandering minstrels, was a rich count, who lived in great state, and spent his time in feasting and hunting. One day, after he had pursued a deer for a great distance, it turned and spoke to him, saying, &ldquo;Thou who pursuest me to death shalt cause the death of thy father and mother.&rdquo; Horrified at this prophecy, and hoping to prevent the possibility of its fulfilment, he would not return home, but at once rode away to another country. Here be took service under the king, and greatly distinguished himself. He also married and lived happily, quite forgetting the terrible prophecy. But meantime his parents, distressed at his loss, did not cease to search for him, and at length came to his castle. Julian, was absent at the time, but his wife, hearing who they were, gave them welcome and put them in her own chamber to rest. When he returned he went straight to his chamber, and, not recognizing his parents at once, by a fatal mistake slew them both in a fit of rage. When he learnt what he had done he was stupefied with horror, but at length, rousing himself, determined to spend the rest of his life in devotion to God&apos;s service, that so he might be forgiven his fearful sin. He and his wife left that country, and established themselves in a cell near a great river, which was so often swollen by mountain torrents that many were drowned in endeavouring to cross it. Here he founded a hospital, and occupied himself with tending the sick and taking all who asked him across the river. One night, while a storm was raging, he heard a voice calling to him, and going out he found a leprous youth lying on the opposite shore. Julian ferried him across, and, as he seemed almost dying from cold and exhaustion, laid him on his own bed and watched him tenderly. Just as morning dawned a light shone from the leper&apos;s face, and he rose up, saying, &ldquo;Julian, the Lord hath sent me to thee, for thy penitence is accepted, and thy rest is at hand&rdquo;, and then vanished from their sight. Julian and his wife fell down and praised God for His mercy, and soon afterwards they both died peacefully. <small> E. A.
