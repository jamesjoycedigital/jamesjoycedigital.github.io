PHOCAS</mark>, A.D. 303, July 3. Patron saint of gardens and gardeners, lived outside the gate of the city <mark>of Sinope</mark>, in Pontus, and supported himself on the produce of his garden, giving all beyond absolute necessities to the poor, and entertaining all homeless travellers who came to him. One night two strangers asked for admittance, and he received them most hospitably, setting before them the best he could provide. Then they told him that they were in search of a certain Phocas, who had been denounced as a Christian, and that wherever they found him they were to put him to death. Phocas said nothing, but having shown them their bedchamber, went out and dug a grave among the flowers in his garden. The next morning he told his guests that he was the Phocas they sought. At first they recoiled from shedding the blood of their host; but when he declared himself ready and willing to die for God, they beheaded him on the edge of the grave he had himself dug, and buried him there. <small> E.
