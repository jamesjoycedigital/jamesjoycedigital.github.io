The root &ldquo;M&rdquo; with its sense of finality would suggest &ldquo;Mi&rdquo; to diminish, and as to measure a thing is to go to its ends, &ldquo;<mark>Ma</mark>&rdquo; would also mean to measure, and as to think a thing is to measure it, &ldquo;Ma&rdquo; would also come to be associated with thinking. <small> A.
