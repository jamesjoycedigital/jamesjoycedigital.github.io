THOMAS AQUINAS</mark>, A.D. 1274, March 7. This saint, known as the &ldquo;Angelical Doctor,&rdquo; was born in Calabria, of a noble family, and was related to many of the crowned heads of Europe. He was early noted for his piety, and gentleness and sweetness of temper, and when only seventeen entered the Dominican Order at Naples. His family were so enraged at this step that they seized and carried him home; but his resolution was not to be moved, and he converted his two sisters, who helped him to escape. He returned at once to his convent, where he concealed his great learning from a sense of humility, so that it was long unsuspected, and he was even nicknamed &ldquo;Bos,&rdquo; the ox, for his apparent dulness. However, he gradually gained a reputation, which steadily increased, and he became the greatest theologian of his age. Various high offices were offered him, but he refused them all. He died at the Cistercian convent of Fossa-Nova, spending his last strength in an effort to finish his Commentary on the Song of Solomon. His theological works are very numerous, and of great value. <small> E. A.
