IVES, or Yvo of Bretagne</mark>, A.D. 1303, May 19, patron saint of lawyers, was of a noble Breton family, and from a child evinced a saintly disposition. He studied the law in Paris, living as strictly as a hermit, and devoting much of his time to prayer and charity. On his return to Brittany the Bishop of Treguier appointed him judge advocate of his diocese. He pleaded for widows and orphans gratuitously, and often reconciled enemies by his exhortations, and prevented their appealing to the law. At length he became a priest, but still used his legal knowledge for the aid of the poor and ignorant. The fatigue of his many good works and self-mortification finally so wore him out that he died. <small> E. A.
