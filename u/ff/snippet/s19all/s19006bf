ROSA DI LIMA</mark>, A.D. 1617, Aug. 30, was born in Peru, and from her earliest years showed a disposition to asceticism. When obliged to wear a wreath of roses, she arranged it so that the thorns should pierce her, and destroyed her beauty with quicklime to discourage her numerous suitors. She toiled night and day to support her parents, chiefly working with her needle. She became a member of the Third Order of S. Dominic, and died at the age of thirty. <small> E. A.
