FELIX DE CANTALICE</mark>, A.D. 1587, May 8, was born in Umbria of very poor parents. Having entered a Capuchin monastery, he was afterwards sent to the Capuccini at Rome, where he was appointed to beg for the daily food of the brotherhood. There had never before been known such plenty as he brought in; and it is related that when he was begging one stormy night, a radiant child met him, who gave him a loaf of bread, and blessing him vanished. S. Felix spent forty-five years at the Capuccini, where his life was an example of devotion and self-denial. He was the first saint of the Capuchin order. <small> E. A.
