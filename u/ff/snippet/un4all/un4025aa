Woman must be obedient, but not servile, to her husband. In one place he makes an amusing attempt to find a ground for the restriction of her work and education. She is more fitted for bodily work, he says, because &ldquo;remember that <mark>God took a rib out of Adam&apos;s body</mark>, not a part of his soul, <mark>to make her</mark>&rdquo;. And when he is asked why she must veil herself in the churches, while her husband does not, he answers, because &ldquo;<mark>she was not made to the image of God</mark>, like man&rdquo;. <small> Joseph McCabe, <a name="JMRW1" href="/udra/udex.htm#jmrw1"><cite title="source">The Religion of Woman</cite></a> (1905), 31</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
