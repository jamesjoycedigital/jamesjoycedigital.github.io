Indeed, it is no exaggeration to say that he is one of the most respected and admired of all the young school of Italian writers, and yet there are passages in the book now under discussion coarser and more vulgar than any in the &ldquo;Satyricon.&rdquo; Despite this it is not a circumstance to the recent book of a seventeen-year-old girl of Rome, <mark>Margherita Emplosi Gherardi</mark>, entitled &ldquo;<mark>Il Nudo nelle Anime</mark>.&rdquo; It is dedicated to all those who deny that the youthful mind has not the capacity, discernment, liberty, and daring to envisage and interpret the painful mysteries of the human soul. There are few things more disgusting in literature, &ldquo;Gamiana&rdquo; excluded, than the sketch entitled &ldquo;The Impure Hour,&rdquo; for women only. <small> Joseph Collins, <a name="JCII" href="/udra/udex.htm#jcii"><cite title="source">Idling in Italy</cite></a> (1920), 79</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: Margherita Emplosi Gherardi, <cite>Il nudo nelle anime: impressioni sceniche</cite> (Roma: P.
