Of Sicilian origin, he was born in Tuscany and has lived in various parts of central Europe. He first came to conspicuous notice through his articles in <cite>Les Soir&eacute;es de Paris</cite>. To the average reader he is known as a traveller and a narrator of his observations and experiences in the form of comments and short stories. Latterly, however, he has published a queer book entitled &ldquo;<mark>Hermaphrodito</mark>,&rdquo; which is difficult briefly to characterize without doing it injustice. It is a book that a clever man might write in the early stages of delirium tremens, providing he returned to it after recovery and added the chapters &ldquo;Isabella Hasson&rdquo; and &ldquo;La Partenza dell&apos; Argonauti.&rdquo; In the latter especially he shows himself capable of writing temperate, vivacious, robust prose, of making inviting descriptions of places, and of revealing man&apos;s conduct and his motives. <small> Joseph Collins, <a name="JCII" href="/udra/udex.htm#jcii"><cite title="source">Idling in Italy</cite></a> (1920), 82</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: Alberto Savinio (Andrea de Chirico), <cite>Hermaphrodito</cite> (Firenze: Libreria della Voce, 1918), a novel. </mm> </dd></dl>
