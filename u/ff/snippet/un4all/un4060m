There is scarcely any diversion more engrossing than reading about others&apos; infirmities unless it be relating one&apos;s own. Hence the continued popularity of Pepys, Amiel, Rousseau, Marie Bashkirsteff, and other garrulous sufferers. But it is a book that no one can be the better or happier for reading, and it does Gauguin&apos;s memory an injury because it parodies it. His life as it has been revealed to us was bizarre and irregular enough. We could wish that he had been less like Rimbaud and more like Rodin, but, distressing as his behavior was, seen in conventional light, we should like not to have seen it featured in fiction. <p><mark>Mr. Maugham</mark> wrote a novel, &ldquo;Out of Human Bondage,&rdquo; which is a far more meritorious piece of work than &ldquo;The Moon and Sixpence,&rdquo; in which some of his professional colleagues&mdash;he is a physician&mdash;recognized portraitures. Perhaps it was his success with them that encouraged him to try a larger canvas.</p> <small> Joseph Collins, <a name="JCII" href="/udra/udex.htm#jcii"><cite title="source">Idling in Italy</cite></a> (1920), 156f</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: William Somerset Maugham (1874-1965), <cite>The Moon and Sixpence</cite> (London: Heinemann, 1919). </mm> </dd></dl>
