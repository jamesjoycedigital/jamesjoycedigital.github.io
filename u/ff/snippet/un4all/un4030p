The conclusion is as follows:&mdash; &ldquo;Although Messrs J. and P. Coats&apos; profit&mdash;based upon the company&apos;s figures of actual costs of production at February 4, 1920&mdash;of 3.204 pence per reel on the 10d reel of the company&apos;s six cord 400 yards blue ticket sewing cotton may appear unreasonably high, yet we recognise that Messrs Coats have, up to the present, had to face a continuously rising market, both for cotton and for yarn, and accordingly to average their costs. If, therefore, Messrs Coats have raised the retail selling price to 10d <mark>with the intention of not further increasing</mark> it until the average cost of their entire holding of yarn has very considerably risen, we are of the opinion that-the present retail price of 10d per reel is not unreasonable.&rdquo; <small> {s}ECaug20{/s}[ECaug20] 137</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
