In all the time of my stay I have not heard a single gun, except at sunrise and sunset, and at half-past nine o&apos;clock for the soldiers to return to their barracks. There has not been even a salute, for, although there is on <mark>the Alameda</mark> a saluting battery, composed of <mark>Russian guns</mark> taken in the Crimean War, yet it is less often used than might be supposed, for the ships of war that come here are for the most part English (the French and Spaniards would hardly find the associations agreeable), and these are not saluted since they are <i>at home</i>, as much as if they were entering Portsmouth. <small> Henry M.
