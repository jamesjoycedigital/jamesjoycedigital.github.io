Then <mark>let the divine minstrel, with his loud lyre in hand, lead off for us the measure of the mirthful dance</mark>. So shall any man that hears the sound from without, whether a wayfarer or one of those that dwell around, say that it is a wedding feast. And thus the slaughter of the wooers shall not be noised abroad through the town before we go forth to our well-wooded farmland. Thereafter shall we consider what gainful counsel the Olympian may vouchsafe us.&rsquo; <small> Butcher &amp; Lang, trans. <a name="OHBL4" href="/udra/udex.htm#OHBL4"><cite title="source">The Odyssey Of Homer</cite></a> (1906), 380</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
