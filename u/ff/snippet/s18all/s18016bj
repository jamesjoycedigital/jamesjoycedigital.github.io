Length, 32.65 feet. Length of bore, 30.25 feet. Diameter of bore, 17.72 inches. Length of charge of powder, 5 feet. Weight of charge, 450 pounds. Weight of shot, <mark>2,000</mark> pounds. Velocity at the muzzle, 1,548 feet per second. At such velocity, a ball of such weight would have a &ldquo;smashing effect&rdquo; of 33.230 &ldquo;foot-tons,&rdquo; and would penetrate 24.9 inches of wrought iron. Range, when fired at the highest elevation, over 8 miles. <p>But these are not the whole of its defences they are only the beginning. There are batteries in the rear of the town, as well as in front, that can be fired over the tops of the houses, so that, if an enemy were to effect a landing he would have to fight his way at every step. As you climb the Rock, it fairly bristles with guns. You cannot turn to the right or the left without seeing these open-mouthed monsters, and looking into their murderous throats. Everywhere it is nothing but <mark>guns, guns, guns</mark>! There are guns over your head and under your feet</p> <small> Henry M.
