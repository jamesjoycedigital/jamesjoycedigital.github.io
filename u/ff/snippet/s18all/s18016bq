Here Spaniards and Moors, who fought for Gibraltar a thousand years ago, are at peace and good friends, at least so far as to be willing to cheat each other as readily as if they were of the same religion. Here are long-bearded Jews in their gabardines; and Turks with their baggy trousers, taking up more space than is allowed to Christian legs; with a mongrel race from the Eastern part of the Mediterranean, known as Levantines; and another like unto them, the Maltese; and a choice variety of <mark>natives of Gibraltar, called &ldquo;Rock scorpions,&rdquo;</mark> with Africans blacker than Moors, who have perhaps crossed the desert, and hail from Timbuctoo. All these make a Babel of races and languages, as they jostle each other in these narrow and crowded streets, and bargain with each other, and, I am afraid, sometimes swear at each other, in all the languages of the East. <small> Henry M. Field, <a name="HMFG" href="/udra/udex.htm#hmfg"><cite title="source">Gibralter</cite></a> (1888), p 33f</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
