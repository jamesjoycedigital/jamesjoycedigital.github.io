You are standing on the very top of one of the <mark>Pillars of Hercules</mark>, the ancient Calpe, and in full view of the other, on the African coast, where, above the present town of Ceuta, whose white walls glisten in the sun, rises the ancient <mark>Abyla</mark>, the Mount of God. These are the two Pillars which to the ancient navigators set bounds to the habitable world. <small> Henry M.
