<p class="duup">A RURAL LIBRARY.</p>
<p>   We have been asked, in connection with the
<br>successful efforts which Cumann na nGaedheal
<br>is making to procure the adoption of the Public
<br>Libraries' Act in the Rural Districts, to publish
<br>a list of books suitable for such libraries.
<br>Nearly three years ago such a list, compiled by
<br>William Rooney, appeared in our columns, and
<br>with a few emendations and a number of
<br>additions we reprint it below. It must be
<br>understood that this list does not profess to be
<br>the ideal list. We have borne in mind the
<br>circumstances, financial and otherwise, under
<br>which these libraries will at first be obliged to
<br>work. There are scores of books which we
<br>would wish to see in such libraries, but which,
<br>owing to financia1 or other reasons, it is impossible
<br>to expect could be at the start found in
<br>them. A few of the books we recommend,
<br>such as Mitford's History of Greece and Mommsen's
<br>Rome are expensive. Others are out of
<br>print, but may easily be procured through the
<br>second-hand booksellers in Dublin. The list
<br>we give below is a list of books written in
<br>English. In our next issue we shall give a list
<br>of books written in Irish.</p>
