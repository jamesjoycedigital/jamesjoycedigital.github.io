<p class="spbr"><h4>1903</h4> </p>

<p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="8Feb1903"><font color="red">8 February 1903</font>, <cite>Letters II</cite> (JJ to Stanislaus Joyce): Grand Hotel Corneille, Paris.
<br>Dear Stannie [&hellip;] I am feeling very intellectual these times and up to my eyes in Aristotle's Psychology. [&hellip;] Words cannot measure my contempt for AE at present (I believe he didn't write to Lady Gregory) and his spiritual friends. I did well however to leave my MSS with him for I had a motive. However I shall take them back as my latest additions to &lsquo;Epiphany&rsquo; might not be to his liking.</div></p>

<p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="9Mar1903"><font color="red">9 March 1903</font>, <cite>Letters II</cite> (JJ to Stanislaus Joyce): Grand Hotel Corneille, Paris.
<br>Dear Stannie [&hellip;] I have written fifteen epiphanies&mdash;of which twelve are insertions and three additions.
[&hellip;] thanks be to God Synge isn't an Aristotelian. I told him part of my esthetic: he says I have a mind like Spinosa.</div></p>

<p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="20Mar1903"><font color="red">20 March 1903</font>, <cite>Letters II</cite> (JJ to Mrs John Stanislaus Joyce): Grand Hotel Corneille, Paris.
<br>Dear Mother I read every day in the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale and every night in the Biblioth&egrave;que Sainte-Genevi&egrave;ve. I often go to vespers at Notre Dame or at Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois. I never go to the theatre&mdash;as I have no money. I have no money either to buy books. Synge was over here selling out and gave me his play to read&mdash;a play which is to be produced by the Irish Literary Theatre. I criticized it. Synge says I have a mind like Spinoza! (Spinoza was great Hebrew philosopher): I am at present up to the neck in Aristotle’s
Metaphysics and read only him and Ben Jonson (a writer of songs and
plays).</div></p>

<p class="spbr"><h4>1904</h4> </p>

<p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="23Jun1904"><font color="red">23 June 1904</font>, <cite>Selected Letters</cite> 22 (JJ to C.P. Curran): Dublin.
<br>Here is the marvellous novel [possibly Chapters I-X] delivered upon you by my twenty-third sister. [&hellip;] If you are too busy to read the novel now, no harm. But as soon as you have read it send me word to meet you on some altitude where we can utter our souls unmolested. [&hellip;] Yours heroically. Stephen Daedalus</div></p>

<p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="?15Jul1904"><font color="red">The Rain, Friday [?15 July 1904]</font>, <cite>Selected Letters</cite> 22 (JJ to C.P. Curran): Dublin.
<br>I have finished the awful chapter&mdash;102 pages&mdash; [possibly Chapter XI) and Russell (A.E.) has the book now. I shall send you the chapter in a week. I am writing a series of epiclets&mdash;ten&mdash;for a paper. I have written one. I call the series <cite>Dubliners</cite> to betray the soul of that hemiplegia or paralysis which many consider a city. [&mdash;] S.D.</div></p>

<p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="29Aug1904"><font color="red">29 August 1904</font>, <cite>Letters II</cite> (JJ to Nora Barnacle): 60 Shelbourne Road, Dublin.
<br>My dear Nora [&hellip;] While I stood there I thought of a few sentences I wrote some years ago when I lived in Paris&mdash;these sentences which follow&mdash;&lsquo;They pass in twos and threes amid the life of the boulevard, walking like people who have leisure in a place lit up for them. They are in the pastry cook's, chattering, crushing little fabrics of pastry, or seated silently at tables by the caf&eacute; door, or descending from carriages with a busy stir of garments soft as the voice of the adulterer. They pass in an air of perfumes: under the perfumes their bodies have a warm humid smell&rsquo;&mdash;</div></p>

<p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="15Sep1904"><font color="red">15 September 1904</font>, <cite>Selected Letters</cite> 29 (JJ to James S. Starkey): 7 S. Peter's Terrace, Cabra, Dublin.
<br>Dear Starkey My trunk will be called for at the Tower tomorrow (Saturday) between 9 and 12. Kindly put into it&mdash;a pair of black boots, a pair of brown boots, a blue peaked cap, a black cloth cap, a black felt hat, a raincoat and the MS of my verses [<cite>Chamber Music</cite>] which are in a roll on the shelf to the right as you enter. Also see that your host [Oliver St. John Gogarty, the model for Buck Mulligan] has not abstracted the twelfth chapter [Chapter XII] of my novel [<cite>Stephen Hero</cite>] from my trunk. May I ask you to see that any letters coming to the Tower for me are redirected to my address at once? Please rope the trunk as it has no lock.</div></p>

<p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="20Oct1904"><font color="red">20 October 1904</font>, <cite>Letters II</cite> 67 (JJ to Stanislaus Joyce): Berlitz School of Langauages, Via S Nicola 32, Trieste.
<br>[&hellip;] also no [copy] of Irish Homestead containing my &lsquo;After the Race&rsquo;. I am writing another &lsquo;Xmas Eve&rsquo;. Have finished Chap. XII [of <cite>Stephen Hero</cite>].</div></p>

<p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="31Oct1904"><font color="red">31 October 1904</font>, <cite>Letters II</cite> 68-9 (JJ to Stanislaus Joyce): Via Giulia 2, s. piano, Pola, Austria.
<br>I have finished (in Z&uuml;rich) chap. XII [of <cite>Stephen Hero</cite>] and have written part of a new story &lsquo;Christmas Eve&rsquo; [JJ never completed this story]</cite>].</div></p>

<p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="19Nov1904"><font color="red">19 November 1904</font>, <cite>Letters II</cite> 71 (JJ to Stanislaus Joyce): Via Giulia 2, Pola, Austria.
<br>I have not written much of my novel&mdash;only the end of the 11th [12th] chapter in Z&uuml;rich. I have written about half of &lsquo;Xmas Eve&rsquo; and  about five long pages of &lsquo;Esthetic Philosophy&rsquo;. [&hellip;] I am afraid I cannot finish my novel for a long time. I am discontented with a great deal of it and yet how is Stephen’s nature to be expressed otherwise. Eh?
</div></p>

<br>I send you the fourth story of &lsquo;Dubliners&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Hallow Eve&rsquo;&mdash;which I want you to offer at once to the Editor of Irish Homestead.[&hellip;] You know I have no-one to talk to. Nora, of course, doesn't give a rambling damn about art [&hellip;] when she saw me copy Epiphanies into my novel [<cite>Stephen Hero</cite>] she asked would all that paper be wasted&mdash;which made me think of Heine. She wants me to hurry up the novel and get rich and go to live in Paris. Paris and Zurich she likes very much but Pola is a queer old place.</div></p>

<br>Your criticism of my novel is always interesting. The sentence &lsquo;to sustain in person &amp;c&rsquo; is not legitimate if the phrase, &lsquo;and to protect thereby&rsquo; is between commas but is legitimate if the phrase is in brackets [neither phrase is in the surviving manuscript of <cite>Stephen Hero</cite>]. I shall change the verb however. Mrs Riordan who has left the house in Bray returns you have forgotten, to the Xmas dinner-table in Dublin. The immateriality of Isabel is intended. The effect of the prose piece [partly at begining of extant manuscript: Chapter XIV]  &lsquo;The spell of arms&rsquo; is to mark the precise point between boyhood (pueritia) and adolescence (adulescentia)&mdash;17 years. Is it possible you remark no change? Again, no old toothless Irishman would say &lsquo;Divil an elephant&rsquo;: he would say &lsquo;divil elephant&rsquo; [page 488 of extant manuscript]. Nora says &lsquo;Divil up I’ll get till you come back&rsquo;. Naif sequence! Your criticism of two aposopeias [aposiopesis: a figure in which the speaker suddenly halts in his utterance] is quite just but I think full dress is not always necessary. Stephen’s change of mind is not effected by that sight as you seem to think, but it is that small event so regarded which expresses the change. His first skin falls. Fulham [page 479 of extant manuscript] is not old Sheehy&mdash;he comes in later.
[&hellip;] I intend to dedicate &lsquo;Dubliners&rsquo; to you&mdash;do you mind?&mdash;because you seem to find the stories to your taste. [&hellip;] I am &lsquo;working in&rsquo; Hairy Jaysus [Skeffington: &lsquo;McCann&rsquo; in Chapter XVI] at present. Do you think the search for heroics damn vulgar&mdash;and yet how are we to describe Ibsen? I have written some fine critical sentences lately [in Chapters XV and XVI]. [&hellip;] I have finished Chap XV and Chap XVI and am now at Chap XVII. [&hellip;] I am sure however that the whole structure of heroism is, and always was, a damned lie and that there cannot be any substitute for of all I the individual passion as the motive power of everything&mdash;art anf =d philosophy included. For this reason Hairy Jaysusseems to be the bloodiest imposter of all I have met.</div></p>

<br>It seems to me that what astonishes most people in the length of the novel is the extraordinary energy in the writer and his extraordinary patience. It would be easy for me to do short novels if I chose but what I want to wear away in this novel cannot be worn away except by constant dropping. Gogarty used to pipe &lsquo;63&rsquo; in treble when I told him the number of the chapters. I am not quite satisfied with the title &lsquo;Stephen Hero&rsquo; and am thinking of restoring the original title of the article &lsquo;A Portrait of the Artist&rsquo; or perhaps better &lsquo;Chapters in the Life of a Young Man&rsquo;. [&hellip;] I have come to accept my present situation as a voluntary exile&mdash;is it not so? This seems to me important both because I am likely to generate out of it a sufficiently personal future to satisfy Curran’s heart and also because it supplies me with the note on which I propose to bring my novel to a close.</div></p>

<br>I have finished Chapters XV. XVI. XVII. XVIII and will send them if you like. The U. College episode will take about ten chapters and I thought of keeping all till it was ended. On the other hand that is a hell of a time for you to wait. I have received your letter which interested me very much but if you knew what the feuilletons and short sketches in French papers [are] you would understand my embarrassment. [SJ perhaps wrote suggesting JJ translate some of the Dubliners stories for the French press.] Is Starkey's book any good?

[&hellip;] You will remember the circumstances in which I left Dublin nine months ago. Like everything else that I have done in my life it was an experiment. I can hardly say with truth that it was an experiment which has failed seeing that in those nine months I have begotten a child, written 500 pages of my novel, written 3 of my stories, learned German and Danish fairly well, besides discharging the intolerable (to me) duties of my position and swindling two tailors. I believe, besides, that I write much better now than when I was in Dublin and the incident in Chap. XXIII(?)

<br><i>After the Race</i>&mdash;Are the police supplied with provisians by government or by privste contrsctd?
<p>Kindly answer these questions as quickly as possible. I sent mmy story <i>The Clay</i> (which I had slightky rewritten) to The LITERARY World
[Hellip;] I wrote to Heinemann telling him about <i>Dubliners</i> and asking him would he read it and consider it. I shall send you on  Wednesday or Thursday the tenth story <i>A Mother</i> and the book will be finished by the first of November. You might let me know what you think of it as I intend to dedicate it to you. You are a long time sitting on my novel. I wish you’d say what you think of it. The only book I know like it is Lermontoff’s <i>Hero of Our Days</i>. Of course mine is much longer and Lermontoff’s hero is an aristocrat and a tired man and a brave animal.

<br>Where is the MS of my novel? It is most thoughtless of Curran to give it to anyone without my permission. I did not send it to Dublin to have it circulated from hand to hand. I added Curran’s name to yours and Cosgrave’s because he treated me very kindly. I must pass a week of torture until I know whether it is safe or not. You must get it from Kettle <i>at once</i> and send it to me safely registered. Kettle, of course, is a decent kind of a fellow but some of these impostors might wheedle it from him. He is too polite to suspect treachery. Have you any idea what I suffer from all this incertitude? Send me <i>A Mother</i> back.</div></p>

<br>I'm afraid you're becoming irascible, but here's some answers to your questions:
<br>A priesr is buried in a habit if he belongs to an order which wears a habit. Otherwise so far as I can find out he is buried in his vestments: I cannot find out for certain if there is any canonical law on the point. Fr O'Malley, who had his parish taken from him was buried in his vestments.
<br>A Municipal Election <i>might</i> take place in October but it is highly improbable. It would be a bye-electioj (for instance if a councillor or alderman died or resigned) and according to the general rule if it occurred so late would be held over till January. Aungier St is in Royal Exchange Ward.
<br>The City Ambulance would be called out to Sydney Parade at the time id supposed to have occurred *The Pembrojke Ambulance from Ballsbridge would go now) but in all proability the body would have been sent in on the tram. I know a man who was injured at Raheny Junction was sent in to Jervis St on the tram.
<p>It seems to me that your book &lsquo;Dubliners&rsquo; is becoming almost as important as your novel. [Follows with extended commentary on the stories.] [&hellip;] I have read Renan's monogram [sic] on Jesus Christ. [&hellip;]
Your postcard received. I have been all day copying out your story to send it back. I thought I told you that as soon as Charlie told me Curran had lent your MS. I dressed and went down to Kettle’s office. I called four times there and once at Curran’s house. I got your MS. back next morning at ten. I said to Curran and to Kettle precisely what is in your postcard. Kettle said I was quite right but that your MS. would be safe in his hands. Curran said he was very sorry but I think he thought I needn’t have made a fuss about it.</p></div></p>

<br>I am obliged to you for your letter and copy of the contract. If <i>Dubliners</i> cannot be published in May I should prefer September. I shall send you in a week or so the last story which is to be inserted between <i>The Boarding House</i> and <i>Counterparts</i> so that you may proceed with the printing of the book. [&hellip;]
You suggest that I should write a novel in some sense autobiographical. I have already written nearly a thousand pages of such a novel, as I think I told you, 914 pages to be accurate. I calculate that these twenty-five chapters, about half of the book, run to 150,000 words. But it is quite impossible for me in present circumstances to think the rest of the book, much less to write it. This novel also has the defect of being about Ireland.
<p>I shall be glad to hear from you again when you have decided in what form you will bring out <i>Dubliners</i>.</p></div></p>

<br>Finally, one word as to my novel I am not in a fit state of mind to complete it. For two years I have been living in hope and now that I see that these two years of waiting and hoping have availed me nothing it is really too much to expect that I should put my two completed books on one side and continue to write the third: and then to wait and hope again. For I am sure we should have the same objections and the same letters. It is true that I stand in need of a publisher, but the publisher I need must at least be prepared to risk something for what he esteems highly and in the meantime I am glad that my position, modest though it be, enables me to save my work from mutilation and my talent from corruption.</div></p>

<br>As for O.G. I am waiting for the <i>S.F.</i> [Sinn Fein] policy to make headway in the hope that he will join it, for no doubt whatever exists in my mind but that, if he gets the chance and the moment comes, he will play the part of [betrayers] MacNally and Reynolds. I do not say this out of spleen. It is my final view of his character: a very native Irish growth, and if I begin to write my novel again it is in this way I shall treat them. It is not far-fetched to say that my action, and that of men like Ibsen &amp;c, is a virtual intellectual strike. I would call such people as Gogarty and Yeats and Colm the blacklegs of literature. Because they have tried to substitute us, to serve the old idols at a lower rate when we refused to do so for a higher.</div></p>

some tolerable quarters will take up some of my time and may delay for a

however, that you print the <i>whole first episode in one number</i> and the
second in the next. I confirm my postcard and repeat here the
corrections on the typescript which I beg you to forward at once to the

as soon as convenient. I may add that my book <cite>Ulysses</cite> takes place on 16
June 1904 in Dublin but I should like to open the chapter I am writing with
an allusion to your theory &mdash; which I must therefore antedate.</div></p>
<p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="28Nov1918"><font color="red">28 November 1918</font>, <cite>JJQ</cite> (Carl Bleibtreu to JJ): I am afraid I have little interest in
this terrible time for details of that controversy. Yet occasionally I wrote
something this summer about the sonnets in behalf of Oscar Wilde&apos;s theory.
Your first question I do not understand. No, not before June 1904. 2) I do
not know. The family Estates are mostly in Warwickshire, at the time of Lord
Roger there was even a countie of Rutland. 3) The Sonnets allude to no man
whatever, but to Shakespeare&apos;s own genius &mdash; the power of conseption [sic]
&mdash;, separated from the Muse &mdash; the power of technical construction &mdash;
personated by the Black Lady, wayward and fickle, as the Muse is, we poets know
her ladyship. All that rumour about Mary Fulton is trash, she was fair (not
&lsquo;black&rsquo;) and the love-passage between her and Lord Pembroke has nothing to
do with the symbolism of the Sonnets. Only there is a possibility and
probablility that Shakepeare&apos;s ever plastic and creative imagination took
some personal observations from active life as a colouring of his
allegorical composition. This would be in accordance with his dramatical
instinct. 4) Mr W.H. is Mr. William Herbert (Lord Pembroke), the cousin of
Rutland and afterwards executor of his intellectual will (Folio). Apparently
he had a manuscript-copy of the Sonnets, as afterwards of many unknown plays
in the Folio, and gave them to the editor Thorpe with the obligation to
publish them <cite>anonymously</cite>, perhaps with the permission of Rutland or
perhaps not. Thus he, W.H., is the &lsquo;begetter&rsquo;, by whom Thorpe <i>got it</i>.
Considering that most of the Sonnets were written in the Tower, as I think
certain (&lsquo;When in disgrace with fortune and men&apos;s eyes I all alone beweep my
outcast state &hellip;&rsquo; &lsquo;Thus comes it, that my name does bear a brand&rsquo;), most
things clear up, otherwise unintelligible. And the allusion &lsquo;from hence your
memory death cannot take, although in me each part shall be forgotten&rsquo;
&lsquo;my name entombed with my body be&rsquo; (I quote from memory, this last verse is
not verbal) or the grandiloquent prophecy of eternal immortality for the
adored &lsquo;lover&rsquo; (lover means in antique English &lsquo;admirer&rsquo; or admired one)
till &lsquo;all the breathers of this world are dead&rsquo; &lsquo;even in the eyes of all
posterity, which wears the world out to the ending doom&rsquo; &lsquo;till the day of
judgement shall arise, you still shall live and love in lovers eyes&rsquo; is so
distinct as possible: the adored one is no mortal, to whom such promise of
eternal fame would be ridiculous. How could he get fame at all, if even the
name of this mystical personage is never revealed? (Except &lsquo;Hughes&rsquo; in
Wilde&apos;s absurdity.) But of course there is no need for that, for the name is
exactly that name all the world knows: Shakespeare, the nom de guerre of His
own genius. And from that name he, the <i>person</i> of The Poet, is entirely
<i>separated</i> and will be buried <i>without</i> this his real name of his
immortal self &mdash; he will be buried as the simple Lord Rutland, not under the
name of the greatest mortal that ever lived. &lsquo;My name entombed with my body
be.&rsquo; Now the Sonnets are the only inheritance we have of Shakespeares real
personal life, a sort of lyrical and mystical (not mystifying) diary, and it
is most significant that the Baconians evade any touch with the Sonnets like
poison, because here is absolutely nothing in them which would not be in
absolute contradction to Bacons life. It is quite the same with the life of
the Stratford vulgarian, and the only allusion which the Stratford scholars
grasp: &lsquo;my name bears a brand&rsquo; as a stage-player, is downright nonsence [sic],
because we know the good position of actors like Burbridge and others &mdash;
whereas it is as clear as daylight for a person condemned to
lifelong imprisonment for <i>high-treason</i>. 5) This is not part of my theory,
because it is only a suggestion, first emanated by an American Baconian.
But it is possible; then I should think Pembroke or Ben Jonson did it. 6)
I do not understand, you must have mis-read. 7) In summer 1904 I was
undoubtedly in Berlin and was nearly every day in the Caf&eacute; Kaiserhof, the
centre of chess=players and visited by many literary people. 9) The monthly
of the New Jersey Shakesperian [sic] Society, which has send [sic] me one
[or] two numbers, contained the statement, that Sid. Lee was Simon Lazarus,
clothed in the ironical question, why other people as Shakespeare had

because I have ridiculed very often his collossal [sic] ignorance in quoting
Marlowes [sic] &lsquo;Faustus&rsquo; about Hamlets [sic] &lsquo;Wittenberg&rsquo;. (The academical
scholar Marlowe did not know Wittenberg, he spells it Wirtenberg, Wortenberg,
Wartenberg, only the last edition long after his death spells rightly
Wittenberg, corrected after Hamlet &mdash; but the ignorant Stratford comedian
should have known this German university, known it too as the university
where all Danish and Swedish noblemen studied &mdash; especially Rosencrans and
Gyldenstjerne!) &hellip; I  have read once a rather mediocre, but well-intentioned
essay of Dowden about Othello, but the way of his polemics in
defence of the Stratford clown is worthy even of Sidney Lee. You must have
forgotten my book, for I mention there Dowden often enough. </div></p>

music beyond which Ulysses travels. I understand that you may begin to
regard the various styles of the episodes with dismay and prefer the initial
style much as the wanderer did who longs for the rock of Ithaca. But in the

then by way of earliest English alliterative and monosyllabic and
Anglo-Saxon (&lsquo;Before born the babe had bliss. Within the womb he won worship.&rsquo;

Landor-Pater-Newman until it ends in a frightful jumble of Pidgin English,
nigger English, Cockney, Irish, Bowery slang and broken doggerel. This
progression is also linked back at each part subtly with some foregoing
episode of the day and, besides this, with the natural stages of development
in the embryo and the periods of faunal evolution in general. The
double-thudding
Saxon motive recurs from time to time (&lsquo;Loth to move from Horne&apos;s

the hospital the womb, the nurse the ovum, Stephen the embryo.

anything in that line will be useful. I am sorry you do not think your ideas
on <cite>Circe</cite> worth sending. As I told you  a catchword is enough to set me
off. <i>Moly</i> is a tough nut to crack.
My latest is this. Moly is the gift of Hermes, god of public ways, and is
the invisible influence (prayer, chance, agility, <i>presence of mind</i>,
power of recuperation) which saves in case of accident. This would cover
immunity from syphilis (&sigma;&#973; &phi;&iota;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf; = swine-love?). Hermes is the god of
signposts: i,e, he is, specially for a traveller like Ulysses, the points at
which roads parallel merge and roads contrary also. He is an accident of
providence. In this special case his plant may be said to have many leaves,
indifference due to masturbation, pessimism congenital, a sense of the
ridiculous, sudden fastidiousness in some detail, experience. It is the only
occasion in which Ulysses is not helped by Minerva but by her male
counterpart and inferior. Curious that Sargent should be an authority on
animals. His character, also, it seems to me, may have been like his
namesake in the Nestor episode &hellip; Are you strong on costume? I want to make
<cite>Circe</cite> a costume episode also. Bloom for instance appears in five or six
different suits. What a book! &hellip; Hell, I must get <cite>Circe</cite> finished and

agree about the explanation of syphilis. I always thought the etymology was

[in Larbaud&apos;s flat] The episode of <cite>Ithaca</cite> is now
all geometry, algebra, and mathematics, and then finally <cite>Penelope</cite>! I&apos;d
like to dip my head in  a sea of ice. The book is already in press and I
expect the first proofs day after tomorrow. It will be published only in
October or November. Three expensive editions being involved, misprints have
to be avoided. The colours of the binding (chosen by me) will be white
letters on a blue field &mdash; the Greek flag though really of Bavarian origin
and imported with the dynasty. Yet in a special way they symbolize the myth
well &mdash; the white islands scattered over the sea &hellip; I have become a
monument &mdash; no, a vespasian.</div></p>

the capture is 260 but people ought not to be told this figure &hellip; I have the

rearranged above all on account of its scheme. I have also written the first
sentence of <cite>Penelope</cite> but as this contains about 2500 words the deed is
more than it seems to be. The episode consists of eight or nine sentences
equally sesquipedalian and ends with a monosyllable. Bloom and all the
Blooms will soon be dead, thank God</div></p>

Of the latter I have since the beginning sketched the outline and now I have
filled in at least three quarters. Of the former I have written almost as
much but it needs much more work. I work six hours a day in adding also text

same house Nelson in their cheap collection &hellip; registered and express &hellip;
As regards that 60pp book would it be too much to suggest to you the
following: get an exercise book and detach the leaves of it. If you read
rapidly through the book again you could jot down on the sheets anything
<i>in the words of the book</i> you think interesting and a quick sketch of
those views (not artistic I am <i>not</i> an artist) this plan you might follow
with the other books and then simply put the sheets in an envelope and send
them on to me. <cite>Penelope</cite> is the <i>clou</i> [Fr. star-turn] of the book.
The first sentence contains 2500 words. There are eight sentences in the
episode. It begins and ends with the female word <i>yes</i>. It turns like the
huge earth ball slowly surely and evenly round spinning, its four cardinal
points being the female breasts, arse, womb and cunt expressed by the words
<i>because</i>, <i>bottom</i> (in all senses bottom button, bottom of the class,
bottom of the sea, bottom of his heart), <i>woman</i>, <i>yes</i>. Though probably
more obscene than any preceding episode it seems to me to be perfectly sane
full amoral fertilisable untrustworthy engaging shrewd limited prudent
indifferent <i>Weib</i>. <i>Ich bin der</i> [sic] <i>Fleisch der stets bejaht.</i></div></p>

The sole correction from page 31 can still be executed on the [verg&eacute; d&apos;]Arches copies,
because we are obliged to re-impose them by 4 pages [r&eacute;imposer par quatre pages] because of the format of this paper.

<br>25&hellip; Oh
<br>were not indicated.

Those on pages 3 (except for the word jesuit  which was written with a capital letter), 14, 22, 31, are our fault. The error on page 3 is the most ridiculous ; if you would like, we could re-pull a four page cancel [carton de quatre pages] that will be exchanged in the stitching.</div></p>

The Christian name of the wife of the

She never lived in Belvedere College, however. After the divorce
court proceedings she was confined in Gaulstown, Co. Westmeath, the old seat
of the family, near Belvedere House by the shore of Lough Ennel, a new
residence just completed by the Earl. The Countess Mary died about 1780.
Belvedere House (now Belvedere College) was not completed by the second Earl

<cite>Ulysses</cite>, a huge book of about 800 pages, about 11 inches by 7, ought to

or anything you remember about the Powells &mdash; chiefly the mother and
daughters. Were any of them born abroad? When did Mrs Powell die? I never
heard of a third brother, only Gus and Charley. The women were Mrs Gallaher,
Mrs Clinch, Mrs Russell. Where did they live before marriage? When did the
major, if that was his rank, die? Also any information you have about the
Dillons (Mat Dillon and his bevy of daughters, Tiny, Floey, Atty, Sara,
Nannie, and <i>Mamie</i>, especially the last, the cigarette smoker and
Spanish type). Get an ordinary sheet of foolscap and a pencil and scribble
any God damn drivel you may remember about these people &hellip; Also I forgot to

Thanks for the information &hellip; Two more questions.
Is it possible for an ordinary person to climb over the area railings of no
7 Eccles street, either from the path or the steps, lower himself from
the lowest part of the railings till his feet are within 2 feet or 3 of the
ground and drop unhurt. I saw it done myself but by a man of rather athletic
build. I require this information in detail in order to determine the
wording of a paragraph. Secondly. Do you know anything of Mat Dillon&apos;s
daughter Mamy who was in Spain? If so, please let me know. Did any of your
girlfriends ever go there? Thirdly and last, Do you remember the cold
February of 1893. I think you were in Clanbrassil street. I want to know if
the canal was frozen and if there were any skating.</div></p>

at a table in an hotel I cannot possibly do this mechanical part with my
wretched eye  and a half. Are these to be perpetuated in future editions?

&pound;75 to pay him a draft falling due on the 30 November and to keep myself
alive till the first week in December &hellip; Anyhow for the last two or three
weeks the printer has shelved my book in favour of McAlmon&apos;s (who, I take it,
paid promptly and in advance). This latter is now out but for the past
week not a single word has been set, the printers confining themselves to
executing my corrections &hellip; The printer told me that I have made such
alterations in <cite>Ulysses</cite> as reduce my estimated gain (on total sale) by
about &pound;600 &mdash; and this after 7&frac12; years labour. I cannot help it. I must give
as much as I can. He says the book will weigh about 4 lbs. I suggest it be
sold by the ounce. Typing has been a heavy item for me personally as I had
certain parts done over three or four times to facilitate the printer in
setting. Also I am afraid I must have the proofs of <cite>Ithaca</cite> (the ugly
duckling of the book and therefore, I suppose, my favourite) read by a
competent person &mdash; which will be another expense &hellip; I made out a rough

I have not checked the paging from p.680 on as my head was
reeling after the effort. The corrections in black pencil are mistakes in
the setting. Mr Rodker wants the proof at once so will you please let him
have it. A revised proof should be sent to you which you could keep so that
as soon as the second edition is out the printers could start to alter the
plates for a third edition.</div></p>

correction of plates ought to be begun at once so that when ever a third
edition is called for the book can appear letter perfect. He says the cost
will be about 1 fr. per &lsquo;operation&rsquo; (agreeable word) that is change of
letter or word or line. He asked me if the list of errata prepared was final.
I said it was not but that I would read through the book and prepare the
final list. Meanwhile if you approve we could begin with your list and my
additions. I am reading steadily through the book and am preparing the list
though it is not amusing work and I cannot do more than 30pp a day. When I
send it to you of course it will include the errors you collected but these
can be struck out. If I had your list I would do it. There are a few general
remarks to be added. The impression of certain pages of the second edition
seems to me rather faint. Also will it be possible to change those broken
&lsquo;f&apos;s which are very irritating? There are some misprints also in the leaflet
of press extracts. And, finally, experts say (and Mr Darantiere agrees) that
the only blemish in the book is the type of capitals used in the Eolus
episode. The book is set in Elzevir and these are Grasset. There are no
Elzevir capitals it seems. I suggest (and Mr Darantiere agreed) that it
would be better to substitute block capitals especially as these are the
type used by newspapers.</div></p>

They have also requested me to write direct to you, should any difficulties arise. I am at present reading the 1930 edition and, as soon as I have finished it, I will send you a list of any corrections which I consider it advisable to make. On receipt of your approval to these, I will see that they are indicated on the proofs. Meanwhile, there is a point on which I should be glad of your immediate decision, as composition is due to begin at the end of this week. The Shakespeare and Co. edition follows, where dialogues are concerned, the French custom, i.e. a long dash is placed before the beginning of each speech. In all Albatross books hitherto (including the Albatross edition of &lsquo;Dubliners&rsquo;), we have followed the English custom, i.e. using quotation marks, which are more familiar to the English reader and are also preferable from the typographical point of view. I notice that quotation marks are also used in the Rhein-Verlag edition of the German translation of &lsquo;Ulysses&rsquo;, and therefore imagine that you will have no objection to their being substituted for the dashes in the Albatross English edition. In all other matters I wll adhere strictly to the Shakespeare and Company edition </div></p>

With regard to the point you raise about the proof reading of Ulysses, I understand that this is a very important matter, but I thought that this would have been done by someone in Paris under yours or Mr Joyce&apos;s supervision. If you definitely decide that it would be better for it to be done by Lanes, I will ask them to undertake this. </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="27Nov1934"><font color="red">27 November 1934</font> <i>NLPK</i> (from Paul L&eacute;on to J.

At the time the Albatross went to the press, they asked Mr Gilbert to do the proof-reading but as it involved an expense I dare not suggest it to Lane. In England I daresay they will find a specialist without any suggestion from us, the important part is however that they should realise this is not a trifling matter and should give it some thought. </div></p>

If Mr Gilbert made some hundreds of corrections for the Odyssey Press edition, wouldn&apos;t it surely be better to set up from this. In any case, I think that Monsieur Leon should certainly supply us with a perfect copy of either one or the other edition or &hellip; perhaps send us a letter embodying the necessary corrections to whichever edition he wishes to set it from. </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="hw12Jul1936"><font color="red">12 July 1936</font> <i>NLHW</i> (from Paul L&eacute;on to Harriet Weaver): ULYSSES is definitely coming out before the end of September. (The sheets for the signed edition are already back in England and the corrections of the proofs is as far as page 500 odd. They have consequently some 200 odd pages to compose. </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="14Jul1936"><font color="red">14 July 1936</font> <i>NLJL</i> (from Edward Young of the Bodley Head to Paul L&eacute;on): Tuesday. Our reader has sent us another batch of queries, which you will find on the accompanying sheet. </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="16Jul1936"><font color="red">16 July 1936</font> <i>NLPK</i> (from Paul L&eacute;on to J. Ralph Pinker): I am in correspondence with &hellip; Messrs John Lane about queries which I am answering direct as I do not think it worth while to bother you. </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="a16Jul1936"><font color="red">16 July 1936</font> <i>NLJL</i> (from Paul L&eacute;on to John Lane The Bodley Head): I beg to enclose reply to the first batch of your queries. I have just received the second and will answer it tomorrow. I am very glad about the meticulous way in which you establish your text and I take up every individual query with Mr Joyce. </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="30Jul1936"><font color="red">30 July 1936</font> <i>NLJL</i> (from Paul L&eacute;on to John Lane The Bodley Head): Mr Joyce has gone away from Paris for a short time but is still within my reach. By August the 10th he will be however gone away further and it will be difficult for me to reach him. I have been in communication with Mr Young from Bury Street about missprints and so far we have reached I think Page 350 odd of the Albatross text. What about the rest? </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="10Aug1936"><font color="red">10 August 1936</font> <i>NLJL</i> (from John Lane to Paul L&eacute;on): We are attaching a further list of queries. </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="15Aug1936"><font color="red">15 August 1936</font> <i>NLJL</i> (from John Lane to Paul L&eacute;on): Many thanks for the queries answered and attached is a further list. </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="21Aug1936"><font color="red">21 August 1936</font> <i>NLJL</i> (from John Lane to Paul L&eacute;on): We attach a further list of queries. </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="24Aug1936"><font color="red">24 August 1936</font> <i>NLJL</i> (from John Lane to Paul L&eacute;on): I am sending you herewith still another batch of queries. [JJ hand: Unanswered questions / Cead mile failte / I think &lsquo;mile&rsquo; is correct Irish for 1000 with <i>one</i> &ldquo;l&rdquo;. See my Irish-English or English-Irish dictionary in flat. Can&apos;t place last question. Perhaps wrongly indicated. To be repeated in next list.] </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="26Aug1936"><font color="red">26 August 1936</font> <i>NLPL</i> (to Paul L&eacute;on): <i>Ulysses</i> came so will send off corrections when I get back. [??corrections may be for transition  not Ulysses] </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="28Aug1936"><font color="red">28 August 1936</font> <i>NLPL</i> (to Paul L&eacute;on): CORRECTIONS TOUTES ENVOYEES VOTRE ADRESSE OUI ACHETEZ ET LIVREZ DE NOTRE PART SANS VISITE MILLE REMERCIEMENTS AVANCE VOTRE SOEUR </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="1Sep1936"><font color="red">1 September 1936</font> <i>NLJL</i> (from John Lane to Paul L&eacute;on): I am enclosing herewith some further queries, including a repetition of the last query of the previous batch, for which I gave you the wrong line on the page. </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="a3Sep1936"><font color="red">3 September 1936</font> <i>NLJL</i> (from Paul L&eacute;on to John Lane The Bodley Head): The printing of ULYSSES &hellip; the first 300 pages went very well but since there has been a lull and the printers seem to have reached page 550 with difficulty. On the other hand the queries which they direct to me cannot be attended as swiftly as heretofore Mr Joyce being away and as I want every reply I make to be verified by him &hellip; hurry them up with the rest of the queries, which means after all some 250 odd pages more. Anyhow these corrections which for the best part are signs of punctuation and hyphens can in case it is necessary to keep to a schedule be attended to simply by your reader as by now he must be conversant with the peculiarities of Mr Joyce&apos;s orthography (as little hyphens as possible, all participial phrases in commas etc.) </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="3Sep1936"><font color="red">3 September 1936</font> <i>NLPL</i> (to Paul L&eacute;on): Here are corrections. The B.T. is the Times of Denmark. </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="4Sep1936"><font color="red">4 September 1936</font> <i>NLPL</i> (to Paul L&eacute;on): Our plans are to leave in a few days, stay a few days in Hamburg (Streits hotel), stop a night at Cologne &hellip; reach Li&egrave;ge and, if possible, rest 4 or 5 days on the outskirts of the town in quiet hotel, reaching Paris about 12 or 15 all subject to change &hellip; Sent you list for Lane last night &hellip;  </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="5Sep1936"><font color="red">?5 September 1936</font> <i>NLPL</i> (JJ to Paul L&eacute;on): I returned the last 3 corrections this morning to Lane by air </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="7Sep1936"><font color="red">7 September 1936</font> <i>NLJL</i> (from John Lane to Paul L&eacute;on): We have felt all along that in view of the number of misprints which have occurred in previous editions, our edition should be as well-nigh perfect as possible, hence the referring of even the smallest queries to Mr Joyce. I may say, that  his has been a very expensive matter as far as we are concerned, as we have had to employ a man outside our own staff to supervise the work. </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="8Sep1936"><font color="red">8 September 1936</font> <i>NLPK</i> (from Paul L&eacute;on to J. Ralph Pinker): The British edition is now due to come out soon. The queries for the corrections however have only reached up to page 620 odd (out of 780 odd) &hellip; Mr Joyce is away. </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="10Sep1936"><font color="red">10 September 1936</font> <i>NLPK</i> (from Paul L&eacute;on to J. Ralph Pinker): Lane &hellip; will have final slip proofs from their printer to-day &hellip; there is no reason why they should not publish on October 1st. </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="12Sep1936"><font color="red">12 September 1936</font> <i>NLJL</i> (from John Lane to Paul L&eacute;on): This is to confirm &hellip; that we have safely received all answers to our queries; also that we have no further queries and that the complete text has now been composed. We are now waiting to hear from Mr Joyce about the Appendix material, proofs of which were sent to him by me to the Hamburg address on Thursday. (10 September 1936) </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="17Sep1936"><font color="red">17 September 1936</font> <i>NLMS</i> (from Paul L&eacute;on to Messrs Monro Saw): A slight difficulty has arisen with Lane in course of the reading of the proofs which have all been corrected from here as regards the documents to be inserted in the Appendices. I mean that they forwarded them to me very late and I needed three days for the rearrangement and the additional matter of these Appendices. I think that they are quite good from a legal point of view. </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="18Sep1936"><font color="red">18 September 1936</font> <i>NLJL</i> (from Paul L&eacute;on to Messrs Monro Saw): John Lane &hellip; had something like six months for setting up the book &hellip; whereas the Albatross edition set up their edition in six weeks. </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="3Oct1936"><font color="red">3 October 1936</font> <i>BLHW</i> (to Harriet Weaver): Thanks for your generous and loyal support during twenty years which has made today&apos;s publication possible. </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="8Oct1936"><font color="red">8 October 1936</font> <i>NLHW</i> (from Harriet Weaver to Paul L&eacute;on): It is too bad there should be so many misprints in <i>Ulysses</i> after all this time. </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="22Oct1936"><font color="red">22 October 1936</font> <i>NLJL</i> (from John Lane to Paul L&eacute;on): ULYSSES &hellip; In regard to the misprints, I had a long conversation with the reader who had charge of this work, and he has now been through 60 pages on which he has found only two mistakes for which he is responsible. He is bringing me a list with particulars of the pages he has read through, and when I receive this, I will again communicate with you. </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="23Oct1936"><font color="red">23 October 1936</font> <i>NLJL</i> (from John Lane to Paul L&eacute;on): I have now heard from our reader who corrected the proofs, who says that in looking through about 100 pages &mdash; from 7-21 inclusive and 235-259 and others &mdash; he found the following two mistakes <br>  Page 8 line 9 There should be a full stop after "brood" <br>  Page 242 last line but one: There should be a paragraph.

<br> We are letting him have a copy of the book to go through carefully in his spare time, so as to rule out any possible mistakes in the general trade edition which we are publishing next year. Incidentally, if you should come across any further misprints yourself &hellip; let me know so that we can have them dealt with. </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="a23Oct1936"><font color="red">23 October 1936</font> <i>NLHW</i> (from Paul L&eacute;on to Harriet Weaver): you must have noticed the incomprehensible amount of misprints, discrepancies from the Albatross text &hellip; Mr Joyce is not well at all. </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="27Oct1936"><font color="red">27 October 1936</font> <i>NLJL</i> (from Paul L&eacute;on to John Lane The Bodley Head): As far as the misprints are concerned it seems that the pages which were opened at random proved particularly unhappy. I gave your brother the list of misprints on pages 368-373 (eight or nine). Since Mr Joyce read page 600-610 and found one misprint only. </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="27Nov1936"><font color="red">27 November 1936</font> <i>NLPK</i> (from J. Ralph Pinker to Paul L&eacute;on): John Lane the Bodley Head has been put into the hands of a Receiver. </div></p>


<p class="spbr"><h4>1937</h4> </p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="1Feb1937"><font color="red">1 February 1937</font> <i>NLGC</i> (from Gerald Griffin to Paul L&eacute;on): Could you let me know &hellip; if <cite>Ulysses</cite> is on the Index Expurgationes of the Holy See? &hellip; I presume you have got the copy of the O.R. &hellip; I posted it yesterday. </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="22Feb1937"><font color="red">22 February 1937</font> <i>NLMS</i> (Paul L&eacute;on to Messrs Monro Saw): Ulysses &hellip; the new John Lane Co. &hellip; they should use the Albatross edition as their text &hellip; the text of the limited Lane edition is full of unwarranted misprints (there are 8 of them between pgs 268-373) as well as the Appendix. But there are incorporated in the limited edition about a hundred corrections chiefly of punctuation. They should therefore use the limited edition as their basis correcting words from the Albatross. It will also be a good thing if they could send me the proofs of the Appendix which contains some serious blunders. </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="20Apr1937"><font color="red">20 April 1937</font> <i>NLMS</i> (from Paul L&eacute;on to Messrs Monro Saw): As far as the text is concerned I am afraid that I have not yet been able to make myself understood. The text of the John Lane edition is the latest and revised text by Mr Joyce in so far as he has given about 100 or 150 corrections and verifications of this text by letter in reply to queries from John Lane. Unfortunately however the text of the John Lane presents an unwarranted number of new mistakes, which are not to be found in the Albatross text. There are for instance some 8 unwarranted misprints on pages 368-373 of the Lane edition which are not in the Albatross. The new firm must have found in the files of the old the numerous letters I have written in reply to queries about the text. The best way to proceed is to go by the Albatross text introducing all these replies to queries. Otherwise I see no other way to proceed than to keep to the Albatross text combining for the punctuation the later Lane text. Still this latter course is less secure as I do not remember all the queries sent and some of them may have also referred to actual words and not only to punctuation. <br>The same applies to the Appendix which has such incredible mistakes as a date "37th of December" or a title "A please for university coeducation". But here it is easier to proceed as I could easily have these misprints corrected myself provided I get the galleys of proofs. But again they must have all the documents which went to constitute the Appendix in the files of the former John Lane company&apos;s archives. </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="5May1937"><font color="red">5 May 1937</font> <i>NLJL</i> (from G. Wren Howard to Paul L&eacute;on): You express surprise that John Lane do not propose to use plates of ULYSSES already in existence &hellip; no plates do, in fact, exist, and because, even if they did, the corrections which you and Mr Joyce are naturally anxious to have made could only be made with difficulty on stereotypic plates </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="a5May1937"><font color="red">5 May 1937</font> <i>NLJL</i> (from G. Wren Howard to Paul L&eacute;on): I have just received the first fruits of our reader&apos;s comparison of the John Lane ULYSSES with &hellip; Odyssey Press. He has made a note of certain points which he is unable himself to settle, and about which he would like to have Mr Joyce&apos;s precise instructions. I enclose a list of these queries. </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="14May1937"><font color="red">14 May 1937</font> <i>NLJL</i> (from G. Wren Howard to Paul L&eacute;on): Our reader has now finished his comparison of the Odyssey Press &hellip; John Lane &hellip; ULYSSES, and I send you his further list of queries which I hope Mr Joyce will be able to deal with. </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="16May1937"><font color="red">16 May 1937</font> <i>NLJL</i> (from Paul L&eacute;on to G. Wren Howard): I beg to acknowledge receipt of your favours from the 26th of April and 5th and 14th inst. I have gone through the first batch of queries with Mr Joyce himself and am enclosing together with the results of carefully reading the pages 369-373. I will go through the new queries with Mr Joyce to morrow or the day after and I will send them to you without further delay. </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="27May1937"><font color="red">27 May 1937</font> <i>NLJL</i> (from Paul L&eacute;on to G. Wren Howard): I beg to enclose the second batch of corrections which seems to complete the first reading of the text. </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="2Jun1937"><font color="red">2 June 1937</font> <i>NLJL</i> (from G. Wren Howard to Paul L&eacute;on): Thank you for &hellip; the second batch of corrections. I think that we now have the text in the proper and final form. </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="3Jun1937"><font color="red">3 June 1937</font> <i>NLJL</i> (from G. Wren Howard to Paul L&eacute;on): Mr Fifield has now collated all the corrections necessary to be made for the new edition of ULYSSES. </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="8Jun1937"><font color="red">8 June 1937</font> <i>NLMS</i> (from Paul L&eacute;on to Messrs Monro Saw): I have exchanged something like three or four letters with Mr Wren Howard about the text of ULYSSES which is now finally established. </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="25Sep1937"><font color="red">25 September 1937</font> <i>NLJL</i> (from G. Wren Howard to Messrs Monro Saw): [ULYSSES] was duly published on the announced date, Thursday last. (23 September 1937) </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="19Oct1937"><font color="red">19 October 1937</font> <i>NLHW</i> (from Harriet Weaver to Paul L&eacute;on): And now I must express regret that I did not send you months ago a list of errors I noticed in the English edition of <i>Ulysses</i>. The reason I did not send it was that, as you yourself had spoken of the many errors Mr Joyce had noticed, I imagined that the type for the trade edition would be reset from the text used for the <i>de luxe</i> edition and not from that edition itself, as, I can see, it has been, the paging being precisely the same and many of the errors being repeated. It seems to be chiefly the errors in the <i>Oxen of the Sun</i> episode that have been corrected. I enclose now, all too late, those on the list I made that occur again in the trade edition, a few of which are rather unfortunate ones. I regret very much not having sent them to you in time for the corrections to be made in the new edition. </div></p>
