&ldquo;Marius the Epicurean&rdquo;</p>



<p class="spbr"><cite>Marius the Epicurean</cite> vol. I, pp. 106f:</p>

<p class="spbr">They comprehended a multitude of both sexes and of all ages, already
initiated into the divine secret, clad in fair linen,
the females veiled, the males with shining
tonsures, and every one carrying a sistrum&mdash;the
richer sort of silver, a few very dainty persons of
fine gold&mdash;rattling the reeds, with a noise [like
the jargon] of innumerable birds and insects
awakened from torpor and abroad in the spring
sun. Then, borne upon a kind of platform, came
the goddess herself, undulating above the heads
of the multitude as the bearers walked, in mystic
robe embroidered with the moon and stars,
bordered gracefully with a fringe of real fruit
and flowers[,] and with a glittering crown upon
the head. The train of the procession consisted
of the priests in long white vestments, close
from head to foot, distributed into various
groups, each bearing, exposed aloft, one of the
sacred symbols of Isis&mdash;the corn[-]fan, the golden
asp, the ivory hand of equity, and among them
the votive ship itself, carved and gilt, and
adorned [bravely] with ^brave^ flags flying. Last of all
walked the high priest[;]^:^ the people kneeling as
he passed to kiss his hand, in which were those
<span style="background:#FFF7A4">well[-]remembered</span> roses. </p>


<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="spbr"><cite>Marius the Epicurean</cite> vol. I, p. 162:</p>

<p class="spbr">Down the
dewy paths the people were descending from it,
to keep a holiday, high and low alike in rough,
white[-] linen smocks. A homely old play was
just begun in an open[-] air theatre, with seats
hollowed out of the turf[-]grown slope. Marius
caught the terrified expression of a child in its
mother's arms, as it turned from the yawning
mouth of a great mask, for refuge in her bosom.
The way mounted[,] and descended again[,] down
the steep street of another place, all resounding
with the noise of metal under the hammer;
for every house had its brazier's workshop, the
bright objects of brass and copper gleaming, like
lights in a cave, out of their dark roofs and
corners. Around the anvils the children were
watching the work, or ran to fetch water to the
hissing, red[-]hot metal; and Marius</p>

<p class="spbr"><h5>VIII.B, page 9</h5> </p>

<p class="spbr">too watched,
as he took his hasty mid[-]day refreshment, a mess
of chestnut[-] meal and cheese, while the swelling
surface of a great copper water[-] vessel grew
flowered all over with tiny petals under the
skilful strokes. Towards dusk, a frantic woman
at the roadside, stood and cried out the words of
some philter[,] or malison[,] in verse, with weird
motion of her hands, as the travellers passed, like
a wild picture drawn from Virgil.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="spbr"><cite>Marius the Epicurean</cite> vol. I, p. 173:</p>

<p class="spbr">The temple^s^ of Antoninus and Faustina
[was] ^were^ still fresh in all the majesty of its closely
arrayed columns of cipollino; but, on the whole,
little had been added under the late and present
emperors, and during fifty years of public quiet[,]
a sober brown and gray had grown apace on
things. The gilding on the roof of many a
temple had lost its garishness: cornice and
capital of polished marble shone out with all the
crisp freshness of real flowers, amid the already
mouldering travertine and brickwork, though
the birds had built freely among them.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="spbr"><cite>Marius the Epicurean</cite> vol. I, p. 177:</p>

<p class="spbr">Marius could distinguish,
could distinguish clearly, the well[-]known profile, between the floating purple curtains.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="spbr"><cite>Marius the Epicurean</cite> vol. I, p. 191</p>

<p class="spbr">The nostrils and mouth seemed capable almost
of peevishness[;]^:^ and Marius noted in them, as
in the hands[,] and in the spare body generally,
what was new to his experience&mdash;something of
asceticism, as we say, of a bodily gymnastic[,] by
which, although it told pleasantly in the clear
blue humours of the eye, the flesh had scarcely
been an equal gainer with the spirit.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="spbr"><cite>Marius the Epicurean</cite> vol. I, p. 211</p>

<p class="spbr">The discourse ended almost in darkness, the
evening having set in somewhat suddenly[,] with
a heavy fall of snow. The torches, made ready
to do him a useless honour, were of real service
now[,] as the emperor was solemnly conducted
home; one man rapidly catching light from
another&mdash;a long stream of moving Hghts across
the white</p>

<p class="spbr"><h5>VIII.B, page 10</h5> </p>

<p class="spbr">Forum, up the great stairs, to the
palace. And, in effect, that night winter began,
the hardest that had been known for a lifetime.
The wolves came from the mountains[;]^:^ and, led
by the carrion scent, devoured the dead bodies
which had been hastily buried during the
plague[,] and, emboldened by their meal, crept,
before the short day was well past, over the
walls of the farmyards of the [C]^c^ampagna. The
eagles were seen driving the flocks of smaller
birds across the dusky sky. Only, in the city
itself the winter was all the brighter for the
contrast[,] among those who could pay for light
and warmth. The <span style="background:#FFF7A4">habit[-]makers</span> made a great
sale of the spoil of all such furry creatures as
had escaped wolves and eagles[,] for presents at
the {i}Saturnalia[;]^:^{/i} and at no time had the winter
roses from Carthage seemed more lustrously
<span style="background:#FFF7A4">yellow and red</span>.</p>


<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="spbr"><cite>Marius the Epicurean</cite> vol. I, p. 239</p>

<p class="spbr">It might
be almost edifying to study minutely the expression of his face[,] while the assistants corded
and pegged him to the bench, cunningly; the
servant of the law waiting by[,] who, after one
short cut with his knife, would slip the man's
leg from his skin, as neatly as if it were a
stocking.</p>

<p class="spbr">And meantime those dreams of remote and
probably adventurous travel lent the youth,
still so healthy of body, a wing for more distant
expeditions than he had ever yet inclined to,
among his own wholesome German woodlands.
In long rambles, afoot or on horseback, by day
and night, he flung himself, for the resettling
of his sanity, on the cheerful influences of their
simple imagery; the hawks, <span style="background:#FFF7A4">as if asleep</span> on the
air below him; the bleached crags, <span style="background:#FFF7A4">evoked</span> by ^the^
late sunset among the dark oaks; the water[-]wheels, <span style="background:#FFF7A4">with their pleasant</span> murmur, in the
foldings of the hillside.</p>

it has its way almost as if it belonged to that

<p class="spbr">&ldquo;The
evening will be a wet one.&rdquo; The storm is
always brooding through the massy splendour
of the trees, above those sun[-]dried glades or
lawns, where delicate children may be trusted
thinly clad; and the secular trees themselves
will hardly outlast another generation[.]</p>

<p class="spbr">The
pavement of the choir, removed amid a surging
sea of lugubrious chants, all persons fasting,
discovered as if it had been a battlefield of
mouldering human remains. Their odour rose
plainly above the plentiful clouds of incense,
such as was used in the king's [private] chapel.
The search for the [S]^s^aint himself continued in
vain all day and far into the night. At last
from a little narrow chest, into which the remains had been almost crushed together, the
bishop's red[-]gloved hands drew the dwindled
body, shrunken inconceivably, but still with
every feature of the face traceable in a sudden
oblique ray of ghastly dawn.</p>

<p class="spbr">Tears rose in the eyes
of needy children, of old or weak people like
children, as they woke up again and again to
sunless, frost[-]bound, ruinous mornings; and
the little hungry creatures went prowling after
scattered hedgenuts or dried vine[-]tendrils.</p>

<p class="spbr">[And his] ^His^ goodwill sunned her
wild[-]grown beauty into majesty, into a kind of
queenly richness. There was natural majesty
in the heavy waves of golden hair folded closely
above the neck, built a little massively; and
she looked kind, beseeching also, capable of
sorrow. She was like clear sunny weather,
with bluebells and the green leaves, between
rainy days, and seemed to embody {i}Die Ruh auf
dem Gipfel{/i}&mdash;all the restful hours he had spent
of late in the wood[-]sides and on the hilltops.</p>

<p class="spbr">The air there, air supposed to possess the singular
property of restoring the whiteness of ivory, was
pure and thin. An even veil of lawn[-]like white
cloud had now drawn over the sky; and under
its broad, shadowless light every hue and tone of
time came out upon the yellow old temples, the
elegant pillared circle of the shrine of the
patronal Sibyl, the houses seemingly of a piece
with the ancient fundamental rock. Some
half[-]conscious motive of poetic grace would
appear to have determined their grouping[;]^:^ in
part resisting, partly going along with the
natural wildness and harshness of the place, its
floods and precipices. An air of immense age
possessed, above all, the vegetation around&mdash;a
world of evergreen trees&mdash;the olives especially,
older than how many generations of men's lives!
fretted and twisted by the combining forces of
life and death, into every conceivable caprice of
form. In the windless weather all seemed to be</p>

<p class="spbr"><h5>VIII.B, page 13</h5> </p>

<p class="spbr">listening to the roar of the immemorial waterfall,
plunging down so unassociably among these
human habitations, and with a motion so unchanging from age to age as to count, even in
this time[-]worn place, as an image of unalterable
rest. Yet the clear sky all but broke to let
through the ray which was silently quickening
everything in the late February afternoon, and
the unseen violet refined itself through the air.
It was as if the spirit of life in nature were but
withholding any too precipitate revelation of
itself, in its slow, wise, maturing work[.]</p>

<p class="spbr">Lastly,
herb and tree had taken possession, spreading
their seed[-]bells and light branches, just astir in
the trembling air, above the ancient garden[-] wall,
against the wide realms of sunset.</p>

<p class="spbr">Men and
women came to the altar successively, in perfect
order, and deposited below the lattice[-]work of
pierced white marble, their baskets of wheat and
grapes, incense, oil for the sanctuary lamps[;]^:^ bread
and wine especially&mdash;pure wheaten bread, the
pure white wine of the Tusculan vineyards. &hellip;

<p class="spbr">Among the captives, amid the laughter
of the crowds at his blowsy upper garment, his trousered legs and
conical wolf[-]skin cap, walked our own ancestor, representative of
subject Germany, under a figure very familiar in later Roman sculpture; and,
though certainly with none of the grace of the {i}Dying Gaul{/i},
yet with plenty of uncouth pathos in his misshapen features[,] and the
pale, servile[,] yet angry eyes.
