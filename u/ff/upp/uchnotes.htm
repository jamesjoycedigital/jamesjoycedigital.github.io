</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn10"> &ldquo;Dedalus (Stephen)&rdquo;, Cornell 25:10; <cite>James Joyce Archive</cite>, vol. 7, p. 118.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn11"> &ldquo;Dedalus (Stephen)&rdquo;, Cornell 25:8; <cite>James Joyce Archive</cite> vol. 7, p. 116ff.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn12"> The exact house-number is unspecified in the early drafts. Here, No. 7 is specified as &ldquo;still unlet&rdquo;: that is, empty. The Blooms moved in, so to speak, only on the placards (dated 16 June 1921). The original home address Joyce had in mind was perhaps No. 8, the number 8 (or lemniscate) he associates with Molly. Clearly, he liked the idea of his characters being ghosts in an empty house (No. 7), which No. 8 was not.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn13"> &ldquo;Milly&rdquo; (&ldquo;Molly&rdquo; watered down) was originally (in the proto-draft of Ithaca) a contraction of Emily and not, as Joyce later decided, of Millicent.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn14"> Joyce never got a copy of the particular issue and thus had no idea of its contents. Wisely, he has Bloom discard it.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn15"> The original <i>lotos</i> was a kind of clover [shamrock] on which horses chewed (and hence the presence in the episode of horses and horse-racing).  On a larger canvas, the theme of the 1904 Gold Cup race is of great importance in <cite>Ulysses</cite>. It surfaces here and re-appears in Aeolus, Lestrygonians, Wandering Rocks, Cyclops, Oxen, Eumeus, Ithaca and Penelope. Joyce had to hand two accounts of it. The first was from the London <cite>Times</cite>; the second from the Dublin <cite>Evening Telegraph</cite>.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn16"> The [Roman Catholic] church here is properly Saint Andrew&apos;s.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn17"> Historically, and this was a reason for Joyce choosing it, according to the 1904 <cite>Thom's</cite> Dignam&apos;s house was vacant, and thus appropriately lifeless.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn18"> A good question is when and how Bloom put the money down. It cannot have been while at Glasnevin, as might seem plausible, as he didn&apos;t have enough cash on him to cover it. He is at this point the possessor of two shilling and ten pence (&ldquo;two and ten&rdquo;). This consideration helps to explain why, immediately after the funeral, in Aeolus, we find a group from Hades hanging around the offices of the Freeman&apos;s Journal instead of being ensconced in a pub (their intended destination). At least two coaches must have returned to the city centre, depositing Bloom, Simon Dedalus, Cunningham, Power, Lambert, and Hynes in O&apos;Connell Street. These would have proceeded directly to the adjacent offices of the Freeman&apos;s Journal, but for different reasons. Bloom, Power and Cunningham would have gone there primarily for Bloom to collect what was due to him in commission, thereby allowing him to transfer the promised five shillings, with Power witness to the transaction. Cunningham and Power would then have left together, still bent on Dignam&apos;s affairs, while Bloom remained behind to attend to his own business over the ad. Lambert and Dedalus would have gone in to ask the editor to join them for the premeditated drink, and Hynes would have gone in to file his report of the funeral. This is the situation when the episode opens, with Power and Cunningham already out of the picture.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn22"> Historically, Joyce met Magee in the library on the morning after he walked out of the tower in shock in September 1904. They seem to have got on well. AE, to whom we are told Stephen owes &pound;1, was an important figure in the Irish literary renaissance, such as it was, and was something of a mystical/theosophist type. He was an associate of the poet W. B. Yeats and editor of the <cite>Irish Homestead</cite>, where Joyce published early versions of three of the stories from <cite>Dubliners</cite>.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn23"> Joyce had personal dealings with Father Conmee. He (the Jesuit) had been appointed rector of Clongowes Wood College in 1885 (as related in <cite>A Portrait</cite>), leaving it in the same year (1891) as did Joyce. John Joyce could no longer afford the inflated fees. Conmee, however, saw to it that the Joyce boys were spared the humiliation of schooling in some Mickey-Muck Christian Brother school and got them (free) into Belvedere. Poor James, however, had to spend a short while in 1893 being taught by the Christian Brothers alongside working-class boys.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn28"> In 1904, the site was occupied by George John Alexander &amp; Co., seed merchants. Their warehouse and offices engrossed the old chapter house: all that remained of the old monastery.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn30"> Farrell is based on &ldquo;Endymion&rdquo; Farrell, a well-known Dublin eccentric who walked about the city bearing two swords, a fishing rod and an umbrella. He sported a red rose in his buttonhole and, for added ventilation, had his tight bowler hat perforated with several large holes. He came from a brewer's family in Dundalk and is reputed to have fallen into a vat in the brewery, an experience from which, evidently, he never recovered.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn31"> The Sirens interlude proves to be costly for Bloom. The first item (a twopenny packet of notepaper and envelopes) is described allusively but definitively. He now has one pound, three shillings and sixpence in his pocket. His dinner of liver and bacon washed down with cider sets him back one shilling and ninepence and a threepenny tip. Whilst writing to Martha, he decides to send her a postal-order for two shillings and sixpence as a &ldquo;little present&rdquo;; to which add a penny for the poundage on the postal-order and a penny for a stamp for the letter.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn32"> Now Grattan Bridge.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn33"> Joyce wrote to Georges Borach on 18 June,1919, that he had finished the &ldquo;big job&rdquo; of writing Sirens during the last few days. &ldquo;I wrote this chapter with the technical resources of music. It is a fugue with all musical notations: piano, forte, rallentando, and so on. A quintet occurs in it, too, as in Die Meistersinger, my favourite Wagnerian opera … Since exploring the resources and artifices of music and employing them in this chapter, I haven&apos;t cared for music any more. I, the great friend of music, can no longer listen to it. I see through all the tricks and can&apos;t enjoy it any more.&rdquo;

</p><p> On reading the typescript of the episode, Ezra Pound was horrified. Joyce, he felt, had finally lost the plot: &ldquo;obsessions arseore-ial, cloacal, deist, aesthetic as opposed to arsethetic, any obsession or tic shd be very carefully considered before being turned loose&rdquo; (<cite>Pound/Joyce</cite> p. 157, letter of 10 June 1919).

</p><p> Joyce, whose vaunted musicological knowledge was technically amateurish, confuses <i>fuga per canonem</i> (to order) with fugue (a movement in canonic form) and he is incorrect in his belief that there is anything resembling a strict &ldquo;eight part&rdquo; construction to it. The episode, moreover, only very loosely and impressionistically breaks into a &ldquo;musical&rdquo; form. As he had his friend Stuart Gilbert explain for him, the episode is intended to correspond to a fugue with soggetto or subject (female sexual seduction, the allure of the sirens: lively Miss Douce and sad Miss Kennedy), answer (dejected Mr Bloom), counter-subject (the seducing male, Blazes Boylan), and diversions or divertimenti (the sentimental songs sung in the bar), the whole ending in a stretto in which all the voices take part.

</p><p> More restrictedly, the fugal aspect is more particularly to be found at the micro-level of the sentence, there being throughout the episode a style of conflation of various almost-parallel sentences from different narrative points of view – e.g., he heard, she heard, they heard, being rolled palimpsest-like into the more succinct: he she they heard.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn34"> Joyce described the &ldquo;sense&rdquo; or &ldquo;meaning&rdquo; of the episode as &ldquo;the projected mirage&rdquo;.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn40"> The organ-eating Bloom doesn&apos;t eat the feet: he gives these to a famished mongrel. Joyce was trying to mirror Odysseus&apos; killing of a stag on his arrival at Circe&apos;s Isle of Hawks (Aiaia) and his feeding his crew with it.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn49"> In classical rhetoric (<i>rhetorike</i>), oratory was divided into three classes: (1) <i>symbouleutikon</i> – deliberative (or legislative) rhetoric that strives to persuade the audience to take action by talking about a possible future; (2) <i>dikanike</i> –  judicial or forensic rhetoric, concerned with accusation or defence and with time past; its standard is justice or injustice; and (3) <i>epideiktike</i>   – epideictic, public, ceremonial or demonstrative rhetoric, the ornamental rhetoric of &ldquo;display&rdquo; that is concerned with praise or blame and, usually, with time present; its standard is honour or shame.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn50"> An enthymeme (<i>enthumema</i>) is a rhetorical syllogism: a tripartite deductive argument used in oratorical practice, of which there are four classes.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn51"> Joyce confused himself when researching the details of the fugue and, in his haste, misunderstood the specific canonical form of the fuga per canonem. In this regard, consult Susan Brown, &ldquo;The Mystery of the Fuga per Canonem Solved&rdquo; in <cite>Genetic Joyce Studies</cite> (Spring 2007): http://www.geneticjoycestudies.org/GJS7/GJS7brown.html. She writes that the entry for the fugue written by Ralph Vaughn Williams in the 1906 edition of Grove&apos;s <cite>Dictionary of Music and Musicians</cite> is the source for Joyce&apos;s fuga per canonem notes. These appear in Italian on the cover of his Sirens copybook (NLI II.ii.3).

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn52"> Hyperion's son Helios was referred to in early mythological writings as Helios Hyperion (&ldquo;Sun High-one&rdquo;). In the <cite>Odyssey</cite>, Hesiod&apos;s <cite>Theogony</cite> and the Homeric <cite>Hymn to Demeter</cite>, the Sun is once in each work called Hyperionides (&ldquo;son of Hyperion&rdquo;), and in other writings Hesiod certainly imagines Hyperion as a separate being. In later Greek literature, Hyperion is distinguished from Helios; the former was ascribed the characteristics of the &ldquo;God of Watchfulness, Wisdom and the Light,&rdquo; while the latter became the physical incarnation of the Sun. Hyperion is an obscure figure in Greek culture and mythology, mainly appearing in lists of the twelve Titans.


</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn53"> The rhapsodes were celebrated reciters and singers of poetry and often well-to-do. The Homeridae were those scholarly preservers of the text who recited the poems &ldquo;by right of succession&rdquo;.  These were perhaps akin to nit-picking modern-day Joyce scholars. Originally, the Poems would have been spoken, or more exactly sung, perhaps in fragments, by the rhapsodes to the accompaniment of a lyre. They were not written down, but memorized and extemporized. Their roots are thus strictly in what is now termed orature. Their maker (known as The Poet, after poetas or &ldquo;maker&rdquo;), or (better) collocator  –  Homer –  is not unambiguously known, as the poem was creatively transmitted through a succession of individuals since its inception. The popular tradition that it was composed <i>ab initio</i> in some ur-form by a blind bard some time between the late eighth and late seventh century B.C., somewhere in Ionia (the Greek coastal region of Anatolia in present-day Turkey) is a simplification.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn54"> This was a week-long festival celebrating the best of the city&apos;s capacity to entertain – much like the week leading up to Bloomsday currently is in Dublin. It opened with a grand procession to the Parthenon, one that was more important than the games themselves.  For this, a special robe (the peplos) was woven by the women of Athens for the statue of the goddess Athene, which was hoisted up and carried to the Parthenon. There was also a large sacrifice made to Athene, the hekatombe (that is, the sacrifice of a hundred oxen), and the meat from the sacrificed animals was used in a banquet on the final night of the festival, the pannychis (the &ldquo;all-nighter&rdquo;).  The biannual Joyce Symposium ends with a fancy dinner for all of the participants. Many scholars believe that this procession is the theme of the inner Ionic Parthenon Frieze, indicating its importance to the Athenian people to warrant inclusion in a temple.

</p><p> Award ceremonies included the giving of amphorae, large ceramic vessels that contained olive oil given as prizes. The winner of the chariot race (the horse-race of its day), for example, received a prize of one hundred and forty of these amphorae.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn55"> Digamma, or wau, &ldquo;&gammad;&rdquo;, was part of the original archaic Greek alphabet as initially adopted from Phoenician [waw] and stood in the sixth position in the alphabet, between epsilon and zeta.  It has principally remained in use as a Greek numeral for 6; as such, it was called episemon during the Byzantine era and is now known as stigma  after the Byzantine ligature combining sigma and tau. As an alphabetic letter, it is attested in archaic and dialectal ancient Greek inscriptions until the classical period.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn56"> Proteus, for example, with whom Menelaos wrestles in the Nile delta, is a disguised Pharaoh, a divine sorcerer anciently known as the &ldquo;Gate Sublime&rdquo; [&ldquo;Prouti&rdquo;].

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn57"> The historian Josephus is the sole ancient witness that Homer was illiterate. As he was attempting to assert the primacy of the ancient Hebrew texts over those of the Greeks, his unsupported assertion is risible.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn58"> That is, epic in the simple, original sense of epos, a song sung or a related story.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn59"> Most scholars now hold the two epics to be from different lines of transmission, with different origins, and believe that The <cite>Iliad</cite> is the earlier composed. The latter tells the tale of the conflict of two warrior kings, Agamemnon of Mycenae and Achilles of Thessaly, and is believed to mythologize the downfall of a lost Mycenaean civilization through civil war. The <cite>Odyssey</cite> likewise mythologizes ancient Mycenaean grandeur.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn60"> The impiety was not exactly his, but that of his companions. The offenses began well before the blinding of Polyphemos and the proscribed killing of the cattle of the sun-god, Helios. During the capture and sacking of Troy, Ajax, a king of the Locrenses in Greece, son to Oileus, raped Cassandra (the daughter of King Priam) in a temple dedicated to Athene, where she had sought sanctuary. The Achaeans failed to punish Ajax for this outrage, and Athene responded by causing stormy winds to blow most of their ships off-course on their return. Ajax was struck by her with lightning, just as he approached his homeland. This lesser mortal is not to be confused with another, greater Ajax, commander of the Salaminians in the Trojan war and the strongest Greek next Achilles, son to the sea goddess Thetis. Angered that the Achaean princes adjudged Odysseus to have the arms and armour of Achilles (armour crafted by the god Hephaestus, and offered up by Achilles&apos; mother after his death at the hands of Paris, son of Priam of Troy), Ajax committed suicide.

</p><p> According to Ovid, Ajax was turned into a flower: the hyacinth, or violet.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn61"> Odysseus sought to avoid being involved in the military struggle by feigning madness when Palamedes was sent by Agamemnon to Ithaca to recruit him. To show that he was mentally unfit for military service, he yoked an ox and a horse together to his plough, and sowed salt into the ground instead of seed. Palamedes was not taken in by these ruses and placed Odysseus&apos; infant son, Telemachos, in the plough&apos;s way, and Odysseus had little choice but to swerve aside and admit his sanity. He never forgave Palamedes for his insistence that he join the other squadrons and, characteristically, when the chance arose he lured him into a well and crushed him with stones.

</p><p> Palamedes is credited with inventing eleven of the letters of the Greek alphabet.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn62"> In contrast, in Dante&apos;s <cite>Divine Comedy</cite>, Odysseus, alongside Diomedes, is placed in the flaming eighth bolgia of the Inferno (Canto 26): that is, in almost the lowest pit. Dante and his guide meet Ulisse among the false counsellors and learn from him a variant account of his death from the sea, after a prohibited five-month journey beyond the Pillars of Herakles. As the Achaean ship approaches the Mountain of Purgatory, it is wholly spun thrice by a whirlpool and sucked into the deep, with the drowning of all hands.

</p><p> Dante&apos;s fascination with Odysseus, who, like the Algerian Augustine (<cite>Confessions</cite> 10.35), he nevertheless condemns, is that of a man with an antihero. No Greek source was available to Dante. He would, rather, have read the Latin recensions of Dictys and Dares. Two things in particular he would have found most reprehensible. First (according to Virgil), the entering of Odysseus and Diomedes into the citadel of Troy through a secret passage and their theft and removal of the heaven-born paladion, a wooden statue (or xoanon) of Athene that protected the city. (According to legend, it was removed ultimately to Rome to become one of the great symbols of its imperium.) When the thieves took it into their camp, its eyes emitted flames. The second opprobrium was the conceit of the hollow Wooden Horse and the swearing of false vows. The Trojans believed that the Achaeans had at last given up and departed, leaving behind the horse (an offering to Athene) crafted by Epeius. They cut a vertical extension into the opening gates to admit it. During the night, the Achaeans secreted within – thirty of the best warriors hidden in the horse&apos;s body and two hidden as spies in its mouth – slipped out through a secret door and, opening the citadel&apos;s gates from within, allowed the returned Achaeans to enter. The city was ultimately destroyed by fire.

</p><p> Historically, there are a number of reasons why the Wooden Horse was mythologized in this particular way. It may have been that the &ldquo;wooden horse&rdquo; was a siege-engine, covered in damp hides against flaming arrows, or it may have been a ship, in the hull of which the Achaeans were hiding, a ship decorated with a horse&apos;s head. Other scholars suggest that the myth followed a misrepresentation of the actual cause of the fall of Troy, whose walls were originally built by the sea-god Poseidon: an earthquake.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn63"> See in this general connection Michael Seidel <cite>Epic Geography: James Joyce&apos;s Ulysses</cite> (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1976); Danis Rose and John O&apos;Hanlon, <cite>The Lost Notebook</cite> (Split Pea Press, Edinburgh, 1989); and Michael Groden, <cite>Ulysses in Progress</cite> (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1977). Another interesting book is Victor B&eacute;rard&apos;s <cite>Did Homer Live?</cite>, translated by Brian Rhys and published (London and Toronto) in 1931. I have made much use of this.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn64"> These sagas of absence and return were called <i>nostoi</i>.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn65"> Nestor&apos;s father was King Neleus of Pylos. His own brothers were slain by Herakles and he was reared in Gerenia, a city in Messinia. In due course he became leader of the Pylians in the Greek coalition against Troy. By the time of the war, he had already lived two generations and was thus already an old man, relatively speaking, and unfit for warfare, but his wisdom helped the Greeks to maintain civilized ways in the midst of that war&apos;s barbarity. His sons Antinoos and Thrasymedes fought nobly there.

</p><p> Nestor&apos;s great age was granted him by Apollo. The god killed the brothers and sisters of Nestor&apos;s mother Chloris (the famed Niobids) and he sought to make redress by granting to Nestor &ldquo;the years not yet lived of the slain&rdquo;.

</p><p> After the sacking of Troy, by his own account, Nestor and Diomedes put to sea together and then joined Menelaos in Lesbos.  Menelaos was subsequently caught up in a storm and, losing the rest of his fleet, was blown to Egypt with only five ships remaining afloat. He did, however, eventually return safely to Sparta after wandering for seven years.  Diomedes returned to Argos, but finding sedition there he fled for Italy.


</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn66"> The protocol of propitiation among the Greeks was highly ritualized. The animal was taken to the altar set up for the purpose by the sacrificers, whose hands had been washed as an aid to purity. Barley was then scattered onto the animal and it was stunned by a blow to the head. Its head was then tugged back and its throat slit. The skin was then excoriated and such parts of the body as were to be dedicated to the gods were removed: the thighbones and sometimes the tongue. The former was wrapped in a double layer of fat and the outside laced with small strips of meat. This offering was then burnt and the smoke that arose therefrom was believed to placate and please the gods. Drops of wine were likewise dedicated to the gods, and poured onto the burned offering. If the animals were sacrificed in the morning, as here, the dedication were put aside until the late evening.

</p><p> The sacrificers ate the inner organs first and only then the meat, and they drank a mixture of wine and water.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn67"> Of the Achaean generals only Nestor had an uneventful return. He was one of the very few Greek leaders who continued to rule, prosperous and undisturbed, after the Trojan war. He is fabled to have been incapable of uttering an untruth, of being extremely articulate (words poured from his mouth &ldquo;like honey&rdquo;) and immensely wise, and of being the greatest of the &ldquo;tamers of horses&rdquo;.

</p><p> Pylos was one of the principal market towns for the trade in horses. It had good pasture land and was also good for cattle, unlike most of rocky Greece. It was also, singularly, the centre of the worship of Hades, god of the underworld.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn69"> The Kikones dwelt on the southwestern coast of Thrace. They sided with Troy against the Achaeans during the Trojan War and were led by Euphemos (son to Troezenos, son to Ceas). They vanish historically and are remembered most notably by the story of Orpheus, the Thracian lyrist who sought his lover Eurydice in the underworld. He is said to have been ripped to pieces by Kikonian women after he rejected their advances. He was subsequently reincarnated as a swan, or, as Ovid writes, his disembodied head bobbed on the sea until it came to rest on the island of Lesbos, where it continued to speak, uttering prophesies.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn70"> Cape Malea is a peninsula and cape in the southeast of Greece and is the south-easternmost cape in continental Europe. It overlooks a strategic sea-passage in the eastern Mediterranean that joins the Aegean with the Ionian Islands and western Europe. The seas around the cape have traditionally been treacherous and difficult to navigate. The island of Cythera (or Kythira) is strategically located between the Greek mainland and Crete at the southwestern exit from the Aegean Sea, behind Cape Malea.

</p><p> In Ancient Greek mythology, here was believed to lie the island of Aphrodite, the Goddess of love, and from ancient times (and onward until the mid-nineteenth century) it was a crossroads of merchants, sailors, and war expeditions. It has had a long and varied history and has been influenced by many cultures and civilizations. The sea-snail that produces the prized Tyrian purple dye is native to the island.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn71"> Herodotus, writing in the fifth century B.C., believed that the lotopagoi or lotophages still existed in his day, in coastal Libya.  As they once did, in San Francisco, for example, and parts of present-day Ballydehob. He writes: &ldquo;A promontory jutting out into the sea from the country of the Gindanes is inhabited by the lotus-eaters, who live entirely on the fruit of the lotus-tree. The lotus fruit is about the size of the lentisk berry and in sweetness resembles the date. The lotus-eaters even succeed in obtaining from it a sort of wine.&rdquo;

</p><p> Polybius, and later Strabo,  locates them differently, in the island of Djerba (anciently, Meninx) off the Tunisian coast.  As for the plant, it was possibly Nymphaea caerulea, N. lotus, or N. stellata. The first-mentioned, the &ldquo;blue lily&rdquo; of the Nile, has psychotropic and soporific properties. Traditionally, the plant was believed to be Ziziphus lotus, a relative of the jujube. There are many other contending plants, such as the opium poppy, each with similar narcotic properties. The Greek word lotos means simply &ldquo;the fruit that brings oblivion to those who eat it&rdquo;.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn72"> The Lotus-Eaters seem to have been a kind of happy-go-lucky hippy community, and no harm or hurt befell the Achaeans while in their country.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn74"> Anciently, the winds were conceived of as horse-shaped spirits. The floating Aeolian island of Homer, Aiolia, was in the time of Pausanias believed to be Lipara, and this or Strongyle was accordingly regarded in later times as the place in which the god of the winds dwelled. Other accounts locate it elsewhere, in Thrace or near Rhegium in Italy.  The adjective &lsquo;aiolos&rsquo;  (= glittering) was applied to the starry night-sky.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn75"> According to Thucydides (6.2.1.) and Polybius (1.2.9), the Laestrygones inhabited southeast Sicily.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn76"> Aiaia is the &ldquo;(island of the) sea-hawk&rdquo;. It is said of Kirke that she poisoned her husband, the king of the Scythians, and was exiled by the citizens to Italy, where, cast out, she dwelt in a promontory called the Cape of Kirke. While there, she magically changed Skylla into a sea monster and Picus, king of the Latin people, into a woodpecker. Berard identifies Kirke with the Roman goddess Feronia, the &ldquo;freer of slaves&rdquo; and her cave with a grotto at an isthmus close to the Pontine swamp. When slaves were freed at her temple, they were ritually shaved (thus Odysseus&apos; men, turned into slaves [pigs)] by Kirke, on being liberated from their suine shape stand erect and &ldquo;lose their bristles&rdquo;).

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn77"> Teiresias, the inventor of augury, was a blind prophet of Apollo in Thebes. He was son to the shepherd Everes and the nymph Charlico, and is reputed to have understood the language of birds. He could divine the future from signatures in fire, or smoke; however, it was the communications of the dead that he most relied on, menacing them when they came late to attend him.

</p><p> He is most noted for having been changed into a woman and, years later, refashioned as a man. Tradition has it that on Mount Cyllene in the Peloponnese he came upon a pair of coupling serpents and struck them with a stick. The goddess Hera was displeased and punished him by transforming him into a woman. As a woman, she (he) became a priestess of Hera, married and had a child. After seven years, she (he) again encountered mating snakes and trampled on them, and with this, was released from womanhood and turned back into a man.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn78"> In extant Hellenistic-Roman mosaics, Phorcys is depicted as a fish-tailed merman with crab-claw forelegs and red, spiky skin.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn79"> In the <cite>Metamorphoses</cite> of Ovid (12-14),  Skylla was said to have transformed by a jealous Kirke into a monster. She is elsewhere identified with Skylla, daughter to and betrayer of King Nisus of Megara, out of love for Minos, king of Crete.  She was often rationalized in antiquity as a rock or reef. In mythology, Charybdis aided her father Poseidon in a feud with her paternal uncle Zeus and, as such, helped him engulf lands and islands in water. Zeus, enraged by this, caused her to be chained to the sea-bed and transformed into a grotesque monster with fish&apos;s limbs and an unquenchable thirst for seawater.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn80"> In Greek mythology, Lampetia (&ldquo;shining&rdquo;) was the daughter of Helios and Neaera. She was the personification of light. With Phaethusa she was taken by Neaera to safeguard the cattle and sheep of Thrinakria, the &ldquo;Isle of the Trident&rdquo;. With a silver crock Lampetia shepherded the sheep; with a copper staff, Phaethusa the cattle.

</p><p> These daughters of Neaira, known as the Neairides (or &ldquo;new risings&rdquo;), seem to represent the measure of days and nights in the year. The word phaeth&ocirc; (&ldquo;shining&rdquo;) was usually associated with the sun while lampeta&ocirc; (&ldquo;to shine like a lamp&rdquo;) was associated with the moon. Each sister tended a total of seven herds of fifty: one for each of the seven days of the week. The total number (350) is fifteen days short of 365; however, the ancient Greeks customarily divided the year into twelve lunar months, and added a thirteenth month every few years to correct the imperfection. The herds were divided into fifty animals, representing the number of lunar months in a Great Year, a four-year cycle in which solar and lunar calendars were believed to coincide.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn81"> Ogygia, and indeed that other mysterious place, the island of Phaeacia,  have been identified with the now-sunken island of Atlantis. A different tradition, begun by Euhemerus in the late fourth century B.C. and endorsed by Callimachus, identifies it with the Maltese island of Gozo.  (Eustathius, the Byzantine grammarian, argued that Gozo was the first name for Egypt.) B&eacute;rard suggests that Kalypso&apos;s isle is close to Gibraltar.


</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn82"> The Phaeacians took no part in the Trojan war. Many of their characteristics, their seafaring life and generosity, are suggestive of Minoan Crete. The walls of the palace there that &ldquo;shone like the sun&rdquo; are covered perhaps not with bronze but with orichalcum. The location of the land of the Phaeacians is uncertain, though Corfu (anciently, Corcyra) has been suggested. It cannot have been close to Ithaca, as its people call Odysseus a stranger and it takes some time to reach Ithaca from Scheria, even on a magical ship a gyr-falcon could not out-speed: a ship steered by thought alone.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn83"> The Thesprotians, who were friendly with the Ithacans, were the guardians of the Dodona oracle, the oldest in Greece. They were part of the Epirus until annexed into the Roman Empire.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn88"> The <cite>Odyssey</cite> had a now-lost sequel, the Telegony, otherwise the Thesprotis, concerning Telegonos, son to Odysseus by Kirke; one most probably composed in the sixth century B.C. This was not written by Homer and was in antiquity usually attributed to Eugamon or Eugammon of Kyrene or to Cinaethon of Sparta. Only two lines of the original text survive. A summary account of the work, however, can be found in the Chrestomathy of Proclus.  According to this, the Telegony opens with the burial of the suitors. Odysseus makes sacrifices to the mystic nymphs of the damp grotto in which he had buried his treasure. He leaves for Elis to visit Polyxenos, who gives him a bowl depicting the story of Trophonios, before returning to Ithaca and from there going on to Thesprotia to perform the rituals ordered by Antinoos in Od. 11.

</p><p> While in Thesprotia, Odysseus marries Queen Kallidike and they have a child. Naturally, he aids these people in their war against the Brygoi, a neighbouring tribe. Even the gods, Ares pitched against Athene, participate in this war. Apollo intervenes to end it. Kallidike, however, is killed and their son, Polypoites, succeeds to the kingdom. Odysseus then returns to Ithaca.

</p><p> Kirke, on her island of Aiaia, gave birth to an older son of Odysseus, Telegonos, half-brother to Telemachos. Telegonos grows up on Aiaia and from Kirke learns the identity of his absent father. At one point, at Kirke&apos;s request, Hephaistos fashions for him a magical spear out of a marine sting-ray. Armed with this, he sets out in quest of his father and happens to put in at the island of Ithaca to rustle the cattle there. Odysseus challenges the stranger and in the course of the ensuing tussle is mortally wounded, as seemingly foretold by Antinoos, who warned him that death would come to him eks halos, &ldquo;out of the sea&rdquo; (i.e., from the poison of the fish).  As Odysseus dies, he and Telegonos recognize each other. Dismayed at killing him, Telegonos takes the body back with him to Aiaia for burial. He also brings Penelope and Telemachos along, and Kirke makes these immortal. Telegonos then marries Penelope, and Telemachos marries Kirke.

</p><p> This version of things, however, is a misinterpretation of the Homeric expression &ldquo;eks halos&rdquo;, which properly means &ldquo;away from the sea:&rdquo;  that is, far distant from the sea. Antinoos, moreover, foretells a gentle death (Od. 11.135) in comfortable old age, which is far from dying in agony from the poison of a sting-ray. What Homer suggests is that Odysseus will cease to be a seafarer and will travel inland to places where his oar is unknown as an oar and is taken instead for a winnowing-fan (both are bladed implements made of fir, similar in appearance and size). There he is to bury his oar in the ground, renounce his former sea-life, and, in propitiation of the god Poseidon, promote his worship in this new place.

</p><p> Sophocles&apos; now-lost <cite>Odysseus Acanthoplex</cite> also has Odysseus slain by Telegonos.

</p><p> There exist traces of yet another variant on his death, one in which Telegonos plays no part: a bird defecates on the hero&apos;s head, and he perishes from a poisonous sting embedded in the excrement.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn90"> It is truer to say that Parnell fell through the scandal-mongering of his Irish enemies, not least the Catholic priests. He chose to remain faithful to Kitty O&apos;Shea, another man&apos;s wife, and she to him. This shifting of responsibility is evident in the Achaeans&apos; hypocrisy also. Troy was sacked for the promotion of their wealth and control of international trade. The Hellenes&apos; outrage at Paris offending Menelaus by running off with his woman, noted beauty that she was, was ostensible only.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn91"> In this context Joyce uses the word &ldquo;signatures:&rdquo; Aristotle &ldquo;signs.&rdquo;

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn92"> That is, Joachim of Fiore [Gloacchino da Fiore] (c. 1135 – 30 March 1202), a mystic and theologian from Calabria in Italy. Joachim visited the Holy Land and some event there precipitated his conversion to monasticism. On his return to Italy he lived as a hermit for many years. Subsequently he joined the Cistercian abbey as a lay brother, and was ordained in 1168. He was intellectually most concerned with escatology and studied the arcane messages buried in the Bible, in particular in John&apos;s Revelation. He was highly regarded as a holy man and founded the Order of San Giovanni in Flore in the mountains of Calabria.

</p><p> His three great works outlining his theological views were hugely influential and he advocated three great ages or epochs of history, to culminate in the impending Age of the Holy Spirit, in which all things would appear lucidly to mankind, the church would no longer be necessary as a guide, and an era of peace would ensue. At the Synod of Arles, his theories (but not the man himself) were declared heretical. Even so, he is venerated as a beatus, on May 29.

</p><p> Thomas Aquinas confuted Joachim in his <cite>Summa Theologica</cite>.

</p><p> What Stephen was reading, however, was not the mystical work of Joachim, but that of imitators, who put out books of prophecies under his name.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn93"> Even so, the evocative passage concerning Paris  &ldquo;rawly waking&rdquo;  was originally written by him to describe Trieste, and not Paris.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn94"> This  &ldquo;recall to Zion&rdquo; which Bloom spurns, contrasts with Odysseus&apos; compulsion to return to Ithaca.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn95"> Odysseus was effectively Kalypso&apos;s lover for six or seven years. Indeed, Hesiod relates that he had two sons by her, Nausithoos and Nausinoos. In the <cite>Odyssey</cite> on the night before launching his raft they copulate one last time, for old time&apos;s sake, so to speak.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn96"> Kalypso points out to the love-captive Odysseus that she is much better-looking than Penelope, with a better-shaped body, and taller.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn97"> According to this account, once Odysseus had returned and seen to the usurpers, he travels overland to Thesprotia where he marries Queen Kallidike and they have a son named Polypoetes. Odysseus later leads her people in war against the Brygeians, but is defeated. When Kallidike dies, Odysseus leaves their son in charge of affairs and again returns alone to Ithaca and to Penelope. In some sense, Kallidike is thus a Calypso-like figure (a woman other than his wife with whom Odysseus has an extended sexual engagement).

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn98"> B&eacute;rard argues that the land of the Lotus Eaters is Djerba, near Libya in Africa. The ancient Greeks characteristically named geographical areas by the distinctive food its inhabitants consumed.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn99"> Traditionally, the lotos was a kind of clover (or shamrock) on which horses fed. The Cyrenean lotus was really a shrub, the fruit of which was eaten by some natives. B&eacute;rard (whose work Joyce read preparatory to writing <cite>Ulysses</cite>) holds that lotos derives from the Semitic word lot, meaning perfume or incense, and he identifies the plant as an edible species of water-lily that grows along the Libyan coast.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn100">  	The exact number of heads the hell-hound had varies, but is traditionally three. Hesiod has Cerberus with fifty heads, and Horace a hundred, calling it bellua centiceps.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn101"> Bloom thinks: &ldquo;Now who is that lankylooking galoot over there in the macintosh? Now who is he I&apos;d like to know? Now, I&apos;d give a trifle to know who he is. Always someone turns up you never dreamt of.&rdquo; The interloper&apos;s presence seems significant: &ldquo;Mr Bloom stood far back, his hat in his hand, counting the bared heads. Twelve. I&apos;m thirteen. No. The chap in the macintosh is thirteen. Death&apos;s number. Where the deuce did he pop out of? He wasn&apos;t in the chapel, that I&apos;ll swear. Silly superstition that about thirteen.&rdquo;
</p><p> He reappears in Wandering Rocks: &ldquo;In Lower Mount street a pedestrian in a brown macintosh, eating dry bread, passed swiftly and unscathed across the viceroy&apos;s path.&rdquo; And later in Circe: &ldquo;A man in a brown macintosh springs up through a trapdoor.&rdquo;
</p><p> The mysterious macintosh man is mentioned eleven times in all in the novel, yet with almost no detail. In Cyclops we learn that the &ldquo;man in the brown macintosh loves a lady who is dead,&rdquo; and in Ithaca the question is posed: &ldquo;What selfinvolved enigma did Bloom risen, going, gathering multicoloured multiform multitudinous garments, voluntarily apprehending, not comprehend? Who was M&apos;Intosh?&rdquo;
</p><p> While Mr Duffy seems the best contender,  in his Cornell University lectures on <cite>Ulysses</cite>, Vladimir Nabokov suggested (unlikely as it is) that the &ldquo;chap in the macintosh&rdquo; is none other than James Joyce himself. In Scylla and Charybdis Stephen Dedalus explains that Shakespeare &ldquo;has hidden his own name, a fair name, William, in the plays, a super here, a clown there, as a painter of old Italy set his face in a dark corner of his canvas.&rdquo; This, Nabokov holds, &ldquo;is exactly what Joyce has done — setting his face in a dark corner of his canvas. The Man in the Brown Macintosh who passes through the dream of the book is no other than the author himself. Bloom glimpses his maker!&rdquo;

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn102"> In the notes he gathered for Aeolus, Joyce went to great lengths to list as many common phrases as he could that involved the metaphor of wind (&ldquo;raising the wind&rdquo;, &ldquo;windfall&rdquo;, and so on).

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn107"> Leucothea is not, as Joyce seems to believe (pairing her as he does with Parthenope) one of the two Sirens, but is the white goddess that rises from the water in the form of a kittiwake to assist Odysseus, lost at sea on leaving the isle of Calypso.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="udn108"> The Sirens were not, as is half-suggested by Joyce in this episode, types of mermaids, with the upper body of a sensual woman and the lower body of a fish. They were classically imagined as half-women and half-birds of prey. One of the duo, Parthenope, is said to have drowned herself because she could not shipwreck Odysseus through the sweetness of her voice. Appropriately, the city of Naples is dedicated to her. Odysseus, being bound, has no choice but to spurn their charms. So also is Bloom, bound by his passivity and the vicarious nature of his desires. He is stuck in the bar, twiddling his thumbs, while saucy Boylan jingles his way to the front door of the house in Eccles Street to seduce his wife.
