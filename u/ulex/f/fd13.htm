<p> Martin Cunningham, first, poked his silkhatted head into the creaking
carriage and, entering deftly, seated himself. Mr Power stepped in after him, curving his height with care.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Come on, Simon.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; After you, Mr Bloom said.</p>
<p> Mr Dedalus covered himself quickly and got in, saying:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, yes.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Are we all here now? Martin Cunningham asked. Come along, Bloom.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom entered and sat in the vacant place. He pulled the door to after
him and slammed it
<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">twice</span></span>

till it shut tight. He passed an arm through the armstrap and looked seriously
from the open carriage window at the lowered blinds of the avenue. One dragged
aside: an old woman peeping. Nose whiteflattened against the pane. Thanking her
stars she was passed over. Extraordinary the interest they take in a corpse.
Glad to see us go we give them such trouble coming. Job seems to suit them.
Huggermugger in corners. Slop about in slipperslappers for fear he&apos;d wake.
Then getting it ready. Laying it out. Molly and Mrs Fleming making the bed. Pull
it more to your side. Our windingsheet. Never know who will touch you dead. Wash
and shampoo. I believe they clip the nails and the hair. Keep a bit in an
envelope.

all the same after. Unclean job.</p>
<p> All waited. Nothing was said. Stowing in the wreaths probably. I am sitting
on something hard. Ah, that soap in my hip pocket. Better shift it out of that. Wait for an opportunity.</p>
<p> All waited. Then wheels were heard from in front, turning: then nearer: then
horses&apos; hoofs. A jolt. Their carriage began to move, creaking and swaying.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 85}</font>
<br> Other hoofs and creaking wheels started behind. The blinds of the avenue
passed and number
<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">nine</span></span>
ten<a target="foot" id="fff0004">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
with its craped knocker, door ajar. At walking pace.</p>
<p> They waited still, their knees jogging, till they had turned and were
passing along the tramtracks. Tritonville road. Quicker. The wheels rattled
rolling over the cobbled causeway and the crazy glasses shook rattling in the doorframes.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What way is he taking us? Mr Power asked through both windows.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Irishtown, Martin Cunningham said. Ringsend. Brunswick street.</p>
<p> Mr Dedalus nodded, looking out.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That&apos;s a fine old custom, he said. I am glad to see it has not died out.</p>
<p> All watched awhile through their windows caps and hats lifted by passers.
Respect. The carriage swerved from the tramtrack to the smoother road past
Watery lane. Mr Bloom at gaze saw a lithe young man, clad in mourning, a wide hat.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There&apos;s a friend of yours gone by, Dedalus, he said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who is that?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Your son and heir.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Where is he? Mr Dedalus said, stretching
over<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font>,<a target="foot" id="fff0005">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
across.</p>
<p> The carriage, passing the open drains and mounds of rippedup roadway before
the tenement houses, lurched round the corner and, swerving back to the
tramtrack, rolled on noisily with chattering wheels. Mr Dedalus fell back,

<p class="di">&mdash; No, Mr Bloom said. He was alone.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Down with his aunt Sally, I suppose, Mr Dedalus said, the
Goulding faction, the drunken little costdrawer and Crissie, papa&apos;s little
lump of dung, the wise child that knows her own father.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom smiled joylessly on Ringsend road. Wallace

bottleworks. Dodder bridge.</p>
<p> Richie Goulding and the legal bag. Goulding, Collis and Ward he calls the
firm. His jokes are getting a bit damp. Great card he was. Waltzing in Stamer
street with Ignatius Gallaher on a Sunday morning, the landlady&apos;s two hats
pinned on his head. Out on the rampage all night. Beginning to tell on him now:
that backache of his, I fear. Wife ironing his back. Thinks he&apos;ll cure it
with pills. All breadcrumbs they are. About six hundred per cent profit.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He&apos;s in with a lowdown crowd, Mr Dedalus snarled.
That Mulligan is a contaminated bloody doubledyed ruffian by all accounts. His name stinks all
<br><font color="green">{u22, 86}</font>
<br> over Dublin. But with the help of God and His blessed mother I&apos;ll make
it my business to write a letter one of those days to his mother or his aunt or
whatever she is that will open her eye as wide as a gate. I&apos;ll tickle his catastrophe, believe you me.</p>
<p> He cried above the clatter of the wheels.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I won&apos;t have her bastard of a nephew ruin my son. A
counterjumper&apos;s son. Selling tapes in my cousin, Peter Paul M&apos;Swiney&apos;s. Not likely.</p>
<p> He ceased. Mr Bloom glanced from his angry moustache to Mr Power&apos;s mild
face and Martin Cunningham&apos;s eyes and beard, gravely shaking. Noisy
selfwilled man. Full of his son. He is right. Something to hand on. If little
Rudy had lived. See him grow up. Hear his voice in the house. Walking beside
Molly in an Eton suit. My son. Me in his eyes. Strange feeling it would be. From
me. Just a chance. Must have been that morning in Raymond terrace she was at the
window, watching the two dogs at it by the wall of the cease to do evil. And the
sergeant grinning up. She had that cream gown on with the rip she never
stitched. Give us a touch, Poldy. God, I&apos;m dying for it. How life begins.</p>
<p> Got big then. Had to refuse the Greystones concert. My son inside her. I
could have helped him on in life. I could. Make him independent. Learn German too.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Are we late? Mr Power asked.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ten minutes, Martin Cunningham said, looking at his watch.</p>
<p> Molly. Milly. Same thing watered down. Her tomboy oaths. O jumping Jupiter!
Ye gods and little fishes! Still, she&apos;s a dear girl. Soon be a woman.
Mullingar. Dearest Papli. Young student. Yes, yes: a woman too.

<p> The carriage heeled over and back, their four trunks swaying.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Corny might have given us a more commodious yoke, Mr Power said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He might, Mr Dedalus said, if he hadn&apos;t that squint troubling him. Do you follow me?</p>
<p> He closed his left eye. Martin Cunningham began to brush away crustcrumbs from under his thighs.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What is
this<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span>?<a target="foot" id="fff0014">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
he said, in the name of God? Crumbs?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Someone seems to have been making a picnic party here lately, Mr Power said.</p>
<p> All raised their thighs
<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">and</span></span>,<a target="foot" id="fff0015">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
eyed with disfavour the mildewed buttonless leather of the seats. Mr Dedalus,
twisting his nose, frowned downward and said:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Unless I&apos;m greatly mistaken. What do you think, Martin?
<br><font color="green">{u22, 87}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It struck me too, Martin Cunningham said.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom set his thigh down. Glad I took that bath. Feel my feet quite
clean. But I wish Mrs Fleming had darned these socks better.</p>
<p> Mr Dedalus sighed resignedly.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; After all, he said, it&apos;s the most natural thing in the world.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Did Tom Kernan turn up? Martin Cunningham asked, twirling the peak of his beard gently.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, Mr Bloom answered. He&apos;s behind with Ned Lambert and Hynes.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And Corny Kelleher himself? Mr Power asked.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; At the cemetery, Martin Cunningham said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I met M&apos;Coy this morning, Mr Bloom said. He said he&apos;d try to come.</p>
<p> The carriage halted short.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What&apos;s wrong?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; We&apos;re stopped.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Where are we?</p>
<p> Mr Bloom put his head out of the window.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The grand canal, he said.</p>
<p> Gasworks. Whooping cough they say it cures. Good job Milly never got it.
Poor children! Doubles

up black and blue in convulsions. Shame really. Got off lightly with illnesses
compared. Only measles. Flaxseed tea. Scarlatina, influenza epidemics.
Canvassing for death. Don&apos;t miss this chance. Dogs&apos; home over there.
Poor old Athos! Be good to Athos, Leopold, is my last wish. Thy will be done. We
obey them in the grave. A dying scrawl. He took it to heart, pined away. Quiet
brute. Old men&apos;s dogs usually are.</p>
<p> A raindrop spat on his hat. He drew back and saw an instant of shower spray
dots over the grey flags. Apart. Curious. Like through a colander. I thought it
would. My boots were creaking I remember now.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The weather is changing, he said quietly.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A pity it did not keep up fine, Martin Cunningham said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Wanted for the country, Mr Power said. There&apos;s the sun again coming out.</p>
<p> Mr Dedalus, peering through his glasses towards the veiled sun, hurled a mute curse at the sky.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It&apos;s as uncertain as a child&apos;s bottom, he said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; We&apos;re off again.</p>
<p> The carriage turned again its stiff wheels and their trunks swayed gently.
Martin Cunningham twirled more quickly the peak of his beard.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 88}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Tom Kernan was immense last night, he said. And Paddy Leonard taking him off to his face.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O draw him out, Martin, Mr Power said eagerly. Wait till
you hear him, Simon, on Ben Dollard&apos;s singing of <i>The Croppy Boy</i>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Immense, Martin Cunningham said pompously. <i>His singing
of that simple ballad, Martin, is the most trenchant rendering I ever heard in
the whole course of my experience.</i></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Trenchant, Mr Power said laughing. He&apos;s dead nuts on
that. And the retrospective arrangement.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Did you read Dan Dawson&apos;s speech? Martin Cunningham asked.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I did not then, Mr Dedalus said. Where is it?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; In the paper this morning.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom took the paper from his inside pocket. That book I must change for her.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; No, no, Mr Dedalus said quickly. Later on, please.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom&apos;s glance travelled down the edge of the paper, scanning the
deaths. Callan, Coleman, Dignam, Fawcett, Lowry, Naumann, Peake, what Peake is
that? is it the chap was in Crosbie and Alleyne&apos;s? no, Sexton, Urbright.
Inked characters fast fading on the frayed breaking paper. Thanks to the Little
Flower. Sadly missed. To the inexpressible grief of his. Aged 88 after a long
and tedious illness. Month&apos;s
mind<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span><a target="foot" id="fff0020">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>

<p class="set"><i>It is now a month since dear Henry fled
<br> To his home up above in the sky

<p> I tore up the envelope? Yes. Where did I put her letter after I read it in
the bath? He patted his waistcoat pocket. There all right. Dear Henry fled. Before my patience are exhausted.</p>
<p> National school. Meade&apos;s yard. The hazard. Only two there now. Nodding.
Full as a tick. Too much bone in their skulls. The other trotting round with a
fare. An hour ago I was passing there. The jarvies raised their hats.</p>
<p> A pointsman&apos;s back straightened itself upright suddenly against a
tramway standard by Mr Bloom&apos;s window. Couldn&apos;t they invent something automatic
<br><font color="green">{u22, 89}</font>
<br> so that the wheel itself much handier? Well but that fellow would lose his
job then? Well but then another fellow would get a job making the new invention?</p>
<p> Antient concert rooms. Nothing on there. A man in a buff suit with a crape
armlet. Not much grief there. Quarter mourning. People in law, perhaps.</p>

Martin Cunningham could work a pass for the Gaiety. Have to stand a drink or two. As broad as it&apos;s long.</p>
<p> He&apos;s coming in the afternoon. Her songs.</p>
<p> Plasto&apos;s. Sir Philip Crampton&apos;s memorial fountain bust. Who was he?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; How do you do? Martin Cunningham said, raising his palm to his brow in salute.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He doesn&apos;t see us, Mr Power said. Yes, he does. How do you do?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who? Mr Dedalus asked.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Blazes Boylan, Mr Power said. There he is airing his quiff.</p>
<p> Just that moment I was thinking.</p>
<p> Mr Dedalus bent across to salute. From the door of the Red Bank the white
disc of a straw hat flashed reply: passed.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom reviewed the nails of his left hand, then those of his right hand.
The nails, yes. Is there anything more in him that they she sees? Fascination.
Worst man in Dublin. That keeps him alive. They sometimes feel what a person is.
Instinct. But a type like that. My nails. I am just looking at them: well pared.
And after: thinking alone. Body getting a bit softy. I would notice that from
remembering. What causes

I suppose the skin can&apos;t contract quickly enough when the flesh falls off.
But the shape is there. The shape is there still. Shoulders. Hips. Plump. Night
of the dance dressing. Shift stuck between the cheeks behind.</p>
<p> He clasped his hands between his knees and, satisfied, sent his vacant glance over their faces.</p>
<p> Mr Power asked:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; How is the concert tour getting on, Bloom?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O very well, Mr Bloom said. I hear great accounts of it.
It&apos;s a good idea, you see&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Are you going yourself?
<br><font color="green">{u22, 90}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Well no, Mr Bloom said. In point of fact I have to go down
to the county Clare on some private business. You see the idea is to tour the
chief towns. What you lose on one you can make up on the other.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Quite so, Martin Cunningham said. Mary Anderson is up there now.</p>
<p class="di"><font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font>&mdash;<a target="foot" id="fff0026">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
Have you good artists?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Louis Werner is touring her, Mr Bloom said. O yes,
we&apos;ll have all topnobbers. J.C. Doyle and John MacCormack I hope and. The best, in fact.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And <i>Madame</i>, Mr Power said, smiling. Last but not least.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom unclasped his hands in a gesture of soft politeness and clasped
them. Smith O&apos;Brien. Someone has laid a bunch of flowers there. Woman. Must
be his deathday. For many happy returns. The carriage wheeling by Farrell&apos;s
statue united noiselessly their unresisting knees.</p>
<p> Oot: a dullgarbed old man from the curbstone tendered his wares, his mouth opening: oot.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Four bootlaces for a penny.</p>
<p> Wonder why he was struck off the rolls. Had his office in Hume street. Same
house as Molly&apos;s
namesake<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span>.<a target="foot" id="fff0027">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
Tweedy, crown solicitor for Waterford. Has that silk hat ever since. Relics of

at the tips of her hairs to see if they are split. <i>Mi trema un poco il</i>.
Beautiful on that <i>tre</i> her voice is: weeping tone. A thrush. A throstle.
There is a word throstle that expresses that.</p>
<p> His eyes passed lightly over Mr Power&apos;s goodlooking face. Greyish over
the ears. <i>Madame</i>: smiling. I smiled back. A smile goes a long way. Only
politeness perhaps. Nice fellow. Who knows is that true about the woman he
keeps? Not pleasant for the wife. Yet they say, who was it told me, there is no
carnal. You would imagine that would get played out pretty quick. Yes, it was

was? Barmaid in Jury&apos;s. Or the Moira, was it?</p>
<p> They passed under the hugecloaked Liberator&apos;s form.</p>
<p> Martin Cunningham nudged Mr Power.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Of the tribe of Reuben, he said.</p>
<p> A tall blackbearded figure, bent on a stick, stumping round the corner of
Elvery&apos;s elephant house showed them a curved hand open on his spine.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 91}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; In all his pristine beauty, Mr Power said.</p>
<p> Mr Dedalus looked after the stumping figure and said mildly:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The devil break the hasp of your back!</p>
<p> Mr Power, collapsing in laughter, shaded his face from the window as the carriage passed Gray&apos;s statue.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; We have all been there, Martin Cunningham said broadly.</p>
<p> His eyes met Mr Bloom&apos;s eyes. He caressed his beard, adding:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Well, nearly all of us.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom began to speak with sudden eagerness to his companions&apos; faces.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That&apos;s an awfully good one that&apos;s going the rounds about Reuben J. and the son.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; About the boatman? Mr Power asked.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes. Isn&apos;t it awfully good?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What is that? Mr Dedalus
asked<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span>,<a target="foot" id="fff0029">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
I didn&apos;t hear it.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There was a girl in the case, Mr Bloom began, and he
determined to send him to the isle of Man out of harm&apos;s way but when they were both&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What? Mr Dedalus asked. That confirmed bloody hobbledehoy is it?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, Mr Bloom said. They were both on the way to the boat and he tried to drown&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Drown Barabbas! Mr Dedalus cried. I wish to Christ he did!</p>
<p> Mr Power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; No, Mr Bloom said, the son himself&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> Martin Cunningham thwarted his speech

<p class="di">&mdash; Reuben J. and the son were piking it down the quay next
the river on their way to the isle of Man boat and the young chiseller suddenly
got loose and over the wall with him into the Liffey.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; For God&apos; sake! Mr Dedalus exclaimed in fright. Is he dead?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Dead! Martin Cunningham cried. Not he! A boatman got a
pole and fished him out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to the
father on the
quay<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font>.</font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>

dead than alive. Half the town was there.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, Mr Bloom said. But the funny part is&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And Reuben J., Martin Cunningham said, gave the boatman a
florin for saving his son&apos;s life.</p>
<p> A stifled sigh came from under Mr Power&apos;s hand.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O, he did, Martin Cunningham affirmed. Like a hero. A silver florin.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Isn&apos;t it awfully good? Mr Bloom said eagerly.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; One and eightpence too much, Mr Dedalus said drily.

<p> Mr Power&apos;s choked laugh burst quietly in the carriage.</p>
<p> Nelson&apos;s pillar.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Eight plums a penny! Eight for a penny!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; We had better look a little serious, Martin Cunningham said.</p>
<p> Mr Dedalus sighed.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ah then indeed, he said, poor little Paddy wouldn&apos;t
grudge us a laugh. Many a good one he told himself.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The Lord forgive me! Mr Power said, wiping his wet eyes
with his fingers. Poor Paddy! I little thought a week ago when I saw him last
and he was in his usual health that I&apos;d be driving after him like this. He&apos;s gone from us.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; As decent a little man as ever wore a hat, Mr Dedalus said. He went very suddenly.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Breakdown, Martin Cunningham said. Heart.</p>
<p> He tapped his chest sadly.</p>
<p> Blazing face: redhot. Too much John Barleycorn. Cure for a red nose. Drink
like the devil till it turns adelite. A lot of money he spent colouring it.</p>
<p> Mr Power gazed at the passing houses with rueful apprehension.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He had a sudden death, poor fellow, he said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The best death, Mr Bloom said.</p>

eyes looked at him.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; No suffering, he said. A moment and all is over. Like dying in sleep.</p>
<p> No-one spoke.</p>
<p> Dead side of the street this. Dull business by day, land agents, temperance
hotel, Falconer&apos;s railway guide, civil service college, Gill&apos;s,
catholic club, the industrious blind. Why? Some reason. Sun or wind. At night
too. Chummies and slaveys. Under the patronage of the late Father

galloping. A

married. Piebald for bachelors. Dun for a nun.</p>

the man. Better luck next time.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 93}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Poor little thing, Mr Dedalus said. It&apos;s well out of it.</p>
<p> The carriage climbed more slowly the hill of Rutland square. Rattle his
bones. Over the stones. Only a pauper. Nobody owns.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; In the midst of life, Martin Cunningham said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; But the worst of all, Mr Power said, is the man who takes his own life.</p>
<p> Martin Cunningham drew out his watch briskly, coughed and put it back.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The greatest disgrace to have in the family, Mr Power added.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Temporary insanity, of course, Martin Cunningham said
decisively. We must take a charitable view of it.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; They say a man who does it is a coward, Mr Dedalus said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It is not for us to judge, Martin Cunningham said.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom, about to speak, closed his lips again. Martin Cunningham&apos;s
large eyes. Looking away now. Sympathetic human man he is. Intelligent. Like
Shakespeare&apos;s face. Always a good word to say. They have no mercy on that
here or infanticide. Refuse christian burial. They used to drive a stake of wood
through his heart in the grave. As if it wasn&apos;t broken already. Yet
sometimes they repent too late. Found in the riverbed clutching rushes. He
looked at me. And that awful drunkard of a wife of his. Setting up house for her
time after time and then pawning the furniture on him every Saturday almost.
Leading him the life of the damned. Wear the heart out of a stone, that. Monday

Dedalus told me he was in there. Drunk about the place and capering with Martin&apos;s umbrella:</p>

<i>And they call me the jewel of Asia,</i>
<br> <i>Of Asia,</i>
<br> <i>The geisha</i>.</p>
<p> He looked away from me. He knows. Rattle his bones.</p>
<p> That afternoon of the inquest. The redlabelled bottle on the table. The room
in the hotel with hunting pictures. Stuffy it was. Sunlight through the slats of
the Venetian blinds. The coroner&apos;s ears, big and hairy. Boots giving
evidence. Thought he was asleep first. Then saw like yellow streaks on his face.
Had slipped down to the foot of the bed. Verdict: overdose. Death by misadventure. The letter. For my son Leopold.</p>
<p> No more pain. Wake no more. Nobody owns.</p>
<p> The carriage rattled swiftly along Blessington street. Over the stones.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 94}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; We are going the pace, I think, Martin Cunningham said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; God grant he doesn&apos;t upset us on the road, Mr Power said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I hope not, Martin Cunningham said. That will be a great
race tomorrow in Germany. The Gordon Bennett.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, by Jove, Mr Dedalus said. That will be worth seeing, faith.</p>
<p> As they turned into Berkeley street a streetorgan near the Basin sent over
and after them a rollicking rattling song of the halls. Has anybody here seen

Eccles street. My house down there. Big place. Ward for incurables there. Very
encouraging. Our Lady&apos;s Hospice for the dying. Deadhouse handy underneath.
Where old Mrs Riordan died. They look terrible the women. Her feeding cup and
rubbing her mouth with the spoon. Then the screen round her bed for her to die.
Nice young student that was dressed that bite the bee gave me. He&apos;s gone
over to the lying-in hospital they told me. From one extreme to the other.</p>
<p> The carriage galloped round a corner: stopped.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What&apos;s wrong now?</p>
<p> A divided drove of branded cattle passed the windows, lowing, slouching by
on padded hoofs, whisking their tails slowly on their clotted bony croups.
Outside them and through them ran raddled sheep bleating their fear.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Emigrants, Mr Power said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Huuuh! the drover&apos;s voice cried, his switch sounding
on their flanks. Huuuh!
<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Out</span></span>
out<a target="foot" id="fff0044">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font> of that!</p>
<p> Thursday of course. Tomorrow is killing day. Springers. Cuffe sold them
about twentyseven quid each. For Liverpool probably. Roast beef for old England.
They buy up all the juicy ones. And then the fifth quarter is lost: all that raw
stuff, hide, hair, horns. Comes to a big thing in a year. Dead meat trade.
Byproducts of the slaughterhouses for tanneries, soap, margarine. Wonder if that
dodge works now getting dicky meat off the train at Clonsilla.</p>
<p> The carriage moved on through the drove.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I can&apos;t make out why the corporation doesn&apos;t run
a tramline from the parkgate to the quays, Mr Bloom said. All those animals
could be taken in trucks down to the boats.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Instead of blocking up the thoroughfare, Martin Cunningham said. Quite right. They ought to.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, Mr Bloom said, and another thing I often thought is to have
<br><font color="green">{u22, 95}</font>
<br> municipal funeral trams like they have in Milan, you know. Run the line out
to the cemetery gates and have special trams, hearse and carriage and all. Don&apos;t you see what I mean?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O that be damned for a story, Mr Dedalus said. Pullman car and saloon diningroom.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A poor lookout for Corny, Mr Power added.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Why? Mr Bloom asked, turning to Mr Dedalus. Wouldn&apos;t
it be more decent than galloping two abreast?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Well, there&apos;s something in that, Mr Dedalus granted.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And, Martin Cunningham said, we wouldn&apos;t have scenes
like that when the hearse capsized round Dunphy&apos;s and upset the coffin on to the road.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That was terrible, Mr Power&apos;s shocked face said, and
the corpse fell about the road. Terrible!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; First round Dunphy&apos;s, Mr Dedalus said, nodding. Gordon Bennett cup.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Praises be to God! Martin Cunningham said piously.</p>
<p> Bom! Upset. A coffin bumped out on to the road. Burst open. Paddy Dignam
shot out and rolling over stiff in the dust in a brown habit too large for him.
Red face: grey now. Mouth fallen open. Asking what&apos;s up now. Quite right to
close it. Looks horrid open. Then the insides decompose quickly. Much better to
close up all the orifices. Yes, also. With wax. The sphincter loose. Seal up all.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Dunphy&apos;s, Mr Power announced as the carriage turned right.</p>
<p> Dunphy&apos;s corner. Mourning coaches drawn
up<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><a target="foot" id="fff0045">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>

by the wayside. Tiptop position for a pub. Expect we&apos;ll pull up here on the
way back to drink his health. Pass round the consolation. Elixir of life.</p>
<p> But suppose now it did happen. Would he bleed if a nail say cut him in the
knocking about? He would and he wouldn&apos;t, I suppose. Depends on where. The
circulation stops. Still some might ooze out of an artery. It would be better to bury them in red: a dark red.</p>
<p> In silence they drove along Phibsborough road. An empty hearse trotted by,
coming from the cemetery: looks relieved.</p>
<p> Crossguns bridge: the royal canal.</p>
<p> Water rushed roaring through the sluices. A man stood on his dropping barge
between clamps of turf. On the towpath by the lock a slacktethered horse. Aboard of the <i>Bugabu</i>.</p>
<p> Their eyes watched him. On the slow weedy waterway he had floated on his
raft coastward over Ireland drawn by a haulage rope past beds of reeds,
<br><font color="green">{u22, 96}</font>
<br> over slime, mudchoked bottles, carrion dogs. Athlone, Mullingar, Moyvalley,
I could make a walking tour to see Milly by the canal. Or cycle down. Hire some
old crock, safety. Wren had one the other day at the auction but a lady&apos;s.
Developing waterways. James M&apos;Cann&apos;s hobby to row me o&apos;er the
ferry. Cheaper transit. By easy stages. Houseboats. Camping out. Also hearses.
To heaven by water. Perhaps I will without writing. Come as a surprise, Leixlip,
Clonsilla. Dropping

brown straw hat, saluting Paddy Dignam.</p>
<p> They drove
on<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font>.<a target="foot" id="fff0049">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
past Brian Boroimhe house. Near it now.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I wonder how is our friend Fogarty getting on, Mr Power said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Better ask Tom Kernan, Mr Dedalus said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; How is that? Martin Cunningham said. Left him weeping I suppose.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Though lost to sight, Mr Dedalus said, to memory dear.</p>
<p> The carriage steered left for Finglas road.</p>
<p> The stonecutter&apos;s yard on the right. Last lap. Crowded on the spit of
land silent shapes appeared, white, sorrowful, holding out calm hands, knelt in
grief, pointing. Fragments of shapes, hewn. In white silence: appealing. The
best obtainable. Thos. H. Dennany, monumental builder and sculptor.</p>
<p> Passed.</p>
<p> On the curbstone before Jimmy
Geary<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><a target="foot" id="fff0050">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
the sexton&apos;s, an old tramp sat, grumbling, emptying the dirt and stones out
of his huge dustbrown yawning boot. After life&apos;s journey.</p>
<p> Gloomy gardens then went by, one by one: gloomy houses.</p>
<p> Mr Power pointed.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That is where Childs was murdered, he said. The last house.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; So it is, Mr Dedalus said. A gruesome case. Seymour Bushe
got him off. Murdered his brother. Or so they said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The crown had no evidence, Mr Power said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Only circumstantial, Martin Cunningham said. That&apos;s
the maxim of the law. Better for ninetynine guilty to escape than for one
innocent person to be wrongfully condemned.</p>
<p> They looked. Murderer&apos;s ground. It passed darkly. Shuttered,
tenantless, unweeded garden. Whole place gone to hell. Wrongfully condemned.
Murder. The murderer&apos;s image in the eye of the murdered. They love reading
about it. Man&apos;s head found in a garden. Her clothing consisted of. How she
met her death. Recent outrage. The weapon used. Murderer is still at large.
Clues. A shoelace. The body to be exhumed. Murder will out.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 97}</font> </p>
<p> Cramped in this carriage. She mightn&apos;t like me to come that way without
letting her know. Must be careful about women. Catch them once with their pants
down. Never forgive you after. Fifteen.</p>
<p> The high railings of Prospect rippled past their gaze. Dark poplars, rare
white forms. Forms more frequent, white shapes thronged amid the trees, white
forms and fragments streaming by mutely, sustaining vain gestures on the air.</p>
<p> The felly harshed against the curbstone: stopped. Martin Cunningham put out
his arm and, wrenching back the handle, shoved the door open with his knee. He
stepped out. Mr Power and Mr Dedalus followed.</p>
<p> Change that soap now. Mr Bloom&apos;s hand unbuttoned his hip pocket swiftly
and transferred the paperstuck soap to his inner handkerchief pocket. He stepped
out of the carriage, replacing the newspaper his other hand still held.</p>
<p> Paltry funeral: coach and three carriages. It&apos;s all the
same<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span>,<a target="foot" id="fff0051">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>

gold reins, requiem mass, firing a volley. Pomp of death. Beyond the hind
carriage a hawker stood by his barrow of cakes and fruit. Simnel cakes those
are, stuck together: cakes for the dead. Dogbiscuits. Who ate them? Mourners coming out.</p>
<p> He followed his companions. Mr Kernan and Ned Lambert followed, Hynes
walking after them. Corny Kelleher stood by the opened hearse and took out the
two wreaths. He handed one to the boy.</p>
<p> Where is that child&apos;s funeral disappeared to?</p>
<p> A team of horses passed from Finglas with toiling plodding tread, dragging
through the funereal silence a creaking waggon on which lay a granite block. The
waggoner marching at their head saluted.</p>
<p> Coffin now. Got here before us, dead as he is. Horse looking round at it
with his plume skeowways. Dull eye: collar tight on his neck, pressing on a
bloodvessel or something. Do they know what they cart out here every
day<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">?</span></span>.<a target="foot" id="fff0053">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
Must be twenty or thirty funerals every day. Then Mount Jerome for the
protestants. Funerals all over the world everywhere every minute. Shovelling
them under by the cartload doublequick. Thousands every hour. Too many in the world.</p>
<p> Mourners came out through the gates: woman and a girl. Leanjawed harpy, hard
woman at a bargain, her bonnet awry. Girl&apos;s face stained with dirt and
tears, holding the woman&apos;s
arm<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><a target="foot" id="fff0054">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
looking up at her for a sign to cry. Fish&apos;s face, bloodless and livid.</p>
<p> The mutes shouldered the coffin and bore it in through the gates. So much
<br><font color="green">{u22, 98}</font>
<br> dead weight. Felt heavier myself
<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">stepping</span></span>

out of that bath. First the stiff: then the friends of the stiff. Corny Kelleher
and the boy followed with their wreaths. Who is that beside them? Ah, the brother-in-law.</p>
<p> All walked after.</p>
<p> Martin Cunningham whispered:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I was in mortal agony with you talking of suicide before Bloom.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What? Mr Power whispered. How so?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; His father poisoned himself, Martin Cunningham whispered.
Had the Queen&apos;s hotel in Ennis. You heard him say he was going to Clare. Anniversary.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O God! Mr Power whispered. First I heard of it. Poisoned himself!</p>
<p> He glanced behind him to where a face with dark thinking eyes followed
towards the cardinal&apos;s mausoleum. Speaking.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Was he insured? Mr Bloom asked.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I believe so, Mr Kernan answered, but the policy was
heavily mortgaged. Martin is trying to get the youngster into Artane.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; How many children did he leave?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Five. Ned Lambert says he&apos;ll try to get one of the girls into Todd&apos;s.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A sad case, Mr Bloom said gently. Five young children.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A great blow to the poor wife, Mr Kernan added.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Indeed yes, Mr Bloom agreed.</p>
<p> Has the laugh at him now.</p>
<p> He looked down at the boots he had blacked and polished. She had outlived
him, lost her husband. More dead for her than for me. One must outlive the
other. Wise men say. There are more women than men in the world. Condole with
her. Your terrible loss. I hope you&apos;ll soon follow him. For Hindu widows
only. She would marry another. Him? No. Yet who knows after? Widowhood not the
thing since the old queen died. Drawn on a guncarriage. Victoria and Albert.
Frogmore memorial mourning. But in the end she put a few violets in her bonnet.
Vain in her heart of hearts. All for a shadow. Consort not even a king. Her son
was the substance. Something new to hope for not like the past she wanted back,
waiting. It never comes. One must go first: alone, under the ground: and lie no more in her warm bed.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; How are you, Simon? Ned Lambert said softly, clasping
hands. Haven&apos;t seen you for a month of Sundays.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Never better. How are all in Cork&apos;s own town?
<br><font color="green">{u22, 99}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I was down there for
the<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font>,<a target="foot" id="fff0058">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
Cork park races on Easter Monday, Ned Lambert said. Same old six and eightpence. Stopped with Dick Tivy.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And how is Dick, the solid man?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Nothing between himself and heaven, Ned Lambert answered.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; By the holy Paul! Mr Dedalus said in subdued wonder. Dick Tivy bald?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Martin is going to get up a whip for the youngsters, Ned
Lambert said, pointing ahead. A few bob a skull. Just to keep them going till the insurance is cleared up.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, yes, Mr Dedalus said dubiously. Is that the eldest boy in front?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, Ned Lambert said, with the wife&apos;s brother. John
Henry Menton is behind. He put down his name for a quid.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I&apos;ll engage he did, Mr Dedalus said. I often told
poor Paddy he ought to mind that job. John Henry is not the worst in the world.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; How did he lose it? Ned Lambert asked. Liquor, what?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Many a good man&apos;s fault, Mr Dedalus said with a sigh.</p>
<p> They halted about the door of the mortuary chapel. Mr Bloom stood behind the
boy with the wreath, looking down at his
<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">sleekcombed</span></span>
sleek
combed<a target="foot" id="fff0059">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
hair and

the slender furrowed neck inside his brandnew collar. Poor boy! Was he there
when the father? Both unconscious. Lighten up at the last moment and recognise
for the last time. All he might have done. I owe three shillings to
O&apos;Grady. Would he understand? The mutes bore the coffin into the chapel. Which end is his head?</p>
<p> After a moment he followed the others in, blinking in the screened light.
The coffin lay on its bier before the
chancel<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><a target="foot" id="fff0061">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
four tall yellow candles at its corners. Always in front of us. Corny Kelleher,
laying a wreath at each fore corner, beckoned to the boy to kneel. The mourners
knelt here and there in praying desks. Mr Bloom stood behind near the font and,
when all had
knelt<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><a target="foot" id="fff0062">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
dropped carefully his unfolded newspaper from his pocket and knelt his right
knee upon it. He fitted his black hat gently on his left knee and, holding its brim, bent over piously.</p>
<p> A server, bearing a brass bucket with something in it, came out through a
door. The whitesmocked priest came after
him<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><a target="foot" id="fff0063">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
tidying his stole with one hand, balancing with the other a little book against
his toad&apos;s belly. Who&apos;ll read the book? I, said the rook.</p>
<p> They halted by the bier and the priest began to read out of his book with a fluent croak.

about the muzzle he looks. Bosses the show. Muscular christian. Woe betide
anyone that looks crooked at him: priest. Thou art Peter. Burst sideways like a
sheep in clover Dedalus says he will. With a belly on him like a poisoned pup.
Most amusing expressions that man finds. Hhhn: burst sideways.</p>

Down in the vaults of saint Werburgh&apos;s lovely old organ hundred and fifty
they have to bore a hole in the coffins sometimes to let out the bad gas and
burn it. Out it rushes: blue. One whiff of that and you&apos;re a goner.</p>
<p> My kneecap is hurting me. Ow. That&apos;s better.</p>
<p> The priest took a stick with a knob at the end of it out of the boy&apos;s
bucket and shook it over the coffin. Then he walked to the other end and shook
it again. Then he came back and put it back in the bucket. As you were before
you rested. It&apos;s all written down: he has to do it.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>Et ne nos inducas in tentationem</i>.</p>
<p> The server piped the answers in the treble. I often thought it would be
better to have boy servants. Up to fifteen or so. After that of course&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> Holy water that was, I expect. Shaking sleep out of it. He must be fed up
with that job, shaking that thing over all the corpses they trot up. What harm
if he could see what he was shaking it over. Every mortal day a fresh batch:
middleaged men, old women, children, women dead in childbirth, men with beards,
baldheaded business men, consumptive girls with little sparrows&apos; breasts.
All the year round he prayed the same thing over them all and shook water on top of them: sleep. On Dignam now.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>In paradisum.</i></p>
<p> Said he was going to paradise or is in paradise. Says that over everybody.
Tiresome kind of a job. But he has to say something.</p>
<p> The priest closed his book and went off, followed by the server. Corny
<br><font color="green">{u22, 101}</font>
<br> Kelleher opened the sidedoors and the gravediggers came in, hoisted the
coffin again, carried it out and shoved it on their cart. Corny Kelleher gave
one wreath to the boy and one to the brother-in-law. All followed them out of
the sidedoors into the mild grey air. Mr Bloom came last, folding his paper
again into his pocket. He gazed gravely at the ground till the coffincart
wheeled off to the left. The metal wheels ground the gravel with a sharp grating
cry and the pack of blunt boots followed the barrow along a lane of sepulchres.</p>
<p> The ree the ra the ree the ra the roo. Lord, I mustn&apos;t lilt here.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The O&apos;Connell circle, Mr Dedalus said about him.</p>
<p> Mr Power&apos;s soft eyes went up to the apex of the lofty cone.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He&apos;s at rest, he said, in the middle of his people,
old Dan O&apos;. But his heart is buried in Rome. How many broken hearts are buried here, Simon!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Her grave is over there, Jack, Mr Dedalus said. I&apos;ll
soon be stretched beside her. Let Him take me whenever He likes.</p>
<p> Breaking down, he began to weep to himself quietly, stumbling a little in his walk. Mr Power took his arm.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; She&apos;s better where she is, he said kindly.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I suppose so, Mr Dedalus said with a weak gasp. I suppose
she is in heaven if there is a heaven.</p>
<p> Corny Kelleher stepped aside from his rank and allowed the mourners to plod by.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Sad occasions, Mr Kernan began politely.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom closed his eyes and sadly twice bowed his head.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The others are putting on their hats, Mr Kernan said. I
suppose we can do so too. We are the last. This cemetery is a treacherous place.</p>
<p> They covered their heads.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The reverend gentleman read the service too quickly,
don&apos;t you think? Mr Kernan said with reproof.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom nodded gravely, looking in the quick bloodshot eyes. Secret eyes,
secret searching eyes. Mason, I think: not sure. Beside him again. We are the
last. In the same boat. Hope he&apos;ll say something else.</p>
<p> Mr Kernan added:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The service of the Irish church, used in Mount Jerome, is
simpler, more impressive, I must say.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom gave prudent assent. The language of course was another thing.</p>
<p> Mr Kernan said with solemnity:
<br><font color="green">{u22, 102}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>I am the resurrection and the life.</i> That touches a man&apos;s inmost heart.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It does, Mr Bloom said.</p>
<p> Your heart perhaps but what price the fellow in the six feet by two with his
toes to the daisies? No touching that. Seat of the affections. Broken heart. A
pump after all, pumping thousands of gallons of blood every day. One fine day it
gets bunged up and there you are. Lots of them lying around here: lungs, hearts,
livers. Old rusty pumps: damn the thing else. The resurrection and the life.
Once you are dead you are dead. That last day idea. Knocking them all up out of
their graves. Come forth, Lazarus! And he came fifth and lost the job. Get up!
Last day! Then every fellow mousing around for his liver and his lights and the
rest of his traps. Find damn all of himself that morning. Pennyweight of powder
in a skull. Twelve grammes one pennyweight. Troy measure.</p>

<p class="di">&mdash; What? Eh? Corny Kelleher said.</p>
<p> Mr Kernan assured him.</p>

seventeen golden years ago, at Mat Dillon&apos;s, in Roundtown. And a good armful she was.</p>
<p> He looked behind through the others.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What is he? he asked. What does he do? Wasn&apos;t he in
the stationery line? I fell foul of him one evening, I remember, at bowls.</p>
<p> Ned Lambert smiled.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, he was, he said, in Wisdom Hely&apos;s. A traveller for blottingpaper.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; In God&apos;s name, John Henry Menton said, what did she
marry a coon like that for? She had plenty of game in her then.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Has still, Ned Lambert said. He does some canvassing for ads.</p>
<p> John Henry Menton&apos;s large eyes stared ahead.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 103}</font> </p>
<p> The barrow turned into a side lane. A portly man, ambushed among the
grasses, raised his hat in homage. The gravediggers touched their caps.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; John O&apos;Connell, Mr Power said, pleased. He never forgets a friend.</p>
<p> Mr O&apos;Connell shook all their hands in silence. Mr Dedalus said:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I am come to pay you another visit.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; My dear Simon, the caretaker answered in a low voice. I don&apos;t want your custom at all.</p>
<p> Saluting Ned Lambert and John Henry Menton he walked on at Martin
Cunningham&apos;s side, puzzling two
<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">long</span></span><a target="foot" id="fff0075">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
keys at his back.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Did you hear that one, he asked them, about Mulcahy from the Coombe?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I did not, Martin Cunningham said.</p>
<p> They bent their silk hats in concert and Hynes inclined his ear. The
caretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold

and spoke in a discreet tone to their vacant smiles.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; They tell the story, he said, that two drunks came out
here one foggy evening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs. They asked
for Mulcahy from the Coombe and were told where he was buried. After traipsing
about in the fog they found the
grave<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font>,<a target="foot" id="fff0077">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
sure enough. One of the drunks spelt out the name: Terence Mulcahy. The other
drunk was blinking up at a statue of our Saviour the widow had got put up.</p>
<p> The caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed. He resumed:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And, after blinking up at the sacred figure, <i>Not a
bloody bit like the man</i>, says he. <i>That&apos;s not Mulcahy</i>, says he, <i>whoever done it</i>.</p>
<p> Rewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with Corny Kelleher, accepting the
dockets given him, turning them over and scanning them as he walked.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That&apos;s all done with a purpose, Martin Cunningham explained to Hynes.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I know, Hynes said, I know that.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; To cheer a fellow up, Martin Cunningham said. It&apos;s
pure goodheartedness: damn the thing else.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom admired the caretaker&apos;s prosperous bulk. All want to be on
good terms with him. Decent fellow, John O&apos;Connell, real good sort. Keys:

Shades of night hovering here with all the dead stretched about. The shadows of
the tombs when churchyards yawn and Daniel O&apos;Connell must be a descendant I
suppose who is this used to say he was a queer breedy man great catholic all the
same like a big giant in the dark. Will o&apos; the wisp. Gas of graves. Want to

her a ghost story in bed to make her sleep. Have you ever seen a ghost? Well, I

Learn anything if taken young. You might pick up a young widow here. Men like

<p> He has seen a fair share go under in his time, lying around him field after
field. Holy fields. More room if they buried them standing. Sitting or kneeling
you couldn&apos;t. Standing? His head might come up some day above ground in a
landslip with his hand pointing. All honeycombed the ground must be: oblong
cells. And very neat he keeps it too, trim grass and edgings. His garden Major
Gamble calls Mount Jerome.

warms the cockles of his heart. The one about the bulletin. Spurgeon went to
heaven 4 a.m. this morning. 11 p.m. (closing time). Not arrived yet. Peter. The
dead themselves the men anyhow would like to hear an odd joke or the women to
know what&apos;s in fashion. A juicy pear or ladies&apos; punch, hot, strong and
sweet. Keep out the damp. You must laugh sometimes so better do it that way.
Gravediggers in <i>Hamlet</i>. Shows the profound knowledge of the human heart.
Daren&apos;t joke about the dead for two years at least. <i>De mortuis nil nisi

of a joke. Read your own obituary notice they say you live longer. Gives you second wind. New lease of life.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; How many have you for tomorrow? the caretaker asked.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Two, Corny Kelleher said. Half ten and eleven.</p>
<p> The caretaker put the papers in his pocket. The barrow had ceased to
trundle. The mourners split and moved to each side of the hole, stepping with
care round the graves. The gravediggers bore the coffin and set its nose on the brink, looping the bands round it.</p>
<p> Burying him. We come to bury

<p> Now who is that lankylooking galoot over there in the macintosh? Now who is
he I&apos;d like to know? Now, I&apos;d give a trifle to know who he is. Always
someone turns up you never dreamt of. A fellow could live on his lonesome all
his life. Yes, he could. Still he&apos;d have to get someone to sod him after he
died though he could dig his own grave. We all do. Only man buries. No ants too.

see. To protect him as long as possible even in the earth. The Irishman&apos;s
house is his coffin. Embalming in catacombs,

<p> Mr Bloom stood far back, his hat in his hand, counting the bared heads.
Twelve. I&apos;m thirteen. No. The chap in the macintosh is thirteen.
Death&apos;s number. Where the deuce did he pop out of? He wasn&apos;t in the
chapel, that I&apos;ll swear. Silly superstition that about thirteen.</p>
<p> Nice soft tweed Ned Lambert has in that suit. Tinge of purple. I had one
like that when we lived in Lombard street west. Dressy fellow he was once. Used
to change three suits in the day. Must get that grey suit of mine turned by
Mesias. Hello. It&apos;s dyed. His wife I forgot he&apos;s not married or his
landlady ought to have picked out those threads for him.</p>
<p> The coffin dived out of sight, eased down by the men straddled on the
gravetrestles. They struggled up and out: and all uncovered. Twenty.</p>
<p> Pause.</p>
<p> If we were all suddenly somebody else.</p>
<p> Far away a donkey brayed. Rain. No such ass. Never see a dead one, they say.
Shame of death. They hide. Also poor papa went away.</p>
<p> Gentle sweet air blew round the bared heads in a whisper. Whisper. The boy
by the gravehead held his wreath with both hands staring quietly in the black
open space. Mr Bloom moved behind the portly kindly caretaker.

forget to pray for him. Remember him in your prayers. Even Parnell. Ivy day
dying out. Then they follow: dropping into a hole one after the other.

<p> We are praying now for the repose of his soul. Hoping you&apos;re well and
not in hell. Nice change of air. Out of the fryingpan of life into the fire of purgatory.</p>
<p> Does he ever think of the hole waiting for himself? They say you do when you
shiver in the sun. Someone walking over it. Callboy&apos;s warning. Near you.
Mine over there towards Finglas, the plot I bought. Mamma, poor mamma, and little Rudy.</p>
<p> The gravediggers took up their spades and flung heavy clods of clay in on
the coffin. Mr Bloom turned his face. And if he was alive all the time? Whew! By
Jingo, that would be awful! No, no: he is dead, of course. Of course he is dead.
Monday he died. They ought to have some law to pierce the heart and make sure or
an electric clock or a telephone in the coffin and some kind of a canvas
airhole. Flag of distress. Three days. Rather long to keep them in summer. Just
as well to get shut of them as soon as you are sure

<p> The clay fell softer. Begin to be forgotten. Out of sight, out of mind.</p>
<p> The caretaker moved away a few paces and put on his hat. Had enough of it.
The mourners took heart of grace, one by one, covering themselves without show.
Mr Bloom put on his hat and saw the portly figure make its way deftly through
the maze of graves. Quietly, sure of his ground, he traversed the dismal fields.</p>
<p> Hynes jotting down something in his notebook. Ah, the names. But he knows them all. No: coming to me.</p>

What is your christian name? I&apos;m not sure.</p>

postmortem for doctors. Find out what they imagine they know. He died of a
Tuesday. Got the run. Levanted with the cash of a few ads. Charley, you&apos;re
my darling. That was why he asked me to. O well, does no harm. I saw to that,
M&apos;Coy. Thanks, old chap: much obliged. Leave him under an obligation: costs nothing.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And tell us, Hynes said, do you know that fellow in the,
fellow was over there in the&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> He looked around.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Macintosh.
Yes<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><a target="foot" id="fff0096">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
I saw him, Mr Bloom said. Where is he now?
<br><font color="green">{u22, 108}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; M&apos;Intosh, Hynes said, scribbling. I don&apos;t know who he is. Is that his name?</p>
<p> He moved away, looking about him.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; No, Mr Bloom began, turning and stopping. I say, Hynes!</p>
<p> Didn&apos;t hear. What? Where has he disappeared to? Not a sign. Well of all
the. Has anybody here seen? Kay ee double ell. Become invisible. Good Lord, what became of him?</p>
<p> A seventh gravedigger came beside Mr Bloom to take up an idle spade.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O, excuse me!</p>
<p> He stepped aside nimbly.</p>
<p> Clay, brown, damp, began to be seen in the hole. It rose. Nearly over. A
mound of damp clods rose more, rose, and the gravediggers rested their spades.
All uncovered again for a few instants. The boy propped his wreath against a
corner: the brother-in-law his on a lump. The gravediggers put on their caps and
carried their earthy spades towards the barrow. Then knocked the blades lightly
on the turf: clean. One bent to pluck from the haft a long tuft of grass. One,
leaving his mates, walked slowly on with shouldered weapon, its blade
blueglancing. Silently at the gravehead another coiled the coffinband. His
navelcord. The brother-in-law, turning away, placed something in his free hand.
Thanks in silence. Sorry, sir: trouble. Headshake. I know that. For yourselves just.</p>
<p> The mourners moved away
slowly<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font>,<a target="foot" id="fff0097">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
without aim, by devious paths, staying awhile to read a name on a tomb.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Let us go round by the chief&apos;s grave, Hynes said. We have time.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Let us, Mr Power said.</p>
<p> They turned to the right, following their slow thoughts. With awe Mr Power&apos;s blank voice spoke:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Some say he is not in that grave at all. That the coffin
was filled with stones. That one day he will come again.</p>
<p> Hynes shook his head.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Parnell will never come again, he said. He&apos;s there,
all that was mortal of him. Peace to his ashes.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels, crosses, broken
pillars<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><a target="foot" id="fff0098">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
family vaults, stone hopes praying with upcast eyes, old Ireland&apos;s hearts
and hands. More sensible to spend the money on some charity for the living. Pray
for the repose of the soul of. Does anybody really? Plant him and have done with
him. Like down a coalshoot. Then lump them together
<br><font color="green">{u22, 109}</font>
<br> to save time. All souls&apos; day. Twentyseventh I&apos;ll be at his grave.
Ten shillings for the gardener. He keeps it free of weeds. Old man himself. Bent
down double with his shears clipping. Near death&apos;s door. Who passed away.
Who departed this life. As if they did it of their own accord. Got the shove,
all of them. Who kicked the bucket. More interesting if they told you what they
were. So and so, wheelwright. I travelled for cork lino. I paid five shillings
in the pound. Or a woman&apos;s with her saucepan. I cooked good Irish stew.
Eulogy in a country churchyard it ought to be that poem of whose is it
Wordsworth or Thomas Campbell. Entered into rest the protestants put it. Old Dr
Murren&apos;s. The great physician called him home. Well it&apos;s God&apos;s
acre for them. Nice country residence. Newly plastered and painted. Ideal spot
to have a quiet smoke and read the <i>Church Times</i>. Marriage ads they never
try to beautify. Rusty wreaths hung on knobs, garlands of bronzefoil. Better
value that for the money. Still, the flowers are more poetical. The other gets
rather tiresome, never withering. Expresses nothing. Immortelles.</p>
<p> A bird sat tamely perched on a poplar branch. Like stuffed. Like the wedding
present alderman Hooper gave us. Hu! Not a budge out of him. Knows there are no
catapults to let fly at him. Dead animal even sadder. Silly-Milly burying the
little dead bird in the kitchen matchbox, a daisychain and bits of broken chainies on the grave.</p>
<p> The Sacred Heart that is: showing it. Heart on his sleeve. Ought to be
sideways and red it should be painted like a real heart. Ireland was dedicated
to it or whatever that. Seems anything but pleased. Why this infliction? Would
birds come then and peck like the boy with the basket of fruit but he said no
because they ought to have been afraid of the boy. Apollo that was.</p>
<p> How many! All these here once walked round Dublin. Faithful departed. As you are now so once were we.</p>
<p> Besides how could you remember everybody? Eyes, walk, voice. Well, the
voice, yes: gramophone. Have a gramophone in every grave or keep it in the
house. After dinner on a Sunday. Put on poor old
greatgrandfather<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span><a target="foot" id="fff0100">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>

Remind you of the voice like the photograph reminds you of the face. Otherwise
you couldn&apos;t remember the face after fifteen years, say. For instance who?
For instance some fellow that died when I was in Wisdom Hely&apos;s.</p>
<p> Rtststr! A rattle of pebbles. Wait. Stop.</p>
<p> He looked down intently into a stone crypt. Some animal. Wait. There he goes.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 110}</font> </p>
<p> An obese grey rat toddled along the side of the crypt, moving the pebbles.
An old stager: greatgrandfather: he knows the ropes. The grey alive crushed
itself in under the plinth, wriggled itself in under it. Good hidingplace for treasure.</p>
<p> Who lives there? Are laid the remains of Robert Emery. Robert Emmet was
buried here by torchlight, wasn&apos;t he? Making his rounds.</p>
<p> Tail gone now.</p>
<p> One of those chaps would make short work of a fellow. Pick the bones clean
no matter who it was. Ordinary meat for them. A corpse is meat gone bad. Well
and what&apos;s cheese? Corpse of milk. I read in that <i>Voyages in China</i>
that the Chinese say a white man smells like a corpse. Cremation better. Priests
dead against it. Devilling for the other firm. Wholesale burners and Dutch oven
dealers. Time of the plague. Quicklime fever pits to eat them. Lethal chamber.
Ashes to ashes. Or bury at sea. Where is that Parsee tower of silence? Eaten by
birds. Earth, fire, water. Drowning they say is the pleasantest. See your whole
life in a flash. But being brought back to life no. Can&apos;t bury in the air
however. Out of a flying machine. Wonder does the news go about whenever a fresh
one is let down. Underground communication. We learned that from them.
Wouldn&apos;t be surprised. Regular square feed for them. Flies come before
he&apos;s well dead. Got wind of Dignam. They wouldn&apos;t care about the smell
of it. Saltwhite crumbling mush of corpse: smell, taste like raw white turnips.</p>
<p> The gates glimmered in front: still open. Back to the world again. Enough of
this place. Brings you a bit nearer every time. Last time I was here was Mrs
Sinico&apos;s funeral. Poor papa too. The love that kills. And even scraping up
the earth at night with a lantern like that case I read of to get at fresh
buried females or even putrefied with running gravesores. Give you the creeps
after a bit. I will appear to you after death. You will see my ghost after
death. My ghost will haunt you after death. There is another world after death
named hell. I do not like that other world she wrote. No more do I. Plenty to
see and hear and feel yet. Feel live warm beings near you. Let them sleep in
their maggoty beds. They are not going to get me this innings. Warm beds: warm fullblooded life.</p>
<p> Martin Cunningham emerged from a sidepath, talking gravely.</p>
<p> Solicitor, I think. I know his face.
Menton<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span>.<a target="foot" id="fff0105">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
John Henry, solicitor, commissioner for oaths and affidavits. Dignam used to be
in his office. Mat Dillon&apos;s long ago. Jolly
Mat<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>

convivial<a target="foot" id="fff0106">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
evenings. Cold fowl, cigars, the Tantalus glasses. Heart of gold really. Yes, Menton. Got his rag out that evening on
<br><font color="green">{u22, 111}</font>
<br> the bowling green because I sailed inside him. Pure fluke of mine: the
bias. Why he took such a rooted dislike to me. Hate at first sight. Molly and
Floey Dillon linked under the lilactree, laughing. Fellow always like
that<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><a target="foot" id="fff0107">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
mortified if women are by.</p>
<p> Got a dinge in the side of his hat. Carriage probably.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Excuse me, sir, Mr Bloom said beside them.</p>
<p> They stopped.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Your hat is a little crushed, Mr Bloom said, pointing.</p>
<p> John Henry Menton stared at him for an instant without moving.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There, Martin Cunningham helped, pointing also.</p>
<p> John Henry Menton took off his hat, bulged out the dinge and smoothed the
nap with care on his coatsleeve. He clapped the hat on his head again.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It&apos;s all right now, Martin Cunningham said.</p>
<p> John Henry Menton jerked his head down in acknowledgment.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Thank you, he said shortly.</p>
<p> They walked on towards the gates. Mr Bloom, chapfallen, drew behind a few
paces so as not to overhear. Martin laying down the law. Martin could wind a
sappyhead like that round his little finger without his seeing it.</p>
<p> Oyster eyes. Never mind. Be sorry after perhaps when it dawns on him. Get the pull over him that way.</p>
<p> Thank you. How grand we are this morning!</p>  </main>
