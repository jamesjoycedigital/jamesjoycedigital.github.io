<p> Martin Cunningham, first, poked his silkhatted head into the creaking
carriage and, entering deftly, seated himself. Mr Power stepped in after him, curving his height with care.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Come on, Simon.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; After you, Mr Bloom said.</p>
<p> Mr Dedalus covered himself quickly and got in, saying:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, yes.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Are we all here now? Martin Cunningham asked. Come along, Bloom.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom entered and sat in the vacant place. He pulled the door to after
him and slammed it twice<a target="foot" id="fff0001">&ordm;</a> till it shut
tight. He passed an arm through the armstrap and looked seriously from the open
carriage window at the lowered blinds of the avenue. One dragged aside: an old
woman peeping. <a name="un4005bb" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4005bb">Nose
whiteflattened against the pane.</a> Thanking her stars she was passed over.
Extraordinary the interest they take in a corpse.
<a name="un4057ak" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4057ak">Glad to see us go we
give them such trouble coming.</a> Job seems to suit them. Huggermugger in
corners. Slop about in slipperslappers for fear he&apos;d wake. Then getting it
ready. Laying it out. Molly and Mrs Fleming making the bed. Pull it more to your
side. <a name="un4004cj" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4004cj">Our
windingsheet</a>.
<a name="un5004h" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5004h">Never know who will
touch you dead</a>. Wash and shampoo. I believe they clip the nails and the
hair. Keep a bit in an envelope. Grows<a target="foot" id="fff0002">&ordm;</a>
all the same after. <a name="un4005r" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4005r">Unclean job.</a></p>
<p> All waited. Nothing was said. Stowing in the wreaths probably. I am sitting
on something hard. Ah, that soap<a target="foot" id="fff0003">&ordm;</a> in my
hip pocket. Better shift it out of that. Wait for an opportunity.</p>
<p> All waited. Then wheels were heard from in front, turning: then nearer: then
horses&apos; hoofs. A jolt. Their carriage began to move, creaking and swaying.
 Other hoofs and creaking wheels started behind. The blinds of the avenue passed
and number nine<a target="foot" id="fff0004">&ordm;</a> with its craped knocker, door ajar. At walking pace.</p>
<p> They waited still, their knees jogging, till they had turned and were
passing along the tramtracks. Tritonville road. Quicker. The wheels rattled
rolling over the cobbled causeway and the crazy glasses shook rattling in the doorframes.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What way is he taking us? Mr Power asked through both windows.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Irishtown, Martin Cunningham said. Ringsend. Brunswick street.</p>
<p> Mr Dedalus nodded, looking out.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That&apos;s a fine old custom, he said. I am glad to see it has not died out.</p>
<p> All watched awhile through their windows caps and hats lifted by passers.
Respect. The carriage swerved from the tramtrack to the smoother road past
Watery lane. Mr Bloom at gaze saw a lithe young man, clad in mourning, a wide hat.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There&apos;s a friend of yours gone by, Dedalus, he said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who is that?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Your son and heir.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Where is he? Mr Dedalus said, stretching over<a target="foot" id="fff0005">&ordm;</a> across.</p>
<p> The carriage, passing the open drains and mounds of
<a name="un4005be" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4005be">rippedup roadway</a>
before the tenement houses, lurched round
the<a target="foot" id="fff0006">&ordm;</a> corner and, swerving back to the
tramtrack, rolled on noisily with chattering wheels. Mr Dedalus fell back,
saying<a target="foot" id="fff0007">&ordm;</a>:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Was that Mulligan cad with him? His
<a name="un4005ba" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4005ba"><i>fidus
Achates</i>!</a><a target="foot" id="fff0008">&ordm;</a></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; No, Mr Bloom said. He was alone.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Down with his aunt Sally, I suppose, Mr Dedalus said,
<a name="un4005dd" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4005dd">the Goulding
faction</a>, the drunken little costdrawer and Crissie, papa&apos;s little lump
of dung, the wise child that knows her own father.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom smiled joylessly on Ringsend road. Wallace
Bros.<a target="foot" id="fff0009">&ordm;</a>
The<a target="foot" id="fff0010">&ordm;</a> bottleworks. Dodder bridge.</p>
<p> Richie Goulding and the legal bag.<a target="foot" id="fff0011">&ordm;</a>
Goulding, Collis and Ward he calls the firm. His jokes are getting a bit damp.
Great card he was. Waltzing in Stamer street with Ignatius Gallaher on a Sunday
morning, the landlady&apos;s two hats pinned on his head. Out on the rampage all
night. Beginning to tell on him now: that backache of his, I fear.
<a name="un4005as" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4005as">Wife ironing his
back.</a> Thinks he&apos;ll cure it with pills. All
breadcrumbs<a target="foot" id="fff0012">&ordm;</a> they are. About six hundred per cent profit.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He&apos;s in with a lowdown crowd, Mr Dedalus snarled.
That Mulligan is a contaminated bloody
<a name="un4005bd" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4005bd">doubledyed</a>
ruffian <a name="un4036r" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4036r">by all
accounts</a>. His name stinks all  over Dublin. But with the help of God
<a name="jn1038n" href="../../FF/unbs/jn1all.htm#jn1038n">and His blessed
mother</a> I&apos;ll
<a name="un4005e" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4005e">make it my
business</a> to write a letter one of those days to his mother or his aunt or
whatever she is that will open her eye as wide as a gate. I&apos;ll tickle his catastrophe, believe you me.</p>
<p> He cried above the clatter of the wheels.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I won&apos;t have her bastard of a nephew ruin my son. A
counterjumper&apos;s son.
<a name="un1032dd" href="../../FF/unbs/un1all.htm#un1032dd">Selling tapes in my
cousin, Peter Paul M&apos;Swiney&apos;s</a>. Not likely.</p>
<p> He ceased. Mr Bloom glanced from his angry moustache to Mr Power&apos;s mild
face and Martin Cunningham&apos;s eyes and beard, gravely shaking. Noisy
selfwilled man. Full of his son. He is right. Something to hand on. If little
Rudy had lived. See him grow up. Hear his voice in the house. Walking beside
Molly in an Eton suit. My son. Me in his eyes. Strange feeling it would be. From
me. Just a chance. Must have been that morning in Raymond terrace she was at the
window, watching the two dogs at it by the wall of the cease to do evil. And the
sergeant grinning up. She had that cream gown on with the rip she never
stitched. Give us a touch, Poldy. God, I&apos;m dying for it. How life begins.</p>
<p> Got big then. Had to refuse the Greystones concert. My son inside her. I
could have helped him on in life. I could. Make him independent. Learn German too.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Are we late? Mr Power asked.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ten minutes, Martin Cunningham said, looking at his watch.</p>
<p> Molly. Milly. Same thing watered down. Her tomboy oaths. O jumping Jupiter!
<a name="un4004ae" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4004ae">Ye gods and little
fishes!</a> Still, she&apos;s a dear girl. Soon be a woman. Mullingar. Dearest
Papli. Young student. Yes, yes: a woman too. Life, life.<a target="foot" id="fff0013">&ordm;</a></p>
<p> The carriage heeled over and back, their four trunks swaying.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Corny might have given us a more commodious yoke, Mr Power said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He might, Mr Dedalus said, if he hadn&apos;t that squint troubling him. Do you follow me?</p>
<p> He closed his left eye. Martin Cunningham began to brush away crustcrumbs from under his thighs.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What is this,<a target="foot" id="fff0014">&ordm;</a> he said, in the name of God? Crumbs?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Someone seems to have been making a picnic party here lately, Mr Power said.</p>
<p> All raised their thighs and<a target="foot" id="fff0015">&ordm;</a> eyed
with disfavour the mildewed buttonless leather of the seats. Mr Dedalus,
twisting his nose, frowned downward and said:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Unless I&apos;m greatly mistaken. What do you think, Martin? </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It struck me too, Martin Cunningham said.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom set his thigh down. Glad I took that bath. Feel my feet quite
clean. <a name="un4005cp" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4005cp">But I wish
Mrs Fleming had darned these socks better.</a></p>
<p> Mr Dedalus sighed resignedly.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; After all, he said, it&apos;s the most natural thing in the world.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Did Tom Kernan turn up? Martin Cunningham asked, twirling the peak of his beard gently.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, Mr Bloom answered. He&apos;s behind with Ned Lambert and Hynes.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And Corny Kelleher himself? Mr Power asked.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; At the cemetery, Martin Cunningham said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I met M&apos;Coy this morning, Mr Bloom said. He said he&apos;d try to come.</p>
<p> The carriage halted short.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What&apos;s wrong?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; We&apos;re stopped.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Where are we?</p>
<p> Mr Bloom put his head out of the window.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The grand canal, he said.</p>
<p> Gasworks. Whooping cough they say it cures. Good job Milly never got it.
Poor children! Doubles them<a target="foot" id="fff0016">&ordm;</a> up black and
blue in
<a name="un4005v" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4005v">convulsions</a>. Shame

Poor old Athos! <a name="un1003o" href="../../FF/unbs/un1all.htm#un1003o">Be
good to Athos, Leopold, is my last wish</a>.
<a name="un6006bc" href="../../FF/unbs/un6all.htm#un6006bc">Thy will be

<a name="un1032av" href="../../FF/unbs/un1all.htm#un1032av">took it to
heart</a>, pined away. Quiet brute. Old men&apos;s dogs usually are.</p>
<p> A raindrop spat on his hat. He drew back and saw an instant of shower spray
dots over the grey flags. Apart. Curious. Like through a colander. I thought it
would. My boots were creaking I remember now.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The weather is changing, he said quietly.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A pity it did not keep up fine, Martin Cunningham said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Wanted for the country, Mr Power said. There&apos;s the sun again coming out.</p>
<p> Mr Dedalus, peering through his glasses towards the veiled sun, hurled a mute curse at the sky.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It&apos;s as uncertain as a child&apos;s bottom, he said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; We&apos;re off again.</p>
<p> The carriage turned again its stiff wheels and their trunks swayed gently.
Martin Cunningham twirled more quickly the peak of his beard. </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Tom Kernan was immense last night, he said.
<a name="un4004f" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4004f">And Paddy Leonard taking him off to his face.</a></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O draw him out, Martin, Mr Power said eagerly. Wait till
you hear him, Simon, on Ben Dollard&apos;s singing of <i>The Croppy Boy</i>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Immense, Martin Cunningham said pompously. <i>His singing
of that simple ballad, Martin, is the most trenchant rendering I ever heard in
the whole course of my experience.</i></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Trenchant<a target="foot" id="fff0017">&ordm;</a>, Mr
Power said laughing. He&apos;s dead nuts on that. And the retrospective
arrangement<a target="foot" id="fff0018">&ordm;</a>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Did you read Dan Dawson&apos;s speech? Martin Cunningham asked.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="un1032bm" href="../../FF/unbs/un1all.htm#un1032bm">I did not then,</a> Mr Dedalus said. Where is it?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; In the paper this morning.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom took the paper from his inside pocket. That book I must change for her.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; No, no, Mr Dedalus said quickly. Later on, please.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom&apos;s glance travelled down the edge of the paper, scanning the
deaths. Callan, Coleman, Dignam, Fawcett, Lowry, Naumann, Peake, what Peake is
that? is<a target="foot" id="fff0019">&ordm;</a> it the chap was in Crosbie and
Alleyne&apos;s? no, Sexton, Urbright. Inked characters fast fading on the frayed
breaking paper. Thanks to the Little Flower. Sadly missed.

<p> I tore up the envelope? Yes. Where did I put her letter after I read it in
the bath? He patted his waistcoat pocket. There all right. Dear Henry fled. Before my patience are exhausted.</p>
<p> National school. Meade&apos;s yard. The hazard. Only two there now. Nodding.
Full as a tick. Too much bone in their skulls. The other trotting round with a
fare. An hour ago I was passing there. The jarvies raised their hats.</p>
<p> A pointsman&apos;s back straightened itself upright suddenly against a
<a name="un4005cv" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4005cv">tramway standard</a>
by Mr Bloom&apos;s window. Couldn&apos;t they invent something automatic  so
that the wheel itself much handier? Well but that fellow would lose his job
then? Well but then another fellow would get a job making the new invention?</p>
<p> Antient concert rooms. Nothing on there. A man in a buff suit with a crape
armlet. Not much grief there.
<a name="un6006f" href="../../FF/unbs/un6all.htm#un6006f">Quarter mourning.</a> People in law, perhaps.</p>

Cunningham could work a pass for the Gaiety. Have to stand a drink or two. As broad as it&apos;s long.</p>
<p> He&apos;s coming in the afternoon. Her songs.</p>
<p> Plasto&apos;s. Sir Philip Crampton&apos;s memorial fountain bust. Who was he?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; How do you do? Martin Cunningham said, raising his palm to his brow in salute.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He doesn&apos;t see us, Mr Power said. Yes, he does. How do you do?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who? Mr Dedalus asked.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Blazes Boylan, Mr Power said. There he is airing his quiff.</p>
<p> Just that moment I was thinking.</p>
<p> Mr Dedalus bent across to salute. From the door of the Red Bank the white
disc of a straw hat flashed reply: passed.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom reviewed the nails of his left hand, then those of his right hand.
The nails, yes. Is there anything more in him that they she sees? Fascination.
<a name="un4036cu" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4036cu">Worst man in
Dublin.</a> That keeps him alive. They sometimes feel what a person is.
Instinct. But a type like that. My nails. I am just looking at them: well pared.
And after: thinking alone. Body getting a bit softy. I would notice that from
remembering. What causes that?<a target="foot" id="fff0025">&ordm;</a> I suppose
the skin can&apos;t contract quickly enough when the flesh falls off. But the
shape is there. The shape is there still. Shoulders. Hips. Plump. Night of the
dance dressing.
<a name="un4037bg" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4037bg">Shift stuck between the cheeks behind.</a></p>
<p> He clasped his hands between his knees and, satisfied, sent his vacant glance over their faces.</p>
<p> Mr Power asked:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; How is the concert tour getting on, Bloom?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O very well, Mr Bloom said. I hear great accounts of it.
It&apos;s a good idea, you see&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Are you going yourself? </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Well no, Mr Bloom said. In point of fact I have to go down
to the county Clare on some private business. You see the idea is to tour the
chief towns. What you lose on one you can make up on the other.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Quite so, Martin Cunningham said. Mary Anderson is up
there now.<a target="foot" id="fff0026">&ordm;</a> Have you good artists?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Louis Werner is touring her, Mr Bloom said. O yes,
we&apos;ll have all topnobbers. J.C. Doyle and John MacCormack I hope and. The best, in fact.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And <i>Madame</i>, Mr Power said, smiling. Last but not least.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom unclasped his hands in a gesture of soft politeness and clasped
them. Smith O&apos;Brien. Someone has laid a bunch of flowers there. Woman. Must
be his deathday. For many happy returns. The carriage wheeling by
<a name="un6016e" href="../../FF/unbs/un6all.htm#un6016e">Farrell&apos;s</a>
statue united noiselessly their unresisting knees.</p>
<p> Oot: a dullgarbed
<a name="un3031g" href="../../FF/unbs/un3all.htm#un3031g">old man</a> from the
curbstone tendered his wares, his mouth opening: oot.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Four bootlaces for a penny.</p>
<p> Wonder why he was struck off the rolls. Had his office in

Mourning too. Terrible comedown, poor wretch!

<p> And <i>Madame</i>. Twenty past eleven. Up. Mrs Fleming is in to clean. Doing

at the tips of her hairs to see if they are split. <i>Mi trema un poco il</i>.
Beautiful on that <i>tre</i> her voice is: weeping tone. A thrush. A throstle.
There is a word throstle that expresses that.</p>
<p> His eyes passed lightly over Mr Power&apos;s goodlooking face. Greyish over
the ears. <i>Madame</i>: smiling. I smiled back.
<a name="un5004cb" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5004cb">A smile goes a long
way.</a> Only politeness perhaps. Nice fellow. Who knows is that true about the
woman he keeps? Not pleasant for the wife. Yet they say, who was it told me,
there is no carnal. You would imagine that would get played out pretty quick.
Yes, it was Crofton met him one evening bringing her a pound of rumpsteak. What
is this she was? Barmaid in Jury&apos;s. Or the Moira, was it?</p>
<p> They passed under the hugecloaked Liberator&apos;s form.</p>
<p> Martin Cunningham nudged Mr Power.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Of the tribe of Reuben, he said.</p>
<p> A tall blackbearded figure, bent on a stick, stumping round the corner of
Elvery&apos;s elephant house showed them a curved hand open on his spine. </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; In all his
<a name="un1032bg" href="../../FF/unbs/un1all.htm#un1032bg">pristine beauty</a>, Mr Power said.</p>
<p> Mr Dedalus looked after the stumping figure and said mildly:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The devil break the hasp of your back!</p>
<p> Mr Power, collapsing in laughter, shaded his face from the window as the carriage passed Gray&apos;s statue.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; We have all been there, Martin Cunningham said broadly.</p>
<p> His eyes met Mr Bloom&apos;s eyes. He caressed his beard, adding:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Well, nearly all of us.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom began to speak with sudden eagerness to his companions&apos; faces.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That&apos;s an awfully good one that&apos;s going the rounds about Reuben J. and the son.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; About the boatman? Mr Power asked.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes. Isn&apos;t it awfully good?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What is that? Mr Dedalus asked.<a target="foot" id="fff0029">&ordm;</a> I didn&apos;t hear it.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There was a girl in the case, Mr Bloom began, and he
determined to send him to the isle of Man out of harm&apos;s way but when they were both&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What? Mr Dedalus asked. That
<a name="un4057k" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4057k">confirmed bloody</a> hobbledehoy is it?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, Mr Bloom said. They were both on the way to the boat and he tried to drown&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Drown Barabbas! Mr Dedalus cried. I wish to Christ he did!</p>
<p> Mr Power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; No, Mr Bloom said, the son himself&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> Martin Cunningham
<a name="un1032bd" href="../../FF/unbs/un1all.htm#un1032bd">thwarted his
speech</a> rudely:<a target="foot" id="fff0030">&ordm;</a></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Reuben J. and the son were piking it down the quay next
the river on their way to the isle of Man boat and the young chiseller suddenly
got loose and over the wall with him into the Liffey.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; For God&apos; sake! Mr Dedalus exclaimed in fright. Is he dead?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Dead! Martin Cunningham cried. Not he! A boatman got a
pole and fished him out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to the
father on the quay
<a name="un4005bg" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4005bg">more</a><a target="foot" id="fff0031">&ordm;</a>
<a name="un4005bg" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4005bg">dead than alive</a>. Half the town was there.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, Mr Bloom said. But the funny part is&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And Reuben J., Martin Cunningham said, gave the boatman a
florin for saving his son&apos;s life.</p>
<p> A stifled sigh came from under Mr Power&apos;s hand.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O, he did, Martin Cunningham affirmed. Like a hero. A silver florin.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Isn&apos;t it awfully good? Mr Bloom said eagerly.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; One and eightpence too much, Mr Dedalus said drily. </p>
<p> Mr Power&apos;s choked laugh burst quietly in the carriage.</p>
<p> Nelson&apos;s pillar.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Eight plums a penny! Eight for a penny!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; We had better look a little serious, Martin Cunningham said.</p>
<p> Mr Dedalus sighed.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ah then<a target="foot" id="fff0032">&ordm;</a> indeed, he
said, poor little Paddy wouldn&apos;t grudge us a laugh. Many a good one he told himself.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The Lord forgive me! Mr Power said, wiping his wet eyes
with his fingers. Poor Paddy! I little thought a week ago when I saw him last
and he was <a name="un4004af" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4004af">in his
usual health</a> that I&apos;d be driving after him like this.
<a name="un4004j" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4004j">He&apos;s gone</a> from us.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; As decent a little man as ever wore a hat, Mr Dedalus said. He went very suddenly.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Breakdown, Martin Cunningham said. Heart.</p>
<p> He tapped his chest sadly.</p>
<p> <a name="un3017c" href="../../FF/unbs/un3all.htm#un3017c">Blazing face:

<p> Mr Power gazed at the passing houses with rueful apprehension.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He had a sudden death, poor fellow, he said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The best death, Mr Bloom said.</p>
<p> Their<a target="foot" id="fff0033">&ordm;</a>
wideopen<a target="foot" id="fff0034">&ordm;</a> eyes looked at him.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; No suffering, he said. A moment and all is over. Like
<a name="un6006av" href="../../FF/unbs/un6all.htm#un6006av">dying in sleep</a>.</p>
<p> No-one spoke.</p>

<p class="di">&mdash; Poor little thing, Mr Dedalus said. It&apos;s well out of it.</p>
<p> The carriage climbed more slowly the hill of Rutland square.

Over the stones.</a> Only a pauper. Nobody owns.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; In the midst of life, Martin Cunningham said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; But the worst of all, Mr Power said, is the man who
<a name="un4005cs" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4005cs">takes his own life</a>.</p>
<p> Martin Cunningham drew out his watch briskly, coughed and put it back.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The greatest disgrace to have in the family, Mr Power added.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="un2043f" href="../../FF/unbs/un2all.htm#un2043f">Temporary

<p class="di">&mdash; They say a man who does it is a coward, Mr Dedalus said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It is not for us to judge, Martin Cunningham said.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom, about to speak, closed his lips again. Martin Cunningham&apos;s
large eyes. Looking away now. Sympathetic human man he is. Intelligent. Like
Shakespeare&apos;s face. Always a good word to say.

<p> That afternoon of the inquest. The redlabelled bottle on the table. The room
in the hotel with hunting pictures. Stuffy it was. Sunlight through the slats of
the Venetian blinds. The coroner&apos;s ears, big and hairy. Boots giving
evidence. Thought he was asleep first. Then saw like yellow streaks on his face.

<p> No more pain. Wake no more. Nobody owns.</p>
<p> The carriage rattled swiftly along Blessington street. Over the stones. </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; We are going the pace, I think, Martin Cunningham said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; God grant he doesn&apos;t upset us on the road, Mr Power said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I hope not, Martin Cunningham said. That will be a great
race tomorrow in Germany. The Gordon Bennett.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, by Jove, Mr Dedalus said. That will be worth seeing, faith.</p>
<p> As they turned into Berkeley street a streetorgan near the Basin sent over
and after them a rollicking rattling song of the halls. Has anybody here seen
Kelly? Kay ee double ell wy. Dead March<a target="foot" id="fff0042">&ordm;</a>
from <i>Saul</i>. He&apos;s as bad as old Antonio. He left me on my ownio.
Pirouette! The <i>Mater

<a name="un4002aj" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4002aj">Our Lady&apos;s
Hospice for the dying.</a> Deadhouse handy underneath. Where old Mrs Riordan
died. They look terrible the women. Her

<a name="un6006bi" href="../../FF/unbs/un6all.htm#un6006bi">rubbing her mouth

for her to die</a>. Nice young student that was dressed that bite the bee gave
me. He&apos;s gone over to the lying-in hospital they told me. From one extreme to the other.</p>
<p> The carriage galloped round a corner: stopped.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What&apos;s wrong now?</p>
<p> A divided drove of
<a name="un4057ag" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4057ag">branded</a> cattle
passed the windows, lowing, slouching by on padded hoofs,
<a name="un1032bu" href="../../FF/unbs/un1all.htm#un1032bu">whisking their
tails</a> slowly on their clotted bony croups. Outside them and through them ran
<a name="un4004bc" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4004bc">raddled</a> sheep bleating their fear.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Emigrants, Mr Power said.</p>

voice cried, his switch sounding on their flanks. Huuuh! Out<a target="foot" id="fff0044">&ordm;</a> of that!</p>
<p> Thursday of course. Tomorrow is killing day. Springers. Cuffe sold them
about twentyseven quid each. For Liverpool probably.
<a name="un1016p" href="../../FF/unbs/un1all.htm#un1016p">Roast beef for old

<p> The carriage moved on through the drove.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I can&apos;t make out why the corporation doesn&apos;t run
a tramline from the parkgate to the quays, Mr Bloom said. All those animals
could be taken in trucks down to the boats.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Instead of blocking up the thoroughfare, Martin Cunningham said. Quite right. They ought to.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, Mr Bloom said, and another thing I often thought is
to have  municipal funeral trams like they have in Milan, you know. Run the line
out to the cemetery gates and have special trams, hearse and carriage and all. Don&apos;t you see what I mean?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O that be damned for a story, Mr Dedalus said.
<a name="un7021j" href="../../FF/unbs/un7all.htm#un7021j">Pullman car and saloon diningroom.</a></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A poor lookout for Corny, Mr Power added.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Why? Mr Bloom asked, turning to Mr Dedalus. Wouldn&apos;t
it be more decent than galloping two abreast?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Well, there&apos;s something in that, Mr Dedalus granted.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And, Martin Cunningham said, we wouldn&apos;t have scenes
like that when the hearse capsized round Dunphy&apos;s and upset the coffin on to the road.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That was terrible, Mr Power&apos;s shocked face said, and
the corpse fell about the road. Terrible!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; First round Dunphy&apos;s, Mr Dedalus said, nodding. Gordon Bennett cup.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Praises be to God! Martin Cunningham said piously.</p>
<p> Bom! Upset. A coffin bumped out on to the road. Burst open. Paddy Dignam
shot out and rolling over stiff in the dust in a brown habit too large for him.
Red face: grey now. Mouth fallen open. Asking what&apos;s up now. Quite right to
close it. Looks horrid open. Then the insides decompose quickly. Much better to
close up all the orifices. Yes, also. With wax. The
<a name="un4057ac" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4057ac">sphincter loose</a>. Seal up all.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Dunphy&apos;s, Mr Power announced as the carriage turned right.</p>
<p> Dunphy&apos;s corner. Mourning coaches drawn
up,<a target="foot" id="fff0045">&ordm;</a> drowning their grief. A
pause<a target="foot" id="fff0046">&ordm;</a> by the wayside. Tiptop position
for a pub. Expect we&apos;ll pull up here on the way back to drink his health.

<p> But suppose now it did happen. Would he bleed if a nail say cut him in the
knocking about? He would and he wouldn&apos;t, I suppose. Depends on where. The
circulation stops. Still some might ooze out of an artery. It would be better to bury them in red: a dark red.</p>
<p> In silence they drove along Phibsborough road. An empty hearse trotted by,
coming from the cemetery: looks relieved.</p>
<p> Crossguns bridge: the royal canal.</p>
<p> Water rushed roaring through the sluices. A man stood on his dropping barge
between clamps of turf. On the towpath by the lock a slacktethered horse. Aboard
of the <a name="un3050d" href="../../FF/unbs/un3all.htm#un3050d"><i>Bugabu</i></a>.</p>
<p> Their eyes watched him. On the slow weedy waterway he had floated on his

<p> They drove on<a target="foot" id="fff0049">&ordm;</a> past Brian Boroimhe house. Near it now.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I wonder how is our friend Fogarty getting on, Mr Power said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Better ask Tom Kernan, Mr Dedalus said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; How is that? Martin Cunningham said. Left him weeping I suppose.</p>

<p> The carriage steered left for Finglas road.</p>
<p> The stonecutter&apos;s yard on the right. Last lap. Crowded on the spit of
land silent shapes appeared, white, sorrowful, holding out calm hands, knelt in
grief, pointing. Fragments of shapes, hewn. In white silence: appealing.
<a name="un4004bp" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4004bp">The best

<p> On the curbstone before Jimmy Geary,<a target="foot" id="fff0050">&ordm;</a>
the sexton&apos;s, an old tramp sat, grumbling, emptying the dirt and stones out
of his huge dustbrown yawning boot. After life&apos;s journey.</p>
<p> Gloomy gardens then went by, one by one: gloomy houses.</p>
<p> Mr Power pointed.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That is where Childs was murdered, he said. The last house.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; So it is, Mr Dedalus said. A

Seymour Bushe got him off. Murdered his brother. Or so they said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The crown had no evidence, Mr Power said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Only circumstantial, Martin Cunningham said. That&apos;s
the maxim of the law. Better for ninetynine guilty to escape than for one
innocent person to be wrongfully condemned.</p>
<p> They looked. Murderer&apos;s ground. It passed darkly. Shuttered,
tenantless, unweeded garden. Whole place gone to hell. Wrongfully condemned.
Murder. <a name="un5004bd" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5004bd">The

<p> The high railings of Prospect rippled past their gaze. Dark poplars, rare
white forms. Forms more frequent, white shapes thronged amid the trees, white
forms and fragments streaming by mutely, sustaining vain gestures on the air.</p>
<p> The felly harshed against the curbstone: stopped. Martin Cunningham put out
his arm and, wrenching back the handle, shoved the door open with his knee. He
stepped out. Mr Power and Mr Dedalus followed.</p>
<p> Change that soap now. Mr Bloom&apos;s hand unbuttoned his hip pocket swiftly
and transferred the paperstuck soap to his inner handkerchief pocket. He stepped
out of the carriage, replacing the newspaper his other hand still held.</p>

<p> He followed his companions. Mr Kernan and Ned Lambert followed, Hynes

<p> Where is that child&apos;s funeral disappeared to?</p>
<p> <a name="un4005bk" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4005bk">A team of

Martin Cunningham whispered. Had the
<a name="un1017e" href="../../FF/unbs/un1all.htm#un1017e">Queen&apos;s hotel in
Ennis</a>. You heard him say he was going to Clare. Anniversary.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O God! Mr Power
whispered<a target="foot" id="fff0056">&ordm;</a>. First I heard of it. Poisoned himself!</p>
<p> He glanced behind him to where a face with dark thinking eyes followed
towards the cardinal&apos;s mausoleum. Speaking.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Was he insured? Mr Bloom asked.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I believe so, Mr Kernan answered, but the policy was
heavily mortgaged. Martin is trying to get the
<a name="un4004c" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4004c">youngster</a> into Artane.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; How many children did he leave?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Five. Ned Lambert says he&apos;ll try to get one of the girls into Todd&apos;s.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A sad case, Mr Bloom said gently. Five young children.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A great blow to the poor wife, Mr Kernan added.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Indeed yes, Mr Bloom agreed.</p>
<p> Has the laugh at him now.</p>
<p> He looked down at the boots he had blacked and polished. She had outlived
him,

<p class="di">&mdash; How are you, Simon? Ned Lambert said softly,
<a name="un4057d" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4057d">clasping</a> hands.
Haven&apos;t seen you for a month of Sundays.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;

<p class="di">&mdash; I was down there for
the<a target="foot" id="fff0058">&ordm;</a> Cork park races on Easter Monday,
Ned Lambert said. Same old six and eightpence. Stopped with Dick Tivy.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And how is Dick, the solid man?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Nothing between himself and heaven, Ned Lambert answered.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="un4005b" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4005b">By the holy Paul</a>!
Mr Dedalus said in subdued wonder. Dick Tivy bald?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Martin is going to get up a whip for the youngsters, Ned
Lambert said, pointing ahead. A few bob a skull. Just to keep them going till the insurance is cleared up.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, yes, Mr Dedalus said dubiously. Is that the eldest boy in front?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, Ned Lambert said, with the wife&apos;s brother.
<a name="un3031c" href="../../FF/unbs/un3all.htm#un3031c">John Henry Menton is
behind</a>. He put down his name for a quid.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I&apos;ll engage he did, Mr Dedalus said. I often told
poor Paddy he ought to mind that job. John Henry is not the worst in the world.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; How did he lose it? Ned Lambert asked. Liquor, what?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Many a good man&apos;s fault, Mr Dedalus said with a sigh.</p>
<p> They halted about the door of the mortuary chapel. Mr Bloom stood behind the
boy with the wreath, looking down at his
sleekcombed<a target="foot" id="fff0059">&ordm;</a> hair and
at<a target="foot" id="fff0060">&ordm;</a> the slender furrowed neck inside his
brandnew collar. Poor boy! Was he there when the father? Both
<a name="un4005u" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4005u">unconscious</a>.
<a name="un6006aq" href="../../FF/unbs/un6all.htm#un6006aq">Lighten up at the
last moment</a> and

<a name="un4004cf" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4004cf">for the last
time</a>. All he might have done. I owe three shillings to O&apos;Grady. Would
he understand? The mutes bore the coffin into the chapel. Which end is his head?</p>
<p> After a moment he followed the others in, blinking in the screened light.
The coffin lay on its bier before the
chancel,<a target="foot" id="fff0061">&ordm;</a> four tall yellow candles at its
corners. Always in front of us. Corny Kelleher, laying a wreath at each fore
corner, beckoned to the boy to kneel. The mourners knelt here and there in
praying desks. Mr Bloom stood behind near the font and, when all had
knelt,<a target="foot" id="fff0062">&ordm;</a> dropped carefully his unfolded
newspaper from his pocket and knelt his right knee upon it. He fitted his black
hat gently on his left knee and, holding its brim, bent over piously.</p>
<p> A server, bearing a brass bucket with something in it, came out through a
door. The whitesmocked priest came after
him,<a target="foot" id="fff0063">&ordm;</a> tidying his stole with one hand,
balancing with the other a little book against his toad&apos;s belly.
<a name="un4005cr" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4005cr">Who&apos;ll read the book? I, said the rook.</a></p>
<p> They halted by the bier and the priest began to read out of his book with a fluent croak. </p>
<p> Father Coffey. I knew his name was like a coffin.
<i>Dominenamine</i><a target="foot" id="fff0064">&ordm;</a>.

bad <a name="un4057ap" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4057ap">gas</a> round
the place. Butchers for instance: they get like raw beefsteaks. Who was telling
me? Mervyn Browne<a target="foot" id="fff0067">&ordm;</a>. Down in the vaults of
saint Werburgh&apos;s lovely old organ hundred and fifty they have to bore a
hole in the coffins sometimes to let out the bad gas and burn it. Out it rushes:
blue. One whiff of that and you&apos;re a goner.</p>
<p> My kneecap is hurting me. Ow. That&apos;s better.</p>
<p> The priest took a stick with a knob at the end of it out of the boy&apos;s
bucket and shook it over the coffin. Then he walked to the other end and shook
it again. Then he came back and put it back in the bucket. As you were before
you rested. It&apos;s all written down: he has to do it.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>Et ne nos inducas in tentationem</i>.</p>
<p> The server piped the answers in the treble. I often thought it would be
better to have boy servants. Up to fifteen or so. After that of course&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> Holy water that was, I expect. Shaking sleep out of it. He must be fed up
with that job, shaking that thing over all the corpses they trot up. What harm
if he could see what he was shaking it over. Every mortal day a fresh batch:
middleaged men, old women, children, women dead in childbirth, men with beards,
baldheaded business men, consumptive girls with little sparrows&apos; breasts.
All the year round he prayed the same thing over them all and shook water on top of them: sleep. On Dignam now.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>In paradisum.</i></p>
<p> Said he was going to paradise or is in paradise. Says that over everybody.
Tiresome kind of a job. But he has to say something.</p>
<p> The priest closed his book and went off, followed by the server. Corny
 Kelleher opened the sidedoors and the gravediggers came in, hoisted the coffin
again, carried it out and shoved it on their cart. Corny Kelleher gave one
wreath to the boy and one to the brother-in-law. All followed them out of the
sidedoors into the mild grey air. Mr Bloom came last, folding his paper again
into his pocket. He gazed gravely at the ground till the coffincart wheeled off
to the left. The metal wheels ground the gravel with a sharp grating cry and the
pack of blunt boots followed the<a target="foot" id="fff0068">&ordm;</a> barrow along a lane of sepulchres.</p>
<p> The ree the ra the ree the ra the roo. Lord, I mustn&apos;t

<p> Mr Power&apos;s soft eyes went up to the apex of the lofty cone.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He&apos;s at rest, he said, in the middle of his people,
<a name="un3031i" href="../../FF/unbs/un3all.htm#un3031i">old Dan O&apos;. But
his heart is buried in Rome</a>. How many broken hearts are buried here, Simon!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Her grave is over there, Jack, Mr Dedalus said. I&apos;ll
soon be stretched beside her. Let Him<a target="foot" id="fff0069">&ordm;</a> take me whenever He likes.</p>
<p> <a name="un4005ar" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4005ar">Breaking
down</a>, he began to weep to himself quietly, stumbling a little in his walk. Mr Power took his arm.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; She&apos;s better where she is, he said kindly.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I suppose so, Mr Dedalus said with a weak gasp. I suppose
she is in heaven if there is a heaven.</p>
<p> Corny Kelleher stepped aside from his rank and allowed the mourners to plod by.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Sad occasions, Mr Kernan began politely.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom closed his eyes and sadly twice bowed his head.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The others are putting on their hats, Mr Kernan said. I
suppose we can do so too. We are the last. This cemetery is a treacherous place.</p>
<p> They covered their heads.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The reverend gentleman read the service too quickly,
don&apos;t you think? Mr Kernan said with reproof.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom nodded gravely, looking in the quick bloodshot eyes. Secret eyes,
secret searching<a target="foot" id="fff0070">&ordm;</a> eyes. Mason, I think:
not sure. Beside him again. We are the last. In the same boat. Hope he&apos;ll say something else.</p>
<p> Mr Kernan added:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The service of the Irish church, used in Mount Jerome, is
simpler, more impressive, I must say.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom gave prudent assent. The language of course was another thing.</p>
<p> Mr Kernan said with solemnity: </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>I am the resurrection and the life.</i> That touches a man&apos;s inmost heart.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It does, Mr Bloom said.</p>
<p> Your heart perhaps but what price the fellow in the six feet by two with his

<p> Corny Kelleher fell into step at their side.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Everything went off A 1<a target="foot" id="fff0071">&ordm;</a>, he said. What?</p>
<p> He looked on them from his drawling eye. Policeman&apos;s shoulders.
<a name="un4005au" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4005au">With your tooraloom tooraloom.</a></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; As it should be, Mr Kernan said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What? Eh? Corny Kelleher said.</p>
<p> Mr Kernan assured him.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who is that chap behind with Tom Kernan? John Henry Menton asked. I know his face.</p>
<p> Ned Lambert glanced back.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Bloom, he said.<a target="foot" id="fff0072">&ordm;</a>
Madam Marion Tweedy that was, is, I mean, the soprano. She&apos;s his wife.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O, to be sure, John Henry Menton said. I haven&apos;t seen
her for some time. She was a finelooking woman. I danced with her, wait,
fifteen,<a target="foot" id="fff0073">&ordm;</a> seventeen golden years ago, at
Mat Dillon&apos;s, in Roundtown. And a good armful she was.</p>
<p> He looked behind through the others.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What is he? he asked. What does he do? Wasn&apos;t he in
the stationery line? I fell foul of him one evening, I remember, at bowls.</p>
<p> Ned Lambert smiled.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, he was, he said, in Wisdom Hely&apos;s. A traveller for blottingpaper.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; In God&apos;s name, John Henry Menton said, what did she
marry a coon like that for? She had plenty of game in her then.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Has still, Ned Lambert said. He does some canvassing for ads.</p>
<p> John Henry Menton&apos;s large eyes stared ahead. </p>
<p> The barrow turned into a side lane. A portly man, ambushed among the
grasses, raised his hat in homage. The gravediggers touched their caps.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; John O&apos;Connell, Mr Power said, pleased. He never forgets a friend.</p>
<p> Mr O&apos;Connell shook all their hands in silence. Mr Dedalus said:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I am come to pay you another visit.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; My<a target="foot" id="fff0074">&ordm;</a> dear Simon, the
caretaker answered in a low voice. I don&apos;t want your custom at all.</p>
<p> Saluting Ned Lambert and John Henry Menton he walked on at Martin
Cunningham&apos;s side, puzzling two long<a target="foot" id="fff0075">&ordm;</a> keys at his back.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Did you hear that one, he asked them, about Mulcahy from the Coombe?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I did not, Martin Cunningham said.</p>
<p> They bent their silk hats in concert and Hynes inclined his ear. The
caretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold
watchchain<a target="foot" id="fff0076">&ordm;</a> and spoke in a discreet tone to their vacant smiles.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; They tell the story, he said, that two drunks came out
here one foggy evening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs. They asked
for Mulcahy from the Coombe and were told where he was buried. After traipsing
about in the fog they found the grave<a target="foot" id="fff0077">&ordm;</a>
sure enough. One of the drunks spelt out the name: Terence Mulcahy. The other
drunk was blinking up at a statue of our Saviour the widow had got put up.</p>
<p> The caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed. He resumed:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And, after blinking up at
<a name="un4036bc" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4036bc">the sacred
figure</a>, <i>Not a bloody bit like the man</i>, says he. <i>That&apos;s not
Mulcahy</i>, says he, <i>whoever done it</i>.</p>
<p> Rewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with Corny Kelleher, accepting the
dockets given him, turning them over and scanning them as he walked.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That&apos;s all done with a purpose, Martin Cunningham explained to Hynes.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I know, Hynes said, I know that.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; To cheer a fellow up, Martin Cunningham said. It&apos;s
pure goodheartedness: damn the thing else.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom admired the caretaker&apos;s prosperous bulk.

<p> Clay, brown, damp, began to be seen in the hole. It rose. Nearly over. A
mound of damp clods rose more, rose, and the gravediggers rested their spades.
All uncovered again for a few instants. The boy propped his wreath against a
corner: the brother-in-law his on a lump. The gravediggers put on their caps and
carried their earthy spades towards the barrow. Then knocked the blades lightly
on the turf: clean. One bent to pluck from the haft a long tuft of grass. One,
leaving his mates, walked slowly on with shouldered weapon, its blade
blueglancing. Silently at the gravehead another coiled the coffinband.

without aim, by devious paths, staying awhile to read a name on a tomb.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Let us go round by the chief&apos;s grave, Hynes said. We have time.</p>

<p> They turned to the right, following their slow thoughts. With awe Mr Power&apos;s blank voice spoke:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Some say he is not in that grave at all. That the coffin
was filled with stones. That one day he will come again.</p>

live warm beings near you. Let them sleep in their maggoty beds. They are not

<p> Martin Cunningham emerged from a sidepath, talking gravely.</p>
<p> Solicitor, I think. I know his face.
Menton,<a target="foot" id="fff0105">&ordm;</a> John Henry, solicitor,
commissioner for oaths and affidavits. Dignam used to be in his office. Mat
Dillon&apos;s long ago.

of gold</a> really. Yes, Menton. Got his rag out that evening on  the bowling
green because I sailed inside him. Pure fluke of mine: the bias.
<a name="un4005h" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4005h">Why he took such a

<p> Got a dinge in the side of his hat. Carriage probably.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Excuse me, sir, Mr Bloom said beside them.</p>
<p> They stopped.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Your hat is a little crushed, Mr Bloom said, pointing.</p>
<p> John Henry Menton stared at him for an instant without moving.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There, Martin Cunningham helped, pointing also.</p>
<p> John Henry Menton took off his hat, bulged out the dinge and smoothed the
nap with care on his coatsleeve. He clapped the hat on his head again.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It&apos;s all right now, Martin Cunningham said.</p>
<p> John Henry Menton jerked his head down in acknowledgment.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Thank you, he said shortly.</p>
<p> They walked on towards the gates. Mr Bloom,
<a name="un4005p" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4005p">chapfallen,</a> drew
behind a few paces so as not to overhear. Martin laying down the law. Martin
could wind a

that round his little finger without his seeing it.</p>
<p> Oyster eyes. Never mind. Be sorry after perhaps when it dawns on him. Get the pull over him that way.</p>
<p> Thank you. How grand we are this morning!</p>  </main>
