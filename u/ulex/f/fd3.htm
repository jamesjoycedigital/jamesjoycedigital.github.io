<br><font color="green">{u21, 99}</font> </p>
<p> All waited. Nothing was said. Stowing in the wreaths probably. I am sitting
on something hard.

<p> All waited. Then wheels were heard from in front,
turning<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
then nearer: then horses&apos; hoofs. A jolt. Their carriage began to move, creaking and swaying.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 85}</font>
<br> Other hoofs and creaking wheels started behind. The
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">drawn</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
blinds of the avenue passed and number ten with its craped knocker, door ajar. At walking pace.</p>
<p> They waited still, their knees
jogging<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
till they had turned and were passing along the

Tritonville road. Quicker. The wheels rattled rolling over the cobbled causeway
and the crazy glasses shook rattling in the doorframes.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What way is he taking us? Mr Power asked of both windows.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Through Irishtown, Martin Cunningham said. Ringsend. Brunswick street.</p>
<p> Mr Dedalus nodded, looking
out<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">:</span></span><font color="black">.</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That&apos;s a fine old custom, he said. I am glad to see it has not died out.</p>
<p> All watched awhile through their windows caps and hats lifted by passers.
Respect. The carriage swerved from the tramtrack to the smoother road. Mr Bloom
at gaze saw a lithe young man, clad in mourning, a wide hat.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There&apos;s a friend of yours gone by, Dedalus, he said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who is that?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Your son and heir.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Where is he? Mr Dedalus said, stretching
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><font color="black">over<a target="foot" id="fff0005">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>

corner and, swerving back to the tramtrack, rolled on noisily with chattering wheels. Mr Dedalus fell back, saying:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Was that Mulligan cad with him?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; No, Mr Bloom said. He was alone.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Down with his aunt Sally, I suppose, Mr Dedalus said, and
the drunken little costdrawer and Crissie, papa&apos;s little lump of dung, the
wise child that knows her own father.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom smiled joylessly on Ringsend

street with Ignatius Gallaher on a Sunday morning, the landlady&apos;s two hats
pinned on his head. Out on the rampage all night. Beginning to tell on him now:
that backache of his, I fear. Thinks he&apos;ll cure it with pills. All
breadcrumbs they are. About six hundred per cent profit.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He&apos;s in with a lowdown crowd, Mr Dedalus snarled.
That Mulligan is a contaminated bloody ruffian. His name stinks all

she is that will open her eye as wide as a gate. I&apos;ll tickle his catastrophe, believe you me.</p>
<p> He cried above the clatter of the wheels.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I won&apos;t have her bastard of a nephew ruin my son. A

<p> He ceased. Mr Bloom glanced from his angry moustache to Mr Power&apos;s mild
face and Martin Cunningham&apos;s eyes and beard, gravely shaking. Noisy
selfwilled man. Full of his son. He is right. Something to hand on. If little
Rudy had lived. See him grow up. Hear his voice in the house. Walking beside
Molly. My son. Me in his eyes. Strange feeling it would be. From me. Just a
chance. Must have been that morning she was at the
window<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
watching the two dogs at it by the wall of the cease to do evil. And the warder
grinning up. She had that cream gown on with the

<p> The carriage heeled over and back, their four trunks swaying.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Corny might have given us a more commodious yoke, Mr Power said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He might, Mr Dedalus said, if he hadn&apos;t that squint troubling him. Do you follow me?</p>
<p> He closed his left eye. Martin Cunningham began to brush away crustcrumbs from under his thighs.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What is this, he said, in the name of God? Crumbs?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Someone seems to have been making a picnic party here lately, Mr Power said.</p>
<p> All raised their thighs and eyed with disfavour the mildewed buttonless
leather of the seats. Mr Dedalus, twisting his nose, frowned downward and said:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Unless I&apos;m greatly
mistaken<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">&nbsp;&hellip;</span></span><font color="black">.</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
What do you think, Martin?
<br><font color="green">{u22, 87}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It struck me
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">also</span></span>
<font color="black">too</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>, Martin Cunningham said.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom set his thigh down. Glad I took that bath. Feel my feet quite clean.</p>
<p> Mr Dedalus sighed resignedly.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; After all, he said, it&apos;s the most natural thing in the world.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Did Tom Kernan turn up? Martin Cunningham asked, twirling the peak of his beard gently.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, Mr Bloom answered. He&apos;s behind with Ned Lambert and Hynes.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And Corny Kelleher himself? Mr Power asked.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; At the cemetery, Martin Cunningham said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I met M&apos;Coy this morning, Mr Bloom said. He said he&apos;d try to come.</p>
<p> The carriage halted short.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What&apos;s wrong?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; We&apos;re stopped.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Where are we?
<br><font color="green">{u21, 102}</font> </p>
<p> Mr Bloom put his head out of the window.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><font color="black">grand</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
canal, he said.</p>
<p> Gasworks. Whooping cough they say it cures. Good job Milly never got it.
Poor children! Doubles them up black and blue. Shame really. Dogs&apos; home
over there. Poor old Athos! Be good to Athos, Leopold, is my last wish. He took
it to heart, pined away. Quiet brute. Old men&apos;s dogs usually are.</p>
<p> A raindrop spat on his

<font color="black">hat</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>.
He drew back
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">his

an instant of shower spray dots over the grey

<p class="di">&mdash; The weather is changing, he said quietly.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A pity it did not keep up fine, Martin Cunningham said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Wanted for the country, Mr Power said. There&apos;s the sun again coming out.</p>
<p> Mr Dedalus, peering through his glasses towards the veiled sun, hurled a mute curse at the sky.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It&apos;s as uncertain as a child&apos;s bottom, he said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; We&apos;re off again.</p>
<p> The carriage turned again its stiff wheels and their trunks swayed gently.
Martin Cunningham twirled more quickly the peak of his beard.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 88}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Tom Kernan was immense last night, he said.</p>

<p class="di">&mdash; I did not then, Mr Dedalus said. Where is it?</p>

<p class="di">&mdash; He doesn&apos;t see us, Mr Power said. Yes, he does. How do you do?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who? Mr Dedalus asked.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Blazes Boylan, Mr Power said. There he is airing his quiff.</p>
<p> Just that moment I was thinking.</p>
<p> Mr Dedalus bent across to salute. From the door of the Red Bank the white
disc of a straw hat flashed reply:
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">spruce

<p> Mr Bloom reviewed the nails of his left hand, then those of his right hand.
The nails, yes. Is there anything more in

<font color="black">him</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>

Instinct. But a type like that. My nails. I am just looking at them: well pared.
And after: thinking alone. Body getting a

from remembering. What causes that? I suppose the skin can&apos;t contract
quickly enough when the flesh falls off. But the shape is there. The shape is there still.</p>
<p> He clasped his hands between his knees and, satisfied, sent his vacant glance over their faces.</p>
<p> Mr Power asked:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; How is the concert tour getting on, Bloom?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
O<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>

<p class="di">&mdash; Are you going yourself?
<br><font color="green">{u22, 90}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Well no, Mr Bloom said. I am not sure, that is. You see
the idea is to tour the chief towns.

<p> His eyes passed lightly over Mr Power&apos;s goodlooking face. Greyish over
the ears. <i>Madame</i>: smiling. I smiled back. Only politeness perhaps. Nice
fellow. Who knows is that true about the woman he keeps? Not pleasant for the
wife. Yet they say, who was it told me, there is no carnal. You would imagine
that would get played out pretty quick. Yes, it was Crofton met him one evening
bringing her a pound of rumpsteak. What is this she was? Barmaid in Jury&apos;s. Or the Moira, was it?</p>

<p> A tall blackbearded figure, bent on a stick,
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">was</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>

open on his spine.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 91}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; In all his pristine beauty, Mr Power said.</p>
<p> Mr Dedalus looked after the stumping figure and said mildly:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The devil break the hasp of your back!</p>
<p> Mr Power, collapsing in laughter, shaded his face from the carriage window.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; We have all been there, Martin Cunningham said broadly.</p>
<p> His eyes met Mr Bloom&apos;s eyes. He caressed his beard, adding:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Well, nearly all of us.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom began to speak with sudden eagerness to his companions&apos; faces.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That&apos;s an awfully good
one<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,
he said,</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
that&apos;s going the rounds about Reuben J and the son.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; About the boatman? Mr Power asked.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes. Isn&apos;t it awfully good?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What is that? Mr Dedalus asked. I didn&apos;t hear it.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There was a girl in the case, Mr Bloom began, and he
determined to send him to
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Isle</span></span>
<font color="black">the

<p class="di">&mdash; What? Mr Dedalus asked. That hobbledehoy is it?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, Mr Bloom said. They were both on the way to the boat
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><font color="black">and</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
he tried to drown&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">No,</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
Mr Power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; No, Mr Bloom said, the son himself&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> Martin Cunningham thwarted his speech rudely:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Reuben J and the son were piking it down the quay next the
river on their way to the
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Isle</span></span>
<font color="black">isle</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
of Man boat and the young chiseller suddenly got loose and over the wall with him into the Liffey.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 107}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; For God&apos; sake! Mr Dedalus exclaimed in fright. Is he dead?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Dead! Martin Cunningham cried. Not he! A boatman got a
pole and fished him out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to the
father on the quay. Half the town was there.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, Mr Bloom said. But the funny part is&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And Reuben J, Martin Cunningham said, gave the boatman a
florin for saving his son&apos;s life.</p>
<p> A stifled sigh came from under Mr Power&apos;s hand.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O, he did, Martin Cunningham affirmed. Like a
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">man</span></span>
<font color="black">hero</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>. A silver florin.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Isn&apos;t it awfully good? Mr Bloom said eagerly.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; One and eightpence too much, Mr Dedalus said drily.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 92}</font> </p>
<p> Mr Power&apos;s choked laugh burst quietly in the carriage.</p>
<p> <font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><font color="black">Nelson&apos;s pillar.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Eight plums a penny. Eight for a
penny.</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; We had better look a little serious, Martin Cunningham said.</p>
<p> Mr Dedalus sighed.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
Ah<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
then<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
indeed, he said, poor little Paddy wouldn&apos;t grudge us a laugh. Many a good one he told himself.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The Lord forgive me! Mr Power said, wiping his wet eyes
with his fingers. Poor Paddy! I little thought a week ago when I saw him last
that I&apos;d be driving after him like this.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; As decent a little man as ever wore a hat, Mr Dedalus said. He went very suddenly.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Breakdown, Martin Cunningham said. Heart.</p>
<p> He tapped his chest sadly.</p>
<p> Blazing face:
redhot<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><font color="black">.</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font></p>
<p> Mr Power gazed at the passing houses with rueful apprehension.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He had a sudden death, poor fellow, he said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The best death, Mr Bloom said.</p>
<p> Their wideopen eyes looked at him.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 108}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; No suffering, he said. A moment and all is over.</p>
<p> No-one spoke.</p>
<p> Horses with white frontlet plumes came round the Rotunda corner, galloping.
A tiny coffin flashed by. A mourning coach.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Sad, Martin Cunningham said. A child.</p>
<p> A dwarf&apos;s face, mauve and wrinkled like little Rudy&apos;s was.
Dwarf&apos;s body, weak as putty, in a whitelined box. Meant nothing. Mistake of nature.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 93}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Poor little thing, Mr Dedalus said. It&apos;s well out of it.</p>
<p> The carriage climbed more slowly the hill of Rutland square.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; In the midst of life, Martin Cunningham said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; But the worst of all, Mr Power said, is the suicide.</p>
<p> Martin Cunningham drew out his watch
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><font color="black">briskly</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>,
coughed<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
and put it back.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The greatest disgrace to have in the family, Mr Power
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">said</span></span>
<font color="black">added</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Temporary insanity, of course, Martin Cunningham said
decisively. We must take a charitable view of it.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; They say a man who does it is a coward, Mr Dedalus said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It is not for us to judge, Martin Cunningham said.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom, about to speak, closed his lips again. Martin Cunningham&apos;s
large eyes. Looking away now. Sympathetic human man he is. Intelligent. Like
Shakespeare&apos;s face. Always a good word to
<br><font color="green">{u21, 109}</font>
<br> say. And that awful drunkard of a wife of his. Setting up house for her
time after time and then pawning the furniture on him. Wear out a man&apos;s
heart. Lord, she must have looked a sight that night Dedalus told me he was in
there. Drunk about the
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">room</span></span>
<font color="black">place</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
and capering with Martin&apos;s umbrella.</p>
<p class="set"><i>And they call me the jewel of</i>

<br> <i>Of Asia,</i>

<p> He looked away from me. He knows.</p>
<p> That afternoon of the inquest. The redlabelled bottle on the table. The room
in the hotel with hunting pictures. Stuffy it was. Sunlight through the slats of
the Venetian

ears, big and hairy. Boots giving evidence. Thought he was asleep first. Then
saw like yellow streaks on his face. Verdict: overdose. The letter. For my son Leopold.</p>
<p> No more pain. Wake no more.</p>
<p> The carriage rattled swiftly along Berkeley road.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 94}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; We are going the pace, I think, Martin Cunningham said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; God grant he doesn&apos;t upset us on the road, Mr Power said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I hope not, Martin Cunningham said. That will be a great
race tomorrow in Germany. The Gordon Bennett.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, by Jove, Mr Dedalus said. That will be worth seeing, faith.</p>
<p> The carriage galloped round a corner: stopped.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What&apos;s wrong now?</p>
<p> A divided drove of cattle passed the windows, lowing, slouching by on padded
hoofs, whisking their tails slowly on their clotted bony
croups<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><font color="black">.</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Emigrants, Mr Power said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Huuu! the drover&apos;s voice cried, his switch sounding
on their flanks. Huuu!
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><font color="black">out of
that!</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font></p>

probably.

all that raw stuff, hide, hair, horns. Comes to a big thing in a year. Wonder if
that dodge works now getting dicky meat off the train at Clonsilla.</p>
<p> The carriage moved on through the drove.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I can&apos;t make out why the corporation doesn&apos;t run
a tramline from the parkgate to the quays, Mr Bloom said. All those animals
could be taken in trucks down to the boats.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Instead of blocking up the thoroughfare, Martin Cunningham said. Quite right. They ought to.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, Mr Bloom said, and another thing I often
thought<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
is to have
<br><font color="green">{u22, 95}</font>
<br> funeral trams like they have in Milan. You know. Run the line out to the
cemetery gates and have special trams, hearse and carriage and all. Don&apos;t you see what I mean?
<br><font color="green">{u21, 111}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
O<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
that be damned for a story, Mr Dedalus said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A poor lookout for Corny, Mr Power added.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Why? Mr Bloom asked, turning to Mr Dedalus. Wouldn&apos;t
it be more decent than galloping two abreast?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Well, there&apos;s something in that, Mr Dedalus granted.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And, Martin Cunningham said, we wouldn&apos;t have scenes
like that when the hearse capsized round Dunphy&apos;s and upset the coffin on to the road.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That was terrible, Mr Power&apos;s shocked face said, and
the corpse fell about the road.
Terrible<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span><font color="black">!</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; First round Dunphy&apos;s, Mr Dedalus said, nodding.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Praises be to God! Martin Cunningham said piously.</p>
<p> Bom! Upset. A coffin bumped out on to the road. Burst open. Paddy Dignam
shot out and rolling over stiff in the dust in a brown habit too large for him.

Then the insides decompose quickly. Much better to close up all the orifices. Yes, also. With wax. Seal up all.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Dunphy&apos;s, Mr Power announced as the carriage turned right.</p>
<p> Dunphy&apos;s corner. Mourning coaches drawn up, drowning their grief.
Tiptop position for a pub. Expect we&apos;ll pull up here on the way back to drink his health.</p>
<p> But suppose now it did happen. Would he bleed if a nail say cut him in the
knocking
about<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span><font color="black">?</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
He would and he
wouldn&apos;t<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
I suppose. Depends on where. The circulation stops. Still some might ooze out of

<p> In silence they drove along Phibsborough road. An empty hearse trotted by,
coming from the cemetery: looks relieved.</p>

between clamps of turf. On the towpath by the lock a slacktethered horse. Aboard of the Bugabu.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 112}</font> </p>
<p> Their eyes watched him. On the slow weedy waterway he had floated

Dublin. With turf from the midland bogs. Salute. He lifted his brown straw hat, saluting Paddy Dignam.</p>
<p> They drove on. Near it now.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I wonder how is our friend Fogarty getting on, Mr Power said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Better ask Tom Kernan, Mr Dedalus said.</p>

<p> The carriage steered left for Finglas road.</p>
<p> The stonecutter&apos;s yard on the right. Last lap. Crowded on the spit of
land silent shapes appeared, white, sorrowful, holding out calm hands, knelt in
grief, pointing. Fragments of shapes, hewn. In white silence: appealing. Thos.

one by one: gloomy houses.</p>
<p> Mr Power pointed.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That is where Childs was murdered, he said. The last house.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; So it is, Mr Dedalus said. A queer case. Seymour Bushe got
him off. Murdered his brother. Or so they said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The crown had no evidence, Mr Power said.

That&apos;s the maxim of the law. Better for ninetynine guilty to escape than

<p> The high railings of Prospect rippled past their gaze. Dark poplars, rare
white forms. Forms more frequent, white shapes thronged amid the trees, white
forms and fragments streaming by mutely, sustaining vain gestures on the air.</p>

Martin Cunningham put out his arm and, wrenching back the handle, shoved the
door open with his knee. He stepped out. Mr Power and Mr Dedalus followed.</p>

<p> He followed his companions. Mr Kernan and Ned Lambert followed, Hynes

<p> Coffin now. Got here before us, dead as he is. Horse looking round at it
with his plume skeowways. Dull eye: collar tight on his neck, pressing on a
bloodvessel or something. Do they know what they cart out here every day? Must
be twenty or thirty funerals every day. Then Mount Jerome for the protestants.
Funerals all over the world everywhere every minute. Shovelling them under by
the thousand doublequick. Too many in the world.</p>
<p> Mourners came out through the gates: woman and a girl. Leanjawed harpy, hard
woman at a bargain, her bonnet awry. Girl&apos;s face stained with dirt and

<p> The mutes shouldered the coffin and bore it in through the gates. First the

then the friends of the stiff. Corny Kelleher and the boy followed with their
wreaths. Who is that beside them? Ah, the brother-in-law.</p>

All walked after.</p>
<p> Martin Cunningham

<p class="di">&mdash; You made it damned awkward talking of suicide before Bloom.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Did I? Mr Power whispered. How so?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; His father poisoned himself, Martin Cunningham said. Had the Queen&apos;s hotel in Ennis.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O God! Mr Power said. First I heard of it. Poisoned
himself<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">?</span></span><font color="black">!</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font></p>
<p> He glanced behind him to where a face with dark thinking eyes followed. Speaking.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Was he insured? Mr Bloom asked.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I believe so, Mr Kernan
answered<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>

heavily mortgaged. Martin is trying to get the boy into Artane.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; How many children did he leave?
<br><font color="green">{u21, 115}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Five. Ned Lambert says he&apos;ll try to get one of the girls into Todd&apos;s.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A sad case, Mr Bloom said gently.
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">&mdash;</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
Five young children.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A great blow to the poor wife, Mr Kernan added.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Indeed yes, Mr Bloom agreed.</p>
<p> Has the laugh at him now.</p>
<p> He looked down at the boots he had blacked and polished. She had outlived
him. One must outlive the other. She would marry another. Him? No. Yet who knows
after<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span><font color="black">?</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
One must go first: alone, under the ground: and lie no more in her warm bed.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; How are you, Simon? Ned Lambert said, shaking hands.
Haven&apos;t seen you for a month of Sundays.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Can&apos;t complain. How are all in Cork&apos;s own
town<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span><font color="black">?</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
<br><font color="green">{u22, 99}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I was there for the races, Ned Lambert said. Same old six
and eightpence. Stopped with Dick Tivy.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And how is Dick, the solid man?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Nothing between himself and heaven, Ned Lambert answered.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; For God&apos; sake! Mr Dedalus said.
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Is

<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><font color="black">Tivy</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
bald?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Martin is going to get up a whip for the youngsters, Ned
Lambert said, pointing ahead. A few bob a skull. Just to keep them going till
the insurance
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">muddle</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
is cleared up.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, yes, Mr Dedalus said dubiously. Is that the eldest boy in front?
<br><font color="green">{u21, 116}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, Ned Lambert said, with the wife&apos;s brother. John
Henry Menton is behind. He put down his name for a quid.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I&apos;ll engage he did, Mr Dedalus said. I often told
poor Paddy he ought to mind that job. John Henry is not the worst in the world.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; How did he lose it? Ned Lambert asked. Liquor, what?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Many a good man&apos;s fault, Mr Dedalus said with a sigh.</p>
<p> They halted about the door of the mortuary chapel. Mr Bloom stood behind the
boy with the
wreath<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
looking down at his sleekcombed hair and at the slender furrowed neck inside his
brandnew collar. Poor boy! Was he there when the father? Would he understand?
The mutes bore the coffin into the chapel. Which end is his head?
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Always
in front of us.</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font></p>
<p> After a moment he followed the others in, blinking in the screened light.
The coffin lay on its bier before the chancel, four tall yellow candles at its
corners.
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><font color="black">Always
in front of us.</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
Corny Kelleher, laying a wreath at each fore corner, beckoned to the boy to
kneel. The mourners knelt here and there in prayingdesks. Mr Bloom stood behind
near the font and, when all had knelt, dropped carefully his unfolded newspaper
from his pocket and knelt his right knee upon it. He fitted his black hat gently
on his left knee and, holding its brim, bent over piously.</p>
<p> A

came out through a door. The whitesmocked priest came after him, tidying his
stole with one hand, balancing with the other a little book against his toad&apos;s belly.</p>
<p> They halted by the bier and the priest began to read out of his book with a fluent croak.

<p> Holy water that was, I expect. Shaking sleep out of it. He must be fed up
with that job, shaking that thing over all the corpses they trot up. What harm
if he could see what he was shaking it over. Every mortal day a fresh batch:
middleaged men, old women, children, women dead in childbirth, men with beards,
baldheaded business men, consumptive girls with little sparrows&apos; breasts.
All the year round he prayed the same thing over them all and shook water on top of them: sleep. On Dignam now.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; In paradisum.</p>

Tiresome kind of a job. But he has to say something.</p>

<br> Kelleher opened the sidedoors and the gravediggers came in, hoisted the
coffin again, carried it out and shoved it on their cart. Corny

<br> Kelleher gave one wreath to the boy and
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the
other</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font> to the
brother-in-law. All followed them out of the sidedoor into the mild grey air. Mr
Bloom came
last<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
folding his paper again into his pocket. He gazed gravely at the ground till the
coffincart wheeled off to the left. The metal wheels ground the gravel with a
sharp grating cry and the pack of blunt boots followed the
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">trundled</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
barrow along a lane of sepulchres.</p>
<p> The ree the ra the ree the ra the roo. Lord, I mustn&apos;t lilt here.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The O&apos;Connell circle, Mr Dedalus said about him.</p>
<p> Mr Power&apos;s soft eyes went up to the apex of the lofty cone.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He&apos;s at rest, he said, in the middle of his people,
old Dan O&apos;. But his heart is buried in Rome. How many broken hearts are buried here, Simon!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Her grave is over there, Jack, Mr Dedalus said. I&apos;ll
soon be stretched beside her. Let Him take me whenever He likes.</p>
<p> He began to weep to himself quietly, stumbling a little in his walk. Mr Power took his arm.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; She&apos;s better where she is, he said kindly.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I suppose so, Mr Dedalus said with a weak gasp. I suppose
she is in heaven if there is a heaven.</p>
<p> Corny Kelleher stepped aside from his rank and allowed the mourners to plod by.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Sad occasions, Mr Kernan began politely.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; They are, indeed, Mr Bloom said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The others are putting on their hats, Mr Kernan said. I
suppose we can do so too. We are the last. This cemetery is a treacherous place.</p>
<p> They covered their heads.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The reverend gentleman read the service too quickly,

<p> Mr Bloom nodded

looking in the quick bloodshot eyes. Secret eyes,

<p> Mr Kernan added:</p>

<p> Mr Bloom gave prudent assent. The language of course was different.</p>
<p> Mr Kernan said with

<p class="di">&mdash; In God&apos;s name, John Henry Menton said, what did she

<p> The barrow turned into a side lane. A portly man, ambushed among the
grasses, raised his hat in homage. The gravediggers touched their caps.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; John O&apos;Connell, Mr Power
said<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
pleased. He never forgets a friend.</p>
<p> Mr O&apos;Connell shook all their hands in silence. Mr Dedalus said:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I am come to pay you another visit.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; My dear Simon, the caretaker answered in a low voice. I don&apos;t want your custom at all.</p>
<p> Saluting Ned Lambert and John Henry Menton he walked on at Martin
Cunningham&apos;s
side<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
puzzling two long keys at his back.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Did you hear that one, he asked them, about Mulcahy from the Coombe?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I did not, Martin Cunningham said.</p>
<p> They bent their silk hats in concert and Hynes
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">stretched</span></span>
<font color="black">inclined</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
his ear. The caretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and
spoke in a discreet tone to their vacant smiles.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; They tell the story, he said, that two drunks came out
here one foggy evening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs. They asked
for Mulcahy from the Coombe and were told where he was buried. After traipsing
about in the fog they found the grave sure enough. One of the drunks spelt out
the name: Terence Mulcahy. The other drunk was blinking up at a statue of
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Our</span></span>
<font color="black">our</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font> Saviour the widow had got put up.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 121}</font> </p>
<p> The caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed. He resumed:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And after blinking up at it. <i>Not a bloody bit like the
man</i>, says he. <i>That&apos;s not Mulcahy</i>, says he, <i>whoever done it</i>.</p>
<p> Rewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with Corny Kelleher, accepting the
dockets given him, turning them over and scanning them as he walked.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That&apos;s all done with a purpose, Martin Cunningham explained to Hynes.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I know, Hynes
said<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
I know that.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; To cheer a fellow up, Martin Cunningham said. It&apos;s pure goodheartedness: nothing else.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom admired the caretaker&apos;s prosperous bulk. Keys: like
Keyes&apos;s ad: no fear of anyone getting out. I must see about that ad after
the funeral. Be the better of a shave. Grey sprouting beard. That&apos;s the
first sign when the hairs come out grey. Fancy being his wife. Wonder

on living. Changing about. Live for ever practically.

<p> But they must breed a devil of a lot of maggots. Soil must be simply
swirling with them. Your head it simply swurls. Your head it simply swurls. He
looks cheerful enough over it. Gives him a sense of power seeing all the others
go under first. Wonder how he looks at life. Cracking his jokes too: warms

out the damp. Hard to imagine his funeral. Seems a sort of a joke.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; How many have you for tomorrow? the caretaker asked.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Two, Corny Kelleher said. Half ten and eleven.</p>
<p> The caretaker put the papers in his pocket. The barrow had ceased to
trundle. The mourners split and moved to each side of the hole, stepping with
care round the graves. The gravediggers bore the coffin and set its nose on the brink, looping the bands round it.</p>
<p> Burying him. We come to bury Caesar. He doesn&apos;t know who is here.</p>
<p> Now who is that lanky looking
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">fellow</span></span>
<font color="black">galoot</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
over there in the mackintosh? Now who is he I&apos;d like to know?
Now<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
I&apos;d give a trifle to know who he is. Always someone turns up you never
dreamt of. A fellow could live on his lonesome all his life. Yes, he could.
Still he&apos;d have to get someone to
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">bury</span></span>
<font color="black">sod</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>

<p> Poor Dignam! His last lie on the earth in his box. When you think of them
all it does seem a waste of wood. All gnawed through. They could invent a
handsome bier with a kind of panel sliding let it down that way. Ay but
<br><font color="green">{u22, 106}</font>
<br> they might object to be buried out of another fellow&apos;s. I see what it
means. I see. To protect him as long as possible even in the earth.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 124}</font> </p>
<p> Mr Bloom stood far back, his hat in his hand, counting the bared heads.
Twelve. I&apos;m thirteen. No. The chap in the mackintosh is thirteen. Where the
deuce did he pop out of? He wasn&apos;t in the chapel, that I&apos;ll swear. Silly superstition that about thirteen.</p>
<p> Nice soft tweed Ned Lambert has in that suit. Tinge of purple. I had one
like that when we lived in Lombard street west. Dressy fellow he was once. Used
to change three suits in the day. Hello. It&apos;s dyed. His wife. I forgot
he&apos;s not married or his landlady ought to have picked out those threads for him.</p>
<p> The coffin
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">slid</span></span>
<font color="black">dived</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
out of sight, easied down by the men straddled on the
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">graveprops</span></span>
<font color="black">grave
trestles</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>. They
struggled up and out: and all uncovered. Twenty.</p>
<p> Pause.</p>
<p> If we were all suddenly somebody else.</p>
<p> Gentle sweet air blew round the bared
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">head</span></span>
<font color="black">heads</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
in a whisper. Whisper. The
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">little</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
boy by the gravehead held his wreath with both hands
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">before
him,</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font> staring
quietly in the black open space. Mr Bloom moved behind the portly kindly
caretaker<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><font color="black">.</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
Wellcut frockcoat. Weighing them up perhaps to see which

<font color="black">will</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
go next.
Well<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
it is a long rest. Feel no more. It&apos;s the moment you feel. Must be damned
unpleasant. Can&apos;t believe it at first. Mistake must be: someone else. People talk about you a bit: forget you.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 125}</font>
<br> Then they follow: dropping into a
hole<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
one after the other.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 107}</font> </p>
<p> We are praying now
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><font color="black">for the
repose of his soul</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>.</p>
<p> Does he ever think of the hole waiting for himself? They say you do when you
shiver in the sun. Someone walking over it. Mine over there towards Finglas, the
plot I bought. Mamma, poor mamma, and little Rudy.</p>
<p> The gravediggers took up their spades and flung heavy clods of clay in on
the coffin. Mr Bloom turned
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">away</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
his face. And if he was alive all the
time<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">!</span></span><font color="black">?</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
Whew! By

<font color="black">Jingo</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>,
that would be awful! No, no: he is dead, of course. Of course he is dead. Monday
he died. Three days. Rather long to keep them in summer. Just as well to get
shut of them as soon as you are sure there&apos;s no.</p>
<p> The clay fell softer. Begin to be forgotten. Out of sight.</p>
<p> The caretaker moved away a few paces and put on his hat. The mourners took
heart of grace, one by one, covering themselves without show. Mr Bloom put on
his hat and saw the portly figure make its way deftly through the maze of
graves. Quietly, sure of his
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">land</span></span>
<font color="black">ground</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>,
he traversed the dismal fields.</p>
<p> Hynes jotting down something in his notebook. Ah, the names. But he knows them all. No: coming to me.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I am just taking the names, Hynes said below his breath.
What is your christian name? I&apos;m not sure.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; L, Mr Bloom said. Leopold. And you might put down M&apos;Coy&apos;s name too. He asked me to.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;

<font color="black">Charley</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>,
Hynes said writing. I know. He was on the <i>Freeman</i> once.</p>
<p> So he was. Got the run. Levanted with the cash of a few ads. That was why he
asked me to. O
well<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
does no harm. I saw to that, M&apos;Coy. Thanks, old
chap<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><font color="black">:</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
much obliged. Leave him under an obligation: costs nothing.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And tell us, Hynes said, do you know that fellow in the,
fellow was over there in
the<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span>
<font color="black">&nbsp;&hellip;</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font></p>
<p> He looked around.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Mackintosh. Yes I saw him, Mr Bloom said. Where is he now?
<br><font color="green">{u22, 108}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Mackintosh, Hynes
said<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
scribbling. I don&apos;t know who he is. Is that his name?</p>
<p> He moved away, looking about him.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; No, Mr Bloom
began<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
turning and stopping. I say,
Hynes<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span><font color="black">!</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font></p>
<p> Didn&apos;t hear. What? Where has he disappeared to? Not a sign. Well of all the. Good Lord, what became of him?</p>
<p> A seventh gravedigger came beside Mr Bloom to take up an idle spade.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O, excuse me.</p>
<p> He stepped aside nimbly.</p>
<p> Clay, brown, damp, began to be seen in the hole. It rose. Nearly over. A
mound of damp clods rose more, rose, and the gravediggers rested their spades.
All uncovered again for a few instants. The boy propped his wreath against a
corner: the brother-in-law his on a lump. The gravediggers put on their caps and
carried their earthy spades towards the barrow. Then knocked the blades lightly
on the turf: clean. One bent to pluck from the heft a long tuft of grass.
Silently at the gravehead another coiled the coffinband. The brother-in-law,
turning away, placed something in his free hand. Thanks in silence. Sorry, sir:
trouble. Headshake. I know that. For yourselves just.</p>
<p> The mourners moved away slowly without aim, by devious paths, staying
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">at
whiles</span></span>
<font color="black">awhile</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font> to read a name on a tomb.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Let us go round by the chief&apos;s grave, Hynes said. We have time.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 127}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Let us, Mr Power said.</p>
<p> They turned to the right, following their slow thoughts. With awe Mr Power&apos;s blank voice spoke:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Some say he is not in that grave at all. That the coffin
was filled with stones. That one day he will come again.</p>
<p> Hynes shook his head.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Parnell will never come again, he said.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom walked unheeded along his grove. Who passed away. Who departed this
life. As if they did it of their own accord. Got the
shove<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
all of them. Rusty wreaths hung on knobs, garlands of bronzefoil. Better value
that for the money.
Still<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
the flowers are more poetical. The other gets rather tiresome, never withering. Expresses nothing.</p>
<p> A bird sat tamely perched on a poplar branch. Like stuffed. Like the wedding
present alderman Hooper gave us.
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Hoo</span></span>
<font color="black">Hu</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>!
Not a

<font color="black">budge</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
out of him. Knows there are no catapults to let fly at him.</p>
<p> The Sacred Heart that is: showing it. Red it should be painted like a real
heart. Would birds come then and peck like the boy with the basket of fruit but
he said no because they ought to have been afraid of the boy. Apollo that was.</p>
<p> How many. All these here once walked round
Dublin<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><font color="black">.</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font></p>
<p> Besides how could you remember
everybody<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">;
eyes</span></span><font color="black">?
Eyes</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>, walk, voice.
Well, the voice, yes: gramophone. Have a gramophone in every grave or keep it in
the house. Remind you of the voice like the photograph reminds you of the face.
Otherwise you couldn&apos;t remember the face after fifteen years, say. For
instance who? For instance some fellow that died when I was in Wisdom Hely&apos;s.</p>
<p> Ssld! A rattle of pebbles. Wait.
Stop<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">!</span></span><font color="black">.</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font></p>
<p> He looked down intently into a stone crypt. Some animal. Wait. There he goes.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 110}</font> </p>
<p> An
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">unwieldy</span></span>
<font color="black">obese</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
grey rat toddled along the side of the crypt, moving the pebbles. An old stager:
grandfather: he knows the ropes. The grey alive crushed itself in under the plinth, wriggled itself in under it.</p>
<p> Who lives there? Are laid the remains of Robert Elliot. Robert Emmet was
buried here by
torchlight<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
wasn&apos;t he? Making his rounds.</p>
<p> Tail gone now.</p>
<p> One of those chaps would make short work of a fellow. Pick the bones clean
no matter who it was. Ordinary meat for them. A corpse is meat gone bad. I read
in that Voyages in China that the Chinese say a white man smells like a corpse.
Wonder does the news go about whenever a fresh one is let down. Wouldn&apos;t be
surprised. Regular square feed for them. Got wind of Dignam. They wouldn&apos;t
care about the smell of it. Saltwhite crumbling mush of corpse: smell, taste like raw white turnips.</p>
<p> The gates glimmered in front: still open. Back to the world again. Enough of
this place. A little goes a long way. Brings you a bit nearer every time. Last
time I was here was Mrs Sinico&apos;s funeral. Give you the creeps after a bit.
Plenty to see and hear and feel yet. Feel live warm beings near you. Let them
sleep in their maggoty beds. They are not going to get me this innings. Warm beds: warm fullblooded life.</p>
<p> Martin Cunningham emerged from a sidepath, talking gravely.</p>
<p> Solicitor, I think. I know his face. Menton. Dignam used to be in his
office. Mat Dillon&apos;s long ago. Got his rag out that evening on
<br><font color="green">{u22, 111}</font>
<br> the

<font color="black">bowlinggreen</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
because I sailed inside him. Pure fluke
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">it
was</span></span> <font color="black">of
mine</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>: the bias.
Molly and Floey Dillon linked under the lilactree, laughing. Fellow always like that if women are by.</p>
<p> Got a dinge in the side of his hat. Carriage probably.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Excuse me, sir, Mr Bloom said beside them.</p>
<p> They stopped.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 130}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Your hat is a little crushed, Mr Bloom
said<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
pointing.</p>
<p> John Henry Menton stared at him for an instant without moving.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There, Martin Cunningham helped, pointing also.</p>
<p> John Henry Menton took off his hat, bulged out the dinge and smoothed the
nap with care on his coatsleeve. He clapped the hat on his head again.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It&apos;s all right now, Martin Cunningham said.</p>
<p> John Henry Menton jerked his head down in acknowledgment.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Thank you, he said shortly.</p>
<p> They walked on towards the gates. Browbeaten Mr Bloom fell behind a few
paces so as not to overhear. Martin laying down the law. Martin could wind a
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">fellow</span></span>
<font color="black">fathead</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
like that round his little
finger<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
without his seeing it.</p>
<p> Oyster eyes. Never mind. Be sorry after perhaps when it dawns on him. Get the pull over him that way.</p>
<p> Thank you. How grand we are this morning!</p>  </main>
