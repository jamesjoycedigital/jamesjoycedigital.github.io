<p class="pStDir">The
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">mild</span></span> mysterious
evening had begun to wrap all nature in its soft mysterious glow. Faraway in the
west the sun was setting and the last light of
day<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">, veiled and</span></span>
shone softly upon
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the</span></span> sea and strand,
on the proud promontory
<a name="s13009bv" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009bv">old</a> Howth,
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the</span></span> guarding as ever
the waters of the bay, on the old weedgrown rocks and on the quiet church whence
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">music and</span></span> music of
worship streamed forth at times upon the stillness to her who is, in
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the</span></span> her pure
radiance, a beacon ever to the stormtossed heart, Mary,
<a name="s13001v" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13001v">star of the sea</a>.</p>
<p> The girl friends were seated on the rocks, enjoying the evening air which
was not too chilly. Cissy Caffrey and
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Bertha Supple</span></span> and
Edie Boardman and the baby and the
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">twins</span></span> Tommy and
Jacky Caffrey, two
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">noisy</span></span> little
curlyheaded boys, dressed in sailor suits
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">to match</span></span> with caps
to match and the name H. M. S. Belleisle on both. For Tommy and Jacky were
twins, scarce four years old, and very noisy and spoiled twins
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">too</span></span> sometimes but
for all that darling little fellows with bright merry faces and
<a name="s13009ce" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009ce">endearing
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">little</span></span> ways</a>
about them. They were playing with their spades and buckets on the sand,
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">buildings</span></span> building
castles as little children do, or playing with the big coloured
ball<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span>, as happy as
the day was long. And Edie Boardman was rocking the
<a name="s13009aa" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009aa">chubby</a> baby boy
to and fro in the
pushcar<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span> while
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">he</span></span> the young
gentleman crowed with delight. He was but fourteen months
<br><font color="green">{ms, 2}</font>
<br> old and, though still a toddler, was just beginning to lisp
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">what</span></span> his first
babyish words. Cissy Caffrey bent over to him to tease his fat little plucks and
the sweet little dimple in his chin.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Now, baby, Cissy said. Say out big, I want a drink a water.</p>
<p> And baby prattled:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <a name="s13020l" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020l">A jink a jink a jawbo.</a></p>
<p> Cissy <a name="s13010r" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010r">hugged the
little man</a> for she was awfully fond of children A downright goodhearted girl
was Cissy, always with a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on
her ripe red lips. Edie Boardman laughed too
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">for baby</span></span> at
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">quaint</span></span> the quaint baby language.</p>
<p> But just then there was a little trouble between Master Tommy and Master
Jacky. <a name="s13009be" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009be">Boys will be
boys</a> and the two twins were no exception to the rule. The bone of contention
was a certain castle of sand which Jacky had built up and Master Tommy would
have it that it was to be
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">improved</span></span> improved
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">according</span></span> by a
frontdoor like
<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font>.
But if Tommy was headstrong Jacky was selfwilled too and, true to the maxim that
every little
<a name="un4054ad" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4054ad">Irishman&apos;s
house is his castle</a>, he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose that
the wouldbe assailant came to grief and (alas!) the coveted castle too
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">and</span></span>. Needless to
say, the cries of discomfited Master Tommy drew the attention of the girl
friends <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">to the</span></span></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Come here, Tommy, his sister called imperatively. At
once! And you, Jacky, <a name="s13009ad" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009ad">for shame!</a> to throw Tommy in the
<br><font color="green">{ms, 3}</font>
<br> dirty sand. Wait till I catch you for that.</p>
<p> Master Tommy came
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">with</span></span> his
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">big</span></span> eyes big with
unshed tears at her call for their big sister&apos;s word was law with the
twins. And in a sad plight he was too after his tumble. His little
unmentionables were full of sand but Cissy was
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">a</span></span> past mistress in
the art of <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">keeping</span></span>
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">restoring</span></span> smoothing
out life&apos;s tiny troubles and very quickly
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the wet eyes were dry
again</span></span> and not one speck of sand was to be seen on his smart little
suit. Still the blue eyes were bright with tears that would well up so Edie
Boardman shook <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">at</span></span> her hand at Master Jacky, far off.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Bold dirty Jacky, she said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;
<a name="jn0070a" href="../../ff/unbs/jn0all.htm#jn0070a">Tell us who is your
sweetheart Edie Boardman queried. Is Cissy your sweetheart?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Nao, Tommy said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is Edie Boardman your sweetheart? Cissy
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">said</span></span> asked.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Nao, Tommy said</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I know, Edie Boardman said. I know who is Tommy&apos;s
sweetheart. Is Gertie your sweetheart, Tommy?</a></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Nao, Tommy said</p>
<p> <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">He was</span></span></p>
<p> Cissy&apos;s quick with guessed
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">that</span></span> what was
amiss<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span> and she
whispered to Edie Boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman couldn&apos;t see.</p>
<p> But who was Gertie?</p>
<p> Gertie MacDowell who was seated near her companions was
<a name="s13013cc" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013cc">as fair a specimen
of</a> <a name="s13003g" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13003g">winsome</a>
<a name="s13013cc" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013cc">Irish girlhood</a>
as one could wish to see.
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">and</span></span>, as folks often
said, <a name="s13009am" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009am">more a Giltrap
than a MacDowell</a>. Her figure was slight and graceful, inclining even to
fragility, but since she had been taking those jelloids had done a world of
good. Her hands were delicately veined and with
<a name="un4018ad" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4018ad">tapering fingers</a>
and as white as lemonjuice and queen of ointments could make them though it was
not true<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">, what Edie Boardman said
about them once to Cissy Caffrey,</span></span> that she used to
<a name="un5003t" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5003t">wear kid gloves in
bed</a>. Edie Boardman said that to Cissy Caffrey once when she was black out
with Gertie
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">MacDowell</span></span> and
<a name="s13004ap" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13004ap">told her not to tell
who told her</a>. No, there was an
<a name="s13011g" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13011g">innate refinement</a>
about Gertie which was unmistakably evidenced in her
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">shapel</span></span> delicate
hands and high shapely instep. Had fate willed her to be born of high degree and
had she only received
<a name="s13013ce" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013ce">the benefit of a
good education</a> Gertie MacDowell might have held her own
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">again</span></span> beside any
lady of the land<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span>
and have seen
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext"><a name="s13013p" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013p">suitors</a>,
the noblest</span></span> aristocratic
<a name="s13013p" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013p">suitors</a> vying with
one another <a name="s13010q" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010q">to pay
their devoirs</a> to her. Mayhap it was this that gave to her softly featured
face at times that tense
<a name="s13010aj" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010aj">look</a> of
<a name="s13010ai" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010ai">suppressed
meaning</a>, and that imparted a strange yearning expression to the lovely eyes.
<a name="s13013n" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013n">Why have women such
eyes of witchery?</a> Gertie&apos;s were of the deepest Irish blue
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">fringed with</span></span> set off
by <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">long</span></span>
<a name="s13020ae" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020ae">lustrous</a> lashes
and dark expressive brows. It was Madame Vera Verity of the <u>Girl&apos;s
Companion</u> who had advised her to try eyebrowleine and she had never
regretted it. But Gertie&apos;s crowning glory was her
<a name="s13009cq" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009cq">wealth of hair</a>.
It was dark brown with a natural wave in it.
<a name="s13014h" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13014h">She had cut it just
that very morning on account of the new moon</a> and now, it
<a name="s13001q" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13001q">nestled</a> about her
pretty head in <a name="s13009cp" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009cp">a
profusion of luxuriant
clusters</a><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">;</span></span>. And
just now at Edie&apos;s words as
<a name="s13013s" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013s">a
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">swift</span></span> telltale flush,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 5}</font>
<br> delicate as the faintest
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">roseboo</span></span>
rosebloom</a>, crept in to her cheeks she looked so lovely in her
<a name="s13009as" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009as">sweet girlish
shyness</a> that of a surety
<a name="s13013t" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013t">God&apos;s fair land
of Ireland did not hold her equal</a>.</p>
<p> For an instant she was silent with
<a name="s13009bf" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009bf">rather sad</a>
<a name="s13010ad" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010ad">downcast eyes</a>
but then she looked up with
<a name="s13012f" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13012f">a faint smile</a> and
<a name="s13005t" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13005t">broke</a> into
<a name="s13009bl" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009bl">a joyous little
laugh which had in it all the freshness of a May morning</a>.
<a name="s13010t" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010t">She knew</a>,
<a name="s13010t" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010t">no-one better</a>,
what made Cissy Caffrey say that
<a name="s13014o" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13014o">Somebody&apos;s nose
was out of joint</a> on account of the boy that had the bicycle in Herbert
Avenue riding up and down in front of the window. Only today he had gone to see
his brother racing in the bicycle race in Trinity university. W.E. Wylie was his
brother and he was going to go to Trinity to study in the university They were
protestants in his family and of course Gerty knew
<a name="s13009ap" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009ap">who came first and
after Him the Blessed Virgin &amp; then Saint Joseph</a> but he was
<a name="s13020h" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020h">undeniably
handsome</a> and he looked what he was, every inch a gentleman,
<a name="s13018o" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13018o">the shape of his head
too at the back with his cap off</a> and the way he turned the bicycle at the
<a name="s13010aa" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010aa">lamp</a>
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext"><font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">unread</span></font></span></span>
with his hands off the bars and that was why Cissy Caffrey thought she was so
very clever because he didn&apos;t go and ride up and down in front of her window.</p>
<p> Gerty was dressed simply but with instinctive taste for she felt that there
was just a might that he might be out. A tasteful blouse of electric blue with a
smart vee cut and kerchief pocket &amp; set off admirably her slim figure. She
wore a coquettish wide hat of
<a name="s13009a" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009a">nigger</a> straw with
an <a name="s13009f" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009f">underbrim</a> of
<a name="s13009a" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009a">eggblue</a>
<a name="s13009f" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009f">chenille</a> and at
the side <a name="s13009g" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009g">butterfly
bow</a> <a name="s13009a" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009a">to tone</a>.
All Monday afternoon she was shopping
<a name="s13020bi" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020bi">to match that chenille</a> and at last she
<br><font color="green">{ms, 6}</font>
<br> found what she wanted at Clery&apos;s Summer bargains, the very it, eight
and a half fingers one and a penny. Her shoes were the smartest of footwear
(Edie Boardman prided herself that she was petite but she never had a foot like
Gerty MacDowell and never would have), with patent toecaps
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">and French heels</span></span> and
just one smart buckle.
<a name="s13009al" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009al">Her wellturned ankle
showed its proportions</a> be
<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">unread</span></font>
her skirt and just the proper amount and no more of her
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">shin</span></span> shapely leg
encased in finespun
<a name="un4019as" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4019as">hose</a> with
<a name="s13009l" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009l">high spliced heels</a>
and <a name="s13009k" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009k">garter tops</a>.
As for <a name="s13009c" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009c">undies</a> they
were Gerty&apos;s special care and who that knows the fluttering hopes &amp;
fears of sweet seventeen can find aught amiss in that? She had five lovely sets,
three articles and nighty extra, each set
<a name="s13009d" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009d">slotted with different
coloured ribbons, rosepink,</a> pale blue, cream, pale mauve and peagreen.
<a name="s13020u" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020u">She was wearing the
blue</a> <a name="s13020u" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020u">for luck</a>
because <a name="un6020ct" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6020ct">it was
Tuesday when she wore the green for grief that</a> his father brought him in to
study and she thought perhaps he might be out too because that morning when she
was dressing in a hurry
<a name="s13020ai" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020ai">she nearly
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">put on</span></span> slipped up
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">those others inside

<p> And yet &mdash; and yet. A gnawing sorrow is there all the time.
<a name="s13010l" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010l">The paly light of the
gloaming falls on a face</a> infinitely sad &amp; wistful. Gerty MacDowell
yearns in vain. <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">In vain she
waits</span></span> No prince charming is her beau ideal but rather an earnest
manly man one who would take her in his arms and
<a name="s13009ak" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009ak">comfort her with a
hearty kiss</a>, a man, every inch of him For him she yearns this lovely summer
evening. And in her heart she longs to be
<a name="s13009br" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009br">his, his only,</a>
his affianced bride for riches for poor, in business, in health, till death us
two part from this to this day forward.</p>
<p> And while Edie Boardman was with little Tommy behind the pushcar she was
just thinking if the day would ever come when she would call herself his
<a name="s13013be" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013be">little wife to
be</a>. Then they could talk. She would care for him with
<a name="s13021h" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13021h">creature comforts</a>
too for Gerty knew that a man liked that feeling of
<a name="s13020b" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020b">homeyness</a>. Her
teacakes and <a name="s13013al" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013al">queen
of pudding</a> had <a name="s13020n" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020n">won
golden opinions</a> from all because she had a lucky hand they said also for
lighting a fire,
<a name="s13004r" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13004r">always stir in the
same direction</a> then

the chairs and that <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">lovely</span></span> toastrack that was
<br><font color="green">{ms, 8}</font>
<br> in Clery&apos;s summer sale like they have in rich houses and every morning
they would both have brekky for their two selves and before he went to business
he would give her just one good
<a name="s13010r" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010r">hug</a> and gaze for a moment into her eyes.</p>
<p> Edie Boardman asked Tommy was he done and then she
<a name="un4019cx" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4019cx">buttoned up his
little pants</a> and told him to run off now and play with Jacky and to be good
and not to fight. But Tommy said he wanted the ball and Edie said no that baby
Boardman was playing with it and if he took it there&apos;d be murder but Tommy
said it was his ball and he wanted his ball. And he stamped his little foot too
in temper. Edie told him
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">not</span></span> no no and to run
off with him now and she told Cissy Caffrey not to give in to him. But Cissy
told Baby Boardman to
<a name="s13017f" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13017f">look up</a> high at
her fingers and snatched the ball quickly and threw along the sand and Tommy ran after it.</p>

Boardman said she was sure the gentleman opposite heard what she said. But not a pin cared Cissy.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O my! she said. Give it to him too, quick as I&apos;d look at him.</p>
<p> Madcap Ciss! You had to laugh at her sometimes. But she was sincerity
itself, not one of your doublefaced things, too sweet to be wholesome.</p>
<p> And then there
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">float</span></span> came out upon
the air the sound of voices from the old ivyclad church and Gerty&apos;s heart
was touched. It was the men&apos;s mission conducted by the missioner, the
reverend father John Hughes S.J, rosary, sermon and benediction of the most
blessed sacrament. They were there gathered together, without distinction of
social class, in that simple church beside the
sea<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span>, after the
storms of this weary world kneeling humbly at the
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">immaculate</span></span> feet of
the immaculate, praying to her to intercede for them, refuge of sinners,
comfortress of the afflicted, virgin most prudent. How sad to Gerty&apos;s ears!
Had her father only avoided the clutches of
<a name="s13022av" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022av"><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the</span></span>
demon <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">of</span></span> drink</a> she might now be rolling in her carriage,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 10}</font>
<br> second to none. She would not be living with the Hughes&apos;s. But that
vile decoction which has ruined so many hearths and homes had cast its shadow
over her girlhood days. Nay, she had even witnessed in her home circle deeds of
violence caused by intemperance and had seen her own father, a prey to the devil
of whisky, <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">behave like the lowest
of the low</span></span> forget himself completely for he who lifts his hand to
a woman <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">ex</span></span> save in
the way in kindness, deserved to be branded as the lowest of the low.</p>
<p> And still the voices sang in supplication to the virgin most powerful,
virgin most merciful. And Gerty, rapt in thought, scarcely saw or heard her
companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or Mr Henderson passing along
the strand<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span>, taking
a short walk. But still
<a name="s13017au" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13017au">she would not like
him for a father</a> on account of his face. Poor father! With all his faults
she loved him still when he sang <u>The Song that reached my heart</u> and they
had stewed cockles for supper. and
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">then</span></span> when he sang
the duet <u>The Moon hath raised</u>
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext"><u>her lamp
above</u></span></span> with Mr. Dignam that
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">was buried</span></span> died
suddenly and was buried from a stroke and mother said to let that be a warning
to him. And he couldn&apos;t even go to the funeral on account of the gout and she had to go into town to bring
<br><font color="green">{ms, 11}</font>
<br> him his letters from his office about Catesby&apos;s cork lino
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">makes the home bright and
cheery</span></span>, artistic designs, gives splendid wear and always bright and cheery.</p>
<p> A sterling good daughter was Gerty. It was she who
<a name="s13009ac" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009ac">turned off the gas
every night at the main</a> and it was she hung up with tacks in
<a name="s13009t" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009t">a certain</a>
<a name="s13009t" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009t">place</a> the picture
of Halcyon Days where a gentleman in the dress they used to wear then was
offering a bunch of flowers to his
<a name="s13010u" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010u">ladylove</a>. The
colours were done lovely and the gentleman in chocolate with a threecornered hat
and he looked <a name="s13010k" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010k">a
thorough aristocrat</a>. She often looked at them dreamily when she went there
and thought about those times because she had
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">rea</span></span> found in
Walker&apos;s Pronouncing dictionary about the halcyon days.</p>
<p> <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Tomm</span></span> The twins
were playing in right brotherly fashion till at last master Jacky, who was
really <a name="s13018j" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13018j">as bold as
brass</a>, there was no getting behind that, deliberately kicked the ball as
hard as ever he could and it went flying through the air. Needless to say poor
Tommy was not slow to expres his dismay but luckily the ball was intercepted by
the gentleman who was sitting there by himself.
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Tos</span></span> Our two
champions claimed their plaything with lusty cries and, to avoid trouble, Cissy
Caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it to her, please. The gentleman rolled
the ball along the sand towards Cissy Caffrey but it rolled down the slope and
stopped right under Gerty&apos;s skirt. The
<br><font color="green">{ms, 12}</font>
<br> twins clamoured again for it and Cissy told her to kick it away and let
them fight for it<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span>
so drew back her foot but she wished it hadn&apos;t come to her and gave a kick
but she missed <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">and
then,</span></span> and Edie and Cissy laughed so then Gerty was determined to
show them so she lifted her skirt a little, and gave the ball a
<a name="s13022af" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022af">jolly good</a> kick
and it went ever so far and the two twins after it, down towards the shingle.
All jealousy of course it was, nothing else, and Gerty felt the warm flush
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext"><a name="s13020p" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020p">surging
into her cheeks</a></span></span>, a
<a name="s13020al" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020al">danger signal</a>
with Gerty MacDowell,
<a name="s13020p" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020p">surging</a>
<a name="s13020p" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020p">into her face</a>.
Till then they had
<a name="s13022l" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022l">exchanged only casual
glances</a> but now under the brim of her hat she
<a name="s13020r" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020r">stole a look at
him</a> and <a name="s13009bp" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009bp">the
face</a> she saw then, pale and
<a name="s13009bp" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009bp">strangely drawn</a>
seemed to her <a name="s13020e" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020e">the saddest she had ever seen</a>.</p>
<p> Through the open windows of the church the fragrant incense
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">floated</span></span> was wafted
and with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain of
original sin. Spiritual vessel, honourable vessel, pray for us. Mystical rose.
and careworn hearts were there, and toilers for their
<a name="s13010f" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010f">daily bread</a>, and
many who had erred and wandered, their eyes
<a name="s13010d" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010d">wet with
contrition</a> but bright with hope for the reverend father Hughes had told them
what the great saint Bernard had said of the
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">in</span></span> Mary&apos;s
intercessory power that it was
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">never</span></span> not recorded
in any age that they who implored her powerful protection were ever abandoned by her.</p>
<p> The twins were now playing again quite merrily
<br><font color="green">{ms, 13}</font>
<br> for the troubles of childhood are but as passing summer clouds. Cissy
Caffrey played with Baby Boardman till he crowed with glee
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">asking him</span></span> behind
the hood of the pushcar and Edie asking where was Cissy gone and then Cissy
popped up her head and said ah. And then she bade him say papa.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Say papa, baby. Say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa.</p>
<p> And baby did his level best to say it:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Ch</span></span> Ja ja ja ja.</p>
<p> Cissy wiped his little mouth with the
<a name="s13020aj" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020aj">dribbling bib</a>
and wanted him to sit up and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried
out to Edie<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O mercy on me</span></span>, holy saint Denis, that he
was <a name="s13004q" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13004q">possing wet</a>
and to double the half blanket the other way. Of course his majesty was most
obstreperous at such toilet formalities but Cissy, always readywitted, gave him
the <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">bone</span></span> teat and
the young heathen was quickly appeased.</p>
<p> Gerty wished to goodness they would take their little brat home out of that
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">in the</span></span>, no hour to
be out, and the little brats of twins. She gazed out towards the distant sea. It
was like a picture: the evening and the clouds coming out and the Bailey light
and to hear the music like that and the perfume they used in the church. And
while she gazed her
<a name="s13001bs" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13001bs">heart</a> of the
girl-woman <a name="s13001bs" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13001bs">went
pitapat</a>. Yes, it was her he was looking at.
<a name="s13017b" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13017b">His eyes burned into
her as though they would</a> search
<a name="un4018l" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4018l">her very soul</a>.
<a name="s13020i" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020i">Wonderful eyes</a>
they were <a name="s13020i" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020i">but could you
<br><font color="green">{ms, 14}</font>
<br> trust him.</a>
<a name="s13013ci" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013ci">She could see at
once that he was a foreigner</a> by his dark eyes but she could not see if he
had an <a name="s13013ci" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013ci">aquiline
nose</a> from where he was sitting.
<a name="s13013ae" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013ae">He was in deep
mourning, she could see that, and the story of a strange past was written on his
face.</a> She would have given worlds to know what it was. He was looking so
intensely so still and he saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the
bright steel buckles of her shoes if she waggled them like
that<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span> thoughtfully.
She was glad she had put on the transparent stockings thinking Reggy Wylie might
be out but that was far away. Here was that of which she had so oft dreamed.
<a name="s13022at" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022at">The heart of the
girl-woman went out to him.</a> If he had suffered, or had been sinned against
than sinning, or more, more if he had been himself a sinner, a wicked man she
cared not. There were
<a name="s13020bt" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020bt">wounds that wanted
healing</a>. Those dark eyes had suffered and, O, she longed to know all and to
forgive all if only he would come to her for himself,
<a name="s13020br" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020br">crushing her soft
body</a> to him and
<a name="s13022ak" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022ak">love her for
herself</a> <font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">unread</span></font>.</p>
<p> Refuge of sinners and comfortress of the afflicted: <u>Ora pro nobis.</u>
Well has it been said that whoever prays to her with faith and constancy can
never be lost or cast away: and fitly is she too a haven of refuge for the
afflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her own heart. Gerty
could picture the whole scene in the church, the stained
<br><font color="green">{ms, 15}</font>
<br> glass windows lighted up, the candles and flowers and the incense and the
banners of the blessed virgin&apos;s sodality and probably father Conroy was
helping the canon at the altar, carrying things in and out with his eye cast
down. He looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet and dark and
clean<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span> and his hands
were just like white wax. He told her that time when she told him about that not
to be troubled because that
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">came</span></span> was only the
voice of nature and we were all subject to nature&apos;s law, he said, in this
life and that that was no sin because that came from the nature of woman
instituted by God, he said, and that our Blessed Lady herself said to the angel
Gabriel be it done unto me according to
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">thy</span></span> Thy word. He was
so kind and holy and often and often she thought could she work a teacosy for
him as a present because it was hard to know what kind of a present to
give<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span> or perhaps an album of views of some place.</p>
<p> The little brats of twins began to quarrel again and Jacky threw the ball
out towards the sea and they both ran after it.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Jacky! Tommy! cried Cissy and Edie. Come back.</p>
<p> Because they were afraid the tide might come in on them, and be drowned.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Jacky!</p>
<p> Not they, what a notion they had! So Cissy said it was the last time
she&apos;d ever bring them out. She jumped up and called them and then she ran
down the slope past him, tossing behind her her raven hair which had a good enough colour
<br><font color="green">{ms, 16}</font>
<br> if there had been more of it but with all the thingamerry she put
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">it</span></span> into it she
couldn&apos;t get it to grow long because it wasn&apos;t natural. She ran with
long strides it was a wonder she didn&apos;t rip up her skirt that was too tight
on her <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">as</span></span> because
there was a lot of the tomboy in her whenever she a chance to show off and just
because she was a good runner she ran like that so that he could see all the end
of her petticoat running up as far as possible. It would have served her right
if she tripped herself over something with her high heels on her boots. That
would have been a nice exhibition for the gentleman to see.</p>
<p> Queen of angels, of patriarchs, of prophets, of all saints, they prayed,
queen of the most holy rosary, and then father Conroy handed the thurible to
Canon O&apos;Hanlon and he put in the incense and
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">in</span></span> censed the
blessed sacrament and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and she was itching to
give them a good clip on the ear but she didn&apos;t because she thought he was
looking after her but she never made a bigger mistake in her life because Gerty
could see without looking that he never took his eyes off her and then Canon
O&apos;Hanlon handed the thurible back to Father Conroy and the choir began to
sing the <u>Tantum Ergo</u> and she just swung
<br><font color="green">{ms, 17}</font>
<br> her foot in and out in time Five and nine she paid for those stockings in
George&apos;s street at easter and there wasn&apos;t a brack on them and that
was what he was looking at and not at hers that had neither shape nor form
because he had better taste and could see the difference for himself.</p>
<p> Cissy came <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">back</span></span>
along the strand with the two twins and their ball with her hat on one side
after her run and she did look a streel. Gerty just took off her hat for a
moment to settle it and a prettier, a daintier head was never seen on a
girl&apos;s shoulders. You would have to travel many a long mile before you
found a head of hair like that. She could almost see the answering flash of
admiration in his eyes. She put on her hat so that she could see from underneath
and swung her buckled shoe faster for
<a name="s13020bn" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020bn">her breath
caught</a> as she read the expression of his eyes. He was watching her
<a name="s13022ap" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022ap">as a snake watches
its prey</a>. Her woman&apos;s instinct told her
<a name="s13009bs" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009bs">she had roused the
devil in him</a> and at the thought
<a name="s13020bl" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020bl">a burning scarlet
swept from throat to brow</a> till the lovely
<a name="s13023an" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13023an">colour of her face became a glorious rose</a>.</p>
<p> Edie Boardman was
<br><font color="green">{ms, 18}</font>
<br> noticing it too because she
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">said to Gerty</span></span> was
looking at Gerty through her spectacles, pretending to hushaby baby. Irritable
little gnat she was poking her nose into what was no concern of hers. And she said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <a name="s13013bu" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013bu">A penny for your thoughts.</a></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What? laughed Gerty. I was only wondering is it late.</p>
<p> Because she wished they&apos;d take the twins and the baby home to the
mischief out of that so that was why she just gave a hint about the time. And
when Cissy came up Edie asked her the time.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;
<a name="s13009o" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009o">Half past kissing
time</a>, Cissy said. Time to kiss again.</p>
<p> But Edie wanted to know because they were told to be in early.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Wait, Cissy said, I&apos;ll ask
<a name="s13004ak" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13004ak">uncle</a> over
there<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span> what&apos;s the time by his conundrum.</p>
<p> So over she went to the gentleman and said to excuse her would he mind
telling her the right time. And Gerty could see him taking his hand out of his
pocket and taking out his watch and looking at it and he said it was stopped and
Cissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said his works were out of order.</p>
<p> Then they sang the second verse of the <u>Tantum ergo</u> and Canon
O&apos;Hanlon got up again and censed the blessed sacrament and knelt down and he told Father Conroy that one of
<br><font color="green">{ms, 19}</font>
<br> the candles was too near the flowers and father Conroy got up and settled
it and she could see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to it and she
swung her leg more because it was getting dark but he could see and he was
looking all the time he was winding the watch and he put it back then and his
dark eyes were fixed on her, drinking in
<a name="s13005k" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13005k">her every</a>
<a name="s13005m" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13005m">line</a>. If ever
there was undisguised admiration in a man&apos;s passionate gaze it was there
plain to be seen on his face.
<a name="s13022r" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022r">And it is for you,
Gerty MacDowell</a>, <a name="s13025m" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13025m">and you know it</a>.</p>
<p> Edie began to get ready to go because it was a long way along the strand to
where there was the place to push up the pushcar and Cissy took off the
twins&apos; caps and combed their hair to make herself attractive and Canon
O&apos;Hanlon stood up and Father Conroy handed him the card to read off and he
read out <u>Panem de coelo praestitisti eis</u> and Edie and Cissy were talking
about the time all the time but Gerty could treat them back in their own coin
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">in her own quiet way</span></span>
and she just answered with
<a name="s13022h" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022h">scathing
politeness</a> when Edie asked her was she
<a name="s13022ai" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022ai">heartbroken</a>
about her best boy. A
<a name="s13022u" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022u">brief cold blaze shone
from her eyes</a> and spoke of
<a name="s13025g" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13025g">scorn
immeasurable</a>. <a name="s13005u" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13005u">It

<br><font color="green">{ms, 20}</font>
<br> because Edie had a way of saying things she knew would wound. Gerty&apos;s
<a name="s13005ai" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13005ai">lips parted
swiftly</a> but she repressed
<a name="s13021t" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13021t">the sob</a> that
<a name="s13005q" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13005q">rose to her

had loved him better than he knew</a> and for an instant there was

<a name="s13025a" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13025a">probing her
mercilessly</a> but with a brave effort she sparkled back in sympathy as she
glanced at her new conquest for them to see.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;

<a name="s13023ag" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13023ag">towering rage</a>
because that <a name="s13022aa" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022aa">shaft

and saw so they could put that in their pipe and smoke it.</p>
<p> Edie straightened up Baby Boardman to get ready to go and Cissy put in the
ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time because the
<a name="s13002d" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13002d">sandman</a> was coming
for baby. And Cissy told him too that

<p> Gerty stifled a

simply passed it off by saying that was the benediction for just then the

from the steeple over the quiet shore because canon O&apos;Hanlon was on the

<p> How beautiful the scene the last glimpse of Erin, the sweet sound of the
evening bells and she could see far away the lights of lighthouses and soon the
lamplighter would be going his rounds like she read in that book by Mrs Gaskell

had <a name="un5005aq" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5005aq">her dreams</a>
that no-one knew of. She loved to read poetry and she had
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">written</span></span> laid in the
drawer where she kept her girlish
<a name="un4019q" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4019q">treasures</a>, the
tortoiseshell comb and the scent and the ribbons to change when her things came
from the wash, and there were some beautiful thoughts written in it in violet
ink that she bought for she felt that she too could write poetry if she could
only express herself like that
<a name="s13004ag" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13004ag">poetry she had
copied out</a> of a paper she found round the

beauty of poetry, so sad <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">too</span></span> in its loveliness,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 22}</font>
<br> had moved her to silent tears for she felt that
<a name="s13005o" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13005o">the years were
slipping by</a> for her, one by one, and but for that one
<a name="s13024f" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13024f">shortcoming</a> she
knew she need fear no comparisons and that was an accident and she always tried
to conceal it. But it must end, she felt.

<p> Canon O&apos;Hanlon put the blessed sacrament back into the tabernacle and
genuflected and the choir sang <u>Laudate Dominum omnes gentes</u> and then he
locked the tabernacle door and Edie asked was she coming but Jacky Caffrey called out:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, look<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">, look</span></span>! Cissy!</p>
<p> And they all looked
<a name="s13018s" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13018s">was it lightning</a>
but Tommy saw it too over the trees beside the church, blue and then green and purple.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It&apos;s
<a name="s13009bd" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009bd">fireworks</a>, Cissy Caffrey said.</p>
<p> And they all ran down the strand to see, Edie with the pushcar with baby
Boardman in it and Cissy holding Tommy &amp; Jacky by the hand so they wouldn&apos;t fall running.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Come on, Gerty, Cissy called. It&apos;s the bazaar
<a name="s13009bd" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009bd">fireworks</a>.</p>
<p> She had no intention now of being
<a name="s13022bh" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022bh">at their beck and
call</a> so she said she could see from where she was. The eyes were fastened
upon her set her
<a name="s13023ao" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13023ao">pulses tingling</a>.
She looked at him a moment,
<a name="s13025r" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13025r">meeting his
glance</a>, and <a name="s13023af" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13023af">a
light broke in upon her</a>.
<a name="s13014am" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13014am">Whitehot passion</a>
was in that face, passion
<a name="s13022ag" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022ag">silent as the

left alone <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">and</span></span>
without the others</a> to pry and pass remarks and she knew he could be trusted
to the death, <a name="s13010am" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010am">a man
of honour to his fingertips</a>. She leaned back far to see up where the
<a name="s13009bd" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009bd">fireworks</a> were
and she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall back, looking up, and there was no-one to see only
<br><font color="green">{ms, 23}</font>
<br> him when she
<a name="s13022bp" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022bp">revealed like that
graceful beautifully shaped legs</a>,
<a name="s13022bq" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022bq">supply soft and
delicately rounded</a> and she seemed to hear the panting of his heart because
she knew too because Bertha Supple told her about the lodger that was staying in
their house out of the who had
<a name="s13004be" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13004be">pictures of skirt
dancers</a> and she said he used to do something not very nice sometimes in the
bed. But this was different there was all the difference because she could
almost feel him <a name="s13024l" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13024l">draw
her face to his</a> and the first
<a name="s13024j" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13024j">quick hot touch of his
handsome lips</a>. Besides there was absolution so long as you didn&apos;t do
the other thing and there ought to be women priests that
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">you could tell that thing
to</span></span> would understand without telling and Cissy Caffrey too
sometimes had that
<a name="s13022e" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022e">dreamy</a> kind of
soft look in her eyes and besides it was on account of that other thing coming on the way it did.</p>
<p> And they all shouted,</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Look! Look! Look! there was another, and she leaned back
and the garters were blue to match and on account of the contrast with the
transparent and then they all saw it and they all shouted to look, look,
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">look,</span></span> there it was,
and she leaned back ever so far to see the
<a name="s13009bd" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009bd">fireworks</a> and it
was a long Roman candle that went up and up, up,
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">up and up higher</span></span> and
they were all breathless with excitement and it went so high and she had to lean
back more and more to
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">see</span></span> look up and her
face was suffused with
<a name="s13020s" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020s">a divine, an
entrancing blush</a> from straining back and he could see the others too on
account of being white and she let him
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">see</span></span> and
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">she</span></span> saw that he saw
and then it went so high it went out of sight a moment and
<br><font color="green">{ms, 24}</font>
<br> she was trembling in every limb from being so far back that he could see
far up above her knee and he wasn&apos;t ashamed to look and then
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">O,</span></span> suddenly it burst
and it was like a sigh of O and everybody cried O, and it let fall a stream of
golden rain in threads and the threads burst and,
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">O</span></span> Ah, they were all
greeny stardrops falling with golden rain, O so lovely, O soft, sweet, soft.</p>
<p> Then all melted away dewily in the grey air: all was silent. She glanced at
him as she bent forward, a glance of shy reproach, and he was leaning back
against the rock behind.
