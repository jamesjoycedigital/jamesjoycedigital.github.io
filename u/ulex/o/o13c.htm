<p class="pStDir">The summer evening had begun to fold the world in its
mysterious embrace. Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow
of all too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand, on the proud
promontory of dear old Howth, guarding as ever the waters of the bay, on the
weedgrown rocks by Sandymount shore and, last but not least, on the quiet church
whence there streamed forth at times upon the stillness the voice of prayer to
her who is in her pure radiance a beacon ever to the stormtossed heart of man, Mary, star of the sea.</p>
<p> The three girl friends were seated on the rocks enjoying the evening scene
which was fresh and not too chilly. Many a time and oft were they wont to come
there to that favourite nook to have a cosy chat and discuss matters feminine,
Cissy Caffrey and Edy Boardman with the baby in the pushcar and Tommy and Jacky
Caffrey, two little curlyheaded boys, dressed in sailor suits with caps to match
and the name <u>H. M. S. Belleisle</u> printed on both. For Tommy and
<br><font color="green">{ms, 2}</font>
<br> Jacky Caffrey were twins, scarce four years old and very noisy and spoiled
twins at times but for all that darling little fellows with bright merry faces
and endearing ways about them. They were dabbling in the sand with their spades
and buckets, building castles as children do, or playing with their big coloured
ball as happy as the day was long. And Edy Boardman was rocking the chubby baby
to and fro in the pushcar while that young gentleman fairly chuckled with
delight. He was but eleven months and nine days old and, though still a tiny
toddler, was just beginning to lisp his first babyish words. Cissy Caffrey bent
over to him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty dimple in his chin</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Now, baby, Cissy Caffrey said. Say out big, big. <u>I want a drink of water.</u></p>
<p> And baby prattled after her:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>A jink a jink a jawbo.</u></p>
<p> Cissy Caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of children, so
patient with little sufferers and Tommy Caffrey could never be got to take his
castor oil unless it was Cissy Caffrey that held his nose. But to be sure baby
Boardman was as good as gold, a perfect little dote in his new fancy bib. No
spoilt beauty was Cissy Caffrey. A truerhearted girl never drew the breath of
life, always with a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her cherryripe red lips, a girl
<br><font color="green">{ms, 3}</font>
<br> <a name="s13020as" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020as">lovable in the
extreme</a>. And Edy Boardman laughed too at the quaint language of little brother.</p>
<p> But just then there was a slight altercation between master Tommy and Master
Jacky. Boys will be boys and the two twins were no exception to the rule. The
apple of discord was a certain castle of sand which Master Jacky had built and
Master Tommy would have it right go wrong that it was to be architecturally
improved by a frontdoor like the Martello tower had. But if Master Tommy was
headstrong Master Jacky was selfwilled too and, true to the maxim that every
little Irishman&apos;s house is his castle, he fell upon his hated rival and to
such purpose that the wouldbe assailant came to grief and (alas to relate!) the
coveted castle too. Needless to say the cries of discomfited Master Tommy drew the attention of the girl friends.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Come here, Tommy, his sister called imperatively. At
once! And you, Jacky, for shame to throw poor Tommy in the dirty sand. Wait till I catch you for that.</p>
<p> His eyes misty with unshed tears Master Tommy came at her call for their big
sister&apos;s word was law with the twins. And in a sad plight he was too after
his misadventure. His little man-o&apos;-war top and unmentionables were full of
sand but Cissy was a past mistress in the art of smoothing out life&apos;s tiny troubles and
<br><font color="green">{ms, 4}</font>
<br> very quickly not one speck of sand was to be seen on his smart little suit.
Still the blue eyes were glistening
<a name="s13009ae" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009ae">with hot tears that
would well up</a> so she shook her hand at Master Jacky the culprit, her eyes dancing in admonition.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Nasty bold Jacky, she said.</p>
<p> She put her arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What&apos;s your name? Butter and cream?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Tell us who is your sweetheart, spoke Edy Boardman. Is Cissy your sweetheart?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Nao, tearful Tommy said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is Edy Boardman your sweetheart? Cissy queried.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Nao, Tommy said</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I know, Edy Boardman said none too amiably with an arch
glance from her shortsighted eyes. I know who is Tommy&apos;s sweetheart. Gerty is Tommy&apos;s sweetheart.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Nao, Tommy said on the verge of tears.</p>
<p> Cissy&apos;s quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to Edy
Boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman couldn&apos;t
see and to mind he didn&apos;t wet his new tan shoes.</p>
<p> But who was Gerty?</p>
<p> Gerty MacDowell who was seated near her companions, lost in thought, gazing
far away into the distance was, in very truth, as fair a specimen of winsome
Irish girlhood as one could wish to see. She was pronounced beautiful by all who knew her though, as
<br><font color="green">{ms, 5}</font>
<br> folks often said, she was more a Giltrap than a MacDowell. Her figure was
slight and graceful, inclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had
been taking of late had done her a world of good and she was much better of
those discharges she used to get. The waxen pallor of her face was almost
spiritual in its ivorylike purity. Her hands were of finely veined alabaster
with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and queen of ointments could
make them though it was not true that she used to wear kid gloves in bed. Bertha
Supple told that once to Edy Boardman when she was black out with Gerty (the
girl chums had of course their little tiffs from time to time like the rest of
mortals) and she told her not to let on whatever she did that it was her that
told her or she&apos;d never speak to her again. No. Honour where honour is due.
There was an innate refinement, a languid queenly hauteur about Gerty which was
unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and high arched instep. Had kind
fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in her own right and
had she only received the benefit of a good education Gerty MacDowell might
easily have held her own beside any lady of the land and have seen herself
exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow and
<a name="un5005ad" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5005ad">patrician</a> suitors
<br><font color="green">{ms, 6}</font>
<br> at her feet vying with one another to pay their devoirs to her. Mayhap it
was this, the love that might have been, that lent to her softly featured face
at times a look, tense with suppressed meaning, that imparted a strange yearning
tendency to the beautiful eyes,
<a name="un5005af" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5005af">a charm few could
resist</a>. Why have women such eyes of witchery? Gerty&apos;s were of the
bluest Irish blue, set off by lustrous lashes and dark expressive expressive
brows. Time had been when those brows were not so silkily seductive. It was
Madame Vera Verity, directress of the <u>Woman Beautiful</u> page in the
Princess Novelette, who had first advised her to try eyebrowleine, which gave
that haunting expression to the eyes, so becoming in leaders of fashion, and she
had never regretted it. But Gerty&apos;s crowning glory was her wealth of hair.
It was dark brown with a natural wave in it. She had cut it that very morning on
account of the new moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion of
luxuriant clusters. And just now at Edy&apos;s words as a telltale flush,
delicate as the faintest rosebloom, crept into her cheeks she looked so lovely
in her sweet girlish shyness that of a surety God&apos;s fair land of Ireland did not hold her equal.</p>
<p> For an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes. She was about
to retort but something checked the words on her tongue. Inclination
<br><font color="green">{ms, 7}</font>
<br> prompted her to speak out: dignity told her to be silent. The pretty lips
pouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke into a joyous little laugh which
had in it all the freshness of a young May morning. She knew right well, no-one
better, what made squinty Edy say that. As per usual somebody&apos;s nose was
out of joint about the boy that had the bicycle off the London bridge road
always riding up and down in front of her windows. Only now his father kept him
in in the evenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate that
was on and he was going to go to Trinity college to study for a doctor when he
left the high school like his brother W E Wylie who was racing in the bicycle
races of Trinity college university. Little recked he perhaps for what she felt,
that dull ache in her heart sometimes, piercing to the core. Yet he was young
and perchance in time he might learn to love her. They were protestants in his
family and of course Gerty knew who came first and after Him the blessed virgin
and then saint Joseph. But he was undeniably handsome and he looked what he was,
every inch a gentleman, the shape of his head too at the back without his cap
on, something off the common and the way he turned the bicycle at her lamp with
his hands off the bars and also the nice perfume
<br><font color="green">{ms, 8}</font>
<br> of those good cigarettes and besides they were both of a size too he and
she and that was why Edy Boardman thought she was so frightfully clever because
he didn&apos;t go and ride up and down in front of her bit of a garden.</p>
<p> Gerty was dressed simply but with instinctive taste for she felt that there
was just a might that he might be out. A neat blouse of electric blue selftinted
by dolly dyes with a smart vee opening and kerchief pocket (in which she kept
always a little piece of cottonwool scented with heliotrope) and a navy three
quarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful figure to
perfection. She wore a coquettish wideleaved hat of nigger straw with an
underbrim of eggblue chenille and at the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone.
All Tuesday week afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at last
she found what she wanted in Sparrow&apos;s summer bargains, the very it,
slightly shopsoiled but you would never notice, seven fingers two and a penny.
She did it up all by herself and tried it on then, smiling back at her lovely
reflection in the mirror, and when she put it on the waterjug to keep the shape
she knew that that would take the shine out of some people she knew. Her shoes were the newest thing in footwear (Edy
<br><font color="green">{ms, 9}</font>
<br> Boardman prided herself that she was very petite but she never had a foot
like Gerty MacDowell, a five, and never would have,
ask,<a target="foot" id="foz0007">&ordm;</a> oak or elm) with patent toecaps and
just one smart buckle. Her wellturned<a target="foot" id="foz0008">&ordm;</a>
ankle displayed its proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and
no more of her shapely leg encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and
wide garter tops. As for undies they were Gerty&apos;s chief care and who that
knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen (though Gerty would
never see seventeen again) can find it in his heart to blame her? She had four
dinky sets, three articles and nighties extra, and each set slotted with
different coloured ribbons, rosepink, pale blue, mauve and peagreen and she
aired them herself when they came home from the wash because she wouldn&apos;t
trust those washerwomen and aired and ironed herself and she had a brickbat too
to keep the iron hot on. She was wearing the blue for luck, her own colour and
lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere because the green she wore
on Friday brought grief because his father brought him in to study for the
intermediate exhibition and because she thought perhaps he might be out because
when she was dressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her
<br><font color="green">{ms, 10}</font>
<br> inside out and that was for luck and lovers&apos; meeting if you put those
things on inside out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so long as it wasn&apos;t of a Friday.</p>
<p> And yet &mdash; and yet. A gnawing sorrow is there all the time. Her very
soul is in her eyes and she would give worlds to be in her own familiar chamber
where she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelings. The paly light
of evening falls upon a face infinitely sad and wistful. Gerty MacDowell yearns
in vain. Yes, she had known from the very first that it was not to be. He was
too young to understand. He would not believe in love. The night of the party
long ago in Stoer&apos;s (he was still in short trousers) when they were alone
and he stole an arm round her waist she went white to the very lips. He called
her little one and half kissed her (the first!) but it was only the end of her
nose and then he hastened from the room with a remark about refreshments.
Impetuous fellow! Strength of character had never been Reggy Wylie&apos;s strong
point and he who would woo and win Gerty MacDowell must be a man among men. But
waiting, always waiting to be asked and it was leap year too and would soon be over. No prince charming is her beau
<br><font color="green">{ms, 11}</font>
<br> ideal to lay a rare and wondrous love at her feet but rather a manly man
with a strong quiet face, perhaps his hair slightly flecked with grey, and who
would understand, take her in his sheltering arms, strain her to him in all the
strength of his deep passionate nature and comfort her with a long long kiss.
For such a one she yearns this balmy summer eve. With all the heart of her she
longs to be his only, his affianced bride for riches for poor in sickness in
health till death us two part from this to this day forward.</p>
<p> And while Edy Boardman was with little Tommy behind the pushcar she was just
thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his little wife to
be. Then they could talk about her, Bertha Supple too and Edy, little spitfire,
because she would be twentytwo in November. She would care for him with creature
comforts too for Gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked that
feeling of homeyness. Her teacakes and queen Ann&apos;s pudding had won golden
opinions from all because she had a lucky hand they said also for lighting a
fire, dredge in the fine flour and always stir in the same direction, then cream
the milk and sugar and whisk well the white of eggs and they would have a nice
<br><font color="green">{ms, 12}</font>
<br> drawingroom with pictures and chintz covers for the chairs and that silver
toastrack in Clery&apos;s summer sale like they have in rich houses. He would be
tall (she had always admired tall men for a husband) with glistening white teeth
under his carefully trimmed sweeping moustache and every morning they would both
have brekky for their own two selves and before he went out to business he would
give her a good hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyes.</p>
<p> Edy Boardman asked Tommy Caffrey was he done and he said yes so then she
buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run off and play
with Jacky and to be good and not to fight. But Tommy said he wanted the ball
and Edy told him no that baby was playing with the ball and if he took it
there&apos;d be wigs on the green but Tommy said it was his ball and he wanted
his ball and he pranced on the ground, if you please. The temper of him! O, he
was a man already was little Tommy Caffrey. Edy told him no, no and to be off
now with him and she told Cissy Caffrey not to give in to him.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You&apos;re not my sister, naughty Tommy said. It&apos;s my ball.</p>
<p> But Cissy Caffrey told baby Boardman to look up, look up high
<br><font color="green">{ms, 13}</font>
<br> at her finger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand
and Tommy after it in full career, having won the day.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Anything for a quiet life, laughed Ciss.</p>
<p> And she tickled baby Boardman&apos;s two cheeks to make him forget and
played here&apos;s the lord mayor, here&apos;s his two horses, here&apos;s his
gingerbread carriage and here he walks in, chinchopper, chinchopper,
chinchopper, chin. But Edy got as cross as two sticks about his getting his own
way like that from everyone always petting him.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I&apos;d like to give him something, she said, so I would, where I won&apos;t say.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; On the beeoteetom, laughed Cissy merrily.</p>
<p> Gerty MacDowell bent down her head at the idea of Cissy saying a thing like
that out she&apos;d be ashamed of her life to say, flushing a deep rosy red and
Edy Boardman said she was sure the gentleman opposite heard what she said. But not a pin cared Cissy.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Let him! she said with a pert toss of her head and a
piquant tilt of her nose. Give it to him too on the same place quick as I&apos;d look at him.</p>
<p> Madcap Ciss. You had to laugh at her sometimes. For instance when she asked
<br><font color="green">{ms, 14}</font>
<br> you would you have some more Chinese tea and jaspberry ram and when she
drew the jugs too and the men&apos;s faces make you split your sides or when she
said she wanted to run and pay a visit to the miss white. That was just like
Cissycums. O, and will you ever forget her the evening she dressed up in her
father&apos;s suit and hat and walked down
<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font>
smoking a cigarette. But she was sincerity itself, one of the bravest and truest
hearts heaven ever made, a sterling good friend, not one of your twofaced things too sweet to be wholesome.</p>
<p> And then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the pealing
anthem of the organ. It was the men&apos;s temperance novena conducted by the
missioner, the reverend father John Hughes S.J., rosary sermon and benediction
of the most blessed sacrament. They were there gathered together without
distinction of social class (and most edifying was it to see) in that simple
fane beside the waves after the storms of this weary world, kneeling humbly at
the feet of the immaculate, beseeching her to intercede for them, holy Mary,
holy virgin of virgins. How sad to poor Gerty&apos;s ears! Had her father only
avoided the clutches of the demon drink she might now be rolling in her
carriage, second to none. Over and over had she told herself that as
<br><font color="green">{ms, 15}</font>
<br> she mused by the fireside in a brown study, her eyes on the dying embers,
or gazing out of the window by the hour at the rain falling on the rusty bucket.
But that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearths and homes had cast its
shadow over her girlhood days. Nay, she had even witnessed in the home circle
deeds of violence caused by intemperance and had seen her own father, a prey to
the fumes of intoxication forget himself completely for if there was one thing
of all things that Gerty knew it was that the man who lifts his hand to a woman
save in the way of kindness, deserves to be branded as the lowest of the low.</p>
<p> And still the voices sang in supplication to the virgin most powerful,
virgin most merciful. And Gerty, rapt in thought, scarce saw or heard her
companions or the twins at the boyish gambols or the gentleman off
Sandymount<a target="foot" id="foz0009">&ordm;</a> green that Cissy called the
man that was so like himself passing along the strand taking a short walk. You
never saw him anyway screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for a
<br><font color="green">{ms, 16}</font>
<br> father because he was too old or something or on account of his face (it
was a palpable case of Doctor Fell) or his carbuncly nose with the pimples on
it. Poor father! With all his faults she loved him still when he sang <u>Tell
me, Mary, how to woo</u> thee and they had stewed cockles and lettuce with salad
dressing for supper and when he sang the duet <u>The moon hath raised</u> with
Mr Dignam that died suddenly and was buried, God have mercy on him, from a
stroke. Her mother&apos;s birthday that was and Charley was home on his holidays
and Tom and Mr Dignam and Mrs and Patsy and Freddy Dignam and they were to have
had a group taken. No-one would have thought the end was so near. Now he was
laid to rest. And her mother said to him to let that be a warning to him for the
rest of his days and he couldn&apos;t even go to the funeral on account of the
gout and she had to go into town to bring him the letters and samples from his
office about Catesby&apos;s cork lino, artistic designs, fit for a palace, gives
tiptop wear and always bright and cheery in the home.</p>
<p> A sterling good daughter was Gerty just like a second mother in the house, a
ministering angel too. And when her mother had those
<br><font color="green">{ms, 17}</font>
<br> awful headaches who was it rubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but
Gerty though she didn&apos;t like her mother&apos;s taking pinches of snuff and
that was the only single thing they ever had words about, taking snuff. It was
Gerty who turned off the gas every night at the main and it was Gerty who tacked
up on the wall of that place Mr Tunney the grocer&apos;s christmas almanac, the
picture of halcyon days where a young gentleman in the dress they used to wear
then with a threecornered hat offered a bunch of flowers to his lady love with
oldtime chivalry through the lattice window. The colours were done lovely. She
was in a soft clinging white and the gentleman in chocolate and he looked a
thorough aristocrat. She often looked at them dreamily when she went there for a
certain purpose and thought about those times because she had found out in
Walker&apos;s pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa Giltrap about the halcyon days what they meant.</p>
<p> The twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion till at
last master Jacky, who was really as bold as brass, there was no getting behind
that, deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he could down towards the
seaweedy rocks. Needless to say, poor Tommy was not slow to voice his dismay but
luckily the gentleman in black who was sitting there by himself
<br><font color="green">{ms, 18}</font>
<br> came to the rescue and intercepted the ball. Our two champions claimed
their plaything with lusty cries and to avoid trouble Cissy Caffrey called to
the gentleman to throw it to her please. The gentleman aimed the ball once or
twice and then threw it along the strand towards Cissy Caffrey but it rolled
down the slope and stopped under Gerty&apos;s skirt near the little pool beside
the rock. The twins clamoured again for it and Cissy told her to kick it away
and let them fight for it so Gerty drew back her foot but she wished their
stupid ball hadn&apos;t come rolling down to her and she gave a gave but she missed and Edy and Cissy laughed.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; If you fail try again, Edy Boardman said.</p>
<p> Gerty smiled assent<a target="foot" id="foz0010">&ordm;</a> A delicate pink
crept into her pretty cheeks but she was determined to let them see so she just
lifted her skirt a little and took good aim and gave the ball a jolly good kick
and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down towards the shingle.
Pure jealousy of course it was, nothing else to draw attention on account of the
gentleman opposite looking. She felt the warm flush, a danger signal always with
Gerty MacDowell, surging and flaming into her cheeks. Till then they had only
exchanged glances of the most casual but now under the brim of her new hat she
ventured a look at him and the face that met her gaze there in the twilight, wan and strangely drawn, seemed to her
<br><font color="green">{ms, 19}</font>
<br> the saddest she had ever seen.</p>
<p> Through the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted and
with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain of original
sin. Spiritual vessel, pray for us, honourable vessel, pray for us, vessel of
singular devotion, pray for us, mystical rose. And careworn hearts were there
and toilers for their daily bread and many who had erred and wandered, their
eyes wet with contrition but, for all that, bright with hope for the reverend
father Father Hughes had told them what the great saint Bernard had said in his
famous prayer of Mary, the most pious virgin&apos;s intercessory power that it
was not recorded in any age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever abandoned by her.</p>
<p> The twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of childhood
are but as passing summer clouds. Cissy Caffrey played with baby Boardman till
he crowed with glee, clapping baby hands in air, crying peep behind the hood of
the pushcar and Edy asked where was Cissy gone and then Cissy popped up her head
and said ah! (O, my! didn&apos;t the little chap enjoy that) And then she bade him say papa.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Say papa, baby. Say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa.</p>
<p> And baby did his level best to say it because he was very intelligent for for eleven months everyone said and he
<br><font color="green">{ms, 20}</font>
<br> would certainly turn out to be something great, they said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ja, ja, ja, ja.</p>
<p> Cissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to sit up
properly and say pa, pa, pa. But when she undid the strap she cried out, holy
saint Denis, that he was possing wet and to double the half blanket the other
way under him. Of course his infant majesty was most obstreperous at such toilet
formalities and it was all no use telling him about the geegee and where was the
puffpuff but Ciss, always readywitted gave him in his mouth the teat of the
suckingbottle and the young heathen was quickly appeased.</p>
<p> Gerty wished to goodness they would take their baby home out of that, no
hour to be out, and the little brats of twins. She gazed out towards the distant
sea. It was like a picture: the evening and the clouds coming out and the Bailey
light on Howth and to hear the music like that and the perfume they used in the
church. And while she gazed her heart went pitapat. Yes, it was her he was
looking at, and there was meaning in his look. His eyes burned into her as
though they would search her through and through, read her very soul. Wonderful eyes they were, superbly expressive,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 21}</font>
<br> but<a target="foot" id="foz0011">&ordm;</a> could you trust them? She could
see at once by his dark eyes that he was a foreigner but she could not see
whether he had an aquiline nose from where he was sitting. He was in deep
mourning, she could see that, and the story of a haunting sorrow was written on
his face. She would have given worlds to know what it was. He was looking up so
intensely, so still and he saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the
bright steel buckles of if she swung them like that thoughtfully. She was glad
that something told her to put on the transparent stockings thinking Reggy Wylie
might be out but that was far away. Here was that of which she had so often
dreamed. The heart of the girl-woman went out to him. If he had suffered, more
sinned against than sinning, or even, even, if he had been himself a sinner, a
wicked man, she cared not. There were wounds that wanted healing and she just
yearned to know all, to forgive all if she could make him fall in love with her,
make him forget the memory of the past. Then mayhap he would embrace her gently,
crushing her soft body to his, and love her for herself alone.</p>
<p> Refuge of sinners. Comfortress of the afflicted.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 22}</font>
<br> <u>Ora pro nobis.</u> Well has it been said that whosoever prays to her
with faith and constancy can never be lost or cast away: and fitly is she too a
haven of refuge for the afflicted because of the seven dolours which
transpierced her own heart. Gerty could picture the whole scene in the church,
the stained glass windows lighted up, the candles, the flowers and the blue
banners of the blessed virgin&apos;s sodality and father Conroy was helping
canon O&apos;Hanlon at the altar, carrying things in and out with his eyes cast
down. He looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet and clean and
dark and his hands were just like white wax. He told her that time when she told
him about that at confession, crimsoning up to the roots of her hair for fear he
could see, that she was not to be troubled because that was only the voice of
nature and we were all subject to nature&apos;s laws, he said, in this life and
that that was no sin because that came from the nature of woman instituted by
God, he said, and that our Blessed Lady herself said to the
archangel<a target="foot" id="foz0012">&ordm;</a> Gabriel be it done unto me
according to Thy Word. He was so kind and holy and often and often she thought could she work an embroidered
<br><font color="green">{ms, 23}</font>
<br> teacosy for him as a present or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on
the mantelpiece white and gold with a canary that came out of a little house to
tell the time the day she went there about the flowers for the forty hours&apos;
adoration because it was hard to know what sort of a present to give or perhaps
an album of illuminated views of Dublin or some place.</p>
<p> The little brats of twins began to quarrel again and Jacky threw the ball
out towards the sea and they both ran after it. Common as ditchwater the little
monkeys. Someone ought to take them and give them a good hiding for themselves
to keep them in their places the both of them. And Cissy and Edy shouted after
them to come back because they were afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Jacky! Tommy!</p>
<p> Not they! What a great notion they had! So Cissy said it was the very last
time she&apos;d ever bring them out. She jumped up and called and then she ran
down the slope past him, tossing behind her her hair which had a good enough
colour if there had been more of it but with all the thingamerry she was always rubbing into it
<br><font color="green">{ms, 24}</font>
<br> she couldn&apos;t get it to grow long because it wasn&apos;t natural so she
could just go and throw her hat at it. She ran with long gandery strides it was
a wonder she didn&apos;t rip up her skirt at the side that was too tight on her
because there was a lot of the tomboy about Cissy Caffrey whenever she thought
she had a good opportunity to show off and just because she was a good runner
she ran like that so that he could see all the end of her petticoat running and
her skinny shanks up as far as possible. It would have served her just right if
she had tripped up over something with her high French heels on her to make her
look tall and got a fine tumble. That would have been a very charming
expos&eacute; for a gentleman like that to witness.</p>
<p> Queen of angels, queen of patriarchs, queen of prophets, of all saints, they
prayed, queen of the most holy rosary and then Father Conroy handed the thurible
to Canon O&apos;Hanlon and he put in the incense and censed the blessed
sacrament and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and she was itching to give
them a good clip on the ear but she didn&apos;t because she thought he might be
watching but she never made a bigger mistake
<br><font color="green">{ms, 25}</font>
<br> in all her life because Gerty could see without looking that he never took
his eyes off of her and then Canon O&apos;Hanlon handed the thurible back to
Father Conroy and knelt down looking up at the blessed sacrament and the choir
began to sing <u>Tantum ergo</u> and she just swung her foot in and out in time
to the <u>tantumer gosa cramen tum</u>. Three and eleven she paid for those
stockings in Sparrow&apos;s of George&apos;s street on the Tuesday, no the
Monday before easter and there wasn&apos;t a brack on them and that was what he
was looking at, transparent, and not at her that had neither shape nor form
because he had eyes in his head to see the difference for himself.</p>
<p> Cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with her
hat anyhow on her on one side after her run and she did look a streel tugging
the two kids along with the blouse she bought only a fortnight before like a rag
on her back. Gerty just took off her hat for a moment to settle her hair and a a
prettier, a daintier head of nutbrown tresses
<br><font color="green">{ms, 26}</font>
<br> was never seen on a girl&apos;s shoulders, &mdash; a radiant little vision,
in sooth, almost maddening in its sweetness. You would have to travel many a
long mile before you found a head of hair the like of that. She could almost see
the swift answering
fl<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps"><sub>unread</sub></span></font>h<a target="foot" id="foz0013">&ordm;</a>
of admiration in his eyes that set her tingling in every nerve. She put on her
hat so that she could see from underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe
faster for her breath caught as she read the expression of his eyes. He was
eying her as a snakes eyes its prey. Her woman&apos;s instinct told her that she
had raised the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet swept from
throat to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a glorious rose.</p>
<p> Edy Boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at Gerty, half
smiling, with her specs like an old maid, pretending to hush the baby. Irritable
little gnat she was and always would be and that was why no-one could get on
with her poking her nose into what was no concern of hers. And she said to Gerty:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A penny for your thoughts.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 27}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What? laughed Gerty. I was only wondering was it late.</p>
<p> Because she wished they&apos;d take the snottynosed twins and the babby home
to the mischief out of that so that was why she just gave a gentle hint about it
being late. And when Cissy came up Edy asked her the time and Miss Cissy, as
glib as you like, said it was half past kissing time, time to kiss again. But
Edy wanted to know because they were told to be in early.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Wait, said Cissy, I&apos;ll ask uncle Peter over there what&apos;s the time by his conundrum.</p>
<p> So over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his hand
out of his pocket, getting nervous, and beginning to play with his watchchain,
looking up at the church. Passionate nature though he was Gerty could see that
he had enormous control over himself. One moment he had been there fascinated by
a loveliness that made him gaze, the passion seething in his veins and the next
moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman, selfcontrol expressed in every line of his distinguished looking figure.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 28}</font> </p>
<p> Cissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the right
time and Gerty could see him taking out his watch and listening and looking up
and looking at it: and he said he was very sorry his watch was stopped but he
thought it must be after eight because the sun was set. His voice had a cultured
ring in it and there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones. Cissy said
thanks and came back with her tongue out and said his waterworks were out of order.</p>
<p> Then they sang the second verse of the <u>Tantum ergo</u> and Canon
O&apos;Hanlon got up again and censed the blessed sacrament and knelt down and
he told Father Conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire to the
flowers and Father Conroy got up and settled it all right and she could see the
gentleman winding his watch and listening to the works. And she swung her leg
more in and out in time. It was getting darker but he could see and he was
looking all the time that he was winding the watch or whatever he was doing to
it and then he put it back. She felt a kind of a sensation rushing all over her
and she knew by the feel of her scalp and that irritation against her stays that
that thing was coming on because the last time was also when she clipped her
hair on account of the moon. His dark eyes fixed themselves on her again,
drinking in her every contour, literally worshipping at
<br><font color="green">{ms, 29}</font>
<br> her<a target="foot" id="foz0014">&ordm;</a> shrine. If ever there was
undisguised admiration in a man&apos;s passionate gaze it was there plain to be
seen on that man&apos;s face. It is for you, Gertrude MacDowell, and you know it.</p>
<p> Edy began to get ready to go and she noticed that little hint she gave had
had the desired effect because it was a long way along the strand to where there
was the place to push up the pushcar and Cissy took off the twins&apos; caps and
combed their hair to make herself attractive of course and Canon O&apos;Hanlon
stood up with his cope poking up at his neck and Father Conroy handed him the
card to read off and he read out <u>Panem de coelo praestitisti eis</u> and Edy
and Cissy were talking about the time all the time and asking her but Gerty
could pay them back in their own coin and she just answered, with scathing
politeness when Edy asked her was she heartbroken about her best boy throwing
her over. Gerty winced sharply. A brief cold blaze shone from her eyes that
spoke of scorn immeasurable. It hurt &mdash; O, yes, it cut deep because Edy had
her own quiet way of saying things that she knew would wound like the confounded
little cat she was. Gerty&apos;s lips parted swiftly but she fought back the sob
that rose to her throat, so slim, so flawless
<br><font color="green">{ms, 30}</font>
<br> so beautifully modelled it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of. She
had loved him better than he knew. Lighthearted deceiver and fickle like all his
sex he would never understand what he had meant to her and for an instant there
was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears. Their eyes were probing her
mercilessly but with a brave effort she sparkled back in sympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them to see</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, she laughed, and the proud head flashed up. I can
throw my cap at who I like because it&apos;s leap year.</p>
<p> Her words rang out crystal clear, more musical than the cooing of the
ringdove but they cut the silence icily. There was that in her young voice that
told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with. Miss Edy&apos;s
countenance fell to no slight extent and Gerty could see by her looking as black
as thunder that she was simply in a towering rage because that shaft had struck
home and they both knew that she was something aloof, apart, in another sphere,
that she was not of them and never would be and there was somebody else too that
knew it and saw it so they could put that in their pipe and smoke it.</p>
<p> Edy straightened up baby Boardman to get
<br><font color="green">{ms, 31}</font>
<br> ready to go and Cissy tucked in the ball and the spades and buckets and it
was high time too because the sandman was on his way for master Boardman junior.
And Cissy Caffrey told him too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to
go deedaw and baby looked just too ducky, laughing up out of his gleeful eyes
and Cissy poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby, without
as much as by your leave, sent up his compliments to all and sundry on to his brand new dribbling bib.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O my! puddeny pie! protested Ciss.</p>
<p> The slight contretemps claimed her attention but in two two she set that little matter to rights.</p>
<p> Gerty stifled a smothered exclamation and Edy asked what and she was just
going to tell her to catch it while it was flying but she was ever ladylike in
her deportment so she simply passed it off by saying that that was the
benediction because just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet
seashore because Canon O&apos;Hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that
Father Conroy put round him round his shoulders giving them the benediction with the blessed sacrament in his hands.</p>
<p> How moving the scene there in the gathering twilight, the last glimpse of
Erin, the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time a bat flew
forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk, hither, thither, with a tiny lost cry. And she could see far away
<br><font color="green">{ms, 32}</font>
<br> the lights of the lighthouses and soon the lamplighter would be going his
rounds lighting the lamp near her window where Reggy Wylie used to turn the
bicycle like she read in that book <u>The Lamplighter</u> by Miss Cummins author
of <u>Mabel Vaughan</u> and other tales. For Gerty had her dreams that no-one
knew of. She loved to read poetry and, when she got a keepsake from Bertha
Supple of that lovely confession album with the coralpink cover to write her
thoughts in she laid it in the drawer of her toilet-table, which, though it did
not err on the side of luxury, was scrupulously neat and clean. It was there she
kept her girlish treasure trove, the tortoiseshell combs, her child of Mary
badge, the whiterose scent, the eyebrowline, her alabaster pouncetbox and the
ribbons to change when her things came home from the wash and there were some
beautiful thoughts written in it in violet ink that she bought in Wisdom
Hely&apos;s for she felt that she too could write poetry if she could only
express herself like that poetry she had copied out of the newspaper she found
one evening round the potherbs.<a target="foot" id="foz0015">&ordm;</a> <u>Art
thou real, my ideal?</u> it was called by Louis J Walsh, Magherafelt, and after
there was something about <u>twilight, wilt thou ever?</u> and often the beauty
of poetry, so sad in its transient loveliness
<br><font color="green">{ms, 33}</font>
<br> had misted her eyes with silent tears for she felt that the years were
slipping by for her, one by one, and but for that one shortcoming she knew she
need fear no comparisons and that was accident coming down the hill and she
always tried to conceal it. But it must end, she felt. If she saw that magic
lure in his eyes there would be no holding back for her. Love laughs at
locksmiths. She would make the great sacrifice. Dearer than the whole world
would she be to him and gild his days with happiness. There was the all
important<a target="foot" id="foz0016">&ordm;</a> question and she was dying to
know was he a married man or a widower who had lost his wife or some tragedy
like the nobleman with the foreign name from the land of song had to have her
put into a madhouse, cruel only to be kind. But even if &mdash; what then? Would
it make a very great difference. From everything in the least indelicate her
finebred nature instinctively recoiled. She loathed that sort of person, the
fallen women off the accomodation walk beside the Dodder that went with the
soldiers and coarse men, degrading the sex and being taken up to the police
station. No, no: not that. They would be just good friends in spite of the
conventions of society with a big ess. Perhaps it was an old flame he was in
mourning for from the days beyond recall. She thought she understood. She would
try to understand him because men were so different. The old love was waiting,
waiting with little white hands stretched out, with blue appealing
<br><font color="green">{ms, 34}</font>
<br> eyes. She would follow the dictates of her heart for love was the master
guide. Nothing else mattered. Come what might she would be wild, untrammelled, free.</p>
<p> Canon O&apos;Hanlon put the blessed sacrament back into the tabernacle and
the choir sang <u>Laudate Dominum omnes gentes</u> and then he locked the
tabernacle door because the benediction was over and Father Conroy handed him
his hat to put on and Edy asked was she coming but Jacky Caffrey called out:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, look, Cissy!</p>
<p> And they all looked was it sheet lightning but Tommy saw it too over the
trees beside the church, blue and then green and purple.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It&apos;s fireworks, Cissy Caffrey said.</p>
<p> And they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church,
helterskelter, Edy with the pushcar with baby Boardman in it and Cissy holding
Tommy and Jacky by the hand so they wouldn&apos;t fall, running.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Come on, Gerty, Cissy called. It&apos;s the bazaar fireworks.</p>
<p> But Gerty was adamant. She had no intention of being at their beck and call.
If they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she could see from
where she was. The eyes that were fastened upon her set her pulses tingling. She
looked at him a moment, meeting his glance, and a light broke in upon her. Whitehot passion was in
<br><font color="green">{ms, 35}</font>
<br> that face, passion silent as the grave and it had made her his. At last
they were left alone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew he
could be trusted to the death, steadfast, a man of principle to his fingertips.
She leaned back far to see up where the fireworks were and she caught her knee
in her hands so as not to fall back, looking up, and there was no-one to see
only him and her when she revealed all her graceful beautifully shaped legs like
that, supply soft and delicately rounded, and she seemed to hear the panting of
his heart, his hoarse breathing, because she knew too about the passion of men
like that, hotblooded<a target="foot" id="foz0017">&ordm;</a> because Bertha
Supple told her once in secret about the gentleman lodger that was staying with
them out of the record office that had pictures cut out of papers of
skirtdancers<a target="foot" id="foz0018">&ordm;</a> and she said he used to do
something not very nice that you could imagine sometimes in the bed. But this
was different from a thing like that because there was all the difference
because she could almost feel him draw her face to his and the first quick hot
touch of his handsome lips. Besides there was absolution so long as you
didn&apos;t do the other thing before being married and there ought to be women
priests that would understand without telling out and Cissy Caffrey too sometimes had
<br><font color="green">{ms, 36}</font>
<br> that dreamy kind of dreamy look in her eyes so that she too, my dear, and
besides it was on account of that other thing coming on the way it did.</p>
<p> And Jacky Caffrey shouted to look, there was another and she leaned back and
the garters were blue to match on account of the contrast with the transparent
and they all saw it and they all shouted to look, look, there it was and she
leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something queer was flying
through the air, a soft thing, to and fro, dark. And she saw a long Roman candle
going up over the trees, up, up, and they were all breathless with excitement as
it went higher and higher and she had to lean back more and more to look up
after it, high, high, almost out of sight, and her face was suffused with a
divine, an entrancing blush from straining back and he could see her other
things too, nainsook knickers, four and eleven, on account of being white and
she let him and she saw that he saw and then it went so high it went out of
sight a moment and she was trembling in every limb from being bent so far back
that he could see high up above her knee where no-one ever and she wasn&apos;t
ashamed to look in that immodest way like that because he couldn&apos;t resist
the sight like those skirtdancers behaving so
<br><font color="green">{ms, 37}</font>
<br> immodest before men looking and he wasn&apos;t either, looking, looking.
She would fain have cried to him chokingly, held out her snowy slender arms to
him to come, to feel his lips laid on her white brow. O! And then suddenly it
burst and it was like a sigh of O! and everybody cried O! O! and it shot out of
it a stream of rain gold hair threads and they burst and ah! they were all
greeny dewy stars falling with golden, O so lovely, O, soft, sweet, soft!</p>
<p> Then all melted away dewily in the grey air: all was silent. Ah! She glanced
at him as she bent forward quickly, a glance of piteous protest, of shy reproach
under which he coloured like a girl. He was leaning back against the rock
behind. Leopold Bloom (for it is he) stands silent, with bowed head before those
young guileless eyes. What a brute he had been!
<a name="s13001b" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13001b">At it again?</a> A
fair unsullied soul had called and, wretch that he was, how had he answered?
What an utter cad he had been! But there was an infinite store of mercy in those
eyes, for him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and sinned and
wandered. That was their secret, only theirs, alone in the hiding twilight and
there was none to know save the little bat that flew so softly through the
evening to and fro and little bats don&apos;t tell.</p>
<p> Cissy Caffrey whistled and she called:
<br><font color="green">{ms, 38}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Gerty! Gerty! We&apos;re going. Come on. We can see from farther up.</p>
<p> Gerty had an idea. She took the wadding from her kerchief pocket and waved
in gay reply of course without letting him and then put it back. Wonder if
he&apos;s too far to. She rose. She had to go but they would meet again, there,
and she would dream of it till then, till they met tomorrow. She drew herself up
to her full height. Their souls met in a last lingering glance and the eyes that
reached her heart, full of a strange shining, hung enraptured on her sweet
flowerlike face. She half smiled at him, a sweet forgiving smile &mdash; and
then they parted. Slowly, without looking back she went down the uneven strand
to Cissy, to Edy, to Jacky and Tommy Caffrey, to little baby Boardman. It was
darker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and slippy
seaweed. She walked with a certain quiet dignity but with care and slowly
because, &mdash; because Gerty MacDowell was&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> Tight boots. No! She&apos; lame. O!</p>
<p> Mr Bloom watched her as she limped away. Poor girl! That&apos;s why
she&apos;s left on the shelf and the others did a sprint. Thought something was
wrong by the cut of her jib. Jilted beauty. Glad I didn&apos;t know it when she
was on show. Hot little devil all the same. Near her monthlies, I expect makes
them feel ticklish. I have such a bad headache. Where did I put the letter. Yes,
all right. All kinds of crazy longings. Girl in Tranquilla convent nun told me liked paraffin
<br><font color="green">{ms, 39}</font>
<br> oil. Sister? That&apos;s the moon. But then why don&apos;t all women
menstruate at the same time with the same moon. I mean. Depends on the time they
were born I suppose. Anyhow I got the best of that. Made up for the tramdriver
this morning. That gouger M<sup><small>c</small></sup>Coy stopping him to say
nothing. Thankful for small mercies. Cheap too. Yours for the asking. Pity they
can&apos;t see themselves<a target="foot" id="foz0019">&ordm;</a>. A dream of
wellfilled hose. Where was that? Ah, yes. Mutoscope picture: for men only.
Peeping Tom. Do they snapshot those girls or is it imagination of some fellow?
Lingerie does it. Felt for the curves inside her deshabille. Excites themselves
when they&apos;re. Molly too. Why I bought her the violet garters. Say a woman
loses a charm with every pin she takes out. Pinned together. O, Mairy lost the
pin of her. Dressed up to the nines for somebody. In no hurry either. Always off
to a fellow when they are. Out on spec probably. They believe in chance because
like themselves. And the others inclined to give her an odd dig. Mary and
Martha. Girl friends at school, arms round each other&apos;s necks, kissing and
whispering secrets about nothing in the convent garden. Nuns with
whitewashed<a target="foot" id="foz0020">&ordm;</a> faces, cool coifs and their
rosaries going up and down, vindictive too for what they can&apos;t get. Barbed
wire. Be sure now and write to me. And I&apos;ll
<br><font color="green">{ms, 40}</font>
<br> write to you. Now won&apos;t you? Molly and Josie Powell. Then meet once in
a blue moon. Tableau. Look who it is for the love of God! How are you at all?
What have you been doing with yourself? Kiss and delighted to, kiss, to see you.
Picking holes in each other&apos;s appearance. You&apos;re looking splendid.
Wouldn&apos;t lend each other a pinch of salt.</p>
<p> Ah.</p>
<p> Devils they are when that&apos;s coming on them. Molly often told me feel
things a ton weight. Scratch the sole of my foot. O that way! O, that&apos;s
exquisite! Feel it myself too. Good to rest once in a way. Wonder if it&apos;s
bad to go with them then. Safe in a way. Something about withering plants I read
in a garden. Besides they say if the flower withers she wears she&apos;s a
flirt. All are. Daresay she felt I. When you feel like that you often meet what
you feel. Liked me or what? Dress they look at. Always know a fellow courting:
collars and cuffs. Same time might prefer a tie undone or something. Trousers?
Suppose I when I was? No. Gently does it. Dislike rough and tumble. Kiss in the
dark and never tell. Saw something in me. Wonder why. Sooner have me as I am
than some poet with bearsgrease plastery hair, lovelock over his dexter optic.
To aid gentleman in literary. Ought to attend to my appearance this age.
Didn&apos;t let her see me in profile. Still, you never know. Pretty girls
<br><font color="green">{ms, 41}</font>
<br> and ugly men marrying. Beauty and the beast. Besides I can&apos;t be so if
Molly. Took off her hat to show her hair. Wide brim. Bought to hide her face,
meeting someone might know her, bend down, or carry a bunch of flowers. Hair
smells in rut. Ten bob I got for Molly&apos;s combings when we were on the rocks
in Holles street. Why not? Suppose he gave her money? Why not? All a
prejudice<a target="foot" id="foz0021">&ordm;</a>. She&apos;s worth ten
shillings, more fifteen, a pound. Bold hand: Mrs Marion. Did I forget to write
address on that letter like the postcard I sent Flynn. And the day I went to
Drimmie&apos;s without a necktie. Wrangle with Molly it was put me off. No, I
remember. Richie Goulding: he&apos;s another. Weighs on his mind. Funny my watch
stopped at half past four. Was that just when he, she?</p>
<p> O, he did! Into her. She did! Done.</p>
<p> Ah.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom with careful hand recomposed his wet shirt. O Lord, that little
limping devil. Begins to feel cold and clammy. After effect not pleasant. They
don&apos;t care. Complimented perhaps. Go home now and say night prayers with
the kiddies. Well, aren&apos;t they? Still, I feel. The strength it gives a man.
That&apos;s the secret of it. Good job I let off then behind the wall coming out
of Dignam&apos;s. Cider that was. Otherwise I couldn&apos;t have. Makes you want
to sing after. Suppose I spoke to her. What about? Bad plan however if you
don&apos;t know how to end the conversation<a target="foot" id="foz0022">&ordm;</a>. Ask them a question
<br><font color="green">{ms, 42}</font>
<br> they ask you another. Good plan if you&apos;re stuck. Then you&apos;re in a
cart. Wonderful of course if you say: good evening, and you see she&apos;s on
for it: good evening. Girl in Meath street that night. All the dirty things I
made her say. Wish she hadn&apos;t called me sir. O, her mouth in the dark!
French letter still in my pocketbook. But might happen sometime, I don&apos;t
think. Come in, all is prepared.
<a name="s13013bq" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013bq">I dreamt. What?</a>
Worst is beginning. How they change the venue when it&apos;s not what they want.
Ask you do you like mushrooms because they knew a gentleman once who. Yet if I
went the whole hog, say: I want to, something like that. Because I did. She too.
Offend her, then make it up. Pretend to want something awfully. Then cry off for
her sake. Flatters them. She must have been thinking of someone else all the
time. What harm? Must since she came to the use of reason, he, he and he. First
kiss does the trick. Something inside them goes pop. Mushy like, tell by their
eye, on the sly. First thoughts are best. Remember that till their dying day.
Molly, lieutenant Mulvey that kissed her under the Moorish wall beside the
gardens. Fifteen she told me. But her breasts were developed. Fell asleep then.
After Glencree dinner that was when we drove home. Featherbed mountain. Gnashing
her teeth in sleep. Lord mayor had his eye on her too. Val Dillon. Apoplectic.</p>
<p> There she is with them down there for the fireworks. My fireworks.
<a name="un4019o" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4019o">Up like a rocket and
down like a stick.</a> And the children, twins they must be, waiting for
something to happen. Want to be grownups. Dressing in mother&apos;s clothes. Time enough, understand all
<br><font color="green">{ms, 43}</font>
<br> the ways of the world. And the dark one with the mop head and the nigger
mouth. I knew she could whistle. Mouth made for that. Why some whores wear veils
to their noses. Would you mind, please, telling me the right time? I&apos;ll
tell you the time in a lane. Say prunes and prisms forty times every morning,
cure for fat lips. Caressing the little boy too. Onlookers see most of the game.
Of course they understand birds, animal, babies. In their line.</p>
<p> Didn&apos;t look back when she was going down the strand. Wouldn&apos;t give
that satisfaction. Those girls, those girls, those lovely seaside. Fine eyes she
had, clear. It&apos;s the white of the eye brings that out not so much the
pupil. Did she know what I? Course. Like a cat sitting beyond a dog&apos;s jump.
Woman. Never meet one like that Wilkins in the high school drawing a picture of
Venus with all her belongings on show. Call that innocence. Poor idiot! His wife
has her work cut out for her. Sharp as needles they are. When I said to Molly
the man at the corner of Cuffe street was goodlooking, thought she might like,
twigged at once he had a false arm. Had, too. Where do they get that? Handed
down from father to, mother to daughter, I mean. Bred in the bone. Milly, for
example, drying her handkerchief on the mirror to save the ironing. And when I
sent for Molly&apos;s Paisley shawl to Prescott&apos;s, by the way that ad I
must, carrying home the change in her stocking! Clever little minx. I never told
her. Neat way she carries parcels too. Attract men, small thing like that. Holding up her hand, shaking it, to let the
<br><font color="green">{ms, 44}</font>
<br> blood flow back when it was red. Who did you learn that from? Nobody.
Something the nurse taught me. O, don&apos;t they know? Five years old she was
in front of Molly&apos;s dressing table, just before we left Lombard street
west. <u>Me have a nice pace.</u> Mullingar. Who knows? Ways of the world. Young
student. Straight on her pins anyhow not like the other. Still she was game.
Lord, I am wet. Devil you are. Swell of her calf. Transparent stockings,
stretched to breaking point. Not like that frump today. A.E. Rumpled stockings.
Or the one in Grafton street. White. Wow! Beef to the heel.</p>
<p> A monkey puzzle rocket burst, spluttering in darting crackles. Zrads and
zrads, zrads, zrads. And Cissy and Tommy and Jacky ran out to see and Edy after
with the pushcar and then Gerty beyond the curve of the rocks. Will she? Watch!
Watch! See! Looked round. She smelt an onion. Darling, I saw, your. I saw all.</p>
<p> Lord!</p>
<p> Did me good all the same. Off colour after Kiernan&apos;s, Dignam&apos;s.
For this relief much thanks. In <u>Hamlet</u>, that is. Lord! It was all things
combined. Excitement. When she leaned back, felt an ache at the butt of my
tongue. Your head it simply. He&apos;s right. Might have made a worse fool of
myself. Instead of talking about nothing. Then I will tell you all. Still it was
a kind of language between us. It couldn&apos;t be? No. Gerty they called her.
Might be false name however like name and the address
<br><font color="green">{ms, 45}</font>
<br> Dolphin&apos;s barn a blind. Her maiden name was Jemima Brown and she lived
with her mother in Irishtown. Place made me think of that, I suppose. All tarred
with the same brush. Wiping pens in their stockings. But the ball rolled down to
her as if it understood. Every bullet has its billet. Course I never could throw
anything straight at school. Crooked as a ram&apos;s horn. Sad however because
it lasts only a few years till they settle down to pot walloping and
fullers&apos; earth for the baby when he does ah ah. No soft job. Saves them.
Keeps them out of harm&apos;s way. Nature. Washing child, washing corpse.
Dignam. Children&apos;s hands always round them. Cocoanut skulls, monkeys, not
even closed at first, sour milk in their swaddles and tainted curds.
Oughtn&apos;t to have given that child an empty teat to suck. Fill it up with
wind. Mrs Beaufoy, Purefoy. Must call to the hospital. Wonder is nurse Callan
there still. And Mrs Breen and Mrs Dignam once like that too, marriageable.
Worst of all the night Mrs Duggan told me in the City Arms. Husband rolling in
drunk, stink of pub off him like a polecat. Have that in your nose all night,
whiff of stale boose. Bad policy however to fault the husband. They stick by one
another. Maybe the women&apos;s fault also. That&apos;s where Molly can knock
spots off them. It&apos;s the blood of the south. Moorish. Also the form, the
figure. Hands felt for the opulent. Just compare, for instance, those others.
Wife locked up at home, skeleton in the cupboard. Allow me to introduce my. Then
they trot you out some kind of a nondescript, wouldn&apos;t know what to call
her always see a fellow&apos;s weak point in his wife. Still,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 46}</font>
<br> there&apos;s destiny in it: falling in love. Have their own secrets between
them. Chaps that would go the dogs if some woman didn&apos;t take them in hand.
Then little chits of girls, height of a shilling in coppers, with little
hubbies. As God made them he matched them. Sometimes children turn out well
enough. Twice nought makes one. This wet is very unpleasant.</p>
<p> Ow!</p>
<p> Other hand a sixfooter with a wifey up to his watchpocket. Long and the
short of it. Very strange about my watch. Wonder is there any magnetic influence
between the person because that was about the time he. Yes, I suppose, at once.
Cat&apos;s away, the mice will play. I remember looking in Pill lane. Also that
now is magnetism. At the back of everything, magnetism, attracting something.
Earth, for instance, pulling this and being pulled. That causes movement. And
time, well that&apos;s the time the movement takes. Then if one thing stopped
the whole ghesabo would stop bit by bit. Because it&apos;s all arranged.
Magnetic needle tells you what&apos;s going on in the sun, the stars. Little
piece of steel iron. When you hold out the fork. Come. Come. Tip. Woman and man,
that is. Fork and steel. Molly, he. Dress up and look and suggest and let you
see and see more and defy you if you&apos;re a man to see that and legs, look, look and. Tip. Have to let fly.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 47}</font>
<br> Wonder how is she feeling in that region. Shame all put on before third
person. Molly, her underjaw stuck out, head back about the farmer in the
ridingboots with the spurs. And when the painters were in Lombard street west.
Smell that I did. Like flowers. It was too. Violets. Came from the turpentine
probably in the paint. Make their own of everything. Same time doing it scraped
her slipper on the floor so they wouldn&apos;t hear. But lots of them can&apos;t
kick the beam, I think. Keep that thing up for hours. Kind of a general all round over me and half down my back.</p>
<p> Wait. Hm. Hm. Yes. That&apos;s her perfume. Why she waved her hand. I leave
you this to think of me when I&apos;m far away on the pillow. What is it?
Heliotrope? No. Hyacinth? Hm. Roses, I think. She&apos;d like scent of that
kind. Sweet and cheap: soon sour. Why Molly likes opoponax. Suits her, with a
little jessamine mixed. Her high notes and her low notes. At the dance night she
met him, dance of the hours. Heat brought it out. She was wearing her black and
it had the perfume of the last time. Good conductor, is it? Or bad? Light too.
Suppose there&apos;s some connection. For instance if you go into a cellar where
it&apos;s dark. Mysterious thing too. Why did I smell it only now?
<br><font color="green">{ms, 48}</font>
<br> Took its time like herself. Slow but sure. Suppose it&apos;s ever so many
millions of tiny grains blown across. Yes, it is. Because those spice islands,
Cinghalese this morning, smell them leagues off. Tell you what it is. It&apos;s
like a fine fine veil or web they have over the skin, fine like what do you call
it gossamer and
the<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps"><sub>unread</sub></span></font><a target="foot" id="foz0023">&ordm;</a>
always spinning it out of them, fine as anything, rainbow colours without
knowing it. Clings to everything she takes off. Vamp of her stockings. Warm
shoe. Stays. Drawers. Little kick taking them off. By by till next time. Also
the cat likes to sniff in her shift on the bed. Know her smell in a thousand.
Bathwater too. Reminds me of strawberries and cream. Wonder where it is really?
There or the armpits or under the neck. Because you get it out of all holes and
corners. Hyacinth perfume made of oil of ether or something. Muskrat. Bag under
their tails. Dogs at each other, behind. Good evening. Good evening. How do you
sniff? Hm. Hm. Very well, thank you. Animals go by that. Yes now, look at it
that way. We&apos;re the same. Some women, instance, warn you off when they have that. Come
<br><font color="green">{ms, 49}</font>
<br> near. Then get a hogo you could hang your hat on. Like what? Potted
herrings gone stale or. Boof! Please keep off the grass.</p>
<p> Perhaps they get a man smell off us. What though? Cigary gloves long John
had on his desk the other day. Breath? What you eat and drink gives that. No.
Mansmell, I mean. Must be connected with that because priests that are supposed
to are different. Women run round that like flies round treacle. O, father, will
you? Let me be the first to. That diffuses itself all through the body,
permeates. Source of life. And it&apos;s extremely curious the smell. Let me.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom inserted his nose. Hm. Into the. Hm. Opening of his waistcoat.
Almonds? Or no, lemons is it? Ah no, that&apos;s the soap.</p>
<p> O by the by that lotion. I knew there was something on my mind. I never went
back and the soap not paid. Two and nine bad opinion of me he&apos;ll have. Call
tomorrow. How much do I owe you? Three and nine? Two and nine, sir. Ah. Might
stop him giving credit. Lose your customers that ways. Pubs do. Fellows run up a
bill on the slate and then slinking around the back streets in to some other place.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 50}</font> </p>
<p> Here&apos;s this man passed before. Blown in from the bay. Just went as far
as turn back. Always at home at dinnertime. Looks mangled out: had a good tuck
in. Enjoying nature now. Grace after meals. After supper walk a mile. Sure he
has a small bank balance somewhere, government sit. Walk after him now make him
awkward like those newsboys me today. That&apos;s the way to find out. Ask
yourself who is he now. The Man on the Beach. Prize Story by Mr Leopold Bloom.
Payment at the rate of one guinea per column. And that fellow today at the
graveside in the mackintosh. Corns on his kismet however. Healthy perhaps absorb
all the. Whistle brings rain they say. Must be some somewhere. Salt in the
Ormond damp. The body feels the atmosphere. Old Betty&apos;s joints are on the
rack. Mother Shipton&apos;s prophecy that is about ships round the world in the
twinkling. No, signs of rain it is. The royal reader. And distant hills seem coming nigh.</p>
<p> Howth. Bailey light. Two, four, six, eight, nine. See. People afraid of the
dark. Also glowworms, cyclists: lighting up time. Jewels too, diamonds, flash better. Women. Light is a kind
<br><font color="green">{ms, 51}</font>
<br> of reassuring. Not going to hurt you. Better now of course than long ago.
Country roads. Run you through the small guts for nothing. Still two types there
are you bob against. Excuse me. Scowl or smile. Not at all. Best time to spray
flowers too in the shade after the sun. Were those nightclouds there all the
time? Land of the setting sun this. Homerule sun setting in the northeast. My native land, goodnight.</p>
<p> Dew falling. Bad for you, dear, to sit on that stone. Brings on white
fluxions. Might get piles myself. Sticks too like a summer cold, sore on the
mouth. Friction of the position. Like to be that rock she sat on. Also the
library today: those girl graduates: happy chairs under them. But it&apos;s the
evening influence. They feel all that. Open like flowers too, know their hours,
Jerusalem artichokes, sunflowers, in ballrooms, avenues under the lamps.
Nightstock in Mat Dillon&apos;s garden where I kissed her shoulder. June that
was too. I wooed. And now. The year returns. Sad about her
<a name="s13016a" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13016a">lame</a> of course but
must be on your guard not to feel too much pity. They take advantage.</p>
<p> All quiet on Howth
<br><font color="green">{ms, 52}</font>
<br> now. The distant hills seem. Where we. The rhododendrons. I am a fool
perhaps. He gets the plums and I the leavings. All that old hill has seen. Names
change. That&apos;s all. Lovers. Yum yum.</p>
<p> Tired I feel now. Drained all the manhood out of me, little wretch. She
kissed me. Never again. My youth. Only once it comes. Or hers. Take the train
there tomorrow. No. Returning not the same. Like kids your second visit to a
house. The new I want. Is there any? Care of P.O. Dolphin&apos;s barn. Are you
not happy in your? Naughty darling. At Dolphin&apos;s barn charades in Luke
Doyle&apos;s house. Mat Dillon and his bevy of daughters were there, Tiny, Atty,
Floey, Sara. Molly too. Eightyseven that was. Year before we. And the old major,
partial to his drop of spirits. Curious she an only child, I an only child. Now
it returns. Dolphin&apos;s barn. Think you&apos;re escaping and run into
yourself. Longest way round is the shortest way home. And just when she and he.
Circus horse walking in a ring. Rip van Winkle we played. Rip: tear in Henny
Doyle&apos;s overcoat. Van: breadvan delivering. Winkle: cockles and
periwinkles. Then I did Rip van Winkle coming back. She
<br><font color="green">{ms, 53}</font>
<br> leaned on the sideboard watching. Moorish eyes. Twenty years asleep. All
changed. Forgotten. The young are old now. His gun rusty from the dew.</p>
<p> Ba. What is that flying about? Swallow? Bat probably. Thinks I&apos;m a
tree, so blind. Metempsychosis. They believed you could be changed into one from
grief. Weeping willow. Ba. There he goes. Funny little beggar. Wonder where he
lives. Belfry up there Very likely. Hanging by the heels in the odour of
sanctity. Bell scared him out, I suppose. Mass seems to be over. Yes,
there&apos;s the light in the priest&apos;s house. Their frugal meal. Remember
about the mistake in the valuation when I was in Thom&apos;s. Twenty eight it
is. Two houses they have. Gabriel Conroy&apos;s brother is curate. Ba. Again.
Wonder why they come out at night like mice. They&apos;re a mixed breed. Birds
are like hopping mice. What frightens them, light or noise? Better sit still.
All instinct like the bird in drouth got water out of the end of a jar by
throwing in pebbles. Like a little man in a cloak he is with tiny hands. Weeny
bones. Almost see them shimmering, {glimmering,} kind of a bluey white. Colours
depend on the light you see. Instance, that cat this morning on the staircase
colour of brown turf. Howth a while ago amethyst. Glass flashing.
<a name="s13017t" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13017t">That&apos;s how that
wise man what&apos;s his name</a> with the
<a name="s13019b" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13019b">burning glass</a>.
<a name="s13017t" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13017t">Then the heather goes
on fire. It can&apos;t be tourists&apos; matches. What? Perhaps the sticks dry rub together in the wind and light.</a>
<br><font color="green">{ms, 54}</font> </p>
<p> Ba. Who knows what they&apos;re always flying for. Insects, birds? That bee
last week got into the room playing with his shadow on the ceiling. Birds too.
Never find out. Or what they say. Like our small talk.
<a name="s13017v" href="../../FF/unbs/s13all.htm#s13017v">And says he and says
she.</a> Nerve they have to fly over the ocean and back. Lots must be killed in
storms, telegraph wires. Dreadful life sailors have too. Big brutes of steamers
floundering along in the dark, lowing out like seacows. Faugh a ballagh! Out of
that, bloody curse to you! Other, in vessels, bit of a handkerchief sail,
pitched about like snuff at a wake when the stormy winds do blow. Married too.
Sometimes away for years at the ends of the earth somewhere. No ends really
because it&apos;s round. Wife in every port they say. She has a good job if she
minds it till Johnny comes marching home again. If ever he does. Smelling the
tail end of ports. How can they like the sea? Yet they do. The anchor&apos;s
weighed. Off he sails with a scapular or a medal on him for luck. Well. And the
tephilim poor papa&apos;s father had on his door to touch. That brought us out
of the land of Egypt and into the house of bondage. Something in all those
superstitions because when you go out never know what dangers. Hanging on to a
plank for grim life, lifebelt round him, gulping salt water, and that&apos;s the
last of his nibs till the sharks catch hold of him Do fish get seasick?</p>
<p> Then you have a
<br><font color="green">{ms, 55}</font>
<br> beautiful calm without a cloud, smooth sea, placid, crew and cargo in
smithereens, Davy Jones&apos; locker, moon looking down so peaceful. Not my fault, old cockalorum.</p>
<p> A lost long candle wandered up the sky from Mirus bazaar in aid of funds for
Mercer&apos;s hospital and broke, drooping, and shed a cluster of violet but one
white stars. They floated, fell: they faded. And among the elms a hoisted
lintstock lit the lamp at Leahy&apos;s terrace. By the screens of lighted
windows, by equal gardens a shrill voice went crying, wailing: Evening
Telegraph, extra edition. Result of the Gold Cup races: and from the door of
Dignam&apos;s house a boy ran out and called. Twittering the bat flew here, flew
there. Far out over the sands the coming surf crept, grey. Howth settled for
slumber, tired of long days, of yumyum rhododendrons (he was old) and felt
gladly the night breeze ruffle his many ferns. He lay but opened a red eye
unsleeping, deep and slowly breathing, slumberous but awake. And far on Kish
bank the anchored lightship twinkled, winked at Mr Bloom.</p>
<p> Life those chaps out there must have, stuck in the same spot. Irish Lights
board. Penance for their sins. Day we went out in the <u>Erin&apos;s King</u>,
throwing them the sack of old papers. Bears in the zoo. Filthy
<br><font color="green">{ms, 56}</font>
<br> trip. Drunkards out to shake up their livers. Puking overboard to feed the
herrings. And the women, fear of God in their faces. Milly, no sign of funk. Her
blue scarf loose, laughing. Don&apos;t know what death is at that age. And then
their stomachs clean. But being lost they fear. When we hid behind the tree at
Crumlin. I didn&apos;t want to. Mamma! Mamma! Frightening them with masks too.
Poor kids! Only troubles wildfire and nettlerash. Calomel purge I got for that.
After getting better, asleep with Molly. Very same teeth she has. What do they
love? Another themselves? But the morning she chased her with the umbrella.
Perhaps so as not to hurt. I felt her pulse. Ticking. Little hand it was: now
big. Dearest Papli. All that the hand says when you touch. Loved to count my
waistcoat buttons. Her first stays I remember. Made me laugh to see. Little paps
to begin with. Left one is more sensitive, I think. Mine too. Nearer the heart?
Her growing pains at night, calling, wakening me. Frightened she was when that,
her nature, came on her first. Poor child! Strange moment for the mother too!
Brings back her girlhood. Gibraltar. Looking from Buena Vista.
O&apos;Hara&apos;s tower. The seabirds screaming. Old barbary ape that gobbled
all his family. Sundown, gunfire, for the men to cross the lines. Looking out
over the sea she told me. Evening like this, but clear, no clouds. I always thought I&apos;d marry a lord or a
<br><font color="green">{ms, 57}</font>
<br> gentleman coming with a private yacht. Bue&ntilde;as noches,
se&ntilde;orita. El hombre ama la muchacha hormosa. Why me? Because you looked so foreign from the others.</p>
<p> Better not stick here all night like an oyster. This weather makes you dull.
Must be getting on for nine by the light. Go home. Too late for <u>Leah</u>.
<u>Lily of Killarney.</u> No. Might be still up. Call to the hospital to see.
Hope she&apos;s over. Long day I&apos;ve had. Martha, the bath, funeral, house
of Keyes, museum with those goddesses, Dedalus&apos; song. Then that bawler in
Barney Kiernan&apos;s. Got my own back there. Drunken ranters. Ought to go home
and laugh at themselves. Always want to be swilling in company. Afraid to be
alone like a child of two. Suppose he hit me: Look at it other way round. Not so
bad then. Perhaps not to hurt he meant. Three cheers for Israel. Three cheers
for the sister-in-law he hawked about, three fangs in her mouth. An extremely
nice cup of tea. Imagine that in the early morning. Every one to his taste as
Maurice said when he kissed the cow. But Dignam&apos;s put the boots on it.
Houses of mourning so depressing because you never know. Anyhow she wants the
money. Must call to the Scottish Widows as I promised. Strange name. Takes it
for granted we&apos;re going to pop off first. That widow on Monday was it outside Cramer&apos;s that looked at me.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 58}</font>
<br> Buried the poor husband but progressing favourably. Well? What do you
expect her to do? Must wheedle her way along. Widower I hate to see. Looks so
forlorn. Poor man O&apos;Connor wife and five children poisoned by mussels here.
The sewage. Hopeless. Some good motherly woman take him in tow, platter face and
a large apron. See him sometimes walking about, trying to find out who played
the trick. U.p: up. Fate that is. He, not me. Also a shop often noticed. Curse
seems to dog it. Dreamt last night? Wait. Something confused. She had red
slippers on. Turkish. Wore the breeches. Suppose she does? Would I like her in
pyjamas. Damned hard to answer. Nannetti&apos;s gone. Mailboat. Near Holyhead by
now. Must nail that ad of Keyes&apos;s. Work Hynes and Crawford. Petticoats for
Molly. She has something to put in them. What&apos;s that? Might be money.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom stooped and turned over a piece of paper on the sand. He brought it
near his eyes and peered. Letter? No. Can&apos;t read. Better go. Better.
I&apos;m tired to move. Page of an old copybook. Never know what you find.
Bottle with story of a treasure in it, thrown from a wreck. Parcels post.
Children always want to throw things in the sea. Trust? Bread cast on the waters. What&apos;s this? Bit of stick.</p>
<p> O! Exhausted that little female has me. Will she come here tomorrow? Will I?</p>
<p> Mr Bloom with his stick gently vexed the thick sand near his foot. Write a message here for her.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 59}</font>
<br> Might remain. What?</p>
<p> I.</p>
<p> Some flatfoot tramp on it in the morning. Useless. Tide comes here. Saw a
pool near her shoes. O, those transparent! Besides they don&apos;t know. What is
the meaning of that other world. I called you naughty darling because I do not like.</p>
<p> AM. A.</p>
<p> No room. Let it go.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom effaced the letters with his slow boot. Hopeless thing sand.
Nothing grows in it. All fades. No fear of big vessels coming up here. Except
Guinness&apos;s barges. Round the Kish in eighty days. Done half by design.</p>
<p> He flung his wooden pen away. The stick fell in silted sand, stuck. Now, if
you were trying to do that for a week on end you couldn&apos;t. Chance?
We&apos;ll never meet again. But it was lovely. Goodbye, dear. Made me fear so young.</p>
<p> Short snooze now if I had. And he can do the other. Did too. And Belfast. I
won&apos;t go. Let him. Just close my eyes a moment. Won&apos;t sleep, though.
Bat again. No harm in him. Just a few.</p>
