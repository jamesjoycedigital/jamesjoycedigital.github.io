<p> The summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysterious embrace.
Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of all too fleeting
day lingered lovingly on sea and strand, on the proud promontory of dear old
Howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay, on the weedgrown rocks along
Sandymount shore and, last but not least, on the quiet church whence there
streamed forth at times upon the stillness the voice of prayer to her who is in
her pure radiance a beacon ever to the stormtossed heart of man, Mary, star of the sea.</p>
<p> The three girl friends were seated on the rocks, enjoying the evening scene
and the air which was fresh but not too chilly. Many a time and oft were they
wont to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy chat beside the
sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine, Cissy Caffrey and Edy Boardman
with the baby in the pushcar and Tommy and Jacky Caffrey, two little curlyheaded
boys, dressed in sailor suits with caps to match and the name <i>H.M.S.
Belleisle</i> printed on both. For Tommy and Jacky Caffrey were twins, scarce
four years old and very noisy and spoiled twins sometimes but for all that
darling little fellows with bright merry faces and endearing ways about them.
They were dabbling in the sand with their spades and buckets, building castles
as children do, or playing with their big coloured ball, happy as the day was
long. And Edy Boardman was rocking the chubby baby to and fro in the pushcar
while that young gentleman fairly chuckled with delight. He was but eleven
months and nine days old and, though still a tiny toddler, was just beginning to lisp his first babyish words. Cissy
<br><font color="green">{u21, 386}</font>
<br> Caffrey bent over to him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty dimple in his chin.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Now, baby, Cissy Caffrey said. Say out big, big. I want a drink of water.

<p> And baby prattled after her:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A jink a jink a jawbo.</p>
<p> Cissy Caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of children, so
patient with little sufferers and Tommy Caffrey could never be got to take his
castor oil unless it was Cissy Caffrey that held his nose and promised him the
scatty heel of the loaf or brown bread with golden syrup on. What a persuasive
power that girl had! But to be sure baby was as good as gold, a perfect little
dote in his new fancy bib. None of your spoilt beauties, Flora MacFlimsy sort,
was Cissy Caffrey. A truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life, always
with a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her cherryripe red
lips, a girl lovable in the extreme. And Edy Boardman laughed too at the quaint language of little brother.</p>
<p> But just then there was a slight altercation between Master Tommy and Master
Jacky. Boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception to this golden
rule. The apple of discord was a certain castle of sand which Master Jacky had
built and Master Tommy would have it right go wrong that it was to be
architecturally improved by a frontdoor like the Martello tower had. But if
Master Tommy was headstrong Master Jacky was selfwilled too and, true to the
maxim that every little Irishman&apos;s house is his castle, he fell upon his
hated rival and to such purpose that the wouldbe assailant came to grief and
(alas to relate!) the coveted castle too. Needless to say the cries of
discomfited Master Tommy drew the attention of the girl friends.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Come here, Tommy, his sister called imperatively, at once!
And you, Jacky, for shame to throw poor Tommy in the dirty sand. Wait till I catch you for that.</p>
<p> His eyes misty with unshed tears Master Tommy came at her call for their big
sister&apos;s word was law with the twins. And in a sad plight he was after his
misadventure. His little man-o&apos;-war top and
<br><font color="green">{u21, 387}</font>
<br> unmentionables were full of sand but Cissy was a past mistress in the art
of smoothing over life&apos;s tiny troubles and very quickly not one speck of
sand was to be seen on his smart little suit. Still the blue eyes were
glistening with hot tears that would well up so she kissed away the hurtness and
shook her hand at Master Jacky the culprit and said if she was near him she
wouldn&apos;t be far from him, her eyes dancing in admonition.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Nasty bold Jacky! she cried.</p>
<p> She put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What&apos;s your name? Butter and cream?
<br><font color="green">{u22, 333}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Tell us who is your sweetheart, spoke Edy Boardman. Is Cissy your sweetheart?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Nao, tearful Tommy said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Is Edy Boardman your sweetheart? Cissy queried.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Nao, Tommy said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I know, Edy Boardman said none too amiably with an arch
glance from her shortsighted eyes. I know who is Tommy&apos;s sweetheart. Gerty is Tommy&apos;s sweetheart.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Nao, Tommy said on the verge of tears.</p>
<p> Cissy&apos;s quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to Edy
Boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman couldn&apos;t
see and to mind he didn&apos;t wet his new tan shoes.</p>
<p> But who was Gerty?</p>
<p> Gerty MacDowell who was seated near her companions, lost in thought, gazing
far away into the distance was in very truth as fair a specimen of winsome Irish
girlhood as one could wish to see. She was pronounced beautiful by all who knew
her though, as folks often said, she was more a Giltrap than a MacDowell. Her
figure was slight and graceful, inclining even to fragility but those iron
jelloids she had been taking of late had done her a world of good much better
than the Widow Welch&apos;s female pills and she was much better of those
discharges she used to get and that tired feeling. The waxen pallor of her face
was almost spiritual in its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth was a
genuine Cupid&apos;s bow, Greekly perfect. Her hands were of
<br><font color="green">{u21, 388}</font>
<br> finely veined alabaster with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice
and queen of ointments could make them though it was not true that she used to
wear kid gloves in bed or take a milk footbath either. Bertha Supple told that
once to Edy Boardman, a deliberate lie, when she was black out at daggers drawn
with Gerty (the girl chums had of course their little tiffs from time to time
like the rest of mortals) and she told her not to let on whatever she did that
it was her that told her or she&apos;d never speak to her again. No. Honour
where honour is due. There was an innate refinement, a languid queenly
<i>hauteur</i> about Gerty which was unmistakably evidenced in her delicate
hands and higharched instep. Had kind fate but willed her to be born a
gentlewoman of high degree in her own right and had she only received the
benefit of a good education Gerty MacDowell might easily have held her own
beside any lady in the land and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels
on her brow and patrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their devoirs to
<br><font color="green">{u22, 334}</font>
<br> her. Mayhap it was this, the love that might have been, that lent to her
softlyfeatured face at whiles a look, tense with suppressed meaning, that
imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful eyes, a charm few could
resist. Why have women such eyes of witchery? Gerty&apos;s were of the bluest
Irish blue, set off by lustrous lashes and dark expressive brows. Time was when
those brows were not so silkily seductive. It was Madame Vera Verity, directress
of the Woman Beautiful page of the Princess novelette, who had first advised her
to try eyebrowleine which gave that haunting expression to the eyes, so becoming
in leaders of fashion, and she had never regretted it. Then there was blushing
scientifically cured and how to be tall increase your height and you have a
beautiful face but your nose? That would suit Mrs Dignam because she had a
button one. But Gerty&apos;s crowning glory was her wealth of wonderful hair. It
was dark brown with a natural wave in it. She had cut it that very morning on
account of the new moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion of
luxuriant clusters and pared her nails too, Thursday for wealth. And just now at
Edy&apos;s words as a telltale flush, delicate as the faintest rosebloom, crept
into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her
<br><font color="green">{u21, 389}</font>
<br> sweet girlish shyness that of a surety God&apos;s fair land of Ireland did not hold her equal.</p>
<p> For an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes. She was about
to retort but something checked the words on her tongue. Inclination prompted
her to speak out: dignity told her to be silent. The pretty lips pouted awhile
but then she glanced up and broke out into a joyous little laugh which had in it
all the freshness of a young May morning. She knew right well, no-one better,
what made squinty Edy say that because of him cooling in his attentions when it
was simply a lover&apos;s quarrel. As per usual somebody&apos;s nose was out of
joint about the boy that had the bicycle always riding up and down in front of
her window. Only now his father kept him in in the evenings studying hard to get
an exhibition in the intermediate that was on and he was going to Trinity
college to study for a doctor when he left the high school like his brother
W.&nbsp;E. Wylie who was racing in the bicycle races in Trinity college
university. Little recked he perhaps for what she felt, that dull aching void in
her heart sometimes, piercing to the core. Yet he was young and perchance he
might learn to love her in time. They were protestants in his family and of
course Gerty knew Who came first and after Him the blessed Virgin and then Saint
Joseph. But he was undeniably handsome with an exquisite nose and he was what he
looked, every inch a gentleman, the shape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would know anywhere
<br><font color="green">{u22, 335}</font>
<br> something off the common and the way he turned the bicycle at the lamp with
his hands off the bars and also the nice perfume of those good cigarettes and
besides they were both of a size and that was why Edy Boardman thought she was
so frightfully clever because he didn&apos;t go and ride up and down in front of her bit of a garden.</p>
<p> Gerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of Dame
Fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be out. A neat
blouse of electric blue, selftinted by dolly dyes (because it was expected in
the <i>Lady&apos;s Pictorial</i> that electric blue would be worn), with a smart
vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocket (in which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her
<br><font color="green">{u21, 390}</font>
<br> favourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit) and a navy
threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful figure to
perfection. She wore a coquettish little love of a hat of wideleaved nigger
straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggblue chenille and at the side a
butterfly bow to tone. All Tuesday week afternoon she was hunting to match that
chenille but at last she found what she wanted at Clery&apos;s summer sales, the
very it, slightly shopsoiled but you would never notice, seven fingers two and a
penny. She did it up all by herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on
then, smiling at the lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to her! And
when she put it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew that that would take
the shine out of some people she knew. Her shoes were the newest thing in
footwear (Edy Boardman prided herself that she was very <i>petite</i> but she
never had a foot like Gerty MacDowell, a five, and never would ash, oak or elm)
with patent toecaps and just one smart buckle at her higharched instep. Her
wellturned ankle displayed its perfect proportions beneath her skirt and just
the proper amount and no more of her shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with
highspliced heels and wide garter tops. As for undies they were Gerty&apos;s
chief care and who that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen
(though Gerty would never see seventeen again) can find it in his heart to blame
her? She had four dinky sets with awfully pretty stitchery, three garments and
nighties extra, and each set slotted with different coloured ribbons, rosepink,
pale blue, mauve and peagreen and she aired them herself and blued them when
they came home from the wash and ironed them and she had a brickbat to keep the
iron on because she wouldn&apos;t trust those washerwomen as far as she&apos;d
see them scorching the things. She was wearing the blue for luck, hoping against
hope, her own colour and the lucky colour too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on
<br><font color="green">{u22, 336}</font>
<br> her because the green she wore that day week brought grief because his
father brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and because she
thought perhaps he might be out because when she was dressing that morning she
nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside out and that was for
<br><font color="green">{u21, 391}</font>
<br> luck and lovers&apos; meeting if you put those things on inside out so long as it wasn&apos;t of a Friday.</p>
<p> And yet &mdash; and yet! That strained look on her face! A gnawing sorrow is
there all the time. Her very soul is in her eyes and she would give worlds to be
in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where, giving way to tears, she could
have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelings though not too much because she
knew how to cry nicely before the mirror. You are lovely, Gerty, it said. The
paly light of evening falls upon a face infinitely sad and wistful. Gerty
MacDowell yearns in vain. Yes, she had known from the first that her daydream of
a marriage has been arranged and the weddingbells ringing for Mrs Reggy Wylie
T.C.D. (because the one who married the elder brother would be Mrs Wylie) and in
the fashionable intelligence Mrs Gertrude Wylie was wearing a sumptuous
confection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox was not to be. He was too
young to understand. He would not believe in love, a woman&apos;s birthright.
The night of the party long ago in Stoer&apos;s (he was still in short trousers)
when they were alone and he stole an arm round her waist she went white to the
very lips. He called her little one in a strangely husky voice and snatched a
half kiss (the first!) but it was only the end of her nose and then he hastened
from the room with a remark about refreshments. Impetuous fellow! Strength of
character had never been Reggy Wylie&apos;s strong point and he who would woo
and win Gerty MacDowell must be a man among men. But waiting, always waiting to
be asked and it was leap year too and would soon be over. No prince charming is
her beau ideal to lay a rare and wondrous love at her feet but rather a manly
man with a strong quiet face who had not found his ideal, perhaps his hair
slightly flecked with grey, and who would understand, take her in his sheltering
arms, strain her to him in all the strength of his deep passionate nature and
comfort her with a long long kiss. It would be like heaven. For such a one she
yearns this balmy summer eve. With all the heart of her she longs to be his
only, his affianced bride for riches for poor, in sickness in health, till death
us two part, from this to this day forward.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 392}</font> </p>
<p> And while Edy Boardman was with little Tommy behind the pushcar she was just
thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself
<br><font color="green">{u22, 337}</font>
<br> his little wife to be. Then they could talk about her
<font color="red"><sup><small>|9</small></sup></font><font color="black">till
they <a name="un4041cc" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4041cc">went blue in
the face</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>9|</small></sup></font>, Bertha
Supple too, and Edy, the spitfire, because she would be twentytwo in November.
She would care for him with creature comforts too for Gerty was womanly wise and
knew that a mere man liked that feeling of homeyness. Her griddlecakes done to a
goldenbrown hue and queen Ann&apos;s pudding of delightful creaminess had won
golden opinions from all because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a fire,
dredge in the fine flour and always stir in the same direction then cream the
milk and sugar and whisk well the white of eggs though she didn&apos;t like the
eating part when there were any people that made her shy and often she wondered
why you couldn&apos;t eat something poetical like violets or roses and they
would have a beautifully appointed drawingroom with pictures and engravings and
the photograph of grandpapa Giltrap&apos;s lovely dog Garryowen that almost
talked it was so human and chintz covers for the chairs and that silver
toastrack in Clery&apos;s summer jumble sales like they have in rich houses. He
would be tall with broad shoulders (she had always admired tall men for a
husband) with glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed sweeping
moustache and
<font color="red"><sup><small>|9</small></sup></font><font color="black">they
would go on the continent for their honeymoon
(<a name="un4047be" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4047be">three wonderful
weeks!</a>) and then when they settled down in a nice snug and cosy little
homely house</font><font color="red"><sup><small>9|</small></sup></font> every
morning they would both have brekky simple but perfectly served for their own
two selves and before he went out to business he would give his dear little
wifey a good hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyes.</p>
<p> Edy Boardman asked Tommy Caffrey was he done and he said yes so then she
buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run off and play
with Jacky and to be good and not to fight. But Tommy said he wanted the ball
and Edy told him no that baby was playing with the ball and if he took it
there&apos;d be wigs on the green but Tommy said it was his ball his ball and he
wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground, if you please. The temper of him! O, he was
<br><font color="green">{u21, 393}</font>
<br> a man already was little Tommy Caffrey since he was out of pinnies. Edy
told him no, no and to be off now with him and she told Cissy Caffrey not to give in to him.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You&apos;re not my sister, naughty Tommy said. It&apos;s my ball.</p>
<p> But Cissy Caffrey told baby Boardman to look up, look up high at her finger
and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand and Tommy after it in full career, having won the day.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Anything for a quiet life, laughed Ciss.</p>
<p> And she tickled tiny tot&apos;s two cheeks to make him forget and played here&apos;s
<br><font color="green">{u22, 338}</font>
<br> the lord mayor, here&apos;s his two horses, here&apos;s his gingerbread
carriage and here he walks in, chinchopper, chinchopper, chinchopper chin. But
Edy got as cross as two sticks about his getting his own way like that from everyone always petting him.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I&apos;d like to give him something, she said, so I would, where I won&apos;t say.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; On the beeoteetom, laughed Cissy merrily.</p>
<p> Gerty MacDowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of Cissy saying
an unladylike thing like that out loud she&apos;d be ashamed of her life to say,
flushing a deep rosy red, and Edy Boardman said she was sure the gentleman
opposite heard what she said. But not a pin cared Ciss.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Let him! she said with a pert toss of her head and a
piquant tilt of her nose. Give it to him too on the same place as quick as I&apos;d look at him.</p>
<p> Madcap Ciss with her golliwog curls. You had to laugh at her sometimes. For
instance when she asked you would you have some more Chinese tea and jaspberry
ram and when she drew the jugs too and the men&apos;s faces on her nails with
red ink make you split your sides or when
<font color="red"><sup><small>|9</small></sup></font><font color="black">she
wanted to go <a name="un5005h" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5005h">where you
know</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>9|</small></sup></font> she said
she wanted to run and pay a visit to the miss white. That was just like
Cissycums. O, and will you ever forget the evening she dressed up in her
father&apos;s suit and hat and the burned cork moustache and walked down
Tritonville road, smoking a cigarette. There was none to come up to her for fun.
But she was sincerity itself, one of the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever
made, not one of your twofaced things, too sweet to be wholesome.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 394}</font> </p>
<p> And then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the pealing
anthem of the organ. It was the men&apos;s temperance retreat conducted by the
missioner, the reverend John Hughes S.J., rosary, sermon and benediction of the
Most Blessed Sacrament. They were there gathered together without distinction of
social class (and a most edifying spectacle it was to see) in that simple fane
beside the waves after the storms of this weary world, kneeling before the feet
of the immaculate, reciting the litany of Our Lady of Loreto, beseeching her to
intercede for them, the old familiar words, holy Mary, holy virgin of virgins.
How sad to poor Gerty&apos;s ears! Had her father only avoided the clutches of
the demon drink by taking the pledge or those powders the drink habit cured in
Pearson&apos;s Weekly she might now be rolling in her carriage, second to none.
Over and over had she told herself that as she mused by the dying embers in a
brown study without the lamp because she hated
<br><font color="green">{u22, 339}</font>
<br> two lights or oftentimes gazing out of the window dreamily by the hour at
the rain falling on the rusty bucket, thinking. But that vile decoction which
has ruined so many hearths and homes had cast its shadow over her childhood
days. Nay, she had even witnessed in the home circle deeds of violence caused by
intemperance and had seen her own father, a prey to the fumes of intoxication,
forget himself completely for if there was one thing of all things that Gerty
knew it was that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way of
kindness deserves to be branded as the lowest of the low.</p>
<p> And still the voices sang in supplication to the Virgin most powerful,
Virgin most merciful. And Gerty, wrapt in thought, scarce saw or heard her
companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman off Sandymount
green that Cissy Caffrey called the man that was so like himself passing along
the strand taking a short walk. You never saw him anyway screwed but still and
for all that she would not like him for a father because he was too old or
something or on account of his face (it was a palpable case of doctor Fell) or
his carbuncly nose with the pimples on it and his sandy moustache a bit white
under his nose. Poor father! With all his faults she loved him still when he
sang <i>Tell me, Mary, how to woo thee</i> or <i>My love and cottage
<br><font color="green">{u21, 395}</font>
<br> near Rochelle</i> and they had stewed cockles and lettuce with salad
dressing for supper and when he sang <i>The moon hath raised</i> with Mr Dignam
that died suddenly and was buried, God have mercy on him, from a stroke. Her
mother&apos;s birthday that was and Charley was home on his holidays and Tom and
Mr Dignam and Mrs and Patsy and Freddy Dignam and they were to have had a group
taken. No-one would have thought the end was so near. Now he was laid to rest.
And her mother said to him to let that be a warning to him for the rest of his
days and he couldn&apos;t even go to the funeral on account of the gout and she
had to go into town to bring him the letters and samples from his office about
Catesby&apos;s cork lino, artistic, standard designs, fit for a palace, gives
tiptop wear and always bright and cheery in the home.</p>
<p> A sterling good daughter was Gerty just like a second mother in the house, a
ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in gold. And when her
mother had those raging splitting headaches who was it rubbed on the menthol
cone on her forehead but Gerty though she didn&apos;t like her mother taking
pinches of snuff and that was the only single thing they ever had words about,
taking snuff. Everyone thought the world of her for her gentle ways. It was
Gerty who turned off the gas at the main every night and it was Gerty
<br><font color="green">{u22, 340}</font>
<br> who tacked up on the wall of that place where she never forgot every
fortnight the chlorate of lime Mr Tunney the grocer&apos;s christmas almanac the
picture of halcyon days where a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear
then with a threecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his ladylove
with oldtime chivalry through her lattice window. You could see there was a
story behind it. The colours were done something lovely. She was in a soft
clinging white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in chocolate and he
looked a thorough aristocrat. She often looked at them dreamily when she went
there for a certain purpose and thought about those times because she had found
out in Walker&apos;s pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa Giltrap
about the halcyon days what they meant.</p>
<p> The twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly
<br><font color="green">{u21, 396}</font>
<br> fashion, till at last Master Jacky who was really as bold as brass there
was no getting behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he could
down towards the seaweedy rocks. Needless to say poor Tommy was not slow to
voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was sitting there by
himself came to the rescue and intercepted the ball. Our two champions claimed
their plaything with lusty cries and to avoid trouble Cissy Caffrey called to
the gentleman to throw it to her please. The gentleman aimed the ball once or
twice and then threw it up the strand towards Cissy Caffrey but it rolled down
the slope and stopped right under Gerty&apos;s skirt near the little pool by the
rock. The twins clamoured again for it and Cissy told her to kick it away and
let them fight for it it so Gerty drew back her foot but she wished their stupid
ball hadn&apos;t come rolling down to her and she gave a kick but she missed and Edy and Cissy laughed.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; If you fail try again, Edy Boardman said.</p>
<p> Gerty smiled assent and bit her lip. A delicate pink crept into her pretty
cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted her skirt a
little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a jolly good kick and
it went ever so far and the two twins after it down towards the shingle. Pure
jealousy of course it was nothing else to draw attention on account of the
gentleman opposite looking. She felt the warm flush, a danger signal always with
Gerty MacDowell, surging and flaming into her cheeks. Till then they had only
exchanged glances of the most casual but now under the brim of her new hat she
ventured a look at him and the face that met her gaze there in the twilight, wan
and strangely drawn, seemed to her the saddest she had ever seen.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 341}</font> </p>
<p> Through the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted and
with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain of original
sin, spiritual vessel, pray for us, honourable vessel, pray for us, vessel of
singular devotion, pray for us, mystical rose. And careworn hearts were there
and toilers for their daily bread and many who had erred and wandered, their
eyes wet with contrition but for all that bright with hope for the reverend
father Hughes had told them what the great saint Bernard said in his famous prayer
<br><font color="green">{u21, 397}</font>
<br> of Mary, the most pious Virgin&apos;s intercessory power that it was not
recorded in any age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever abandoned by her.</p>
<p> The twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of childhood
are but as passing summer showers. Cissy played with baby Boardman till he
crowed with glee, clapping baby hands in air. Peep she cried behind the hood of
the pushcar and Edy asked where was Cissy gone and then Cissy popped up her head
and cried ah! and, my word, didn&apos;t the little chap enjoy that! And then she told him to say papa.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Say papa, baby. Say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa.</p>
<p> And baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for eleven
months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of health, a perfect
little bunch of love, and he would certainly turn out to be something great, they said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Haja ja ja haja.</p>
<p> Cissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to sit up
properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried out, holy saint
Denis, that he was possing wet and to double the half blanket the other way
under him. Of course his infant majesty was most obstreperous at such toilet
formalities and he let everyone know it:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa.</p>
<p> And two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks. It was all no
use soothering him with no, nono, baby, no and telling him about the geegee and
where was the puffpuff but Ciss, always readywitted, gave him in his mouth the
teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen was quickly appeased.</p>
<p> Gerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out of
that and not get on her nerves, no hour to be out, and the little brats of
twins. She gazed out towards the distant sea. It was like the paintings that man
used to do on the pavement with all the coloured chalks
<font color="red"><sup><small>|9</small></sup></font><font color="black">and
such a pity too leaving them there to be all blotted
out,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>9|</small></sup></font> the evening and the clouds coming
<br><font color="green">{u22, 342}</font>
<br> out and the Bailey light on Howth
<br><font color="green">{u21, 398}</font>
<br> and to hear the music like that and the perfume of those incense they
burned in the church like a kind of waft. And while she gazed her heart went
pitapat. Yes, it was her he was looking at and there was meaning in his look.
His eyes burned into her as though they would search her through and through,
read her very soul. Wonderful eyes they were, superbly expressive, but could you
trust them? People were so queer. She could see at once by his dark eyes and his
pale intellectual face that he was a foreigner the image of the photo she had of
Martin Harvey, the matin&eacute;e idol, only for the moustache which she
preferred because she wasn&apos;t stagestruck like
<font color="red"><sup><small>|9</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Winnie</span></span>
<font color="black">Winny</font><font color="red"><sup><small>9|</small></sup></font>
Rippingham that wanted they two to always dress the same on account of a play
but she could not see whether he had an aquiline nose or a slightly
<i>retrouss&eacute;</i> from where he was sitting. He was in deep mourning, she
could see that, and the story of a haunting sorrow was written on his face. She
would have given worlds to know what it was. He was looking up so intently, so
still and he saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel
buckles of her shoes if she swung them like that thoughtfully with the toes
down. She was glad that something told her to put on the transparent stockings
thinking Reggy Wylie might be out but that was far away. Here was that of which
she had so often dreamed. It was he who mattered and there was joy on her face
because she wanted him because she felt instinctively that he was like no-one
else. The very heart of the girlwoman went out to him, her
dreamhusband<font color="red"><sup><small>|9</small></sup></font><font color="black">,<a target="foot" id="foo0067">&ordm;</a>
because <a name="un5005k" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5005k">she knew</a>
on the instant <a name="un5005k" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5005k">it was
him</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>9|</small></sup></font>. If he had
suffered, more sinned against than sinning, or even, even, if he had been
himself a sinner, a wicked man, she cared not. Even if he was a protestant or
methodist she could convert him easily if he truly loved her. There were wounds
that wanted healing with heartbalm. She was a womanly woman not like other
flighty girls, unfeminine he had known, those cyclists showing off what they
hadn&apos;t got and she just yearned to know all, to forgive all if she could
make him fall in love with her, make him forget the memory of the past. Then
mayhap he would embrace her gently, like a real man, crushing her soft body to
him, and love her, his ownest girlie, for herself alone.

<p> Refuge of sinners. Comfortress of the afflicted. <i>Ora pro nobis</i>. Well
has it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy can never
be lost or cast away: and fitly is she too a haven of refuge for the afflicted
because of the seven dolours which transpierced her own heart. Gerty could
picture the whole scene in the church, the stained glass windows lighted up, the
candles, the flowers and the blue banners of the blessed Virgin&apos;s sodality and Father
<br><font color="green">{u22, 343}</font>
<br> Conroy was helping Canon O&apos;Hanlon at the altar, carrying things in and
out with his eyes cast down. He looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was
so quiet and clean and dark and his hands were just like white wax and if ever
she became a Dominican nun in their white habit perhaps he might come to the
convent for the novena of Saint Dominic. He told her that time when she told him
about that in confession crimsoning up to the roots of her hair for fear he
could see, not to be troubled because that was only the voice of nature and we
were all subject to nature&apos;s laws, he said, in this life and that that was
no sin because that came from the nature of woman instituted by God, he said,
and that Our Blessed Lady herself said to the archangel Gabriel be it done unto
me according to Thy Word. He was so kind and holy and often and often she
thought and thought could she work a ruched teacosy with embroidered floral
design for him as a present or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the
mantelpiece white and gold with a canarybird that came out of a little house to
tell the time the day she went there about the flowers for the forty hours&apos;
adoration because it was hard to know what sort of a present to give or perhaps
an album of illuminated views of Dublin or some place.</p>
<p> The exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and Jacky
threw the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it. Little monkeys
common as ditchwater. Someone ought to take them and give them a good hiding for
themselves to keep them in their places, the both of them. And Cissy and Edy
shouted after them to come back because they were afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Jacky! Tommy!
<br><font color="green">{u21, 400}</font> </p>
<p> Not they! What a great notion they had! So Cissy said it was the very last
time she&apos;d ever bring them out. She jumped up and called them and then she
ran down the slope past him, tossing her hair behind her which had a good enough
colour if there had been more of it but with all the thingamerry she was always
rubbing into it she couldn&apos;t get it to grow long because it wasn&apos;t
natural so she could just go and throw her hat at it. She ran with long gandery
strides it was a wonder she didn&apos;t rip up her skirt at the side that was
too tight on her because there was a lot of the tomboy about Cissy Caffrey and
she was a forward piece whenever she thought she had a good opportunity to show
off and just because she was a good runner she ran like that so that he could
see all the end of her petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as
possible. It would have served her just right if she had tripped up over
something accidentally on purpose with her high crooked French heels on her to make her look tall and
<br><font color="green">{u22, 344}</font>
<br> got a fine tumble. <i>Tableau!</i> That would have been a very charming
expos&eacute; for a gentleman like that to witness.</p>
<p> Queen of angels, queen of patriarchs, queen of prophets, of all saints, they
prayed, queen of the most holy rosary and then Father Conroy handed the thurible
to Canon O&apos;Hanlon and he put in the incense and censed the blessed
sacrament and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and she was itching to give
them a ringing good clip on the ear but she didn&apos;t because she thought he
might be watching but she never made a bigger mistake in her life because Gerty
could see without looking that he never took his eyes off of her and then Canon
O&apos;Hanlon handed the thurible back to Father Conroy and knelt down looking
up at the blessed sacrament and the choir began to sing <i>Tantum ergo</i> and
she just swung her foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to the
<i>Tantumer gosa cramen tum</i>. Three and eleven she paid for those stockings
in Sparrow&apos;s of George&apos;s street on the Tuesday, no the Monday before
Easter and there wasn&apos;t a brack on them and that was what he was looking
at, transparent, and not at her insignificant ones that had neither shape nor
form (the cheek of her!) because he had eyes in his head to see the difference for himself.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 401}</font> </p>
<p> Cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with her
hat anyhow on her on one side after her run and she did look a streel tugging
the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought only a fortnight before
like a rag on her back and a bit of her petticoat hanging like a caricature.
Gerty just took off her hat for a moment to settle her hair and a prettier, a
daintier head of nutbrown tresses was never seen on a girl&apos;s shoulders
&mdash; a radiant little vision, in sooth, almost maddening in its sweetness.
You would have to travel many a long mile before you found a head of hair the
like of that. She could almost see the swift answering flash of admiration in
his eyes that set her tingling in every nerve. She put on her hat so that she
could see from underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster for her
breath caught as she caught the expression in his eyes. He was eying her as a
snake eyes its prey. Her woman&apos;s instinct told her that she had raised the
devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet swept from throat to brow till
the lovely colour of her face became a glorious rose.</p>
<p> Edy Boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at Gerty, half
smiling, with her specs, like an old maid, pretending to nurse the baby.
Irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was why no-one could
get on with her, poking her nose into what was no concern of hers. And she said to Gerty:
<br><font color="green">{u22, 345}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A penny for your thoughts.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What? replied Gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest
of teeth. I was only wondering was it late.</p>
<p> Because she wished to goodness they&apos;d take the snottynosed twins and
their baby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just gave a
gentle hint about its being late. And when Cissy came up Edy asked her the time
and Miss Cissy, as glib as you like, said it was half past kissing time, time to
kiss again. But Edy wanted to know because they were told to be in early.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Wait, said Cissy, I&apos;ll ask my uncle Peter over there
what&apos;s the time by his conundrum.</p>
<p> So over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his hand
out of his pocket, getting nervous, and beginning to play
<br><font color="green">{u21, 402}</font>
<br> with his watchchain, looking at the church. Passionate nature though he was
Gerty could see that he had enormous control over himself. One moment he had
been there, fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze, and the next moment
it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman, selfcontrol expressed in every line of his distinguishedlooking figure.</p>
<p> Cissy said to excuse her would he mind telling her what was the right time
and Gerty could see him taking out his watch listening to it and looking up and
clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry his watch was stopped but he
thought it must be after eight because the sun was set. His voice had a cultured
ring in it and though he spoke in measured accents there was a suspicion of a
quiver in the mellow tones. Cissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out
and said uncle said his waterworks were out of order.</p>
<p> Then they sang the second verse of the <i>Tantum ergo</i> and Canon
O&apos;Hanlon got up again and censed the blessed sacrament and knelt down and
he told Father Conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire to the
flowers and Father Conroy got up and settled it all right and she could see the
gentleman winding his watch and listening to the works and she swung her leg
more in and out in time. It was getting darker but he could see and he was
looking all the time that he was winding the watch or whatever he was doing to
it and then he put it back and put his hands back into his pockets. She felt a
kind of a sensation rushing all over her and she knew by the feel of her scalp
and that irritation against her stays that that thing must be coming on because
the last time too was when she clipped her hair on account of the moon. His dark
eyes fixed themselves on her again, drinking in her every contour,
<br><font color="green">{u22, 346}</font>
<br> literally worshipping at her shrine. If ever there was undisguised
admiration in a man&apos;s passionate gaze it was there plain to be seen on that
man&apos;s face. It is for you, Gertrude MacDowell, and you know it.</p>
<p> Edy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and Gerty noticed
that that little hint she gave had the desired effect because it was a long way
along the strand to where there was the place to push up the pushcar and Cissy
took off the twins&apos; caps and tidied their
<br><font color="green">{u21, 403}</font>
<br> hair to make herself attractive of course and Canon O&apos;Hanlon stood up
with his cope poking up at his neck and Father Conroy handed him the card to
read off and he read out <i>Panem de coelo praestitisti eis</i> and Edy and
Cissy were talking about the time all the time and asking her but Gerty could
pay them back in their own coin and she just answered with scathing politeness
when Edy asked her was she heartbroken about her best boy throwing her over.
Gerty winced sharply. A brief cold blaze shone from her eyes that spoke volumes
of scorn immeasurable. It hurt &mdash; O yes, it cut deep because Edy had her
own quiet way of saying things like that she knew would wound like the
confounded little cat she was. Gerty&apos;s lips parted swiftly to frame the
word but she fought back the sob that rose to her throat, so slim, so flawless,
so beautifully moulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of. She had
loved him better than he knew. Lighthearted deceiver and fickle like all his sex
he would never understand what he had meant to her and for an instant there was
in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears. Their eyes were probing her
mercilessly but with a brave effort she sparkled back in sympathy as she glanced
at her new conquest for them to see.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O, responded Gerty, quick as lightning, laughing, and the
proud head flashed up. I can throw my cap at who I like because it&apos;s leap year.</p>
<p> Her words rang out crystalclear, more musical than the cooing of the
ringdove but they cut the silence icily. There was that in her young voice that
told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with. As for Mr Reggy with his
swank and his bit of money she could just chuck him aside as if he was so much
filth and never again would she cast as much as a second thought on him and tear
his silly postcard into a dozen pieces. And if ever after he dared to presume
she could give him one look of measured scorn that would make him shrivel up on
the spot. Miss puny little Edy&apos;s countenance fell to no slight extent and
Gerty could see by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a
towering rage though she hid it, the little kinnatt, because that shaft had
struck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was something
aloof, apart, in another sphere, that she was
<br><font color="green">{u21, 404}</font>
<br> not of them and never would be and there
<br><font color="green">{u22, 347}</font>
<br> was somebody else too that knew it and saw it so they could put that in their pipe and smoke it.</p>
<p> Edy straightened up baby Boardman to get ready to go and Cissy tucked in the
ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because the sandman was
on his way for Master Boardman junior and Cissy told him too that Billy Winks
was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and baby looked just too ducky,
laughing up out of his gleeful eyes, and Cissy poked him like that out of fun in
his wee fat tummy and baby, without as much as by your leave, sent up his
compliments to all and sundry on to his brand new dribbling bib.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O my! Puddeny pie! protested Ciss. He has his bib destroyed.</p>
<p> The slight contretemps claimed her attention but in two twos she set that little matter to rights.</p>
<p> Gerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and Edy asked
what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was flying but she
was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed it off with consummate
tact by saying that that was the benediction because just then the bell rang out
from the steeple over the quiet seashore because Canon O&apos;Hanlon was up on
the altar with the veil that Father Conroy put round him round his shoulders
giving the benediction with the blessed sacrament in his hands.</p>
<p> How moving the scene there in the gathering twilight, the last glimpse of
Erin, the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time a bat flew
forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk, hither, thither, with a tiny lost
cry. And she could see far away the lights of the lighthouses so picturesque she
would have loved to do with a box of paints
<font color="red"><sup><small>|9</small></sup></font><font color="black">because
it was easier than
<a name="un5005bq" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5005bq">to make a
man</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>9|</small></sup></font> and soon the
lamplighter would be going his rounds past the presbyterian church grounds and
along by shady Tritonville avenue where the couples walked and lighting the lamp
near her window where Reggy Wylie used to turn his freewheel like she read in
that book <i>The Lamplighter</i> by Miss Cummins, author of <i>Mabel Vaughan</i>
and other tales. For Gerty had her dreams that no-one knew of. She loved to read
poetry and she got a keepsake from Bertha Supple of that lovely confession
<br><font color="green">{u21, 405}</font>
<br> album with the coralpink cover to write her thoughts in she laid it in the
drawer of her toilet-table which, though it did not err on the side of luxury,
was scrupulously neat and clean. It was there she kept her girlish treasure
trove, the tortoiseshell combs, her child of Mary badge, the whiterose scent,
the eyebrowleine, her alabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to change when her
things came home from the wash and there were some beautiful thoughts written in
it in violet ink that she bought in Wisdom Hely&apos;s
<br><font color="green">{u22, 348}</font>
<br> for she felt that she too could write poetry if she could only express
herself like that poem that appealed to her so deeply that she had copied out of
the newspaper she found one evening round the potherbs. <i>Art thou real, my
ideal?</i> it was called by Louis J. Walsh, Magherafelt, and after there was
something about <i>twilight, wilt thou ever?</i> and ofttimes the beauty of
poetry, so sad in its transient loveliness had misted her eyes with silent tears
that the years were slipping by for her, one by one, and but for that one
shortcoming she knew she need fear no competition and that was an accident
coming down Dalkey hill and she always tried to conceal it. But it must end, she
felt. If she saw that magic lure in his eyes there would be no holding back for
her. Love laughs at locksmiths. She would make the great sacrifice. Her every
effort would be to share his thoughts. Dearer than the whole world would she be
to him and gild his days with happiness. There was the allimportant question and
she was dying to know was he a married man or a widower who had lost his wife or
some tragedy like the nobleman with the foreign name from the land of song had
to have her put into a madhouse, cruel only to be kind. But even if &mdash; what
then? Would it make a very great difference? From everything in the least
indelicate her finebred nature instinctively recoiled. She loathed that sort of
person, the fallen women off the accomodation walk beside the Dodder that went
with the soldiers and coarse men with no respect for a girl&apos;s honour,
degrading the sex and being taken up to the police station. No, no: not that.
They would be just good friends like a big brother and sister without all that
other in spite of the conventions of Society with a big ess. Perhaps it was an
old flame he was in mourning for from the days beyond recall. She thought she
<br><font color="green">{u21, 406}</font>
<br> understood. She would try to understand him because men were so different.
The old love was waiting, waiting with little white hands stretched out, with
blue appealing eyes. Heart of mine! She would follow her dream of love, the
dictates of her heart that told her he was her all in all, the only man in
<font color="red"><sup><small>|9</small></sup></font><font color="black">all</font><font color="red"><sup><small>9|</small></sup></font>
the world for her for love was the master guide. Nothing else mattered. Come
what might she would be wild, untrammelled, free.</p>
<p> Canon O&apos;Hanlon put the blessed sacrament back into the tabernacle and
the choir sang <i>Laudate Dominum omnes gentes</i> and then he locked the
tabernacle door because the benediction was over and Father Conroy handed him
his hat to put on and
<font color="red"><sup><small>|9</small></sup></font><font color="black"><a name="un5005j" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5005j">crosscat</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>9|</small></sup></font>
Edy asked

<font color="black">wasn&apos;t</font><font color="red"><sup><small>9|</small></sup></font>
she coming but Jacky Caffrey called out:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O, look, Cissy!</p>
<p> And they all looked was it sheet lightning but Tommy saw it too over the
trees beside the church, blue and then green and purple.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 349}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It&apos;s fireworks, Cissy Caffrey said.</p>
<p> And they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church,
helterskelter, Edy with the pushcar with baby Boardman in it and Cissy holding
Tommy and Jacky by the hand so they wouldn&apos;t fall running.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Come on, Gerty, Cissy called. It&apos;s the bazaar fireworks.</p>
<p> But Gerty was adamant. She had no intention of being at their beck and call.
If they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she could see from
where she was. The eyes that were fastened upon her set her pulses tingling. She
looked at him a moment, meeting his glance, and a light broke in upon her.
Whitehot passion was in that face, passion silent as the grave, and it had made
her his. At last they were left alone without the others to pry and pass remarks
and she knew he could be trusted to the death, steadfast, a sterling man, a man
of inflexible honour to his fingertips. His hands and face were working and a
tremour went over her. She leaned back far to look up where the fireworks were
and she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall back looking up and there
was no-one to see only him and her when she revealed all her graceful beautifully shaped legs like that, supply
<br><font color="green">{u21, 407}</font>
<br> soft and delicately rounded, and she seemed to hear the panting of his
heart, his hoarse breathing, because she knew about the passion of men like
that, hotblooded, because Bertha Supple told her once in dead secret and made
her swear she&apos;d never about the gentleman lodger that was staying with them
out of the Congested Districts Board that had pictures cut out of papers of
those skirtdancers and highkickers and she said he used to do something not very
nice that you could imagine sometimes in the bed. But this was altogether
different from a thing like that because there was all the difference because
she could almost feel him draw her face to his and the first quick hot touch of
his handsome lips. Besides there was absolution so long as you didn&apos;t do
the other thing before being married and there ought to be women priests that
would understand without your telling out and Cissy Caffrey too sometimes had
that dreamy kind of dreamy look in her eyes so that she too, my dear, and
<font color="red"><sup><small>|9</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Winnie</span></span>
<font color="black">Winny</font><font color="red"><sup><small>9|</small></sup></font>
Rippingham so mad about actors&apos; photographs and besides it was on account
of that other thing coming on the way it did.</p>
<p> And Jacky Caffrey shouted to look, there was another and she leaned back and
the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent and they all saw it
and shouted to look, look, there it was and she leaned back ever so far to see
the fireworks and something queer was flying about through the air, a soft
thing, to and fro, dark. And she saw a long Roman candle going up over
<br><font color="green">{u22, 350}</font>
<br> the trees up, up, and, in the tense hush, they were all breathless with
excitement as it went higher and higher and she had to lean back more and more
to look up after it, high, high, almost out of sight, and her face was suffused
with a divine, an entrancing blush from straining back and he could see her
other things too, nainsook knickers, the fabric that caresses the skin, better
than those other pettiwidth hose, the green, four and eleven, on account of
being white and she let him and she saw that he saw and then it went so high it
went out of sight a moment and she was trembling in every limb from being bent
so far back that he had a full view high up above her knee where no-one ever not
even on the swing or wading and she wasn&apos;t ashamed and he wasn&apos;t either to look in that immodest
<br><font color="green">{u21, 408}</font>
<br> way like that because he couldn&apos;t resist the sight of the wondrous
revealment
<font color="red"><sup><small>|9</small></sup></font><font color="black"><a name="un5005i" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5005i">half
offered</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>9|</small></sup></font> like
those skirtdancers behaving so immodest before gentlemen looking and he kept on
looking, looking. She would fain have cried to him chokingly, held out her snowy
slender arms to him to come, to feel his lips laid on her white brow, the cry of
a young girl&apos;s love, a little strangled cry, wrung from her, that cry that
has rung through the ages. And then a rocket sprang and bang shot blind blank
and O! then the Roman candle burst and it was like a sigh of O! and everyone
cried O! O! in raptures and it gushed out of it a stream of rain gold hair
threads and they shed and ah! they were all greeny dewy stars falling with
golden, O so lovely! O so soft, sweet, soft!</p>
<p> Then all melted away dewily in the grey air: all was silent. Ah! She glanced
at him as she bent forward quickly, a pathetic little glance of piteous protest,
of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl. He was leaning back against
the rock behind. Leopold Bloom (for it is he) stands silent with bowed head
before those young guileless eyes. What a brute he had been! At it again? A fair
unsullied soul had called to him and, wretch that he was, how had he answered?
An utter cad he had been! He of all men! But there was an infinite store of
mercy in those eyes, for him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and
sinned and wandered. Should a girl tell? No, a thousand times no. That was their
secret, only theirs, alone in the hiding twilight and there was none to know or
tell save the little bat that flew so softly through the evening to and fro and little bats don&apos;t tell.</p>
<p> Cissy Caffrey whistled, imitating the boys in the football field to show
what a great person she was: and then she cried:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Gerty! Gerty! We&apos;re going. Come on. We can see from farther up.</p>
<p> Gerty had an idea, one of love&apos;s little ruses. She slipped a hand into her
<br><font color="green">{u22, 351}</font>
<br> kerchief pocket and took out the wadding and waved in reply of course
without letting him and then slipped it back. Wonder if he&apos;s too far to.
She rose. Was it goodbye? No. She had to go but they would meet again, there,
and she would dream of that till then, tomorrow, of her dream of yester eve. She
drew herself up to her full height. Their
<br><font color="green">{u21, 409}</font>
<br> souls met in a last lingering glance and the eyes that reached her heart,
full of a strange shining, hung enraptured on her sweet flowerlike face. She
half smiled at him wanly, a sweet forgiving smile, a smile that verged on tears, and then they parted.</p>
<p> Slowly without looking back she went down the uneven strand to Cissy, to
Edy, to Jacky and Tommy Caffrey, to little baby Boardman. It was darker now and
there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and slippy seaweed. She walked
with a certain quiet dignity characteristic of her but with care and very slowly
because &mdash; because Gerty MacDowell was&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> Tight boots? No. She&apos;s lame! O!</p>
<p> Mr Bloom watched her as she limped away. Poor girl! That&apos;s why
she&apos;s left on the shelf and the others did a sprint. Thought something was
wrong by the cut of her jib. Jilted beauty. A defect is ten times worse in a
woman. But makes them polite. Glad I didn&apos;t know it when she was on show.
Hot little devil all the same. I wouldn&apos;t mind. Curiosity like a nun or a
negress or a girl with glasses. That squinty one is delicate. Near her
monthlies, I expect, makes them feel ticklish. I have such a bad headache today.
Where did I put the letter? Yes, all right. All kinds of crazy longings. Licking
pennies. Girl in Tranquilla convent that nun told me liked to smell rock oil.

How many women in Dublin have it today? Martha, she. Something in the air.
That&apos;s the moon. But then why don&apos;t all women menstruate at the same

Or all start scratch then get out of step. Sometimes Molly and Milly together.
Anyhow I got the best of that. Damned glad I didn&apos;t do it in the bath this

all off. Molly. Why I bought her the violet garters. Us too: the tie he wore,
his lovely socks and turnedup trousers. He wore a pair of gaiters the night that
first we met. His lovely shirt was shining beneath his what? of jet. Say a woman
loses a charm with every pin she takes out. Pinned together. O Mairy lost the
pin of her. Dressed up to the nines for somebody. Fashion part of their charm.
Just changes when you&apos;re on the track of the secret. Except the east: Mary,
Martha: now as then. No reasonable offer refused. She wasn&apos;t in a hurry
either. Always off to a fellow when they are. They never forget an appointment.
Out on spec probably. They believe in chance because like themselves. And the
others inclined to give her an odd dig. Girl friends at school, arms round each
other&apos;s necks or with ten fingers locked, kissing and whispering secrets
about nothing in the convent garden. Nuns with whitewashed faces, cool coifs and
their rosaries going up and down, vindictive too for what they can&apos;t get.
Barbed wire. Be sure now and write to me. And I&apos;ll write to you. Now
won&apos;t you? Molly and Josie Powell.

Then meet once in a blue moon. <i>Tableau</i>. O, look who it is for the love of
God! How are you at all? What have you been doing with yourself? Kiss and
delighted to, kiss, to see you. Picking holes in each other&apos;s appearance.
You&apos;re looking splendid. Sister souls. Showing their teeth at one another.
How many have you left? Wouldn&apos;t lend each other a pinch of salt.</p>
<p> Ah.</p>
<p> Devils they are when that&apos;s coming on them. Dark devilish appearance.
Molly often told me feel things a ton weight. Scratch the sole of my foot. O
that way! O, that&apos;s exquisite! Feel it myself too. Good to rest once in a
way. Wonder if it&apos;s bad to go with them then.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 411}</font>
<br> Safe in one way. Turns milk, makes fiddlestrings snap. Something about
withering plants I read in a garden. Besides they say if the flower withers she
wears she&apos;s a flirt. All are. Daresay she felt I. When you feel like that
you often meet what you feel. Liked me or what? Dress they look at. Always know
a fellow courting: collars and cuffs. Well cocks and lions do the same and
stags. Same time might prefer a tie undone or something. Trousers? Suppose I
when I was? No. Gently does it. Dislike rough and tumble. Kiss in the dark and
never tell. Saw something in me. Wonder what. Sooner have me as I am than some poet
<br><font color="green">{u22, 353}</font>
<br> chap with bearsgrease plastery hair, lovelock over his dexter optic. To aid
gentleman in literary. Ought to attend to my appearance my age. Didn&apos;t let
her see me in profile. Still, you never know. Pretty girls and ugly men
marrying. Beauty and the beast. Besides I can&apos;t be so if Molly. Took off
her hat to show her hair. Wide brim bought to hide her face, meeting someone
might know her, bend down or carry a bunch of flowers to smell. Hair strong in
rut. Ten bob I got for Molly&apos;s combings when we were on the rocks in Holles
street. Why not? Suppose he gave her money. Why not? All a prejudice. She&apos;s
worth ten, fifteen, more a pound. What? I think so. All that for nothing. Bold
hand. Mrs Marion. Did I forget to write address on that letter like the postcard
I sent to Flynn. And the day I went to Drimmie&apos;s without a necktie. Wrangle
with Molly it was put me off. No, I remember. Richie Goulding. He&apos;s
another. Weighs on his mind. Funny my watch stopped at half past four. Dust.
Shark liver oil they use to clean. Could do it myself. Save. Was that just when he, she?</p>
<p> O, he did. Into her. She did. Done.</p>
<p> Ah.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom with careful hand recomposed his wet shirt. O Lord, that little
limping devil. Begins to feel cold and clammy. After effect not pleasant. Still
you have to get rid of it someway. They don&apos;t care. Complimented perhaps.
Go home to nicey bread and milky and say night prayers with the kiddies. Well,
aren&apos;t they? See her as she is spoil all. Must have the stage setting, the
rouge, costume, position, music.

up. Moonlight silver effulgence. Maiden discovered with pensive bosom. Little
sweetheart come and kiss me. Still I feel. The strength it gives a man.
That&apos;s the secret of it. Good job I let off there behind coming out of
Dignam&apos;s. Cider that was. Otherwise I couldn&apos;t have. Makes you want to
sing after. <i>Lacaus esant taratara</i>. Suppose I spoke to her. What about?
Bad plan however if you don&apos;t know how to end the conversation. Ask them a
question they ask you another. Good idea if you&apos;re stuck. Gain time. But
then you&apos;re in a cart. Wonderful of course if you say: good evening, and
you see she&apos;s on for it: good evening. O but the dark evening in the Appian
way I nearly spoke to Mrs Clinch O thinking she was. Whew! Girl in Meath street
that night. All the dirty things I made her say. All wrong of course. My arks
she called it. It&apos;s so hard to find one who. Aho! If you don&apos;t answer
when they solicit must be horrible for them till they harden. And kissed my hand
when I gave her the extra two shillings. Parrots. Wish she hadn&apos;t called me
sir. O, her mouth in the dark! And you a married man with a single girl!
That&apos;s what they enjoy. Taking a man from another woman. Or even hear of
it. Different with me. Glad to get away from other chap&apos;s wife. Eating off
his cold plate. Chap in the Burton today spitting back gumchewed gristle. French
letter still in my pocketbook. Cause of half the trouble. But might happen
sometime, I don&apos;t think. Come in. All is prepared. I dreamt. What? Worst is
beginning. How they change the venue when it&apos;s not what they like. Ask you
do you like mushrooms because she once knew a gentleman who. Or ask you what
someone was going to say when he changed his mind and stopped. Yet if I went the
whole hog, say: I want to, something like that. Because I did. She too. Offend
her. Then make it up. Pretend to want something awfully, then cry off for her
sake. Flatters them. She must have been thinking of someone else all the time.
What harm? Must since she came to the use of reason, he, he and he. First kiss
does the trick. The propitious moment. Something inside them goes pop. Mushy
like, tell by their eye, on the sly. First thoughts are best. Remember that till
their dying day. Molly, lieutenant Mulvey that kissed her under the
<br><font color="green">{u21, 413}</font>
<br> Moorish wall beside the gardens. Fifteen she told me. But her breasts were
developed. Fell asleep then. After Glencree dinner that was when we drove home
the featherbed mountain. Gnashing her teeth in sleep. Lord mayor had his eye on her too. Val Dillon. Apoplectic.</p>
<p> There she is with them down there for the fireworks. My fireworks. Up like a
rocket, down like a stick. And the children, twins they must be, waiting for
something to happen. Want to be grownups. Dressing in mother&apos;s clothes.
Time enough, understand all the ways of the world. And the dark one with the mop
head and the nigger mouth. I knew she could whistle. Mouth made for that. Like
Molly. Why that highclass whore in Jammet&apos;s wore her veil only to her nose.
Would you mind, please, telling me the right time? I&apos;ll tell you the right
time up a dark lane. Say prunes and prisms forty times every morning, cure for
fat lips. Caressing the little boy too. Onlookers see most of the game. Of
course they understand birds, animals, babies. In their line.</p>
<p> Didn&apos;t look back when she was going down the strand. Wouldn&apos;t give
that satisfaction. Those girls, those girls, those lovely seaside girls. Fine
eyes she had, clear. It&apos;s the white of the eye brings that out not so much
the pupil. Did she know what I? Course. Like a cat sitting beyond a dog&apos;s
jump. Woman. Never meet one like that Wilkins in the high school drawing a
picture of Venus with all his belongings on show. Call that innocence? Poor idiot! His wife
<br><font color="green">{u22, 355}</font>
<br> has her work cut out for her. Never see them sit on a bench marked <i>Wet
Paint</i>. Eyes all over them. Look under the bed for what&apos;s not there.
Longing to get the fright of their lives. Sharp as needles they are. When I said
to Molly the man at the corner of Cuffe street was goodlooking, thought she
might like, twigged at once he had a false arm. Had too. Where do they get that?
Typist going up Roger Greene&apos;s stairs two at a time to show her
understandings. Handed down from father to, mother to daughter, I mean. Bred in
the bone. Milly for example drying her handkerchief on the mirror to save the
ironing. Best place for an ad to catch a woman&apos;s eye on a mirror. And when
I sent her for Molly&apos;s Paisley shawl to Prescott&apos;s, by the way that ad
I must, carrying home the change in her stocking. Clever little minx! I never told her. Neat way she carries
<br><font color="green">{u21, 414}</font>
<br> parcels too. Attract men, small thing like that. Holding up her hand,
shaking it, to let the blood flow back when it was red. Who did you learn that
from? Nobody. Something the nurse taught me. O, don&apos;t they know? Three
years old she was in front of Molly&apos;s dressingtable just before we left
Lombard street west. <i>Me have a nice pace</i>. Mullingar. Who knows? Ways of
the world. Young student. Straight on her pins anyway not like the other. Still
she was game. Lord, I am wet. Devil you are. Swell of her calf. Transparent
stockings, stretched to breaking point. Not like that frump today. A.E. Rumpled
stockings. Or the one in Grafton street. White. Wow! Beef to the heel.</p>
<p> A monkey puzzle rocket burst, spluttering in darting crackles. Zrads and
zrads, zrads, zrads. And Cissy and Tommy and Jacky ran out to see and Edy after
with the pushcar and then Gerty beyond the curve of the rocks. Will she? Watch!
Watch! See! Looked round. She smelt an onion. Darling, I saw your. I saw all.</p>
<p> Lord!</p>
<p> Did me good all the same. Off colour after Kiernan&apos;s, Dignam&apos;s.
For this relief much thanks. In <i>Hamlet</i>, that is. Lord! It was all things
combined. Excitement. When she leaned back felt an ache at the butt of my
tongue. Your head it simply swirls. He&apos;s right. Might have made a worse
fool of myself however. Instead of talking about nothing. Then I will tell you
all. Still it was a kind of language between us. It couldn&apos;t be? No, Gerty
they called her. Might be false name however like mine and the address Dolphin&apos;s barn a blind.</p>
<p class="set"><i>Her maiden name was Jemima Brown</i>
<br> <i>And she lived with her mother in Irishtown</i>.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 356}</font> </p>
<p> Place made me think of that I suppose. All tarred with the same brush.
Wiping pens in their stockings. But the ball rolled down to her as if it
understood. Every bullet has its billet. Course I never could throw anything
straight at school. Crooked as a ram&apos;s horn. Sad however because it lasts
only a few years till they settle down to potwalloping and papa&apos;s pants
will soon fit Willy and fuller&apos;s earth for the baby when they hold him out
to do ah ah. No soft job. Saves them. Keeps them
<br><font color="green">{u21, 415}</font>
<br> out of harm&apos;s way. Nature. Washing child, washing corpse. Dignam.
Children&apos;s hands always round them. Cocoanut skulls, monkeys, not even
closed at first, sour milk in their swaddles and tainted curds. Oughtn&apos;t to
have given that child an empty teat to suck. Fill it up with wind. Mrs Beaufoy,
Purefoy. Must call to the hospital. Wonder is nurse Callan there still. She used
to look over some nights when Molly was in the Coffee Palace. That young doctor
O&apos;Hare I noticed her brushing his coat. And Mrs Breen and Mrs Dignam once
like that too, marriageable. Worst of all the night Mrs Duggan told me in the
City Arms. Husband rolling in drunk, stink of pub off him like a polecat. Have
that in your nose all night, whiff of stale boose. Then ask in the morning: was
I drunk last night? Bad policy however to fault the husband. Chickens come home
to roost. They stick by one another like glue. Maybe the women&apos;s fault
also. That&apos;s where Molly can knock spots off them. It is the blood of the
south. Moorish. Also the form, the figure. Hands felt for the opulent. Just
compare for instance those others. Wife locked up at home, skeleton in the
cupboard. Allow me to introduce my. Then they trot you out some kind of a
nondescript, wouldn&apos;t know what to call her. Always see a fellow&apos;s
weak point in his wife. Still there&apos;s destiny in it, falling in love. Have
their own secrets between them. Chaps that would go to the dogs if some woman
didn&apos;t take them in hand. Then little chits of girls, height of a shilling
in coppers, with little hubbies. As God made them He matched them. Sometimes
children turn out well enough. Twice nought makes one. Or old rich chap of
seventy and blushing bride. Marry in May and repent in December. This wet is
very unpleasant. Stuck. Well the foreskin is not back. Better detach.</p>
<p> Ow!</p>
<p> Other hand a sixfooter with a wifey up to his watchpocket. Long and the
short of it. Big he and little she. Very strange about my watch. Wristwatches
are always going wrong. Wonder is there any magnetic influence between the
person because that was about the time he. Yes, I suppose, at once. Cat&apos;s
away the mice will play. I remember looking in Pill lane. Also that now is magnetism.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 357}</font>
<br> Back of everything
<br><font color="green">{u21, 416}</font>
<br> magnetism. Earth for instance pulling this and being pulled. That causes
movement. And time? Well that&apos;s the time the movement takes. Then if one
thing stopped the whole ghesabo would stop bit by bit. Because it&apos;s all
arranged. Magnetic needle tells you what&apos;s going on in the sun, the stars.
Little piece of steel iron. When you hold out the fork. Come. Come. Tip. Woman
and man that is. Fork and steel. Molly, he. Dress up and look and suggest and
let you see and see more and defy you if you&apos;re a man to see that and, like
a sneeze coming, legs, look, look and if you have any guts in you. Tip. Have to let fly.</p>
<p> Wonder how is she feeling in that region. Shame all put on before third
person. More put out about a hole in her stocking. Molly, her underjaw stuck
out, head back, about the farmer in the ridingboots and spurs at the horse show.
And when the painters were in Lombard street west. Fine voice that fellow had.
How Giuglini began. Smell that I did, like flowers. It was too. Violets. Came
from the turpentine probably in the paint. Make their own use of everything.
Same time doing it scraped her slipper on the floor so they wouldn&apos;t hear.
But lots of them can&apos;t kick the beam, I think. Keep that thing up for
hours. Kind of a general all round over me and half down my back.</p>
<p> Wait. Hm. Hm. Yes. That&apos;s her perfume. Why she waved her hand. I leave
you this to think of me when I&apos;m far away on the pillow. What is it?
Heliotrope? No. Hyacinth? Hm. Roses, I think. She&apos;d like scent of that
kind. Sweet and cheap: soon sour. Why Molly likes opoponax. Suits her with a
little jessamine mixed. Her high notes and her low notes. At the dance night she
met him, dance of the hours. Heat brought it out. She was wearing her black and
it had the perfume of the time before. Good conductor, is it? Or bad? Light too.
Suppose there&apos;s some connection. For instance if you go into a cellar where
it&apos;s dark. Mysterious thing too. Why did I smell it only now? Took its time
in coming like herself, slow but sure. Suppose it&apos;s ever so many millions
of tiny grains blown across. Yes, it is. Because those spice islands, Cinghalese
this morning, smell them leagues off. Tell you what it is. It&apos;s like a fine
fine veil or web they have all over the skin, fine like what do you call it
gossamer and they&apos;re always spinning it out
<br><font color="green">{u21, 417}</font>
<br> of them, fine as anything, rainbow colours without knowing it. Clings to
everything she takes off. Vamp of her stockings. Warm shoe. Stays. Drawers:
little kick, taking them off. Byby till next time. Also the cat likes to sniff
in her shift on the bed. Know her smell in a thousand. Bathwater too. Reminds me
of strawberries and cream. Wonder where it is really. There or the armpits or under the neck. Because
<br><font color="green">{u22, 358}</font>
<br> you get it out of all holes and corners. Hyacinth perfume made of oil of
ether or something. Muskrat. Bag under their tails. One grain pour off odour for
years. Dogs at each other behind. Good evening. Evening. How do you sniff? Hm.
Hm. Very well, thank you. Animals go by that. Yes now, look at it that way.
We&apos;re the same. Some women for instance warn you off when they have their
period. Come near. Then get a hogo you could hang your hat on. Like what? Potted
herrings gone stale or. Boof! Please keep off the grass.</p>
<p> Perhaps they get a man smell off us. What though? Cigary gloves Long John
had on his desk the other. Breath? What you eat and drink gives that. No.
Mansmell, I mean. Must be connected with that because priests that are supposed
to be are different. Women buzz round it like flies round treacle. Railed off
the altar get on to it at any cost. The tree of forbidden priest. O father, will
you? Let me be the first to. That diffuses itself all through the body,
permeates. Source of life. And it&apos;s extremely curious the smell. Celery sauce. Let me.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom inserted his nose. Hm. Into the. Hm. Opening of his waistcoat.
Almonds or. No. Lemons it is. Ah no, that&apos;s the soap.</p>
<p> O by the by that lotion. I knew there was something on my mind. Never went
back and the soap not paid. Dislike carrying bottles like that hag this morning.
Hynes might have paid me that three shillings. I could mention Meagher&apos;s
just to remind him. Still if he works that paragraph. Two and nine. Bad opinion
of me he&apos;ll have. Call tomorrow. How much do I owe you? Three and nine? Two
and nine, sir. Ah. Might stop him giving credit another time. Lose your
customers that way. Pubs do. Fellows run up a bill on the slate and then
slinking around the back streets into somewhere else.</p>
<p> Here&apos;s this nobleman passed before. Blown in from the bay. Just
<br><font color="green">{u21, 418}</font>
<br> went as far as turn back. Always at home at dinnertime. Looks mangled out:
had a good tuck in. Enjoying nature now. Grace after meals. After supper walk a
mile. Sure he has a small bank balance somewhere, government sit. Walk after him
now make him awkward like those newsboys me today. Still you learn something.
See ourselves as others see us. So long as women don&apos;t mock what matter?
That&apos;s the way to find out. Ask yourself who is he now. <i>The Mystery Man
on the Beach</i>, prize titbit story by Mr Leopold Bloom. Payment at the rate of
one guinea per column. And that fellow today at the graveside in the brown
macintosh. Corns on his kismet however. Healthy perhaps absorb all the. Whistle
brings rain they say. Must be some somewhere. Salt in the
<br><font color="green">{u22, 359}</font>
<br> Ormond damp. The body feels the atmosphere. Old Betty&apos;s joints are on
the rack. Mother Shipton&apos;s prophecy that is about ships around they fly in
the twinkling. No. Signs of rain it is. The royal reader. And distant hills seem coming nigh.</p>
<p> Howth. Bailey light. Two, four, six, eight, nine. See. Has to change or they
might think it a house. Wreckers. Grace darling. People afraid of the dark. Also
glowworms, cyclists: lighting up time. Jewels diamonds flash better. Light is a
kind of reassuring. Not going to hurt you. Better now of course than long ago.
Country roads. Run you through the small guts for nothing. Still two types there
are you bob against. Scowl or smile. Pardon! Not at all. Best time to spray
plants too in the shade after the sun. Some light still. Red rays are longest.

Reynolds taught us: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet. A star I
see. Venus? Can&apos;t tell yet. Two. When three it&apos;s night. Were those
nightclouds there all the time? Looks like a phantom ship. No. Wait. Trees are
they? An optical illusion. Mirage. Land of the setting sun this. Homerule sun
setting in the northeast. My native land, goodnight.</p>
<p> Dew falling. Bad for you, dear, to sit on that stone. Brings on white
fluxions. Never have little baby then less he was big strong fight his way up
through. Might get piles myself. Sticks too like a summer cold, sore on the
mouth. Cut with grass or paper worst. Friction of the position. Like to be that
rock she sat on. O sweet little, you don&apos;t
<br><font color="green">{u21, 419}</font>
<br> know how nice you looked. I begin to like them at that age. Green apples.
Grab at all that offer. Suppose it&apos;s the only time we cross legs, seated.
Also the library today: those girl graduates. Happy chairs under them. But
it&apos;s the evening influence. They feel all that. Open like flowers, know
their hours, sunflowers, Jerusalem artichokes, in ballrooms, chandeliers,
avenues under the lamps. Nightstock in Mat Dillon&apos;s garden where I kissed
her shoulder. Wish I had an oilpainting of her then. June that was too I wooed.
The year returns. History repeats itself. Ye crags and peaks I&apos;m with you
once again. Life, love, voyage round your own little world. And now? Sad about
her lame of course but must be on your guard not to feel too much pity. They take advantage.</p>
<p> All quiet on Howth now. The distant hills seem. Where we. The rhododendrons.
I am a fool perhaps. He gets the plums and I the plumstones. Where I come in.
All that old hill has seen. Names change: that&apos;s all. Lovers: yum yum.</p>
<p> Tired I feel now. Will I get up? O wait. Drained all the manhood out of me,
little wretch. She kissed me. My youth. Never again. Only once it comes.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 360}</font>
<br> Or hers. Take the train there tomorrow. No. Returning not the same. Like
kids your second visit to a house. The new I want. Nothing new under the sun.
Care of P.O. Dolphin&apos;s barn. Are you not happy in your? Naughty darling. At
Dolphin&apos;s barn charades in Luke Doyle&apos;s house. Mat Dillon and his bevy
of daughters: Tiny, Atty, Floey, Mamie, Louie, Sara. Molly too. Eightyseven that
was. Year before we. And the old major partial to his drop of spirits. Curious
she an only child, I an only child. So it returns. Think you&apos;re escaping
and run into yourself. Longest way round is the shortest way home. And just when
he and she. Circus horse walking in a ring. Rip van Winkle we played. Rip: tear
in Henny Doyle&apos;s overcoat. Van: breadvan delivering. Winkle: cockles and
periwinkles. Then I did Rip van Winkle coming back. She leaned on the sideboard
watching. Moorish eyes. Twenty years asleep in Sleepy Hollow. All changed.
Forgotten. The young are old. His gun rusty from the dew.</p>
<p> Ba. What is that flying about? Swallow? Bat probably. Thinks I&apos;m
<br><font color="green">{u21, 420}</font>
<br> a tree, so blind. Have birds no smell? Metempsychosis. They believed you
could be changed into a tree from grief. Weeping willow. Ba. There he goes.
Funny little beggar. Wonder where he lives. Belfry up there. Very likely.
Hanging by his heels in the odour of sanctity. Bell scared him out, I suppose.
Mass seems to be over. Could hear them all at it. Pray for us. And pray for us.
And pray for us. Good idea the repetition. Same thing with ads. Buy from us. And
buy from us. Yes, there&apos;s the light in the priest&apos;s house. Their
frugal meal. Remember about the mistake in the valuation when I was in
Thom&apos;s. Twentyeight it is. Two houses they have. Gabriel Conroy&apos;s
brother is curate. Ba. Again. Wonder why they come out at night like mice.
They&apos;re a mixed breed. Birds are like hopping mice. What frightens them,
light or noise? Better sit still. All instinct like the bird in drouth got water
out of the end of a jar by throwing in pebbles. Like a little man in a cloak he
is with tiny hands. Weeny bones. Almost see them shimmering, kind of a bluey
white. Colours depend on the light you see. Stare the sun for example like the
eagle then look at a shoe see a blotch blob yellowish. Wants to stamp his
trademark on everything. Instance, that cat this morning on the staircase.
Colour of brown turf. Say you never see them with three colours. Not true. That
half tabbywhite tortoiseshell in the City Arms with the letter em on her
forehead. Body fifty different colours. Howth a while ago amethyst. Glass
flashing. That&apos;s how that wise man what&apos;s his name with the burning
glass. Then the heather goes on fire. It can&apos;t be tourists&apos; matches.
What? Perhaps the sticks dry rub together in the
<br><font color="green">{u22, 361}</font>
<br> wind and light. Or broken bottles in the furze act as a burning glass in
the sun. Archimedes. I have it! My memory&apos;s not so bad.</p>
<p> Ba. Who knows what they&apos;re always flying for. Insects? That bee last
week got into the room playing with his shadow on the ceiling. Birds too never
find out what they say. Like our small talk. And says she and says he. Nerve
they have to fly over the ocean and back. Lots must be killed in storms,
telegraph wires. Dreadful life sailors have too. Big brutes of oceangoing
steamers floundering along in the dark, lowing out like seacows. <i>Faugh a ballagh</i>.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 421}</font>
<br> Out of that, bloody curse to you. Others in vessels, bit of a handkerchief
sail, pitched about like snuff at a wake when the stormy winds do blow. Married
too. Sometimes away for years at the ends of the earth somewhere. No ends really
because it&apos;s round. Wife in every port they say. She has a good job if she
minds it till Johnny comes marching home again. If ever he does. Smelling the
tail end of ports. How can they like the sea? Yet they do. The anchor&apos;s
weighed. Off he sails with a scapular or a medal on him for luck. Well? And the
tephilim no what&apos;s this they call it poor papa&apos;s father had on his
door to touch. That brought us out of the land of Egypt and into the house of
bondage. Something in all those superstitions because when you go out never know
what dangers. Hanging on to a plank or astride of a beam for grim life, lifebelt
round him, gulping salt water, and that&apos;s the last of his nibs till the
sharks catch hold of him. Do fish ever get seasick?</p>
<p> Then you have a beautiful calm without a cloud, smooth sea, placid, crew and
cargo in smithereens, Davy Jones&apos; locker. Moon looking down. Not my fault, old cockalorum.</p>
<p> A lost long candle wandered up the sky from Mirus bazaar in search of funds
for Mercer&apos;s hospital and broke, drooping, and shed a cluster of violet but
one white stars. They floated, fell: they faded. The shepherd&apos;s hour: the
hour of folding: hour of tryst. From house to house, giving his everwelcome
double knock, went the nine o&apos;clock postman, the glowworm&apos;s lamp at
his belt gleaming here and there through the laurel hedges. And among the five
young trees a hoisted lintstock lit the lamp at Leahy&apos;s terrace. By screens
of lighted windows, by equal gardens a shrill voice went crying, wailing:
<i>Evening Telegraph, stop press edition! Result of the Gold Cup races!</i> and
from the door of Dignam&apos;s house a boy ran out and called. Twittering the
bat flew here, flew there. Far out over the sands the coming surf crept, grey.
Howth settled for slumber, tired of long days, of yumyum rhododendrons (he was old) and felt
<br><font color="green">{u22, 362}</font>
<br> gladly the night breeze lift, ruffle his many ferns. He lay but opened a
red eye unsleeping, deep and slowly breathing, slumberous but awake. And far on
Kish bank the anchored lightship twinkled, winked at Mr Bloom.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 422}</font> </p>
<p> Life those chaps out there must have, stuck in the same spot. Irish Lights
board. Penance for their sins. Coastguards too. Rocket and breeches buoy and
lifeboat. Day we went out for the pleasure cruise in the <i>Erin&apos;s
King</i>, throwing them the sack of old papers. Bears in the zoo. Filthy trip.
Drunkards out to shake up their livers. Puking overboard to feed the herrings.
Nausea. And the women, fear of God in their faces. Milly, no sign of funk. Her
blue scarf loose, laughing. Don&apos;t know what death is at that age. And then
their stomachs clean. But being lost they fear. When we hid behind the tree at
Crumlin. I didn&apos;t want to. Mamma! Mamma! Babes in the wood. Frightening
them with masks too. Throwing them up in the air to catch them. I&apos;ll murder
you. Is it only half fun? Or children playing battle. Whole earnest. How can
people aim guns at each other. Sometimes they go off. Poor kids. Only troubles
wildfire and nettlerash. Calomel purge I got her for that. After getting better
asleep with Molly. Very same teeth she has. What do they love? Another
themselves? But the morning she chased her with the umbrella. Perhaps so as not
to hurt. I felt her pulse. Ticking. Little hand it was: now big. Dearest Papli.
All that the hand says when you touch. Loved to count my waistcoat buttons. Her
first stays I remember. Made me laugh to see. Little paps to begin with. Left
one is more sensitive, I think. Mine too. Nearer the heart. Padding themselves
out if fat is in fashion. Her growing pains at night, calling, wakening me.
Frightened she was when her nature came on her first. Poor child! Strange moment
for the mother too. Brings back her girlhood. Gibraltar. Looking from Buena
Vista. O&apos;Hara&apos;s tower. The seabirds screaming. Old Barbary ape that
gobbled all his family. Sundown, gunfire for the men to cross the lines. Looking
out over the sea she told me. Evening like this, but clear, no clouds. I always
thought I&apos;d marry a lord or a gentleman with a private yacht. <i>Buenas
noches, se&ntilde;orita. El hombre ama la muchacha hermosa</i>. Why me? Because you were so foreign from the others.</p>
<p> Better not stick here all night like a limpet. This weather makes you dull.
Must be getting on for nine by the light. Go home. Too late for <i>Leah</i>.
<i>Lily of Killarney</i>. No. Might be still up. Call to the hospital
<br><font color="green">{u21, 423}</font>
<br> to see. Hope she&apos;s over. Long day I&apos;ve had. Martha, the bath,
funeral, house of Keyes, museum with those goddesses, Dedalus&apos; song. Then
that bawler in Barney Kiernan&apos;s. Got my own back there. Drunken ranters. What I said about his God made him wince.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 363}</font>
<br> Mistake to hit back. Or? No. Ought to go home and laugh at themselves.
Always want to be swilling in company. Afraid to be alone like a child of two.
Suppose he hit me. Look at it other way round. Not so bad then. Perhaps not to
hurt he meant. Three cheers for Israel. Three cheers for the sister-in-law he
hawked about, three fangs in her mouth. Same style of beauty. Particularly nice
old party for a cup of tea. The sister of the wife of the wild man of Borneo has
just come to town. Imagine that in the early morning at close range. Everyone to
his taste as Morris said when he kissed the cow. But Dignam&apos;s put the boots
on it. Houses of mourning so depressing because you never know. Anyhow she wants
the money. Must call to the Scottish Widows as I promised. Strange name. Takes
it for granted we&apos;re going to pop off first. That widow on Monday was it
outside Cramer&apos;s that looked at me. Buried the poor husband but progressing
favourably on the premium. Her widow&apos;s mite. Well? What do you expect her
to do? Must wheedle her way along. Widower I hate to see. Looks so forlorn. Poor
man O&apos;Connor wife and five children poisoned by mussels here. The sewage.
Hopeless. Some good matronly woman in a porkpie hat to mother him. Take him in
tow, platter face and a large apron. Ladies&apos; grey flanelette bloomers,
three shillings a pair, astonishing bargain. Plain and loved, loved for ever,
they say. Ugly: no woman thinks she is. Love, lie and be handsome for tomorrow
we die. See him sometimes walking about trying to find out who played the trick.
U. p: up. Fate that is. He, not me. Also a shop often noticed. Curse seems to
dog it. Dreamt last night? Wait. Something confused. She had red slippers on.
Turkish. Wore the breeches. Suppose she does. Would I like her in pyjamas?
Damned hard to answer. Nannetti&apos;s gone. Mailboat. Near Holyhead by now.
Must nail that ad of Keyes&apos;s. Work Hynes and Crawford. Petticoats for
Molly. She has something to put in them. What&apos;s that? Might be money.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 424}</font> </p>
<p> Mr Bloom stooped and turned over a piece of paper on the strand. He brought
it near his eyes and peered. Letter? No. Can&apos;t read. Better go. Better.
I&apos;m tired to move. Page of an old copybook. All those holes and pebbles.
Who could count them? Never know what you find. Bottle with story of a treasure
in it thrown from a wreck. Parcels post. Children always want to throw things in
the sea. Trust? Bread cast on the waters. What&apos;s this? Bit of stick.</p>
<p> O! Exhausted that female has me. Not so young now. Will she come here
tomorrow? Wait for her somewhere for ever. Must come back. Murderers do. Will I?
<br><font color="green">{u22, 364}</font> </p>
<p> Mr Bloom with his stick gently vexed the thick sand at his foot. Write a message for her. Might remain. What?</p>
<p> I.</p>
<p> Some flatfoot tramp on it in the morning. Useless. Washed away. Tide comes
here a pool near her foot. Bend, see my face there, dark mirror, breathe on it,
stirs. All these rocks with lines and scars and letters. O, those transparent!
Besides they don&apos;t know. What is the meaning of that other world. I called
you naughty boy because I do not like.</p>
<p> AM. A.</p>
<p> No room. Let it go.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom effaced the letters with his slow boot. Hopeless thing sand.
Nothing grows in it. All fades. No fear of big vessels coming up here. Except
Guinness&apos;s barges. Round the Kish in eighty days. Done half by design.</p>
<p> He flung his wooden pen away. The stick fell in silted sand, stuck. Now if
you were trying to do that for a week on end you couldn&apos;t. Chance.
We&apos;ll never meet again. But it was lovely. Goodbye, dear. Made me feel so young.</p>
<p> Short snooze now if I had. Must be near nine. Liverpool boat long gone. And
she can do the other. Did too. And Belfast. I won&apos;t go. Race there, race
back to Ennis. Let him. Just close my eyes a moment. Won&apos;t sleep though.
Half dream. It never comes the same. Bat again. No harm in him. Just a few.
