Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of all too fleeting
day lingered lovingly on sea and strand, on the proud promontory of dear old

with their spades and buckets, building castles as children do, or playing with
their big coloured ball, happy as the day was long. And Edy Boardman was rocking
the chubby baby to and fro in the pushcar while that young gentleman fairly
chuckled with delight. He was but eleven months and nine days old and, though
still a tiny toddler, was just beginning to lisp his first babyish words. Cissy

<br> Caffrey bent over to him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty dimple in his chin.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Now, baby, Cissy Caffrey said. Say out big, big. I want a drink of water.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 332}</font> </p>
<p> And baby prattled after her:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A jink a jink a jawbo.</p>
<p> Cissy Caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of children, so
patient with little sufferers and Tommy Caffrey could never be got to take his
castor oil unless it was Cissy Caffrey that held his nose
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black">and
promised
<font color="red"><sup><small>|a</small></sup></font>him<font color="red"><sup><small>a|</small></sup></font>

<a name="un5005t" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5005t">golden syrup</a>
on</font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font>. But to be sure
baby was as good as gold, a perfect little dote in his new fancy bib. None of
your spoilt beauties was Cissy Caffrey. A truerhearted girl never drew the
breath of life, always with a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word
on her cherryripe red lips, a girl lovable in the extreme. And Edy Boardman
laughed too at the quaint language of little brother.</p>
<p> But just then there was a slight altercation between Master Tommy and Master
Jacky. Boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception to this rule. The
apple of discord was a certain castle of sand which Master Jacky had built and
Master Tommy would have it right go wrong that it was to be architecturally
improved by a frontdoor like the Martello tower had. But if Master Tommy was
headstrong Master Jacky was selfwilled too and, true to the maxim that every
little Irishman&apos;s house is his castle, he fell upon his hated rival and to
such purpose that the wouldbe assailant came to grief and (alas to relate!) the
coveted castle too. Needless to say the cries of discomfited Master Tommy drew the attention of the girl friends.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Come here, Tommy, his sister called imperatively, at once!
And you, Jacky, for shame to throw poor Tommy in the dirty sand. Wait till I catch you for that.</p>
<p> His eyes misty with unshed tears Master Tommy came at her call for their big
sister&apos;s word was law with the twins. And in a sad plight he was after his
misadventure. His little man-o&apos;-war top and
<br><font color="green">{u21, 387}</font>
<br> unmentionables were full of sand but Cissy was a past mistress in the art
of smoothing over life&apos;s tiny troubles and very quickly not one speck of
sand was to be seen on his smart little suit. Still the blue eyes were
glistening with hot tears that would well up so she shook her hand at Master
Jacky the culprit, her eyes dancing in admonition.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Nasty bold Jacky! she cried.</p>
<p> She put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What&apos;s your name? Butter and cream?
<br><font color="green">{u22, 333}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Tell us who is your sweetheart, spoke Edy Boardman. Is Cissy your sweetheart?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Nao, tearful Tommy said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Is Edy Boardman your sweetheart? Cissy queried.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Nao, Tommy said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I know, Edy Boardman said none too amiably with an arch
glance from her shortsighted eyes. I know who is Tommy&apos;s sweetheart. Gerty is Tommy&apos;s sweetheart.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Nao, Tommy said on the verge of tears.</p>
<p> Cissy&apos;s quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to Edy
Boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman couldn&apos;t
see and to mind he didn&apos;t wet his new tan shoes.</p>
<p> But who was Gerty?</p>
<p> Gerty MacDowell who was seated near her companions, lost in thought, gazing
far away into the distance was in very truth as fair a specimen of winsome Irish
girlhood as one could wish to see. She was pronounced beautiful by all who knew
her though, as folks often said, she was more a Giltrap than a MacDowell. Her
figure was slight and graceful, inclining even to fragility but those iron
jelloids she had been taking of late had done her a world of good and she was
much better of those discharges she used to get
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black">and

<br><font color="green">{u21, 388}</font>
<br> finely veined alabaster with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice
and queen of ointments could make them though it was not true that she used to
wear kid gloves in bed. Bertha Supple told that once to Edy Boardman when she
was black out
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black"><a name="un4047g" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4047g">at
daggers drawn</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font>
with Gerty (the girl chums had of course their little tiffs from time to time
like the rest of mortals) and she told her not to let on whatever she did that
it was her that told her or she&apos;d never speak to her again. No. Honour
where honour is due. There was an innate refinement, a languid queenly hauteur
about Gerty which was unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and
higharched instep. Had kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high
degree in her own right and had she only received the benefit of a good
education Gerty MacDowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in the
land and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow and
patrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their devoirs to
<br><font color="green">{u22, 334}</font>
<br> her. Mayhap it was this, the love that might have been, that lent to her
softlyfeatured face at whiles a look, tense with suppressed meaning, that
imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful eyes, a charm few could
resist. Why have women such eyes of witchery? Gerty&apos;s were of the bluest
Irish blue, set off by lustrous lashes and dark expressive brows. Time was when
those brows were not so silkily seductive. It was Madame Vera Verity, directress
of the Woman Beautiful page of the Princess novelette, who had first advised her
to try eyebrowleine which gave that haunting expression to the eyes, so becoming
in leaders of fashion, and she had never regretted it.

morning on account of the new moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a
profusion of luxuriant clusters

pared her nails too, Thursday for

now at Edy&apos;s words as a telltale flush, delicate as the faintest rosebloom,
crept into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her
<br><font color="green">{u21, 389}</font>
<br> sweet girlish shyness that of a surety God&apos;s fair land of Ireland did not hold her equal.</p>
<p> For an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes. She was about
to retort but something checked the words on her tongue. Inclination prompted
her to speak out: dignity told her to be silent. The pretty lips pouted awhile
but then she glanced up and broke out into a joyous little laugh which had in it
all the freshness of a young May morning. She knew right well, no-one better,
what made squinty Edy say that. As per usual somebody&apos;s nose was out of
joint about the boy that had the bicycle always riding up and down in front of
her window. Only now his father kept him in in the evenings studying hard to get
an exhibition in the intermediate that was on and he was going to Trinity
college to study for a doctor when he left the high school like his brother
W.&nbsp;E. Wylie who was racing in the bicycle races in Trinity college
university. Little recked he perhaps for what she felt, that dull ache in her
heart sometimes, piercing to the core. Yet he was young and perchance he might
learn to love her in time. They were protestants in his family and of course
Gerty knew Who came first and after Him the blessed

<font color="black">Virgin</font><font color="red"><sup><small>~|5|</small></sup></font>
and then saint Joseph. But he was undeniably handsome and he was what he looked,
every inch a gentleman, the shape of his head too at the back without his cap on
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black"><a name="un5005bn" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5005bn">that

<br><font color="green">{u22, 335}</font>
<br> something off the common and the way he turned the bicycle at the lamp with
his hands off the bars and also the nice perfume of those good cigarettes and
besides they were both of a size and that was why Edy Boardman thought she was
so frightfully clever because he didn&apos;t go and ride up and down in front of her bit of a garden.</p>
<p> Gerty was dressed simply but with instinctive taste for she felt that there
was just a might that he might be out. A neat blouse of electric blue,
selftinted by dolly dyes, with a smart vee opening
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black"><a name="un4018as" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4018as">down

and kerchief pocket (in which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her
<br><font color="green">{u21, 390}</font>
<br> favourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit) and a navy
threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful figure to
perfection. She wore a coquettish wideleaved hat of nigger straw with an
underbrim of eggblue chenille and at the side a butterfly bow to tone. All
Tuesday week afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at last she
found what she wanted at Clery&apos;s summer sales, the very it, slightly
shopsoiled but you would never notice, seven fingers two and a penny. She did it
up all by herself and tried it on then, smiling back at her lovely reflection in
the mirror and when she put it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew that
that would take the shine out of some people she knew. Her shoes were the newest
thing in footwear (Edy Boardman prided herself that she was very <i>petite</i>
but she never had a foot like Gerty MacDowell, a five, and never would ash, oak
or elm) with patent toecaps and just one smart buckle

proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more of her
shapely leg encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and wide garter
tops. As for undies they were Gerty&apos;s chief care and who that knows the
fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen (though Gerty would never see
seventeen again) can find it in his heart to blame her? She had four dinky sets,
three

and nighties extra, and each set slotted with different coloured ribbons,
rosepink, pale blue, mauve and peagreen and she aired them herself and blued
them when they came home from the wash and ironed them and she had a brickbat to
keep the iron on because she wouldn&apos;t trust those washerwomen as far as
she&apos;d see them scorching the things. She was wearing the blue for luck,

father brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and because she
thought perhaps he might be out because when she was dressing that morning she
nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside out and that was for

with a remark about refreshments. Impetuous fellow! Strength of character had
never been Reggy Wylie&apos;s strong point and he who would woo and win Gerty
MacDowell must be a man among men. But waiting, always waiting to be asked and
it was leap year too and would soon be over. No prince charming is her beau

<p> Edy Boardman asked Tommy Caffrey was he done and he said yes so then she
buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run off and play
with Jacky and to be good and not to fight. But Tommy said he wanted the ball
and Edy told him no that baby was playing with the ball and if he took it
there&apos;d be wigs on the green but Tommy said it was his ball his ball and he
wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground, if you please. The temper of him! O, he was
<br><font color="green">{u21, 393}</font>
<br> a man already was little Tommy Caffrey. Edy told him no, no and to be off
now with him and she told Cissy Caffrey not to give in to him.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You&apos;re not my sister, naughty Tommy said. It&apos;s my ball.</p>
<p> But Cissy Caffrey told baby Boardman to look up, look up high at her finger
and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand and Tommy after it in full career, having won the day.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Anything for a quiet life, laughed Ciss.</p>
<p> And she tickled baby&apos;s two cheeks to make him forget and played here&apos;s

<br> the lord mayor, here&apos;s his two horses, here&apos;s his gingerbread
carriage and here he walks in, chinchopper, chinchopper, chinchopper chin. But
Edy got as cross as two sticks about his getting his own way like that from everyone always petting him.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I&apos;d like to give him something, she said, so I would, where I won&apos;t say.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; On the beeoteetom, laughed Cissy merrily.</p>
<p> Gerty MacDowell bent down her head at the idea of Cissy saying a thing like
that out she&apos;d be ashamed of her life to say, flushing a deep rosy red and
Edy Boardman said she was sure the gentleman opposite heard what she said. But not a pin cared Ciss.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Let him! she said with a pert toss of her head and a
piquant tilt of her nose. Give it to him too on the same place as quick as I&apos;d look at him.</p>

anthem of the organ. It was the men&apos;s temperance retreat conducted by the
missioner, the reverend John Hughes S.J., rosary, sermon and benediction of the
most blessed sacrament. They were there gathered together without distinction of
social class (and a most edifying spectacle it was to see) in that simple fane
beside the waves after the storms of this weary world, kneeling before the feet
of the immaculate, beseeching her to intercede for them, holy Mary, holy virgin
of virgins. How sad to poor Gerty&apos;s ears! Had her father only avoided the

But that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearths and homes had cast its
shadow over her childhood days. Nay, she had even witnessed in the home circle
deeds of violence caused by intemperance and had seen her own father, a prey to
the fumes of intoxication, forget himself completely for if there was one thing
of all things that Gerty knew it was that the man who lifts his hand to a woman
save in the way of kindness deserves to be branded as the lowest of the low.</p>
<p> And still the voices sang in supplication to the

or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman off Sandymount green that
Cissy Caffrey called the man that was so like himself passing along the strand
taking a short walk. You never saw him anyway screwed but still and for all that
she would not like him for a father because he was too old or something or on
account of his face (it was a palpable case of doctor Fell) or his carbuncly
nose with the pimples on it. Poor father! With all his faults she loved him
still when he sang <i>Tell me, Mary, how to woo thee</i> and they had stewed
cockles and lettuce with salad dressing for supper and when he sang <i>The moon
hath raised</i> with Mr Dignam that died suddenly and was buried, God have mercy
on him, from a stroke. Her mother&apos;s birthday that was and Charley was home
on his holidays and Tom and Mr Dignam and Mrs and Patsy and Freddy Dignam and
they were to have had a group taken. No-one would have thought the end was so
near. Now he was laid to rest. And her mother said to him to let that be a
warning to him for the rest of his days and he couldn&apos;t even go to the
funeral on account of the gout and she had to go into town to bring him the
letters and samples from his office about Catesby&apos;s cork lino,

were done something lovely. She was in a soft clinging white and the gentleman
was in chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat. She often looked at them
dreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and thought about those times
because she had found out in Walker&apos;s pronouncing dictionary that belonged
to grandpapa Giltrap about the halcyon days what they meant.</p>
<p> The twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly
<br><font color="green">{u21, 396}</font>
<br> fashion, till at last Master Jacky who was really as bold as brass there
was no getting behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he could
down towards the seaweedy rocks. Needless to say poor Tommy was not slow to
voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was sitting there by
himself came to the rescue and intercepted the ball. Our two champions claimed
their plaything with lusty cries and to avoid trouble Cissy Caffrey called to
the gentleman to throw it to her please. The gentleman aimed the ball once or
twice and then threw it up the strand towards Cissy Caffrey but it rolled down
the slope and stopped right under Gerty&apos;s skirt near the little pool by the
rock. The twins clamoured again for it and Cissy told her to kick it away and
let them fight for it it so Gerty drew back her foot but she wished their stupid
ball hadn&apos;t come rolling down to her and she gave a kick but she missed and Edy and Cissy laughed.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; If you fail try again, Edy Boardman said.</p>
<p> Gerty smiled assent. A delicate pink crept into her pretty cheek but she was
determined to let them see so she just lifted her skirt a little but just enough
and took good aim and gave the ball a jolly good kick and it went ever so far
and the two twins after it down towards the shingle. Pure jealousy of course it
was nothing else to draw attention on account of the gentleman opposite looking.
She felt the warm flush, a danger signal always with Gerty MacDowell, surging
and flaming into her cheeks. Till then they had only exchanged glances of the
most casual but now under the brim of her new hat she ventured a look at him and
the face that met her gaze there in the twilight, wan and strangely drawn, seemed to her the saddest she had ever seen.

<p> Through the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted and
with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain of original
sin, spiritual vessel, pray for us, honourable vessel, pray for us, vessel of
singular devotion, pray for us, mystical rose. And careworn hearts were there
and toilers for their daily bread and many who had erred and wandered, their
eyes wet with contrition but for all that bright with hope for the reverend
father Hughes had told them what the great saint Bernard said in his famous prayer

intercessory power that it was not recorded in any age that those who implored
her powerful protection were ever abandoned by her.</p>
<p> The twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of childhood
are but as passing summer showers. Cissy played with baby Boardman till he
crowed with glee, clapping baby hands in air. Peep she cried behind the hood of
the pushcar and Edy asked where was Cissy gone and then Cissy popped up her head
and cried ah! and, my word, didn&apos;t the little chap enjoy that! And then she told him to say papa.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Say papa, baby. Say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa.</p>
<p> And baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for eleven

properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried out, holy saint
Denis, that he was possing wet and to double the half blanket the other way
under him. Of course his infant majesty was most obstreperous at such toilet
formalities and he let everyone know it:</p>

her as though they would search her through and through, read her very soul.

out towards the sea and they both ran after it. Little monkeys common as
ditchwater. Someone ought to take them and give them a good hiding for
themselves to keep them in their places the both of them. And Cissy and Edy
shouted after them to come back because they were afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned.</p>

<p> Not they! What a great notion they had! So Cissy said it was the very last
time she&apos;d ever bring them out. She jumped up and called them and then she
ran down the slope past him, tossing her hair behind her which had a good enough
colour if there had been more of it but with all the thingamerry she was always
rubbing into it she couldn&apos;t get it to grow long because it wasn&apos;t
natural so she could just go and throw her hat at it. She ran with long gandery
strides it was a wonder she didn&apos;t rip up her skirt at the side that was
too tight on her because there was a lot of the tomboy about Cissy Caffrey

them a good clip on the ear but she didn&apos;t because she thought he might be
watching but she never made a bigger mistake in her life because Gerty could see
without looking that he never took his eyes off of her and then Canon
O&apos;Hanlon handed the thurible back to Father Conroy and knelt down looking
up at the blessed sacrament and the choir began to sing <i>Tantum ergo</i> and

just took off her hat for a moment to settle her hair and a prettier, a daintier
head of nutbrown tresses was never seen on a girl&apos;s shoulders &mdash; a
radiant little vision, in sooth, almost maddening in its sweetness. You would
have to travel many a long mile before you found a head of hair the like of
that. She could almost see the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes
that set her tingling in every nerve. She put on her hat so that she could see
from underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster for her breath caught
as she caught the expression in his eyes. He was eying her as a snake eyes its
prey. Her woman&apos;s instinct told her that she had raised the devil in him
and at the thought a burning scarlet swept from throat to brow till the lovely
colour of her face became a glorious rose.</p>
<p> Edy Boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at Gerty, half
smiling, with her specs, like an old maid, pretending to nurse the baby.
Irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was why no-one could
get on with her, poking her nose into what was no concern of hers. And she said to Gerty:
<br><font color="green">{u22, 345}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A penny for your thoughts.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What?
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">laughed</span></span>
<font color="black">replied</font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font>
Gerty
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black">with
<a name="un4018bs" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4018bs">a smile reinforced
by the whitest of
teeth</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font>. I was only wondering was it late.</p>
<p> Because she wished to goodness they&apos;d take the snottynosed twins and
their baby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just gave a
gentle hint about its being late. And when Cissy came up Edy asked her the time
and Miss Cissy, as glib as you like, said it was half past kissing time, time to
kiss again. But Edy wanted to know because they were told to be in early.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Wait, said Cissy, I&apos;ll ask my uncle Peter over there
what&apos;s the time by his conundrum.</p>
<p> So over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his hand
out of his pocket, getting nervous, and beginning to play
<br><font color="green">{u21, 402}</font>
<br> with his watchchain, looking at the church. Passionate nature though he was
Gerty could see that he had enormous control over himself. One moment he had
been there, fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze, and the next moment
it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman, selfcontrol expressed in every line of his distinguishedlooking figure.</p>
<p> Cissy said to excuse her would he mind telling her what was the right time
and Gerty could see him taking out his watch listening to it and looking up
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black">and
<a name="un4019ao" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4019ao">clearing his
throat</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font> and he
said he was very sorry his watch was stopped but he thought it must be after
eight because the sun was set. His voice had a cultured ring in it and
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black"><a name="un4047k" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4047k">though
he spoke in measured
accents</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font> there
was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones. Cissy said thanks and came back
with her tongue out and said
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black"><a name="un6012l" href="../../FF/unbs/un6all.htm#un6012l">uncle
said</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font> his waterworks were out of order.</p>
<p> Then they sang the second verse of the <i>Tantum ergo</i> and Canon
O&apos;Hanlon got up again and censed the blessed sacrament and knelt down and
he told Father Conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire to the
flowers and Father Conroy got up and settled it all right and she could see the
gentleman winding his watch and listening to the works and she swung her leg
more in and out in time. It was getting darker but he could see and he was
looking all the time that he was winding the watch or whatever he was doing to
it and then he put it back and put his hands back into his pockets. She felt a
kind of a sensation rushing all over her and she knew by the feel of her scalp
and that irritation against her stays that that thing must be coming on because
the last time too was when she clipped her hair on account of the moon. His dark
eyes fixed themselves on her again, drinking in her every contour,
<br><font color="green">{u22, 346}</font>
<br> literally worshipping at her shrine. If ever there was undisguised
admiration in a man&apos;s passionate gaze it was there plain to be seen on that
man&apos;s face. It is for you, Gertrude MacDowell, and you know it.</p>
<p> Edy began to get ready to go
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black">and
<a name="un4018am" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4018am">it was high time</a>
for her</font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font> and

<font color="black">Gerty</font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font>
noticed that that little hint she gave had the desired effect because it was a
long way along the strand to where there was the place to push up the pushcar
and Cissy took off the twins&apos; caps and tidied their
<br><font color="green">{u21, 403}</font>
<br> hair to make herself attractive of course and Canon O&apos;Hanlon stood up
with his cope poking up at his neck and Father Conroy handed him the card to
read off and he read out <i>Panem de coelo praestitisti eis</i> and Edy and
Cissy were talking about the time all the time and asking her but Gerty could
pay them back in their own coin and she just answered with scathing politeness
when Edy asked her was she heartbroken about her best boy throwing her over.
Gerty winced sharply. A brief cold blaze shone from her eyes that spoke
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black"><a name="un4018bv" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4018bv">volumes</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font>
of scorn immeasurable. It hurt &mdash; O yes, it cut deep because Edy had her
own quiet way of saying things like that she knew would wound like the
confounded little cat she was. Gerty&apos;s lips parted swiftly
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black"><a name="un4041ag" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4041ag">to
frame the word</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font>
but she fought back the sob that rose to her throat, so slim, so flawless, so
beautifully moulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of. She had loved
him better than he knew. Lighthearted deceiver and fickle like all his sex he
would never understand what he had meant to her and for an instant there was in
the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears. Their eyes were probing her mercilessly
but with a brave effort she sparkled back in sympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them to see.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O,
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">she

proud head flashed up. I can throw my cap at who I like because it&apos;s leap year.</p>
<p> Her words rang out crystalclear, more musical than the cooing of the
ringdove but they cut the silence icily. There was that in her young voice that
told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with.
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black">As for

Edy&apos;s countenance fell to no slight extent and Gerty could see by her
looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a towering rage because that
shaft had struck home and they both knew that she was something aloof, apart, in another sphere, that she was
<br><font color="green">{u21, 404}</font>
<br> not of them and never would be and there
<br><font color="green">{u22, 347}</font>
<br> was somebody else too that knew it and saw it so they could put that in their pipe and smoke it.</p>
<p> Edy straightened up baby Boardman to get ready to go and Cissy tucked in the
ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because the sandman was
on his way for Master Boardman junior and Cissy told him too that Billy Winks
was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and baby looked just too ducky,
laughing up out of his gleeful eyes, and Cissy poked him like that out of fun in
his wee fat tummy and baby, without as much as by your leave, sent up his
compliments to all and sundry on to his brand new dribbling bib.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O my! Puddeny pie! protested Ciss.

has his bib destroyed.</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font></p>
<p> The slight contretemps claimed her attention but in two twos she set that little matter to rights.</p>
<p> Gerty stifled a smothered exclamation
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black">and
gave a <a name="un4018ce" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4018ce">nervous
cough</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font> and Edy
asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was flying
but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed it off
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black">with
<a name="un4041w" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4041w">consummate
tact</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font> by saying
that that was the benediction because just then the bell rang out from the
steeple over the quiet seashore because Canon O&apos;Hanlon was up on the altar
with the veil that Father Conroy put round him round his shoulders giving the
benediction with the blessed sacrament in his hands.</p>
<p> How moving the scene there in the gathering twilight, the last glimpse of
Erin, the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time a bat flew
forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk, hither, thither, with a tiny lost
cry. And she could see far away the lights of the lighthouses
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black">so
<a name="un6012aa" href="../../FF/unbs/un6all.htm#un6012aa">picturesque</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font>

she read in that book <i>The Lamplighter</i> by Miss Cummins, author of <i>Mabel
Vaughan</i> and other tales. For Gerty had her dreams that no-one knew of. She
loved to read poetry and she got a keepsake from Bertha Supple of that lovely confession
<br><font color="green">{u21, 405}</font>
<br> album with the coralpink cover to write her thoughts in she laid it in the
drawer of her toilet-table which, though it did not err on the side of luxury,
was scrupulously neat and clean. It was there she kept her girlish treasure
trove, the tortoiseshell combs, her child of Mary badge, the whiterose scent,
the eyebrowleine, her alabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to change when her
things came home from the wash and there were some beautiful thoughts written in
it in violet ink that she bought in Wisdom Hely&apos;s
<br><font color="green">{u22, 348}</font>
<br> for she felt that she too could write poetry if she could only express
herself like that poem she had copied out of the newspaper she found one evening
round the potherbs. <i>Art thou real, my ideal?</i> it was called by Louis J.
Walshe, Magherafelt, and after there was something about <i>twilight, wilt thou
ever?</i> and often the beauty of poetry, so sad in its transient loveliness had
misted her eyes with silent tears that the years were slipping by for her, one
by one, and but for that one shortcoming she knew she need fear no competition
and that was an accident coming down the hill and she always tried to conceal
it. But it must end, she felt. If she saw that magic lure in his eyes there
would be no holding back for her. Love laughs at locksmiths. She would make the
great sacrifice.

than the whole world would she be to him and gild his days with happiness. There
was the allimportant question and she was dying to know was he a married man or
a widower who had lost his wife or some tragedy like the nobleman with the
foreign name from the land of song had to have her put into a madhouse, cruel
only to be kind. But even if &mdash; what then? Would it make a very great
difference? From everything in the least indelicate her finebred nature
instinctively recoiled. She loathed that sort of person, the fallen women off
the accomodation walk beside the Dodder that went with the soldiers and coarse
men, degrading the sex and being taken up to the police station. No, no: not
that. They would be just good friends

with a big ess. Perhaps it was an old flame he was in mourning for from the days beyond recall. She thought she
<br><font color="green">{u21, 406}</font>
<br> understood. She would try to understand him because men were so different.
The old love was waiting, waiting with little white hands stretched out, with
blue appealing eyes. She would follow the dictates of her heart

for love was the master guide. Nothing else mattered. Come what might she would be wild, untrammelled, free.</p>
<p> Canon O&apos;Hanlon put the blessed sacrament back into the tabernacle and
the choir sang <i>Laudate Dominum omnes gentes</i> and then he locked the
tabernacle door because the benediction was over and Father Conroy handed him
his hat to put on and Edy asked was she coming but Jacky Caffrey called out:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O, look, Cissy!</p>
<p> And they all looked was it sheet lightning but Tommy saw it too over the
trees beside the church, blue and then green and purple.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 349}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It&apos;s fireworks, Cissy Caffrey said.</p>
<p> And they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church,
helterskelter, Edy with the pushcar with baby Boardman in it and Cissy holding
Tommy and Jacky by the hand so they wouldn&apos;t fall running.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Come on, Gerty, Cissy called. It&apos;s the bazaar fireworks.</p>
<p> But Gerty was adamant. She had no intention of being at their beck and call.
If they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she could see from
where she was. The eyes that were fastened upon her set her pulses tingling. She
looked at him a moment, meeting his glance, and a light broke in upon her.
Whitehot passion was in that face, passion silent as the grave, and it had made
her his. At last they were left alone without the others to pry and pass remarks
and she knew he could be trusted to the death, steadfast, a man of honour to his
fingertips.
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black"><a name="un4047am" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4047am">His

back far to look up where the fireworks were and she caught her knee in her

her when she revealed all her graceful beautifully shaped legs like that, supply
<br><font color="green">{u21, 407}</font>
<br> soft and delicately rounded, and she seemed to hear the panting of his
heart, his hoarse breathing, because she knew about the passion of men like
that, hotblooded, because Bertha Supple told her once in secret about the
gentleman lodger that was staying with them out of the

and she said he used to do something not very nice that you could imagine
sometimes in the bed. But this was
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black"><a name="un4018n" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4018n">altogether</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font>
different from a thing like that there was all the difference because she could
almost feel him draw her face to his and the first quick hot touch of his
handsome lips. Besides there was absolution so long as you didn&apos;t do the
other thing before being married and there ought to be women priests that would
understand without telling out and Cissy Caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy
kind of dreamy look in her eyes so that she too, my dear, and besides it was on
account of that other thing coming on the way it did.</p>
<p> And Jacky Caffrey shouted to look, there was another and she leaned back and
the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent and they all saw it
and shouted to look, look, there it was and she leaned back ever so far to see
the fireworks and something queer was flying about through the air, a soft
thing, to and fro, dark. And she saw a long Roman candle going up over
<br><font color="green">{u22, 350}</font>
<br> the trees up, up, and they were all breathless with excitement as it went
higher and higher and she had to lean back more and more to look up after it,
high, high, almost out of sight, and her face was suffused with a divine, an
entrancing blush from straining back and he could see her other things too,
nainsook knickers,

in every limb from being bent so far back that he

those skirtdancers behaving so immodest before gentlemen looking and he kept on

stars falling with golden, O so lovely! O so soft, sweet, soft!</p>
<p> Then all melted away dewily in the grey air: all was silent. Ah! She glanced
at him as she bent forward quickly, a

glance of piteous protest, of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl.
He was leaning back against the rock behind. Leopold Bloom (for it is he) stands
silent with bowed head before those young guileless eyes. What a brute he had
been! At it again? A fair unsullied soul had called to him and, wretch that he
was, how had he answered? An utter cad he had been!

of all men!</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font> But
there was an infinite store of mercy in those eyes, for him too a word of pardon
even though he had erred and sinned and wandered. That was their secret, only
theirs, alone in the hiding twilight and there was none to know or tell save the
little bat that flew so softly through the evening to and fro and little bats don&apos;t tell.</p>
<p> Cissy Caffrey whistled, imitating the boys in the football field to show
what a great person she was: and then she cried:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Gerty! Gerty! We&apos;re going. Come on. We can see from farther up.</p>
<p> Gerty had an

<br><font color="green">{u22, 351}</font>

without letting him and then slipped it back. Wonder if he&apos;s too far to.
She rose.

<br> souls met in a last lingering glance and the eyes that reached her heart,
full of a strange shining, hung enraptured on her sweet flowerlike face. She
half smiled at him

a sweet forgiving smile &mdash; and then they parted.</p>
<p> Slowly without looking back she went down the uneven strand to Cissy, to
Edy, to Jacky and Tommy Caffrey, to little baby Boardman. It was darker now and
there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and slippy seaweed. She walked

Pretend to want something awfully, then cry off for her sake. Flatters them. She
must have been thinking of someone else all the time. What harm? Must since she
came to the use of reason, he, he and he. First kiss does the trick. Something
inside them goes pop. Mushy like, tell by their eye, on the sly. First thoughts
are best. Remember that till their dying day. Molly, lieutenant Mulvey that kissed her under the
<br><font color="green">{u21, 413}</font>
<br> Moorish wall beside the gardens. Fifteen she told me. But her breasts were
developed. Fell asleep then. After Glencree dinner that was when we drove home

Perhaps so as not to hurt. I felt her pulse. Ticking. Little hand it was: now
big. Dearest Papli. All that the hand says when you touch. Loved to count my
waistcoat buttons. Her first stays I remember. Made me laugh to see. Little paps
to begin with. Left one is more sensitive, I think. Mine too. Nearer the heart.
Her growing pains at night, calling, wakening me. Frightened she was when her
nature came on her first. Poor child! Strange moment for the mother too. Brings
back her girlhood. Gibraltar. Looking from Buena Vista. O&apos;Hara&apos;s
tower. The seabirds screaming. Old Barbary ape that gobbled all his family.
Sundown, gunfire for the men to cross the lines. Looking out over the sea she
told me. Evening like this, but clear, no clouds. I always thought I&apos;d

Nothing grows in it. All fades. No fear of big vessels coming up here. Except
