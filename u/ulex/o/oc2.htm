<p> The summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysterious embrace.
Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of
<a name="s13020f" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020f">all too</a> fleeting
day lingered lovingly on sea and strand, on the proud promontory of
<a name="s13009bv" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009bv">dear old</a> Howth,
guarding as ever the waters of the bay, on the weedgrown rocks by Sandymount
shore and, last but not least, on the quiet church whence there streamed forth
at times upon the stillness the voice of prayer to her who is in her pure
radiance a beacon ever to the stormtossed heart of man, Mary,
<a name="s13001v" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13001v">star of the sea</a>.</p>
<p> The three girl friends were seated on the
rocks,<a target="foot" id="foo0002">&ordm;</a> enjoying the evening scene which
was fresh and not too chilly. Many a time and oft were they wont to come there
to that favourite
<a name="s13013m" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013m">nook</a> to have a
cosy chat and
<a name="s13020bg" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020bg">discuss matters
feminine</a>, Cissy Caffrey and Edy Boardman with the baby in the pushcar and
Tommy and Jacky Caffrey, two little curlyheaded boys, dressed in sailor suits
with caps to match and the name <i>H.M.S.
Belleisle</i><a target="foot" id="foo0004">&ordm;</a> printed on both. For Tommy
and Jacky Caffrey were twins, scarce four years old and very noisy and spoiled
twins at times but for all that darling little fellows with bright merry faces
and <a name="s13009ce" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009ce">endearing
ways</a> about them. They were dabbling in the sand with their spades and
buckets, building castles as children do, or playing with their big coloured
ball,<a target="foot" id="foo0006">&ordm;</a> as happy as the day was long. And
Edy Boardman was rocking the
<a name="s13009aa" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009aa">chubby</a> baby to
and fro in the pushcar while that young gentleman fairly chuckled with delight.
He was but eleven months and nine days old and, though still a tiny toddler, was
just beginning to lisp his first babyish words. Cissy  Caffrey bent over
to<a target="foot" id="foo0007">&ordm;</a> him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty dimple in his chin.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Now, baby, Cissy Caffrey said. Say out big, big. I want a
drink of water.<a target="foot" id="foo0008">&ordm;</a>
<br><font color="green">{u22, 332}</font> </p>
<p> And baby prattled after her:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="s13020l" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020l">A jink a jink a
jawbo.</a><a target="foot" id="foo0009">&ordm;</a></p>
<p> Cissy Caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of children, so
patient with <a name="s13020o" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020o">little
sufferers</a> and Tommy Caffrey could never be got
<a name="s13013bd" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013bd">to take his castor
oil unless it was Cissy Caffrey that held his nose</a>. But to be sure baby
Boardman was <a name="s13018k" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13018k">as good
as gold</a>, a perfect little dote in his new fancy
<a name="s13018q" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13018q">bib</a>. No
<a name="s13021aa" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13021aa">spoilt beauty</a>
was Cissy Caffrey. A truerhearted girl never drew the breath of life, always
with a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her
<a name="s13016b" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13016b">cherryripe</a> red
lips, a girl <a name="s13020as" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020as">lovable
in the extreme</a>. And Edy Boardman laughed too at the quaint language of little brother.</p>
<p> But just then there was a slight altercation between
Master<a target="foot" id="foo0011">&ordm;</a> Tommy and Master Jacky.
<a name="s13009be" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009be">Boys will be
boys</a> and the two twins were no exception to the rule. The apple of discord
was a certain castle of sand which Master Jacky had built and Master Tommy would
have it right go wrong that it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor
like the Martello tower had. But if Master Tommy was headstrong Master Jacky was
selfwilled too and, true to the maxim that every little
<a name="un4054ad" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4054ad">Irishman&apos;s
house is his castle</a>, he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose that
the wouldbe assailant came to grief and (alas to relate!) the coveted castle
too. Needless to say the cries of discomfited Master Tommy drew the attention of the girl friends.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Come here, Tommy, his sister called imperatively. At once!
And you, Jacky, <a name="s13009ad" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009ad">for
shame</a> to throw poor Tommy in the dirty sand. Wait till I catch you for that.</p>
<p> <a name="s13020g" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020g">His eyes misty
with unshed tears</a> Master Tommy came at her call for their big sister&apos;s
word was law with the twins. And in a sad plight he was too after his
misadventure. His little man-o&apos;-war top and  unmentionables were full of
sand but Cissy was a past mistress in the art of smoothing out life&apos;s tiny
troubles and<a target="foot" id="foo0014">&ordm;</a> very quickly not one speck
of sand was to be seen on his smart little suit. Still the blue eyes were
glistening with <a name="s13009ae" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009ae">hot
tears that would well up</a> so she shook her hand at Master Jacky the culprit, her eyes dancing in admonition.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <a name="s13009af" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009af">Nasty</a> bold Jacky, she said.</p>
<p> She put her arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="s13004c" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13004c">What&apos;s your name? Butter and cream?</a>
<br><font color="green">{u22, 333}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="jn0070a" href="../../ff/unbs/jn0all.htm#jn0070a">Tell us who is your
sweetheart, spoke Edy Boardman. Is Cissy your sweetheart?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Nao, tearful Tommy said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Is Edy Boardman your sweetheart? Cissy queried.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Nao, Tommy said.</a></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I know, Edy Boardman said
<a name="s13020bd" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020bd">none too amiably</a>
with an arch glance from her shortsighted eyes. I know who is Tommy&apos;s
sweetheart.<a target="foot" id="foo0015">&ordm;</a>
<a name="jn0070a" href="../../ff/unbs/jn0all.htm#jn0070a">Gerty is Tommy&apos;s sweetheart.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Nao, Tommy said on the verge of tears.</a></p>
<p> Cissy&apos;s quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to Edy
Boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the
gentleman<a target="foot" id="foo0016">&ordm;</a> couldn&apos;t see and to mind
he didn&apos;t wet his new tan shoes.</p>
<p> But who was Gerty?</p>
<p> Gerty MacDowell who was seated near her companions,
<a name="s13012l" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13012l">lost in thought</a>,
<a name="s13010ac" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010ac">gazing far away into
the distance</a> was
<a name="s13013cc" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013cc">in very
truth</a><a target="foot" id="foo0017">&ordm;</a>
<a name="s13013cc" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013cc">as fair a specimen
of</a> <a name="s13003g" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13003g">winsome</a>
<a name="s13013cc" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013cc">Irish girlhood</a>
as one could wish to see. She was
<a name="s13012j" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13012j">pronounced
beautiful</a> by all who knew her though, as folks often said, she was
<a name="s13009am" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009am">more a Giltrap than
a MacDowell</a>. Her figure was slight and graceful, inclining even to fragility
but those iron jelloids she had been taking of late had done her a world of good
and she was much better of those
<a name="s13010ak" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010ak">discharges</a> she
used to get. The
<a name="s13020bj" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020bj">waxen pallor of her
face was almost spiritual in its ivorylike purity</a>. Her hands were of  finely
veined alabaster with
<a name="un4018ad" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4018ad">tapering fingers</a>
and as white as lemonjuice<a target="foot" id="foo0018">&ordm;</a> and queen of
ointments could make them though it was not true that she used to
<a name="un5003t" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5003t">wear kid gloves in
bed</a>. Bertha Supple told that once to Edy Boardman when she was black out
with Gerty (the girl chums had of course their little tiffs from time to time
like the rest of mortals) and
<a name="s13004ap" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13004ap">she told her not
to</a><a target="foot" id="foo0019">&ordm;</a>
<a name="s13004ap" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13004ap">let on whatever she
did that it was her that told her</a> or she&apos;d never speak to her again.
No. <a name="s13020bk" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020bk">Honour where
honour is due.</a> There was an<a target="foot" id="foo0020">&ordm;</a>
<a name="s13011g" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13011g">innate refinement</a>,
a <a name="s13010as" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010as">languid</a>
<a name="s13010al" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010al">queenly</a>
<a name="s13013o" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013o">hauteur</a> about
Gerty which was unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and high arched
instep. Had kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree
<a name="s13023r" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13023r">in her own right</a>
and had she only received
<a name="s13013ce" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013ce">the benefit of a
good education</a> Gerty MacDowell might easily have held her own beside any
lady of the land and have seen herself
<a name="s13020ac" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020ac">exquisitely
gowned</a> <a name="s13023aa" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13023aa">with
jewels on her brow</a> and
<a name="un5005ad" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5005ad">patrician</a>
<a name="s13013p" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013p">suitors</a> at her
feet vying with one another <a name="s13010q" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010q">to pay their devoirs</a> to
<br><font color="green">{u22, 334}</font>
<br> her. Mayhap it was this,
<a name="s13009bg" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009bg">the love that might
have been</a>, that lent to her softly featured face at times
<a name="s13010aj" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010aj">a look</a>,
<a name="s13010ai" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010ai">tense with
suppressed meaning</a>, that imparted a strange yearning
tendency<a target="foot" id="foo0021">&ordm;</a> to the beautiful eyes,
<a name="un5005af" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5005af">a charm few could
resist</a>. <a name="s13013n" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013n">Why have
women such eyes of witchery?</a> Gerty&apos;s were of the bluest Irish blue, set
off by <a name="s13020ae" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020ae">lustrous</a>
lashes and dark expressive expressive brows.
<a name="s13010o" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010o">Time had been when</a>
those brows were not so
<a name="s13020ad" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020ad">silkily</a>
seductive<a target="foot" id="foo0022">&ordm;</a>. It was Madame Vera Verity,
directress of the
<a name="s13021n" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13021n"><i>Woman
Beautiful</i></a> page in the Princess Novelette, who had first advised her to
try <a name="s13020w" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020w">eyebrowleine,
which gave that haunting expression to the eyes, so becoming in leaders of
fashion,</a> and she had never regretted it. But Gerty&apos;s crowning glory was
her <a name="s13009cq" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009cq">wealth of</a>
<a name="s13009cq" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009cq">hair</a>. It was
dark brown with a natural wave in it.
<a name="s13014h" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13014h">She had cut it that
very morning on account of the new moon</a> and it
<a name="s13001q" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13001q">nestled</a> about her
pretty head in <a name="s13009cp" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009cp">a
profusion of luxuriant clusters</a>. And just now at Edy&apos;s words as
<a name="s13013s" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013s">a telltale flush,
delicate as the faintest rosebloom</a>, crept into her cheeks she looked so
lovely in her  <a name="s13009as" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009as">sweet
girlish shyness</a> that of a surety
<a name="s13013t" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013t">God&apos;s fair land
of Ireland did not hold her equal</a>.</p>
<p> For an instant she was silent with
<a name="s13009bf" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009bf">rather sad</a>
<a name="s13010ad" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010ad">downcast eyes</a>.
She was about to retort but
<a name="s13020cf" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020cf">something checked
the words on her tongue</a>.
<a name="s13010n" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010n">Inclination prompted
her to speak out: dignity told her to be silent.</a>
<a name="s13011h" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13011h">The pretty lips
pouted</a> awhile<a target="foot" id="foo0025">&ordm;</a> but then she glanced
up and <a name="s13005t" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13005t">broke</a> into
<a name="s13009bl" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009bl">a joyous little
laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young May morning</a>.
<a name="s13010t" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010t">She knew</a> right
well, <a name="s13010t" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010t">no-one
better,</a> what made squinty Edy say that.
<a name="s13020be" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020be">As per usual</a>
<a name="s13014o" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13014o">somebody&apos;s nose
was out of joint</a> about the boy that had the bicycle off the London bridge
road always riding up and down in front of her windows. Only now his father kept
him in in<a target="foot" id="foo0028">&ordm;</a> the evenings studying hard to
get an exhibition in the intermediate that was on and he was going to go to
Trinity college to study for a doctor when he left the high school like his
brother W E Wylie who was racing in the bicycle races of Trinity college
university. <a name="s13010c" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010c">Little</a>
<a name="s13010b" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010b">recked</a>
<a name="s13010c" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010c">he</a> perhaps for
what she felt, that dull ache in her heart sometimes, piercing
<a name="s13020bf" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020bf">to the core</a>. Yet
he was young <a name="s13010ap" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010ap">and
perchance</a> in time he might
<a name="s13013bf" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013bf">learn to love
her</a>. They were protestants in his family and of course Gerty knew
<a name="s13009ap" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009ap">who came first and
after Him the blessed virgin and then saint Joseph.</a> But he was
<a name="s13020h" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020h">undeniably
handsome</a> and he looked what he was, every inch a gentleman,
<a name="s13018o" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13018o">the shape of his head too at the back without his cap on</a>,
<br><font color="green">{u22, 335}</font>
<br> <a name="s13011i" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13011i">something off the
common</a> and the way he turned the bicycle at her lamp with his hands off the
bars and also the nice perfume of those good cigarettes and besides they were
both of a size too he and she and that was why Edy Boardman thought she was so
frightfully clever because he didn&apos;t go and ride up and down in front of her bit of a garden.</p>
<p> Gerty was dressed simply but with instinctive taste for she felt that there
was just a might that he might be out. A neat blouse of electric blue selftinted
by <a name="s13013bm" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013bm">dolly dyes</a>
with a smart vee opening and kerchief pocket (in which she kept always a little
<a name="s13013aj" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013aj">piece of cottonwool
scented</a> with heliotrope) and a navy three quarter skirt cut to the stride
showed<a target="foot" id="foo0032">&ordm;</a> off her slim graceful figure to
perfection. She wore a coquettish wideleaved hat of
<a name="s13009a" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009a">nigger</a> straw with
an <a name="s13009f" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009f">underbrim</a> of

<a name="s13009f" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009f">chenille</a> and at
the side a <a name="s13009g" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009g">butterfly
bow</a> of silk <a name="s13009a" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009a">to
tone</a>. All Tuesday week afternoon she was hunting
<a name="s13020bi" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020bi">to match that
chenille</a> but at last she found what she wanted in Sparrow&apos;s summer
bargains, the very it,
<a name="s13022ab" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022ab">slightly</a>
shopsoiled but you would never notice,<a target="foot" id="foo0033">&ordm;</a>
seven fingers two and a penny. She did it up all by herself and tried it on
then,<a target="foot" id="foo0034">&ordm;</a> smiling back at her lovely
reflection in the mirror, and
<a name="s13009i" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009i">when she put it on the
waterjug to keep the shape</a> she knew that that would take the shine out of
some people she knew. Her shoes were the newest thing in footwear (Edy Boardman
prided herself that she was very petite but she never had a foot like Gerty
MacDowell, a five,<a target="foot" id="foo0035">&ordm;</a> and never would have,
ash,<a target="foot" id="foo0036">&ordm;</a> oak or elm) with patent toecaps and
just one smart buckle.
<a name="s13009al" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009al">Her wellturned ankle
displayed its</a>

and <a name="s13009k" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009k">wide garter
tops</a>. As for
<a name="s13009c" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009c">undies</a> they were
Gerty&apos;s chief care and who that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of
sweet seventeen (though Gerty would
<a name="s13010au" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010au">never see seventeen
again</a>) can find it in his heart to blame her? She had four dinky sets, three
articles and nighties extra, and each set
<a name="s13009d" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009d">slotted with different
coloured ribbons, rosepink,</a> pale blue, mauve and peagreen and she
<a name="s13021i" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13021i">aired</a> them herself
when they came home from the wash because she wouldn&apos;t trust those
washerwomen and aired and ironed herself and

<p> And while Edy Boardman was with little Tommy behind the pushcar she was just
thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself
<br><font color="green">{u22, 337}</font>
<br> his <a name="s13013be" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013be">little wife

<a name="s13021m" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13021m">spitfire</a>, because
she would be twentytwo in November. She would care for him with
<a name="s13021h" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13021h">creature comforts</a>
too for Gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked that feeling of
<a name="s13020b" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020b">homeyness</a>. Her
teacakes and <a name="s13013al" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013al">queen
Ann&apos;s pudding</a> had
<a name="s13020n" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020n">won golden

fire, dredge in the fine flour and
<a name="s13004r" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13004r">always stir in the

sugar</a> and
<a name="s13006c" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13006c">whisk</a> well the
white of eggs and they would have a nice drawingroom with pictures and
<a name="s13021j" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13021j">chintz covers</a> for
the chairs and that silver toastrack in Clery&apos;s summer sale like they have
in rich houses. He would be tall
(<a name="s13020ce" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020ce">she had always
admired tall men</a> for a husband) with glistening

every morning they would both have brekky for their own two selves and before he
went out to business he would give her a good hearty
<a name="s13010r" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010r">hug</a> and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyes.</p>
<p> Edy Boardman asked Tommy Caffrey was he done and he said yes so then she
<a name="un4019cx" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4019cx">buttoned up his
little knickerbockers for him</a> and told him to run off and play with Jacky
and to be good and not to fight. But Tommy said he wanted the ball and Edy told
him no that baby was playing with the ball and if he took it there&apos;d be
wigs on the green but Tommy said it was his ball and he wanted his ball and he
pranced on the ground, if you please. The temper of him! O, he was  a man
already was little Tommy Caffrey. Edy told him no, no and to be off now with him
and she told Cissy Caffrey not to give in to him.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You&apos;re not my sister,
<a name="s13009ag" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009ag">naughty</a> Tommy said. It&apos;s my ball.</p>
<p> But Cissy Caffrey told baby Boardman to
<a name="s13017f" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13017f">look up, look up</a>
high at her finger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand
and Tommy after it in full career, having won the day.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="s13012d" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13012d">Anything for a quiet life</a>, laughed Ciss.</p>
<p> And she tickled baby Boardman&apos;s two cheeks to make him forget and played here&apos;s
<br><font color="green">{u22, 338}</font>
<br> the lord mayor, here&apos;s his two horses, here&apos;s his gingerbread
carriage and here he walks in, chinchopper, chinchopper, chinchopper, chin. But
Edy got <a name="s13009an" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009an">as cross as
two sticks</a> about his
<a name="s13023ae" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13023ae">getting
his</a><a target="foot" id="foo0046">&ordm;</a>
<a name="s13023ae" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13023ae">own way</a> like that from everyone always petting him.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I&apos;d like to give him something, she said, so I would,
<a name="s13009s" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009s">where I won&apos;t say</a>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; On the
<a name="s13009ai" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009ai">beeoteetom</a>, laughed Cissy merrily.</p>
<p> Gerty MacDowell bent down her head at the idea of Cissy saying a thing like
that out she&apos;d be
<a name="s13020aa" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020aa">ashamed of her
life</a> to say,
<a name="s13012g" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13012g">flushing a deep rosy
red</a> and Edy Boardman said she was sure the gentleman opposite heard what she said. But not a pin cared Cissy.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Let him! she said with a pert toss of her head and
<a name="s13020ca" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020ca">a piquant tilt of
her nose</a>. Give it to him too on the same place quick as I&apos;d look at him.</p>
<p> Madcap Ciss. You had to laugh at her sometimes. For instance when she asked
you would you have some more Chinese tea and
<a name="s13014ac" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13014ac">jaspberry ram</a>
and when she drew the jugs too and the men&apos;s faces make you split your
sides or when she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to
<a name="s13009bb" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009bb">the miss white</a>.
That was just like
<a name="s13022au" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022au">Cissycums.</a> O,
and will you ever forget her the evening she dressed up in her father&apos;s
suit and hat and walked down
<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font>
smoking a cigarette. But she was sincerity itself,
<a name="s13022aq" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022aq">one of the bravest
and truest hearts heaven ever made</a>, a sterling good friend, not one of your
twofaced things too sweet to be wholesome. </p>
<p> And then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the pealing
anthem of the organ. It was the men&apos;s temperance novena conducted by the
missioner, the reverend father John Hughes
S.J.,<a target="foot" id="foo0047">&ordm;</a> rosary sermon and benediction of
the most blessed sacrament. They were there gathered together without
distinction of social class (and most edifying was it to see) in that simple
fane beside the waves after the storms of this weary world, kneeling humbly at
the feet of the immaculate, beseeching her to intercede for them, holy Mary,
holy virgin of virgins. How sad to poor Gerty&apos;s ears! Had her father only
avoided the clutches of
<a name="s13022av" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022av">the demon drink</a>
she might now be rolling in her carriage, second to none. Over and over had she
told herself that as she mused by the fireside
<a name="s13022b" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022b">in a brown study</a>,
<a name="s13021o" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13021o">her eyes on the dying
embers</a>, or <a name="s13017o" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13017o">gazing
out of the window</a> by the hour at the rain falling on the rusty bucket. But
that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearths and homes had cast its
shadow over her girlhood days. Nay, she had even witnessed in the home circle
deeds of violence caused by intemperance and had seen her own father, a prey to
the fumes of intoxication forget himself completely for if there was one thing
of all things that Gerty knew it was
that<a target="foot" id="foo0048">&ordm;</a> the man who lifts his hand to a
woman save in the way of kindness, deserves to be branded as the lowest of the low.</p>
<p> And still the voices sang in supplication to the virgin most powerful,
virgin most merciful. And Gerty, rapt in thought, scarce saw or heard her
companions or the twins at the boyish gambols or the gentleman off Sandymount
green that Cissy called the man that was so like himself passing along the
strand taking a short walk. You never saw him anyway screwed but still and for
all that <a name="s13017au" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13017au">she would
not like him for a father because he was too old</a> or something or on account
of his face (it was a palpable case of Doctor Fell) or his carbuncly nose with
the pimples on it. Poor father! With all his faults she loved him still when he
sang <i>Tell me, Mary, how to woo
thee</i><a target="foot" id="foo0050">&ordm;</a> and they had stewed cockles and
lettuce with salad dressing for supper and when he sang the duet <i>The moon
hath raised</i> with Mr Dignam that died suddenly and was buried, God have mercy
on him, from a stroke. Her mother&apos;s birthday that was and Charley was home
on his holidays and Tom and Mr Dignam and Mrs and Patsy and Freddy Dignam and
they were <a name="s13005a" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13005a">to have had
a group taken</a>. No-one would have thought
<a name="s13025o" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13025o">the end was so
near</a><a target="foot" id="foo0051">&ordm;</a>. Now he was
<a name="s13025s" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13025s">laid to rest</a>. And
her mother said to him to let that be a warning to him for the rest of his days
and he couldn&apos;t even go to the funeral on account of the gout and she had
to go into town to bring him the letters and samples from his office about
Catesby&apos;s cork lino, artistic designs, fit for a palace, gives tiptop wear
and always bright and cheery in the home.</p>
<p> A sterling good daughter was Gerty just like a second mother in the house, a
ministering angel too. And when her mother had those awful headaches who was it
rubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but Gerty though she didn&apos;t like
her mother&apos;s taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single thing
they ever had words about, taking snuff. It was Gerty who
<a name="s13009ac" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009ac">turned off the gas
every night at the main</a> and it was Gerty
<br><font color="green">{u22, 340}</font>
<br> who tacked up on the wall of
<a name="s13009t" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009t">that place</a> Mr
Tunney the grocer&apos;s christmas almanac, the picture of halcyon days where a
young gentleman in the dress they used to wear then with a threecornered hat
offered a bunch of flowers to his
<a name="s13010u" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010u">lady love</a> with
<a name="s13025aa" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13025aa">oldtime chivalry</a>
through the
<a name="s13012b" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13012b">lattice</a> window.
The colours were done lovely. She was in a
<a name="s13022al" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022al">soft clinging
white</a> and the gentleman in chocolate and he looked
<a name="s13010k" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010k">a thorough
aristocrat</a>. She often looked at them dreamily when she went there for a
certain purpose and thought about those times because she had found out in
Walker&apos;s pronouncing dictionary that
<a name="un4019am" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4019am">belonged to
grandpapa Giltrap</a><a target="foot" id="foo0055">&ordm;</a> about the halcyon days what they meant.</p>
<p> The twins were now playing in
<a name="s13022a" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022a">the most approved</a>
brotherly  fashion till at last master Jacky, who was really
<a name="s13018j" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13018j">as bold as brass</a>,
there was no getting behind that, deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever
he could down towards the seaweedy rocks. Needless to say, poor Tommy was not
slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was sitting
there by himself <a name="s13022c" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022c">came
to the rescue</a> and intercepted the ball. Our two champions claimed their
plaything with lusty cries and to avoid trouble Cissy Caffrey called to the
gentleman to throw it to her please. The gentleman aimed the ball once or twice
and then threw it along the strand towards Cissy Caffrey but it rolled down the
slope and stopped under Gerty&apos;s skirt near the little pool beside the rock.
The twins clamoured again for it and Cissy told her to kick it away and let them
fight for it so Gerty drew back her foot but she wished their stupid ball
hadn&apos;t come rolling down to her and she gave a
kick<a target="foot" id="foo0057">&ordm;</a> but she missed and Edy and Cissy laughed.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; If you fail try again, Edy Boardman said.</p>
<p> Gerty <a name="s13010s" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010s">smiled
assent</a>.<a target="foot" id="foo0058">&ordm;</a>
<a name="s13020t" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020t">A delicate pink crept
into her pretty cheeks</a> but she was determined to let them see so she just
lifted her skirt a little and took good aim and gave the ball a
<a name="s13022af" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022af">jolly good</a> kick
and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down towards the shingle.
Pure jealousy of course it was, nothing else
<a name="s13014ah" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13014ah">to draw
attention</a> on account of the gentleman opposite looking. She felt the warm
flush, a <a name="s13020al" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020al">danger
signal</a> always with Gerty MacDowell,
<a name="s13020p" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020p">surging</a> and
<a name="s13020al" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020al">flaming</a>
<a name="s13020p" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020p">into her cheeks</a>.
Till then they had only
<a name="s13022l" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022l">exchanged glances of
the most casual</a> but now under the brim of her new hat
<a name="s13020r" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020r">she ventured a
look</a> at him and
<a name="s13009bp" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009bp">the face</a> that
met her gaze there in the twilight, wan and
<a name="s13009bp" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009bp">strangely drawn</a>,
seemed to her <a name="s13020e" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020e">the saddest she had ever seen</a>.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 341}</font> </p>
<p> Through the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted and
with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain of original
sin. Spiritual vessel,
<a name="un4045bq" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4045bq">pray for us</a>,
honourable vessel, pray for us, vessel of singular devotion, pray for us,
mystical rose. And careworn hearts were there and toilers for their
<a name="s13010f" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010f">daily bread</a> and
many who had erred and wandered, their eyes
<a name="s13010d" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010d">wet with
contrition</a> but, for all that, bright with hope for the reverend father
Father Hughes had told them what the great saint Bernard had said in his famous
prayer  of Mary, the most pious virgin&apos;s intercessory power that it was not
recorded in any age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever abandoned by her.</p>
<p> The twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of childhood
are but as passing summer clouds. Cissy Caffrey played with baby Boardman till
he crowed with glee, clapping
<a name="s13009ba" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009ba">baby hands</a> in
air, <a name="s13018h" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13018h">crying peep</a>
behind the hood of the pushcar and Edy asked where was Cissy gone and then Cissy
popped up her head and said ah! (O, my! didn&apos;t the little chap enjoy that) And then she bade him say papa.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Say papa, baby. Say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa.</p>
<p> And baby did his level best to say it because he was very intelligent for
eleven months everyone said and he would certainly turn out to be something great, they said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ja, ja, ja, ja.</p>
<p> Cissy wiped his little mouth with the
<a name="s13020aj" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020aj">dribbling bib</a>
and wanted him to sit up properly and say pa, pa, pa. But when she undid the
strap she cried out, holy saint Denis, that he was
<a name="s13004q" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13004q">possing wet</a> and to
double the half blanket the other way under him. Of course his infant majesty
was most obstreperous at such toilet formalities and it was all no use telling
him about<a target="foot" id="foo0061">&ordm;</a> the
<a name="s13022g" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022g">geegee</a> and where
was the <a name="s13018f" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13018f">puffpuff</a>
but Ciss, always<a target="foot" id="foo0062">&ordm;</a> readywitted gave him in
his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen was quickly appeased.</p>
<p> Gerty wished to goodness they would take their baby home out of
that,<a target="foot" id="foo0063">&ordm;</a> no hour to be
out,<a target="foot" id="foo0064">&ordm;</a> and the little brats of twins. She
gazed out towards the distant sea. It was like a picture: the evening and the clouds coming
<br><font color="green">{u22, 342}</font>
<br> out and the Bailey light on Howth  and to hear the music like that and the
perfume they used in the church. And while she gazed
<a name="s13001bs" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13001bs">her heart went
pitapat</a>. Yes, it was her he was looking at, and
<a name="s13022ah" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022ah">there was meaning in
his look</a>. <a name="s13017b" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13017b">His eyes
burned into her as though they would search her through and through</a>, read
<a name="un4018l" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4018l">her very soul</a>.
<a name="s13020i" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020i">Wonderful eyes</a>
they were, superbly expressive,
<a name="s13020i" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020i">but could you trust
them?</a> <a name="s13013ci" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013ci">She could
see at once</a> by his dark eyes
<a name="s13013ci" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013ci">that he was a
foreigner</a> but she could not see whether he had
<a name="s13013ci" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013ci">an aquiline nose</a>
from where he was sitting.
<a name="s13013ae" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013ae">He was in deep
mourning, she could see that, and the story of a haunting sorrow was written on
his face.</a> She would have given worlds to know what it was. He was looking up
so intensely, so still and he saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the
bright steel buckles of if she swung them like that thoughtfully. She was glad
that something told her to put on the transparent stockings thinking Reggy Wylie
might be out but that was far away. Here was that of which she had so often
dreamed. The <a name="s13022at" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022at">heart
of the girl-woman went out to him</a>. If he had suffered, more sinned against
than sinning, or even, even, if he had been himself a sinner, a wicked man, she
cared not. There were
<a name="s13020bt" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020bt">wounds that wanted
healing</a> and she just yearned to know all, to forgive all if she could make
him <a name="s13021l" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13021l">fall in love</a>
with her, make him forget the memory of the past. Then mayhap he would embrace
her gently, <a name="s13020br" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020br">crushing
her soft body</a> to his, and
<a name="s13022ak" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022ak">love her</a>
<a name="s13022ak" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022ak">for herself alone</a>. </p>
<p> Refuge of sinners. Comfortress of the afflicted. <i>Ora pro nobis</i>. Well
has it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy can never
be lost or cast away: and fitly is she too a haven of refuge for the afflicted
because of the seven dolours which transpierced her own heart. Gerty could
picture the whole scene in the church, the stained glass windows lighted up, the
candles, the flowers and the blue banners of the blessed virgin&apos;s sodality and father
<br><font color="green">{u22, 343}</font>
<br> Conroy was helping canon O&apos;Hanlon at the altar, carrying things in and
out with his eyes cast down. He looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was
so quiet and clean and dark and his hands were just like white wax. He told her
that time when she told him about that at confession,
<a name="s13020ak" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020ak">crimsoning up to the
roots of her hair</a> for fear he could see, that she was not to be troubled
because that was only the voice of nature and we were all subject to
nature&apos;s laws, he said, in this life and that that was no sin because that
came from the nature of woman instituted by God, he said, and that our Blessed
Lady herself said to the archangel Gabriel be it done unto me according to Thy
Word. He was so kind and holy and often and often she thought could she work an
embroidered teacosy for him as a present or a clock but
<a name="s13009bc" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009bc">they had a clock</a>
she noticed on the mantelpiece white and gold with a canary that came out of a
little house to tell the time the day she went there about the flowers for the
forty hours&apos; adoration because it was hard to know what sort of a present
to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views of Dublin or some place.</p>
<p> The little brats of twins began to quarrel again and Jacky threw the ball
out towards the sea and they both ran after it. Common as ditchwater the little
monkeys. Someone ought to take them and give them a good hiding for themselves
to keep them in their places the both of them. And Cissy and Edy shouted after
them to come back because they were afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Jacky! Tommy! </p>
<p> Not they! What a great notion they had! So Cissy said it was the very last
time she&apos;d ever bring them out. She jumped up and called them and
then<a target="foot" id="foo0069">&ordm;</a> she ran down the slope past him,
tossing behind her her hair which had a good enough colour if there had been
more of it but with all the thingamerry she was always rubbing into it she
couldn&apos;t get it to grow long because it wasn&apos;t natural so she could
just go and throw her hat at it. She ran with long gandery strides it was a
wonder she didn&apos;t rip up her skirt at the side that was too tight on her
because there was a lot of the tomboy about Cissy Caffrey whenever she thought
she had a good opportunity to show off and just because she was a good runner
she ran like that so that he could see all the end of her petticoat running and
her skinny shanks up as far as possible. It would have served her just right if
she had tripped up over something with her high French heels on her to make her look tall and
<br><font color="green">{u22, 344}</font>
<br> got a fine tumble. That would have been a very charming expos&eacute; for a gentleman like that to witness.</p>
<p> Queen of angels, queen of patriarchs, queen of prophets, of all saints, they
prayed, queen of the most holy rosary and then Father Conroy handed the thurible
to Canon O&apos;Hanlon and he put in the incense and censed the blessed
sacrament and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and she was itching to give
them a good clip on the ear but she didn&apos;t because she thought he might be
watching but she never made a bigger mistake in all her life because Gerty could
see without looking that he never took his eyes off of her and then Canon
O&apos;Hanlon handed the thurible back to Father Conroy and knelt down looking
up at the blessed sacrament and the choir began to sing <i>Tantum ergo</i> and
she just swung her foot in and out in time to the <i>tantumer gosa cramen
tum</i>. Three and eleven she paid for those stockings in Sparrow&apos;s of
George&apos;s<a target="foot" id="foo0070">&ordm;</a> street on the Tuesday, no
the Monday before easter and there wasn&apos;t a brack on them and that was what
he was looking at, transparent, and not at her that had neither shape nor form
because he had eyes in his head to see the difference for himself. </p>
<p> Cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with her
hat anyhow on her on one side after her run and she did look a streel tugging
the two kids along with the blouse she bought only a fortnight before like a rag
on her back. Gerty just took off her hat for a moment to settle her hair and a a
prettier, a daintier head of nutbrown
<a name="s13024e" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13024e">tresses</a> was never
seen on a girl&apos;s shoulders, &mdash;<a target="foot" id="foo0071">&ordm;</a>
<a name="s13023j" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13023j">a radiant little
vision</a>, in sooth, almost
<a name="s13022bv" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022bv">maddening in its
sweetness</a>. You would have to travel many a long mile before you found a head
of hair the like of that. She could almost see the swift answering
flash<a target="foot" id="foo0072">&ordm;</a> of admiration in his eyes that
<a name="s13022cc" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022cc">set her tingling</a>
in every nerve. She put on her hat so that she could see from underneath the
brim and swung her buckled shoe faster for
<a name="s13020bn" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020bn">her breath
caught</a> as she read the expression of his eyes. He was eying her
<a name="s13022ap" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022ap">as a
snake</a><a target="foot" id="foo0074">&ordm;</a>
<a name="s13022ap" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022ap">eyes its prey</a>.
Her woman&apos;s instinct told her that
<a name="s13009bs" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009bs">she had raised the
devil in him</a> and at the thought
<a name="s13020bl" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020bl">a burning scarlet
swept from throat to brow</a> till the lovely
<a name="s13023an" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13023an">colour of her face became a glorious rose</a>.</p>
<p> Edy Boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at Gerty, half
smiling, with her specs like an old maid, pretending to hush the baby. Irritable
little gnat she was and always would be and that was why no-one could get on
with her poking her nose into what was no concern of hers. And she said to Gerty:
<br><font color="green">{u22, 345}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <a name="s13013bu" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013bu">A penny for your thoughts.</a></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What? laughed Gerty. I was only wondering was it late.</p>
<p> Because she wished they&apos;d take the snottynosed twins and the babby home
to the mischief out of that so that was why she just gave a gentle hint about it
being late. And when Cissy came up Edy asked her the time and Miss Cissy, as
glib as you like, said it was
<a name="s13009o" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009o">half past kissing
time</a>, time to kiss again. But Edy wanted to know because they were told to be in early.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Wait, said Cissy, I&apos;ll
ask<a target="foot" id="foo0076">&ordm;</a>
<a name="s13004ak" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13004ak">uncle</a> Peter over
there what&apos;s the time by his conundrum.</p>
<p> So over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his hand
out of his pocket, getting nervous, and beginning to play  with his watchchain,
looking up at the church. Passionate nature though he was Gerty could see that
he had enormous control over himself. One moment he had been there
<a name="s13022bu" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022bu">fascinated by a
loveliness that made him gaze</a>,<a target="foot" id="foo0077">&ordm;</a> the
passion seething in his veins and
<a name="s13020bb" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020bb">the next moment it
was the quiet gravefaced gentleman, selfcontrol expressed in every line of
his</a>
<a name="un4019ag" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4019ag">distinguished
looking</a> <a name="s13020bb" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020bb">figure</a>.</p>
<p> Cissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the right
time and Gerty could see him taking out his watch and
<a name="un4018d" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4018d">listening</a> and
looking up and looking at it: and he said he was very sorry his watch was
stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the sun was set.
<a name="s13020c" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020c">His voice had a
cultured ring in it</a> and there was
<a name="s13023b" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13023b">a suspicion of a
quiver in the mellow tones</a>. Cissy said thanks and came back with her tongue
out and said his waterworks were out of order.</p>
<p> Then they sang the second verse of the <i>Tantum ergo</i> and Canon
O&apos;Hanlon got up again and censed the blessed sacrament and knelt down and
he told Father Conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire to the
flowers and Father Conroy got up and settled it all right and she could see the
gentleman winding his watch and listening to the works. And she swung her leg
more in and out in time. It was getting darker but he could see and he was
looking all the time that he was winding the watch or whatever he was doing to
it and then he put it back. She felt a kind of a sensation rushing all over her
and she knew by the feel of her scalp and that irritation against her stays that
that thing was coming on because the last time was also when she clipped her
hair on account of the moon. His dark eyes fixed themselves on her
again,<a target="foot" id="foo0078">&ordm;</a> drinking in
<a name="s13005k" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13005k">her every</a>
<a name="s13005ad" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13005ad">contour</a>,
<br><font color="green">{u22, 346}</font>
<br> literally
<a name="s13005ac" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13005ac">worshipping at her
shrine</a>. If ever there was undisguised admiration in a man&apos;s passionate
gaze it was there plain to be seen on that man&apos;s face.
<a name="s13022r" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022r">It is for you,
Gertrude MacDowell,</a> <a name="s13025m" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13025m">and you know it</a>.</p>
<p> Edy began to get ready to go and she noticed that little hint she gave
<a name="s13014ae" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13014ae">had had the desired
effect</a> because it was a long way along the strand to where there was the
place to push up the pushcar and Cissy took off the twins&apos; caps and combed
their  hair to make herself attractive of course and Canon O&apos;Hanlon stood
up with his cope poking up at his neck and Father Conroy handed him the card to
read off and he read out <i>Panem de coelo praestitisti eis</i> and Edy and
Cissy were talking about the time all the time and asking her but Gerty could
pay them back in their own coin and she just
answered<a target="foot" id="foo0080">&ordm;</a> with
<a name="s13022h" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022h">scathing
politeness</a> when Edy asked her was she
<a name="s13022ai" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022ai">heartbroken</a>
about her best boy throwing her over.
<a name="s13015d" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13015d">Gerty winced
sharply.</a> A <a name="s13022u" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022u">brief
cold blaze shone from her eyes</a> that spoke of
<a name="s13025g" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13025g">scorn

<a name="s13023n" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13023n">yes</a>, it cut deep
because Edy had her own quiet way of saying things that she knew would wound

glanced at her new conquest for them to see.</p>

<p> Edy straightened up baby Boardman to get ready to go and Cissy tucked in the
ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because the
<a name="s13002d" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13002d">sandman</a> was on his
way for master Boardman junior. And Cissy Caffrey told him too that

coming and that baby was
<a name="s13017m" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13017m">to go deedaw</a> and

of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby, without as much as by your leave, sent up

<p> The slight contretemps

<p> Gerty stifled a
<a name="s13024k" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13024k">smothered
exclamation</a> and Edy asked what and she was just going to tell her to
<a name="s13025u" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13025u">catch it while it was
flying</a> but she was ever

<a name="s13024h" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13024h">deportment</a> so she
simply passed it off by saying that that was the benediction because just then
the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet seashore because Canon
O&apos;Hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that Father Conroy put round him
round his shoulders giving them the benediction with the blessed sacrament in his hands.</p>
<p> How moving the scene there in the gathering twilight, the last glimpse of
Erin, the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time a bat flew
forth from the<a target="foot" id="foo0089">&ordm;</a> ivied belfry through the
dusk, hither, thither, with a tiny lost cry. And she could see far away the
lights of the lighthouses and soon the lamplighter would be going his rounds
lighting the
<a name="s13010aa" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010aa">lamp</a> near her
window where Reggy Wylie used to turn the bicycle like she read in that book
<i>The Lamplighter</i> by Miss Cummins author of <i>Mabel Vaughan</i> and other
tales. For Gerty had
<a name="un5005aq" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5005aq">her dreams</a> that
no-one knew of. She loved to read poetry and, when she got a keepsake from
Bertha Supple of that lovely confession  album with the
<a name="s13013bp" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013bp">coralpink cover to
write her thoughts in</a> she laid it in the drawer of her toilet-table,
which,<a target="foot" id="foo0090">&ordm;</a> though it

<p> Canon O&apos;Hanlon put the blessed sacrament back into the tabernacle and
the choir sang <i>Laudate Dominum omnes gentes</i> and then he locked the

his hat to put on and Edy asked was she coming but Jacky Caffrey called out:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O, look, Cissy!</p>
<p> And they all looked

<p> And they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church,
helterskelter, Edy with the pushcar with baby Boardman in it and Cissy holding
Tommy and Jacky by the hand so they wouldn&apos;t fall, running.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Come on, Gerty, Cissy called. It&apos;s the bazaar
<a name="s13009bd" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009bd">fireworks</a>.</p>
<p> But Gerty was
<a name="s13002t" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13002t">adamant</a>. She had
no intention of being
<a name="s13022bh" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022bh">at their beck and
call</a>. If they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she could see
from where she was. The eyes that were fastened upon her set her
<a name="s13023ao" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13023ao">pulses tingling</a>.
She looked at him a moment,
<a name="s13025r" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13025r">meeting his
glance</a>, and <a name="s13023af" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13023af">a
light broke in upon her</a>.
<a name="s13014am" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13014am">Whitehot passion</a>
was in that face, passion
<a name="s13022ag" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022ag">silent as the
grave</a> and it had

<a name="s13009cg" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009cg">At last they were
left alone without the others</a> to pry and pass remarks and she knew he could
be trusted to the death,

<a name="s13010am" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010am">a man of</a>
<a name="s13010am" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010am">principle to his

<a name="s13009bd" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009bd">fireworks</a> were
and she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall back, looking up, and
there was no-one to see only him and her when she
<a name="s13022bp" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022bp">revealed all her
graceful beautifully shaped legs</a> like that,
<a name="s13022bq" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022bq">supply  soft and
delicately rounded</a>, and she seemed to hear the panting of his
heart,<a target="foot" id="foo0101">&ordm;</a>
<a name="s13009cd" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009cd">his hoarse
breathing</a>, because she knew too about the passion of men like that,
hotblooded because Bertha Supple told her once in secret about the gentleman
lodger that was staying with them out of the record office that had pictures cut
out of <a name="s13004be" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13004be">papers of
skirtdancers</a> and she said he used to do something not very nice that you
could imagine sometimes in the bed. But this was different from a thing like
that because there was all the difference because she could almost feel him
<a name="s13024l" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13024l">draw her face to
his</a> and the first
<a name="s13024j" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13024j">quick hot touch of his
handsome lips</a>. Besides there was absolution so long as you didn&apos;t do
the other thing before being married and there ought to be women priests that
would understand without telling out and Cissy Caffrey too sometimes had that
<a name="s13022e" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022e">dreamy</a> kind of
<a name="s13022e" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022e">dreamy</a> look in her
eyes so that she too, my dear, and besides it was on account of that other thing coming on the way it did.</p>
<p> And Jacky Caffrey shouted to look, there was another and she leaned back and
the garters were blue to match on account of the contrast with the transparent
and they all saw it and they all shouted to look,
look,<a target="foot" id="foo0102">&ordm;</a> there it was and she leaned back
ever so far to see the
<a name="s13009bd" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009bd">fireworks</a> and
something queer was flying through the air, a soft
thing,<a target="foot" id="foo0103">&ordm;</a> to and fro, dark. And she saw a long Roman candle going up over
<br><font color="green">{u22, 350}</font>
<br> the trees, up, up, and they were all breathless with excitement as it went
higher and higher and she had to lean back more and more to look up after it,
high, high, almost out of sight, and her face was suffused with
<a name="s13020s" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020s">a divine, an
entrancing blush</a> from straining back and he could see her other things too,
nainsook <a name="s13021d" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13021d">knickers</a>,
four and eleven, on account of being white and she let him and she saw that he
saw and then it went so high it went out of sight a moment and she was trembling
in every limb from being bent so far back that he could see high up above her
knee where no-one ever and she wasn&apos;t ashamed to look in that immodest  way
like that because he couldn&apos;t resist the sight like those skirtdancers
behaving so immodest before men looking and he wasn&apos;t either, looking,
looking. She would fain have cried to him
<a name="s13020bs" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020bs">chokingly</a>, held

everybody cried O! O! and it shot out of it a stream of rain gold hair threads
and they burst and ah! they were all greeny dewy stars falling with golden, O so lovely, O, soft, sweet, soft!</p>
<p> Then all melted away dewily in the grey air: all was silent. Ah! She glanced
at him as she bent forward quickly, a glance of
<a name="s13015e" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13015e">piteous protest</a>,
of shy reproach under which he
<a name="s13012h" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13012h">coloured like a

parted</a>. Slowly, without looking back she went down the uneven strand to
Cissy, to Edy, to Jacky and Tommy Caffrey, to little baby Boardman. It was
darker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and slippy
seaweed. She walked with a certain quiet dignity but with care and slowly
