not too chilly. Many a time and oft were they wont to come there to that
favourite nook to have a cosy chat and discuss matters feminine, Cissy Caffrey
and Edy Boardman with the baby in the pushcar and Tommy and Jacky Caffrey, two
little curlyheaded boys, dressed in sailor suits with caps to match and the name
<i>H.M.S. Belleisle</i> printed on both. For Tommy and Jacky Caffrey were twins,
scarce four years old and very noisy and spoiled twins

but for all that darling little fellows with bright merry faces and endearing
ways about them. They were dabbling in the sand with their spades and buckets,
building castles as children do, or playing with their big coloured ball,
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">as</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
happy as the day was long. And Edy Boardman was rocking the chubby baby to and
fro in the pushcar while that young gentleman fairly chuckled with delight. He
was but eleven months and nine days old and, though still a tiny toddler, was
just beginning to lisp his first babyish words. Cissy
<br><font color="green">{u21, 386}</font>
<br> Caffrey bent over to him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty dimple in his chin.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Now, baby, Cissy Caffrey said. Say out big, big. I want a drink of water.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 332}</font> </p>
<p> And baby prattled after her:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A jink a jink a jawbo.</p>
<p> Cissy Caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of children, so
patient with little sufferers and Tommy Caffrey could never be got to take his
castor oil unless it was Cissy Caffrey that held his nose. But to be sure baby
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Boardman</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
was as good as gold, a perfect little dote in his new fancy bib.

<font color="black">beauties</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
was Cissy Caffrey. A truerhearted girl never drew the breath of life, always
with a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her cherryripe red
lips, a girl lovable in the extreme. And Edy Boardman laughed too at the quaint language of little brother.</p>
<p> But just then there was a slight altercation between Master Tommy and Master
Jacky. Boys will be boys and the two twins were no exception to
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the</span></span>
<font color="black">this
</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font> rule. The apple of
discord was a certain castle of sand which Master Jacky had built and Master
Tommy would have it right go wrong that it was to be architecturally improved by
a frontdoor like the Martello tower had. But if Master Tommy was headstrong
Master Jacky was selfwilled too and, true to the maxim that every little
Irishman&apos;s house is his castle, he fell upon his hated rival and to such
purpose that the wouldbe assailant came to grief and (alas to relate!) the
coveted castle too. Needless to say the cries of discomfited Master Tommy drew the attention of the girl friends.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Come here, Tommy, his sister called
imperatively<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.
At</span></span><font color="black">,
at</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font> once! And you,
Jacky, for shame to throw poor Tommy in the dirty sand. Wait till I catch you for that.</p>
<p> His eyes misty with unshed tears Master Tommy came at her call for their big
sister&apos;s word was law with the twins. And in a sad plight he was
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">too</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
after his misadventure. His little man-o&apos;-war top and
<br><font color="green">{u21, 387}</font>
<br> unmentionables were full of sand but Cissy was a past mistress in the art
of smoothing
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">out</span></span>
<font color="black">over<a target="foot" id="foo0013">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
life&apos;s tiny troubles and very quickly not one speck of sand was to be seen
on his smart little suit. Still the blue eyes were glistening with hot tears
that would well up so she shook her hand at Master Jacky the culprit, her eyes dancing in admonition.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Nasty bold
Jacky<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><font color="black">!</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>

<font color="black">cried</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>.</p>
<p> She put

<font color="black">an</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What&apos;s your name? Butter and cream?
<br><font color="green">{u22, 333}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Tell us who is your sweetheart, spoke Edy Boardman. Is Cissy your sweetheart?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Nao, tearful Tommy said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Is Edy Boardman your sweetheart? Cissy queried.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Nao, Tommy said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I know, Edy Boardman said none too amiably with an arch
glance from her shortsighted eyes. I know who is Tommy&apos;s sweetheart. Gerty is Tommy&apos;s sweetheart.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Nao, Tommy said on the verge of tears.</p>
<p> Cissy&apos;s quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to Edy
Boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman couldn&apos;t
see and to mind he didn&apos;t wet his new tan shoes.</p>
<p> But who was Gerty?</p>
<p> Gerty MacDowell who was seated near her companions, lost in thought, gazing
far away into the distance was in very truth as fair a specimen of winsome Irish
girlhood as one could wish to see. She was pronounced beautiful by all who knew
her though, as folks often said, she was more a Giltrap than a MacDowell. Her
figure was slight and graceful, inclining even to fragility but those iron
jelloids she had been taking of late had done her a world of good and she was
much better of those discharges she used to get. The waxen pallor of her face
was almost spiritual in its ivorylike purity. Her hands were of
<br><font color="green">{u21, 388}</font>
<br> finely veined alabaster with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice
and queen of ointments could make them though it was not true that she used to
wear kid gloves in bed. Bertha Supple told that once to Edy Boardman when she
was black out with Gerty (the girl chums had of course their little tiffs from
time to time like the rest of mortals) and she told her not to let on whatever
she did that it was her that told her or she&apos;d never speak to her again.
No. Honour where honour is due. There was an innate refinement, a languid
queenly hauteur about Gerty which was unmistakably evidenced in her delicate
hands and
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></SUP></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">high
arched</span></span>
<font color="black">higharched</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
instep. Had kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in
her own right and had she only received the benefit of a good education Gerty
MacDowell might easily have held her own beside any lady

the land and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow and
patrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their devoirs to

a look, tense with suppressed meaning, that imparted a strange yearning tendency
to the beautiful eyes, a charm few could resist. Why have women such eyes of
witchery? Gerty&apos;s were of the bluest Irish blue, set off by lustrous lashes
and dark expressive
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">expressive</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>

which gave that haunting expression to the eyes, so becoming in leaders of
fashion, and she had never regretted it. But Gerty&apos;s crowning glory was her
wealth of hair. It was dark brown with a natural wave in it. She had cut it that
very morning on account of the new moon and it nestled about her pretty head in
a profusion of luxuriant clusters. And just now at Edy&apos;s words as a
telltale flush, delicate as the faintest rosebloom, crept into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her
<br><font color="green">{u21, 389}</font>
<br> sweet girlish shyness that of a surety God&apos;s fair land of Ireland did not hold her equal.</p>
<p> For an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes. She was about
to retort but something checked the words on her tongue. Inclination prompted
her to speak out: dignity told her to be silent. The pretty lips pouted awhile
but then she glanced up and broke
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><font color="black">out</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
into a joyous little laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young May
morning. She knew right well, no-one better, what made squinty Edy say that. As
per usual somebody&apos;s nose was out of joint about the boy that had the
bicycle
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">off

Only now his father kept him in in the evenings studying hard to get an
exhibition in the intermediate that was on and he was going
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">to

Trinity college university. Little recked he perhaps for what she felt, that
dull ache in her heart sometimes, piercing to the core. Yet he was young and
perchance
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">in

protestants in his family and of course Gerty knew who came first and after Him
the blessed virgin and then saint Joseph. But he was undeniably handsome and he

<font color="black">was</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>

and that was why Edy Boardman thought she was so frightfully clever because he
didn&apos;t go and ride up and down in front of her bit of a garden.</p>
<p> Gerty was dressed simply but with instinctive taste for she felt that there
was just a might that he might be out. A neat blouse of electric

skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful figure to perfection. She
wore a coquettish wideleaved hat of nigger straw with an underbrim of eggblue

<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">of

All Tuesday week afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at last
she found what she wanted

the very it, slightly shopsoiled but you would never notice, seven fingers two
and a penny. She did it up all by herself and tried it on then, smiling back at
her lovely reflection in the
mirror<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
and when she put it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew that that would
take the shine out of some people she knew. Her shoes were the newest thing in
footwear (Edy Boardman prided herself that she was very petite but she never had
a foot like Gerty MacDowell, a five, and never would
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">have,</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
ash, oak or elm) with patent toecaps and just one smart buckle. Her wellturned
ankle displayed its proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and
no more of her shapely leg encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and
wide garter tops. As for undies they were Gerty&apos;s chief care and who that
knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen (though Gerty would
never see seventeen again) can find it in his heart to blame her? She had four
dinky sets, three articles and nighties extra, and each set slotted with
different coloured ribbons, rosepink, pale blue, mauve and peagreen and she
aired them herself
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><font color="black">and
blued them</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font> when they

A gnawing sorrow is there all the time. Her very soul is in her eyes and she
would give worlds to be in her own familiar chamber where she could have a good
cry and relieve her pentup feelings. The paly light of evening falls upon a face
infinitely sad and wistful. Gerty MacDowell yearns in vain. Yes, she had known
from the
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">very</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
first that it was not to be. He was too young to understand. He would not
believe in love. The night of the party long ago in Stoer&apos;s (he was still
in short trousers) when they were alone and he stole an arm round her waist she
went white to the very lips. He called her little one and half kissed her (the
first!) but it was only the end of her nose and then he hastened from the room
with a remark about refreshments. Impetuous fellow! Strength of character had
never been Reggy Wylie&apos;s strong point and he who would woo and win Gerty
MacDowell must be a man among men. But waiting, always waiting to be asked and
it was leap year too and would soon be over. No prince charming is her beau
ideal to lay a rare and wondrous love at her feet but rather a manly man with a
strong quiet face, perhaps his hair slightly flecked with grey, and who would
understand, take her in his sheltering arms, strain her to him in all the
strength of his deep passionate nature and comfort her with a long long kiss.
For such a one she yearns this balmy summer eve. With all the heart of her she
longs to be his only, his affianced bride for riches for poor in sickness in
health till death us two part from this to this day forward.

<p> And while Edy Boardman was with little Tommy behind the pushcar she was just
thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself
<br><font color="green">{u22, 337}</font>
<br> his little wife to be. Then they could talk about her, Bertha Supple
too<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>

spitfire, because she would be twentytwo in November. She would care for him
with creature comforts too for Gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man
liked that feeling of homeyness. Her

then cream the milk and sugar and whisk well the white of eggs and they would
have a nice drawingroom with pictures and chintz covers for the chairs and that

for a husband) with glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed sweeping
moustache and every morning they would both have brekky for their own two selves
and before he went out to business he would give her a good hearty hug and gaze
for a moment deep down into her eyes.</p>
<p> Edy Boardman asked Tommy Caffrey was he done and he said yes so then she
buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run off and play
with Jacky and to be good and not to fight. But Tommy said he wanted the ball
and Edy told him no that baby was playing with the ball and if he took it
there&apos;d be wigs on the green but Tommy said it was his ball

now with him and she told Cissy Caffrey not to give in to him.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You&apos;re not my sister, naughty Tommy said. It&apos;s my ball.</p>
<p> But Cissy Caffrey told baby Boardman to look up, look up high at her finger
and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand and Tommy after it in full career, having won the day.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Anything for a quiet life, laughed Ciss.</p>

<p class="di">&mdash; I&apos;d like to give him something, she said, so I would, where I won&apos;t say.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; On the beeoteetom, laughed Cissy merrily.</p>
<p> Gerty MacDowell bent down her head at the idea of Cissy saying a thing like
that out she&apos;d be ashamed of her life to say, flushing a deep rosy red and
Edy Boardman said she was sure the gentleman opposite heard what she said. But
not a pin cared

<p> Madcap Ciss. You had to laugh at her sometimes. For instance when she asked
you would you have some more Chinese tea and jaspberry ram and when she drew the
jugs too and the men&apos;s faces make you split your sides or when she said she
wanted to run and pay a visit to the miss white. That was just like Cissycums.

avoided the clutches of the demon drink she might now be rolling in her

But that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearths and homes had cast its
shadow over her

intemperance and had seen her own father, a prey to the fumes of
intoxication<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>

like him for a father because he was too old or something or on account of his

faults she loved him still when he sang <i>Tell me, Mary, how to woo thee</i>
and they had stewed cockles and lettuce with salad dressing for supper and when
he sang

so near. Now he was laid to rest. And her mother said to him to let that be a
warning to him for the rest of his days and he couldn&apos;t even go to the
funeral on account of the gout and she had to go into town to bring him the
letters and samples from his office about Catesby&apos;s cork lino, artistic
designs, fit for a palace, gives tiptop wear and always bright and cheery in the home.</p>

dreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and thought about those times
because she had found out in Walker&apos;s pronouncing dictionary that belonged

there was no getting behind
that<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he could down towards the seaweedy

poor Tommy was not slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black
who was sitting there by himself came to the rescue and intercepted the ball.
Our two champions claimed their plaything with lusty cries and to avoid trouble
Cissy Caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it to her please. The gentleman
aimed the ball once or twice and then threw it
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">along</span></span>
<font color="black">up</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>

and let them fight for
it<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><font color="black">it</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
so Gerty drew back her foot but she wished their stupid ball hadn&apos;t come
rolling down to her and she gave a kick but she missed and Edy and Cissy laughed.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; If you fail try again, Edy Boardman said.</p>
<p> Gerty smiled assent. A delicate pink crept into her pretty

<font color="black">cheek</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted her skirt a little
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><font color="black">but
just enough</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font> and took
good aim and gave the ball a jolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two
twins after it down towards the shingle. Pure jealousy of course it
was<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
nothing else to draw attention on account of the gentleman opposite looking. She
felt the warm flush, a danger signal always with Gerty MacDowell, surging and
flaming into her cheeks. Till then they had only exchanged glances of the most
casual but now under the brim of her new hat she ventured a look at him and the
face that met her gaze there in the twilight, wan and strangely drawn, seemed to her the saddest she had ever seen.

baby home out of that, no hour to be out, and the little brats of twins. She
gazed out towards the distant sea. It was like a

looking
at<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
and there was meaning in his look. His eyes burned into her as though they would
search her through and through, read her very soul. Wonderful eyes they were,
superbly expressive, but could you trust them? She could see at once by his dark
eyes that he was a foreigner but she could not see whether he had an aquiline
nose from where he was sitting. He was in deep mourning, she could see that, and
the story of a haunting sorrow was written on his face. She would have given
worlds to know what it was. He was looking up so
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">intensely</span></span>
<font color="black">intently</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>,

buckles of

shoes<a target="foot" id="foo0066">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
if she swung them like that thoughtfully. She was glad that something told her
to put on the transparent stockings thinking Reggy Wylie might be out but that
was far away. Here was that of which she had so often dreamed. The heart of the
girl-woman went out to him. If he had suffered, more sinned against than
sinning, or even, even, if he had been himself a sinner, a wicked man, she cared
not. There were wounds that wanted healing and she just yearned to know all, to
forgive all if she could make him fall in love with her, make him forget the
memory of the past. Then mayhap he would embrace her gently, crushing her soft
body to
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">his</span></span>
<font color="black">him</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>, and love her for herself alone.

has it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy can never
be lost or cast away: and fitly is she too a haven of refuge for the afflicted
because of the seven dolours which transpierced her own heart. Gerty could
picture the whole scene in the church, the stained glass windows lighted up, the
candles, the flowers and the blue banners of the blessed virgin&apos;s sodality

O&apos;Hanlon at the altar, carrying things in and out with his eyes cast down.
He looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet and clean and dark
and his hands were just like white wax. He told her that time when she told him
about that

crimsoning up to the roots of her hair for fear he could see,
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">that
she was</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font> not
to be troubled because that was only the voice of nature and we were all subject
to nature&apos;s laws, he said, in this life and that that was no sin because
that came from the nature of woman instituted by God, he said, and that

Blessed Lady herself said to the archangel Gabriel be it done unto me according
to Thy Word. He was so kind and holy and often and often she thought could she
work an embroidered teacosy for him as a present or a clock but they had a clock
she noticed on the mantelpiece white and gold with a canary that came out of a
little house to tell the time the day she went there about the flowers for the
forty hours&apos; adoration because it was hard to know what sort of a present
to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views of Dublin or some place.</p>
<p> The little brats of twins began to quarrel again and Jacky threw the ball
out towards the sea and they both ran after it.

<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><font color="black">common

Someone ought to take them and give them a good hiding for themselves to keep
them in their places the both of them. And Cissy and Edy shouted after them to
come back because they were afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Jacky! Tommy!
<br><font color="green">{u21, 400}</font> </p>
<p> Not they! What a great notion they had! So Cissy said it was the very last
time she&apos;d ever bring them out. She jumped up and called them and then she
ran down the slope past him, tossing
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">behind
her</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font> her hair
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><font color="black">behind
her</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font> which had a good
enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the thingamerry she was
always rubbing into it she couldn&apos;t get it to grow long because it
wasn&apos;t natural so she could just go and throw her hat at it. She ran with
long gandery strides it was a wonder she didn&apos;t rip up her skirt at the
side that was too tight on her because there was a lot of the tomboy about Cissy
Caffrey whenever she thought she had a good opportunity to show off and just
because she was a good runner she ran like that so that he could see all the end
of her petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as possible. It would
have served her just right if she had tripped up over something with her high
French heels on her to make her look tall and
<br><font color="green">{u22, 344}</font>
<br> got a fine tumble. That would have been a very charming expos&eacute; for a gentleman like that to witness.</p>
<p> Queen of angels, queen of patriarchs, queen of prophets, of all saints, they
prayed, queen of the most holy rosary and then Father Conroy handed the thurible
to Canon O&apos;Hanlon and he put in the incense and censed the blessed
sacrament and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and she was itching to give
them a good clip on the ear but she didn&apos;t because she thought he might be
watching but she never made a bigger mistake in
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">all</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
her life because Gerty could see without looking that he never took his eyes off
of her and then Canon O&apos;Hanlon handed the thurible back to Father Conroy
and knelt down looking up at the blessed sacrament and the choir began to sing
<i>Tantum ergo</i> and she just swung her foot in and out in time to the
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext"><i>tantumer</i></span></span>
<font color="black"><i>Tantumer</i></font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
<i>gosa cramen tum</i>. Three and eleven she paid for those stockings in
Sparrow&apos;s of George&apos;s street on the Tuesday, no the Monday before
easter and there wasn&apos;t a brack on them and that was what he was looking
at, transparent, and not at her that had neither shape nor form because he had
eyes in his head to see the difference for himself.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 401}</font> </p>
<p> Cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with her
hat anyhow on her on one side after her run and she did look a streel tugging
the two kids along with the blouse she bought only a fortnight before like a rag
on her back. Gerty just took off her hat for a moment to settle her hair and a
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">a</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
prettier, a daintier head of nutbrown tresses was never seen on a girl&apos;s
shoulders<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
&mdash; a radiant little vision, in sooth, almost maddening in its sweetness.
You would have to travel many a long mile before you found a head of hair the
like of that. She could almost see the swift answering flash of admiration in
his eyes that set her tingling in every nerve. She put on her hat so that she
could see from underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster for her
breath caught as she
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">read</span></span>
<font color="black">caught</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
the expression
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">of</span></span>
<font color="black">in</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
his eyes. He was eying her as a snake eyes its prey. Her woman&apos;s instinct
told her that she had raised the devil in him and at the thought a burning
scarlet swept from throat to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a glorious rose.</p>
<p> Edy Boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at Gerty, half
smiling, with her
specs<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
like an old maid, pretending to
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">hush</span></span>
<font color="black">nurse</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
the baby. Irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was why
no-one could get on with
her<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
poking her nose into what was no concern of hers. And she said to Gerty:
<br><font color="green">{u22, 345}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A penny for your thoughts.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What? laughed Gerty. I was only wondering was it late.</p>
<p> Because she wished
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><font color="black">to
goodness</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font> they&apos;d
take the snottynosed twins and
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the
babby</span></span> <font color="black">their
baby<a target="foot" id="foo0075">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just gave a gentle hint
about it being late. And when Cissy came up Edy asked her the time and Miss
Cissy, as glib as you like, said it was half past kissing time, time to kiss
again. But Edy wanted to know because they were told to be in early.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Wait, said Cissy, I&apos;ll ask
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><font color="black">my</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
uncle Peter over there what&apos;s the time by his conundrum.</p>
<p> So over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his hand
out of his pocket, getting nervous, and beginning to play
<br><font color="green">{u21, 402}</font>
<br> with his watchchain, looking
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">up</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
at the church. Passionate nature though he was Gerty could see that he had
enormous control over himself. One moment he had been
there<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze,
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the
passion seething in his
veins</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font> and the
next moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman, selfcontrol expressed in
every line of his
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">distinguished
looking</span></span>
<font color="black">distinguishedlooking</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font> figure.</p>
<p> Cissy said to excuse her would he mind
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">please</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
telling her what was the right time and Gerty could see him taking out his watch
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">and</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
listening
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><font color="black">to
it</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font> and looking up
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">and
looking at
it:</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font> and he
said he was very sorry his watch was stopped but he thought it must be after
eight because the sun was set. His voice had a cultured ring in it and there was
a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones. Cissy said thanks and came back
with her tongue out and said his waterworks were out of order.</p>
<p> Then they sang the second verse of the <i>Tantum ergo</i> and Canon
O&apos;Hanlon got up again and censed the blessed sacrament and knelt down and
he told Father Conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire to the
flowers and Father Conroy got up and settled it all right and she could see the
gentleman winding his watch and listening to the
works<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.
And</span></span>
<font color="black">and</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
she swung her leg more in and out in time. It was getting darker but he could
see and he was looking all the time that he was winding the watch or whatever he
was doing to it and then he put it back
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><font color="black">and put
his hands back into his
pockets</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>. She felt a
kind of a sensation rushing all over her and she knew by the feel of her scalp
and that irritation against her stays that that thing
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">was</span></span>
<font color="black">must
be</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font> coming on because
the last time
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><font color="black">too</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
was
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">also</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
when she clipped her hair on account of the moon. His dark eyes fixed themselves
on her again, drinking in her every contour,
<br><font color="green">{u22, 346}</font>
<br> literally worshipping at her shrine. If ever there was undisguised
admiration in a man&apos;s passionate gaze it was there plain to be seen on that
man&apos;s face. It is for you, Gertrude MacDowell, and you know it.</p>
<p> Edy began to get ready to go and she noticed that
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><font color="black">that<a target="foot" id="foo0079">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
little hint she gave had
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">had</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
the desired effect because it was a long way along the strand to where there was
the place to push up the pushcar and Cissy took off the twins&apos; caps and
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">combed</span></span>
<font color="black">tidied</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font> their
<br><font color="green">{u21, 403}</font>
<br> hair to make herself attractive of course and Canon O&apos;Hanlon stood up
with his cope poking up at his neck and Father Conroy handed him the card to
read off and he read out <i>Panem de coelo praestitisti eis</i> and Edy and
Cissy were talking about the time all the time and asking her but Gerty could
pay them back in their own coin and she just answered with scathing politeness
when Edy asked her was she heartbroken about her best boy throwing her over.
Gerty winced sharply. A brief cold blaze shone from her eyes that spoke of scorn
immeasurable. It hurt &mdash; O yes, it cut deep because Edy had her own quiet
way of saying things
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><font color="black">like</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
that she knew would wound like the confounded little cat she was. Gerty&apos;s
lips parted swiftly but she fought back the sob that rose to her throat, so
slim, so
flawless<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
so beautifully
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">modelled</span></span>
<font color="black">moulded</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of. She had loved him better than he
knew. Lighthearted deceiver and fickle like all his sex he would never
understand what he had meant to her and for an instant there was in the blue
eyes a quick stinging of tears. Their eyes were probing her mercilessly but with
a brave effort she sparkled back in sympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them to see.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O, she laughed, and the proud head flashed up. I can throw
my cap at who I like because it&apos;s leap year.</p>
<p> Her words rang out
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">crystal
clear</span></span>
<font color="black">crystalclear</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>,
more musical than the cooing of the ringdove but they cut the silence icily.
There was that in her young voice that told that she was not a one to be lightly
trifled with. Miss Edy&apos;s countenance fell to no slight extent and Gerty
could see by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a towering
rage because that shaft had struck home and they both knew that she was
something aloof, apart, in another sphere, that she was
<br><font color="green">{u21, 404}</font>
<br> not of them and never would be and there
<br><font color="green">{u22, 347}</font>
<br> was somebody else too that knew it and saw it so they could put that in their pipe and smoke it.</p>
<p> Edy straightened up baby Boardman to get ready to go and Cissy tucked in the
ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because the sandman was
on his way for
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">master</span></span>

And</span></span>
<font color="black">and</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
Cissy
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Caffrey</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
told him too that
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">billy
winks</span></span> <font color="black">Billy
Winks</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font> was coming and
that baby was to go deedaw and baby looked just too ducky, laughing up out of
his gleeful
eyes<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
and Cissy poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby, without
as much as by your leave, sent up his compliments to all and sundry on to his brand new dribbling bib.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O my!
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></SUP></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">puddeny</span></span>

<p> The slight contretemps claimed her attention but in two
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">two</span></span>
<font color="black">twos<a target="foot" id="foo0088">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
she set that little matter to rights.</p>
<p> Gerty stifled a smothered exclamation and Edy asked what and she was just
going to tell her to catch it while it was flying but she was ever ladylike in
her deportment so she simply passed it off by saying that that was the
benediction because just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet
seashore because Canon O&apos;Hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that
Father Conroy put round him round his shoulders giving them the benediction with the blessed sacrament in his hands.</p>
<p> How moving the scene there in the gathering twilight, the last glimpse of
Erin, the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time a bat flew
forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk, hither, thither, with a tiny lost
cry. And she could see far away the lights of the lighthouses and soon the
lamplighter would be going his rounds lighting the lamp near her window where
Reggy Wylie used to turn the bicycle like she read in that book <i>The
Lamplighter</i> by Miss
Cummins<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
author of <i>Mabel Vaughan</i> and other tales. For Gerty had her dreams that
no-one knew of. She loved to read poetry
and<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,
when</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font> she got
a keepsake from Bertha Supple of that lovely confession
<br><font color="green">{u21, 405}</font>
<br> album with the coralpink cover to write her thoughts in she laid it in the
drawer of her
toilet-table<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
which, though it did not err on the side of luxury, was scrupulously neat and
clean. It was there she kept her girlish treasure trove, the tortoiseshell
combs, her child of Mary badge, the whiterose scent, the
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">eyebrowline</span></span>
<font color="black">eyebrowleine</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>,
her alabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to change when her things came home
from the wash and there were some beautiful thoughts written in it in violet ink that she bought in Wisdom Hely&apos;s
<br><font color="green">{u22, 348}</font>
<br> for she felt that she too could write poetry if she could only express
herself like that
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">poetry</span></span>
<font color="black">poem</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
she had copied out of the newspaper she found one evening round the potherbs.
<i>Art thou real, my ideal?</i> it was called by Louis J
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Walsh</span></span>
<font color="black">Walshe</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>,
Magherafelt, and after there was something about <i>twilight, wilt thou
ever?</i> and often the beauty of poetry, so sad in its transient loveliness had
misted her eyes with silent tears
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">for
she felt</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font> that
the years were slipping by for her, one by one, and but for that one shortcoming
she knew she need fear no

<font color="black">competition</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
and that was
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><font color="black">an<a target="foot" id="foo0094">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
accident coming down the hill and she always tried to conceal it. But it must
end, she felt. If she saw that magic lure in his eyes there would be no holding
back for her. Love laughs at locksmiths. She would make the great sacrifice.
Dearer than the whole world would she be to him and gild his days with
happiness. There was the
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">all
important</span></span>
<font color="black">allimportant</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
question and she was dying to know was he a married man or a widower who had
lost his wife or some tragedy like the nobleman with the foreign name from the
land of song had to have her put into a madhouse, cruel only to be kind. But
even if &mdash; what then? Would it make a very great
difference<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span><font color="black">?</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
From everything in the least indelicate her finebred nature instinctively
recoiled. She loathed that sort of person, the fallen women off the accomodation
walk beside the Dodder that went with the soldiers and coarse men, degrading the
sex and being taken up to the police station. No, no: not that. They would be
just good friends in spite of the conventions of society with a big ess. Perhaps
it was an old flame he was in mourning for from the days beyond recall. She thought she
<br><font color="green">{u21, 406}</font>
<br> understood. She would try to understand him because men were so different.
The old love was waiting, waiting with little white hands stretched out, with
blue appealing eyes. She would follow the dictates of her heart for love was the
master guide. Nothing else mattered. Come what might she would be wild, untrammelled, free.</p>
<p> Canon O&apos;Hanlon put the blessed sacrament back into the tabernacle and
the choir sang <i>Laudate Dominum omnes gentes</i> and then he locked the
tabernacle door because the benediction was over and Father Conroy handed him
his hat to put on and Edy asked was she coming but Jacky Caffrey called out:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O, look, Cissy!</p>
<p> And they all looked was it sheet lightning but Tommy saw it too over the
trees beside the church, blue and then green and purple.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 349}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It&apos;s fireworks, Cissy Caffrey said.</p>
<p> And they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church,
helterskelter, Edy with the pushcar with baby Boardman in it and Cissy holding
Tommy and Jacky by the hand so they wouldn&apos;t
fall<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
running.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Come on, Gerty, Cissy called. It&apos;s the bazaar fireworks.</p>
<p> But Gerty was adamant. She had no intention of being at their beck and call.
If they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she could see from
where she was. The eyes that were fastened upon her set her pulses tingling. She
looked at him a moment, meeting his glance, and a light broke in upon her.
Whitehot passion was in that face, passion silent as the grave and it had made
her his. At last they were left alone without the others to pry and pass remarks
and she knew he could be trusted to the death, steadfast, a man of
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></SUP></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">principle</span></span>
<font color="black">honour<a target="foot" id="foo0099">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
to his fingertips. She leaned back far to

and there was no-one to see only him and her when she revealed all her graceful
beautifully shaped legs like that, supply
<br><font color="green">{u21, 407}</font>
<br> soft and delicately rounded, and she seemed to hear the panting of his
heart, his hoarse breathing, because she knew
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">too</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
about the passion of men like that,
hotblooded<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
because Bertha Supple told her once in secret about the gentleman lodger that
was staying with them out of the record office that had pictures cut out of
papers of
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><font color="black">those</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
skirtdancers and she said he used to do something not very nice that you could
imagine sometimes in the bed. But this was different from a thing like that
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">because</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
there was all the difference because she could almost feel him draw her face to
his and the first quick hot touch of his handsome lips. Besides there was
absolution so long as you didn&apos;t do the other thing before being married
and there ought to be women priests that would understand without telling out
and Cissy Caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy look in her eyes
so that she too, my dear, and besides it was on account of that other thing coming on the way it did.</p>
<p> And Jacky Caffrey shouted to look, there was another and she leaned back and
the garters were blue to match on account of
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the

to look, look, there it was and she leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks
and something queer was flying
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><font color="black">about</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
through the air, a soft thing, to and fro, dark. And she saw a long Roman candle going up over
<br><font color="green">{u22, 350}</font>
<br> the
trees<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
up, up, and they were all breathless with excitement as it went higher and
higher and she had to lean back more and more to look up after it, high, high,
almost out of sight, and her face was suffused with a divine, an entrancing
blush from straining back and he could see her other things too, nainsook
knickers, four and eleven, on account of being white and she let him and she saw
that he saw and then it went so high it went out of sight a moment and she was
trembling in every limb from being bent so far back that he could see high up
above her knee where no-one ever and she wasn&apos;t ashamed
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><font color="black">and he
wasn&apos;t either</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font> to look in that immodest
<br><font color="green">{u21, 408}</font>
<br> way like that because he couldn&apos;t resist the sight like those
skirtdancers behaving so immodest before
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">men</span></span>
<font color="black">gentlemen</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>

him to come, to feel his lips laid on her white brow.

it</span></span> <font color="black">the Roman

<font color="black">shed</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>

<font color="black">so</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font> soft, sweet, soft!</p>
<p> Then all melted away dewily in the grey air: all was silent. Ah! She glanced
at him as she bent forward quickly, a glance of piteous protest, of shy reproach
under which he coloured like a girl. He was leaning back against the rock
behind. Leopold Bloom (for it is he) stands silent with bowed head before those
young guileless eyes. What a brute he had been! At it again? A fair unsullied
soul had called
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><font color="black">to
him</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font> and, wretch that
he was, how had he answered?

an</span></span>
<font color="black">An</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>
utter cad he had been! But there was an infinite store of mercy in those eyes,
for him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and sinned and wandered.
That was their secret, only theirs, alone in the hiding twilight and there was
none to know
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><font color="black">or
tell</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font> save the little

<br><font color="green">{u21, 409}</font>
<br> souls met in a last lingering glance and the eyes that reached her heart,
full of a strange shining, hung enraptured on her sweet flowerlike face. She
half smiled at him, a sweet forgiving smile &mdash; and then they parted.</p>

without looking back she went down the uneven strand to Cissy, to Edy, to Jacky
and Tommy Caffrey, to little baby Boardman. It was darker now and there were
stones and bits of wood on the strand and slippy seaweed. She walked with a
certain quiet dignity
<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><font color="black">characteristic
of her</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font> but with care

<p> Mr Bloom watched her as she limped away. Poor girl! That&apos;s why
she&apos;s left on the shelf and the others did a sprint. Thought something was
wrong by the cut of her jib. Jilted beauty. Glad I didn&apos;t know it when she
was on show. Hot little devil all the same. Near her monthlies, I

Mairy lost the pin of her. Dressed up to the nines for somebody. In no hurry
either. Always off to a fellow when they are. Out on spec probably. They believe
in chance because like themselves. And the others inclined to give her an odd
dig. Mary and Martha. Girl friends at school, arms round each other&apos;s
necks, kissing and whispering secrets about nothing in the convent garden. Nuns
with whitewashed faces, cool coifs and their rosaries going up and down,
vindictive too for what they can&apos;t get. Barbed wire. Be sure now and write
to me. And I&apos;ll write to you. Now won&apos;t you? Molly and Josie Powell.

When you feel like that you often meet what you feel. Liked me or what? Dress
they look at. Always know a fellow courting: collars and cuffs. Same time might
prefer a tie undone or something. Trousers? Suppose I when I was? No. Gently

<p> A lost long candle wandered up the sky from Mirus bazaar in aid of funds for
Mercer&apos;s hospital and broke, drooping, and shed a cluster of violet but one
white stars. They floated, fell: they faded. And among the elms a hoisted
lintstock lit the lamp at Leahy&apos;s terrace. By the screens of lighted
windows, by equal gardens a shrill voice went crying, wailing: Evening
Telegraph, extra edition. Result of the Gold Cup races: and from the door of
Dignam&apos;s house a boy ran out and called. Twittering the bat flew here, flew

women, fear of God in their faces. Milly, no sign of funk. Her blue scarf loose,
laughing. Don&apos;t know what death is at that age. And then their stomachs
