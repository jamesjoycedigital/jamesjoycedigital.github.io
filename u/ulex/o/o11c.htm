<p class="pStDir">The summer evening had begun to fold all nature in its deep
mysterious warmth. Faraway in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of
<a name="s13020f" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020f">all too</a> fleeting
day lingered softly upon sea and strand, on the proud promontory of
<a name="s13009bv" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009bv">dear</a>
<a name="s13009bv" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009bv">old</a> faithful
Howth, guarding as ever the waters of the bay, on the old weedgrown rocks along
Sandymount shore and, last but not least, on the quiet church whence streamed
forth at times upon the stillness music of prayer to her who is, in her pure
radiance, a beacon ever to the stormtossed heart of man, Mary,
<a name="s13001v" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13001v">star of the sea</a>.</p>
<p> The three girl friends were seated on the rocks, enjoying the evening air
which was fresh but not too chilly. Many a time &amp; oft would they come there
to their favourite
<a name="s13013m" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013m">nook</a> to have a
cosy chat &amp;
<a name="s13020bg" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020bg">discuss things
feminine</a> Cissy Caffrey and and Edie Boardman with the baby boy in the
pushcar and the Tommy and Jacky Caffrey, two little curlyheaded boys, dressed in
sailor suits with caps to match and the name H. M. S. Belleisle on both. For
Tommy and Jacky were twins, scarce four years old, and very noisy and spoiled
twins sometimes but for all that darling little fellows with bright merry faces
and <a name="s13009ce" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009ce">endearing
ways</a> about them. They were dabbling with their spades and buckets in the
sand, building castles as little children do, or playing with their big coloured
ball, as happy as the day was long. And Edie Boardman was rocking the
<a name="s13009aa" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009aa">chubby</a> baby boy
to and fro in the pushcar while the young gentleman fairly chuckled with delight. He was but fourteen months
<br><font color="green">{ms, 2}</font>
<br> old and, though still a tiny toddler, was just beginning to lisp his first
babyish words. Cissy Caffrey bent over to him to tease his fat little plucks and
the ducky little dimple in his chin.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Now, baby, Cissy said. Say out big, big. I want a drink a water.</p>
<p> And baby prattled after her:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <a name="s13020l" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020l">A jink a jink a jawbo.</a></p>
<p> Cissy Caffrey
<a name="s13010r" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010r">cuddled the wee
fellow</a> for she was awfully fond of children so patient with the
<a name="s13020o" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020o">little sufferers</a>
and little Tommy Caffrey would never
<a name="s13013bd" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013bd">take the castor oil
unless it was sister Cissy that held his nose.</a> and baby Boardman was
<a name="s13018k" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13018k">as good as gold</a>, a
perfect little dote in his fancy
<a name="s13018q" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13018q">bib</a>
<a name="s13009aa" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009aa">with chubby
hands</a> and bright eye No
<a name="s13021aa" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13021aa">spoilt beauty</a>
was she. No trueer<a target="foot" id="foz0001">&ordm;</a> goodhearted girl than
Cissy Caffrey ever breathed, always with a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a
frolicsome word on her
<a name="s13016b" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13016b">cherry</a> ripe red
lips, a girl lovable in the extreme. Edie Boardman laughed too at the quaint baby language.</p>
<p> But just then there was a slight altercation between Master Tommy and Master
Jacky. <a name="s13009be" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009be">Boys will be
boys</a> and the two twins were no exception to the rule. The apple of discord
was a certain castle of sand which Master Jacky had built up and Master Tommy
would have it right go wrong that it be improved by a frontdoor like the
Martello Tower had. But if Master Tommy was headstrong Master Jacky was
selfwilled too and, true to the maxim that every little
<a name="un4054ad" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4054ad">Irishman&apos;s
house is his castle</a>, he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose that
the wouldbe assailant came to grief and (alas!) the coveted castle too. Needless
to say, the cries of discomfited Master Tommy drew the attention of the three girl friends</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Come here, Tommy, his sister called imperatively. At
once! And you, Jacky,
<a name="s13009ad" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009ad">for shame!</a> to throw poor Tommy in the
<br><font color="green">{ms, 3}</font>
<br> dirty sand. Wait till I catch you for that.</p>
<p> <a name="s13020g" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020g">His</a> glistening
<a name="s13020g" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020g">eyes misty with unshed
tears,</a> Master Tommy came at her call for their big sister&apos;s word was
law with the twins. And in a sad plight he was too after his tumble. His little
man-o&apos;-war top &amp; unmentionables were full of sand but Cissy was past
mistress in the art of smoothing out life&apos;s tiny troubles and very quickly
and not one speck of sand was to be seen on his smart little suit. Still the
blue eyes were bright with hot tears that would well up so Cissy shook her hand
at Master Jacky, the culprit, her eyes dancing in admonition.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;
<a name="s13009af" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009af">Nasty</a> Bold
Jacky, she said. She
<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font>
her arm round the little fellow and coaxed winningly:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;
<a name="s13004c" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13004c">What&apos;s your name? Butter and cream.</a></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;
<a name="jn0070a" href="../../ff/unbs/jn0all.htm#jn0070a">Tell us who is your
sweetheart spoke Edie Boardman. Is Cissy your sweetheart?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Nao, tearful Tommy said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is Edie Boardman your sweetheart? Cissy queried.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Nao, Tommy said</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I know, Edie Boardman said
<a name="s13020bd" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020bd">none too
amiably</a>, with an arch glance from her usually quiet eyes. I know who is
Tommy&apos;s sweetheart. Gertie is Tommy&apos;s sweetheart.</a></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Nao, Tommy said, on the verge of tears once more</p>
<p> Cissy&apos;s quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to
Edie Boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman
couldn&apos;t see and to mind he didn&apos;t wet his new tan shoes.</p>
<p> But who was Gertie?</p>
<p> Gertie MacDowell who was seated near her companions
<a name="s13012l" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13012l">lost in thought</a>,
<a name="s13010ac" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010ac">gazing far away into
the distance</a> was
<a name="s13013cc" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013cc">in very truth</a>
<a name="s13013cc" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013cc">as fair a specimen
of</a> <a name="s13003g" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13003g">winsome</a>
<a name="s13013cc" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013cc">Irish girlhood</a>
as one could wish to see. She was
<a name="s13012j" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13012j">pronounced
beautiful</a> by all who knew her though, as folks often said, she was
<a name="s13009am" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009am">more a Giltrap than
a MacDowell</a>. Her figure was slight and graceful, inclining even to fragility, but
<br><font color="green">{ms, 4}</font>
<br> those iron jelloids she had been taking of late had done a world of good
and she was much better of those
<a name="s13010ak" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010ak">discharges</a> she
used to get. The
<a name="s13020bj" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020bj">waxen pallor of her
face was almost spiritual in its ivorylike purity</a>. Her hands were of finely
veined alabaster, with
<a name="un4018ad" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4018ad">tapering fingers</a>
and as white as lemonjuice and queen of ointments could make them though it was
not true that she used to
<a name="un5003t" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5003t">wear kid gloves in
bed</a>. Edie Boardman said that to Bertha Supple once when she was black out
with Gertie (the girl chums had of course their little tiffs like the rest of
mortals) and <a name="s13004ap" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13004ap">told
her not to let on whatever she did that it was her that told her</a> or
she&apos;d never speak to her again, never. No,
<a name="s13020bk" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020bk">Honour where honour
is due</a> there was an

<a name="s13010al" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010al">queenly</a>
<a name="s13013o" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013o">hauteur</a> about
Gertie which was unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and high arched
instep. Had kind fate willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree
<a name="s13023r" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13023r">in her own right</a>
and had she only received
<a name="s13013ce" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013ce">the benefit of a
good education</a> Gertie MacDowell might easily have held her own beside any
lady of the land and have seen herself
<a name="s13020ac" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020ac">exquisitely
gowned</a> <a name="s13023aa" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13023aa">with
jewels on her brow</a> with aristocratic
<a name="s13013p" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013p">suitors</a> at her
feet vying with one another
<a name="s13010q" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010q">to pay their
devoirs</a> to her. Mayhap it was this
(<a name="s13009bg" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009bg">the love that might
have been</a>) that gave to her softly featured face at times a
<a name="s13010aj" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010aj">look</a>,
<a name="s13010ai" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010ai">tense with</a>
<a name="s13010ai" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010ai">suppressed
meaning</a>, and that imparted a strange yearning tenderness to the beautiful
eyes. <a name="s13013n" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013n">Why have women
such eyes of witchery?</a> Gertie&apos;s were of the deepest Irish blue set off
by <a name="s13020ae" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020ae">lustrous</a>
lashes and dark expressive brows.
<a name="s13010o" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010o">Time had been when</a>
those brows had not been so
<a name="s13020ad" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020ad">silkily</a>
seductive. It was Madame Vera Verity of the
<a name="s13021n" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13021n">Woman Beautiful</a>
Department of the Princess Novelette <u>Girl&apos;s Companion</u> who had
advised her first to try eyebrowleine
<a name="s13020w" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020w">which gave that
haunting expression to the eyes, so becoming in leaders of fashion</a>; and she
had never regretted it. But Gertie&apos;s crowning glory was her
<a name="s13009cq" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009cq">wealth of hair</a>.
It was dark brown with a natural wave in it.
<a name="s13014h" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13014h">She had cut it that
very morning on account of the new moon</a> and it
<a name="s13001q" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13001q">nestled</a> about her
pretty head in <a name="s13009cp" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009cp">a
profusion of luxuriant clusters</a>. And just now at Edie&apos;s words as
<a name="s13013s" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013s">a telltale flush,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 5}</font>
<br> delicate as the faintest rosebloom</a>,
<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font> to
her cheeks she looked so lovely in her
<a name="s13009as" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009as">sweet girlish
shyness</a> that of a surety
<a name="s13013t" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013t">God&apos;s fair land
of Ireland did not hold her equal</a>.</p>
<p> For an instant she was silent with
<a name="s13009bf" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009bf">rather sad</a>
<a name="s13010ad" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010ad">downcast eyes</a>
about to retort but
<a name="s13020cf" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020cf">something checked
the words on her tongue</a>.
<a name="s13010n" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010n">Inclination prompted
her to speak out: dignity told her to be silent.</a>
<a name="s13011h" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13011h">the pretty lips
pouted</a> awhile but then she glanced up with
<a name="s13012f" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13012f">a faint smile</a> and
<a name="s13005t" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13005t">broke</a> into
<a name="s13009bl" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009bl">a joyous little
laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young May morning</a>.
<a name="s13010t" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010t">She knew</a> right
well, <a name="s13010t" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010t">no-one
better</a>, what made Edie Boardman say that
<a name="s13014o" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13014o">Somebody&apos;s nose
was out of joint</a>
<a name="s13020be" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020be">as per usual</a>

the intermediate and he was going to go to Trinity College when he left the high
school then to study for a doctor in the university like his brother, J.A
Henderson, who was racing in the bicycle races of Trinity College University.
<a name="s13010c" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010c">Little</a>

what she felt, that dull ache in her heart sometimes piercing

he was young <a name="s13010ap" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010ap">and
perchance</a> in time he might
<a name="s13013bf" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013bf">learn to love
her</a>. They were protestants in his family and of course Gerty knew
<a name="s13009ap" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009ap">who came first and
after Him the Blessed Virgin &amp; then Saint Joseph</a> but he was
<a name="s13020h" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020h">undeniably
handsome</a> and he looked what he was,
<a name="s13011i" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13011i">something off the
common</a> every inch a gentleman,
<a name="s13018o" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13018o">the shape of his head
too at the back without his cap on</a> and the way he turned the bicycle at the
<a name="s13010aa" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010aa">lamp</a> with his
hands off the bars and the nice perfume of those good cigarettes he smoked &amp;
they just of a size and that was why Edie Boardman thought she was so awfully
clever because he didn&apos;t go and ride up and down in front of her window.</p>
<p> Gerty was dressed simply but with instinctive taste for she felt that there
was just a might that he might be out. A tasteful blouse selftinted of electric
blue by <a name="s13013bm" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013bm">dolly
dyes</a> with a smart vee opening and kerchief pocket (in which she kept a tiny
piece of <a name="s13013aj" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013aj">wadding
perfumed</a> with heliotrope) &amp; a navy three quarter skirt cut to the stride
&amp; set off admirably her slim figure. She wore a coquettish wide hat of
<a name="s13009a" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009a">nigger</a> straw with
an <a name="s13009f" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009f">underbrim</a> of

bow</a> of silk <a name="s13009a" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009a">to

<a name="s13020bi" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020bi">to match that chenille</a> and at last she
<br><font color="green">{ms, 6}</font>
<br> found what she wanted at Clery&apos;s Summer bargains,

did it up all by herself, trying it on and smiling back at her own reflection in
the mirror, and when she
<a name="s13009i" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009i">put it on the waterjug
to keep the shape</a> she knew it would take the shine out of some people she
knew. Her shoes were the newest thing in footwear (Edie Boardman prided herself
that she was very petite but she never had a foot like Gerty MacDowell (a small
5) and never would have ash, oak or
elm,)<a target="foot" id="foz0002">&ordm;</a>, with patent toecaps and just one
smart buckle. <a name="s13009al" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009al">Her
wellturned ankle showed its proportions</a> be neath her skirt and just the
proper amount and no more of her shapely leg encased in finespun

and <a name="s13009k" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009k">wide garter

<a name="s13009c" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009c">undies</a> they were
Gerty&apos;s chief care and who that knows the fluttering hopes &amp; fears of
sweet seventeen (though Gerty would
<a name="s13010au" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010au">never see 17
again</a>) can find aught amiss in that? She had five dinky sets, three articles
and nighties extra, and each set
<a name="s13009d" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009d">slotted with different
coloured ribbons, rosepink,</a> pale blue, cream, pale mauve and peagreen. And
she washed them herself and
<a name="s13021i" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13021i">aired</a> and ironed
and <a name="s13018ae" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13018ae">she had a brick
too to keep the iron on</a>.

blue</a> her own colour and
<a name="s13020v" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020v">the lucky colour too

<p> And yet &mdash; and yet. A gnawing sorrow is there all the time.
<a name="s13020ao" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020ao">Her very soul is in
her eyes</a> and she would
<a name="s13010af" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010af">give worlds to</a>

that he was not for her. It would never be. He was but a boy, too young to

not believe in</a> love&apos;s language. The night of the party in Stoer&apos;s

and soon be over. No prince charming is her beau ideal

<p> And while Edie Boardman was with little Tommy behind the pushcar she was
just thinking if the day would ever come when she would call herself his
<a name="s13013be" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013be">little wife to
be</a>. Then they could talk about her, Bertha Supple too,
<a name="s13021m" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13021m">spitfire</a> because
she was 22. She would care for him with
<a name="s13021h" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13021h">creature comforts</a>
too for Gerty knew that a mere man liked that feeling of
<a name="s13020b" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020b">homeyness</a>. Her
teacakes and <a name="s13013al" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013al">queen
Ann&apos;s pudding</a> had
<a name="s13020n" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020n">won golden
opinions</a> from all because she had a lucky hand they said also for lighting a
fire, dredge in the fine flour
<a name="s13004r" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13004r">always stir in the
same direction</a> then
<a name="s13004u" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13004u">cream the milk and
sugar</a> and
<a name="s13006c" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13006c">whisk</a> well the
white of eggs and they would have a nice drawingroom too with pictures and
<a name="s13021j" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13021j">chintz covers</a> for the chairs and that toastrack that was
<br><font color="green">{ms, 8}</font>
<br> in Clery&apos;s summer sale like they have in rich houses. He would be tall
(<a name="s13020ce" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020ce">she had always
admired tall men</a>) with glistening
<a name="s13009bi" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009bi">white teeth under
his</a> <a name="s13013cd" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013cd">carefully

<a name="s13009bi" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009bi">moustache</a> and
every morning they would both have brekky for their own two selves and before he
went to business he would give her a good long
<a name="s13010r" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010r">hug</a> and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyes.</p>
<p> Edie Boardman asked little Tommy was he done and he said he was then she
<a name="un4019cx" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4019cx">buttoned up his
little knickerbockers for him</a> and told him to run off now and play with
Jacky and to be good and not to fight. But Tommy said he wanted the ball and
Edie said no that baby Boardman was playing with the ball and if he took it
there&apos;d be wigs on the green but Tommy said it was his ball and he wanted
his ball. And he stamped his little foot too in temper. O, he was a man already
was little Tommy Caffrey. Edie told him no no and to run off with him now and
she told Cissy Caffrey not to give in to him. You&apos;re not my sister,
<a name="s13009ag" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009ag">naughty</a> Tommy
said. It&apos;s my ball. But Cissy told Baby Boardman to
<a name="s13017f" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13017f">look up</a>
<a name="s13017f" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13017f">look up</a> high at
her fingers and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand and
Tommy ran after it in full career having won the day.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <a name="s13012d" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13012d">Anything for a quiet life!</a></p>
<p> And she tickled baby Boardman&apos;s two cheeks to make him forget and
played here&apos;s the lord mayor, here&apos;s his two horses, here&apos;s his
gingerbread carriage and here he walks in chinchopper chinchopper chinchopper
chin. But Edie got
<a name="s13009an" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009an">as cross as two
sticks</a> about his <a name="s13023ae" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13023ae">getting his own way</a> like that
<br><font color="green">{ms, 9}</font>
<br> from everyone petting him &amp; giving him his own way.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I&apos;d like to give him something, she said, so I
would, <a name="s13009s" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009s">where I won&apos;t say</a>.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; On the
<a name="s13009ai" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009ai">bee-o-teetom</a>,
laughed Cissy merrily with a pert toss of her head.</p>
<p> Gerty MacDowell bent her head down at the idea of Cissy saying a thing like
that out, she&apos;d be
<a name="s13020aa" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020aa">ashamed of her
life</a> to say,
<a name="s13012g" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13012g">flushing a deep rosy
red,</a> and Edie Boardman said she was sure the gentleman opposite heard what she said. But not a pin cared Cissy.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Let him! she said
<a name="s13020ca" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020ca">with a piquant tilt
of her nose</a>. Give it to him too on the same place, quick as I&apos;d look at him.</p>
<p> Madcap Ciss! You had to laugh at her sometimes. For instance when she asked
you would you have some more chinese tea &amp;
<a name="s13014ac" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13014ac">jaspberry ram</a>.
Or said she wanted to pay a visit to
<a name="s13009bb" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009bb">the miss white</a>.
And The jugs she used to draw too and men&apos;s faces: make you split your
sides. That was just like
<a name="s13022au" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022au">Cissycums</a>. But
she was sincerity itself,
<a name="s13022aq" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022aq">one of the bravest
&amp; truest hearts heaven ever made</a>. not one of your 2faced things, too sweet to be wholesome.</p>
<p> And then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the pealing
anthem of the organ from the old ivyclad church and Gerty&apos;s heart was
touched. It was the men&apos;s temperance novena conducted by the missioner, the
reverend father John Hughes S.J, rosary, sermon and benediction of the most
blessed sacrament. They were there gathered together, without distinction of
social class (and most edifying was it to see), in that simple fane beside the
waves, after the storms of this weary world kneeling humbly at the feet of the
immaculate, praying to her to intercede for them, holy Mary, holy virgin of
virgins. How sad to poor Gerty&apos;s ears! Had her father only avoided the
clutches of <a name="s13022av" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022av">demon
drink</a> she might now be rolling in her carriage,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 10}</font>
<br> second to none. Over and over had she told herself that as she mused by the
fireside, in a <a name="s13022b" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022b">brown
study</a>, <a name="s13021o" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13021o">her eyes on
the dying embers</a> or
<a name="s13017o" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13017o">gazing out of the
window</a> by the hour at the rain falling on the rusty bucket. But that vile
decoction which has ruined so many hearths and homes had cast its shadow over
her girlhood days. Nay, she had even witnessed in the home circle deeds of
violence caused by intemperance and had seen her own father, a prey to the devil
of whisky, forget himself completely for if there was one thing of all things
that Gerty knew it was that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the
way of kindness, deserved to be branded as the lowest of the low.</p>
<p> And still the voices sang in supplication to the virgin most powerful,
virgin most merciful. And Gerty, rapt in thought, scarce saw or heard her
companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman off Sandymount
Green that Cissy called the man that&apos;s so like himself passing along the
strand, taking a short walk. You never saw him any way screwed But still
<a name="s13017au" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13017au">she would not like
him for a father</a>
<a name="s13017au" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13017au">because he was too
old</a> or something (it was a palpable case of Dr Fell) on account of his face
or his carbuncly nose with the pimple on it. Poor father! With all his faults
she loved him still when he sang <u>The Song that reached my heart</u> and they
had stewed cockles for supper. and when he sang the duet <u>The Moon hath
raised</u> with Mr. Dignam that died suddenly and was buried God have mercy on
him from a stroke. Her birthday that was and Charley was home on holidays and
mother and Tom and Mr Dignam and Mrs and Patsy &amp; Freddy Dignam. And they
were <a name="s13005a" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13005a">to have had a
group taken</a>. And no-one would have thought
<a name="s13025o" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13025o">the end was so
near</a>. And now Mr Dignam
<a name="s13025s" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13025s">laid to rest</a> would
never sing with her father any more the duets. and mother said to let that be a
warning to him. And he couldn&apos;t even go to the funeral on account of the gout and she had to go into town to bring
<br><font color="green">{ms, 11}</font>
<br> him the letters and samples from his office about Catesby&apos;s cork lino,
artistic designs fit for a palace, gives splendid wear and always bright and cheery.</p>
<p> A sterling good daughter was Gerty. just like A second mother in the house.
A ministering angel too,
<a name="s13021e" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13021e">as kind as kind could
be</a>, for when mother had those awful headaches who was it rubbed the menthol
cone on her forehead but Gerty though she didn&apos;t like mother&apos;s taking
pinches of snuff because it wasn&apos;t
<a name="s13017ch" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13017ch">ladylike</a> and
that was the only single thing they ever had words about, taking snuff. It was
Gerty who <a name="s13009ac" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009ac">turned off
the gas every night at the main</a> and it was Gerty hung up with tacks on the
wall of that <a name="s13009t" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009t">place</a>
the picture of Halcyon Days where a gentleman in the dress they used to wear
then with a threecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his
<a name="s13010u" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010u">ladylove</a> through
the <a name="s13012b" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13012b">lattice</a> window
with <a name="s13025aa" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13025aa">oldtime
chivalry</a>. The colours were done lovely. She was robed in
<a name="s13022al" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022al">soft clinging
white</a>. and the gentleman in chocolate and he looked
<a name="s13010k" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010k">a thorough
aristocrat</a>. She often looked at them dreamily when she went there to pay a
visit for a certain purpose and thought about those times because she had found
out in Walker&apos;s Pronouncing dictionary that
<a name="un4019am" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4019am">belonged to
grandpapa Giltrap</a> about the halcyon days what they meant.</p>
<p> The twins were playing in
<a name="s13022a" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022a">the most approved</a>
brotherly fashion till at last master Jacky, who was really
<a name="s13018j" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13018j">as bold as brass</a>,
there was no getting behind that, deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever
he could and it went flying down towards the seaweedy rocks. Needless to say
poor Tommy was not slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black
who was sitting there by himself
<a name="s13022c" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022c">came to the rescue</a>
&amp; intercepted the ball. Our two champions claimed their plaything with lusty
cries and, to avoid trouble, Cissy Caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it
to her, please. The gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then threw it
along the sand towards Cissy Caffrey but it rolled down the slope and stopped
right under Gerty&apos;s skirt near the little pool beside her rock. The
<br><font color="green">{ms, 12}</font>
<br> twins clamoured again for it and Cissy told her to kick it away and let
them fight for it so drew back her foot but she wished their stupid ball
hadn&apos;t come rolling down to her and gave a kick but she missed and Edie and Cissy laughed</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; If you fail Try again, Edie Boardman said.</p>
<p> Gerty <a name="s13010s" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010s">smiled
assent</a> but she was determined to let them see so she lifted her skirt a
little, took good aim and gave the ball a
<a name="s13022af" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022af">jolly good</a> kick
and it went ever so far and the two twins after it, down towards the shingle.
Pure jealousy of course it was, nothing else trying
<a name="s13014ah" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13014ah">to draw
attention</a>, on account of the gentleman looking.
<a name="s13020t" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020t">A delicate pink crept
into Gerty&apos;s pretty cheeks</a> and then she felt the warm flush, a
<a name="s13020al" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020al">danger signal</a>
with Gerty MacDowell,
<a name="s13020p" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020p">surging</a> &amp;
<a name="s13020al" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020al">flaming</a>
<a name="s13020p" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020p">into her face</a>.
Till then they had
<a name="s13022l" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022l">exchanged only glances
of the most casual</a> but now under the brim of her new hat she
<a name="s13020r" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020r">stole a look at
him</a> and <a name="s13009bp" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009bp">the
face</a> that <a name="s13019ba" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13019ba">met
her gaze</a> then <a name="s13019ba" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13019ba">in
the twilight</a>, wan and
<a name="s13009bp" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009bp">strangely drawn</a>
seemed to her <a name="s13020e" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020e">the saddest face she ever saw</a>.</p>
<p> Through the open windows of the church the fragrant incense was wafted and
with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain of original
sin. Spiritual vessel,
<a name="un4045bq" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4045bq">pray for us</a>
honourable vessel, pray for us. Mystical rose. and careworn hearts were there,
and toilers for their
<a name="s13010f" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010f">daily bread</a>, and
many who had erred and wandered, their eyes
<a name="s13010d" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010d">wet with
contrition</a> but for all that bright with hope for the reverend father Hughes
had told them what the great saint Bernard had said in his famous prayer of Mary
the most pious virgin&apos;s intercessory power that it was not recorded in any
age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever abandoned by her.</p>
<p> The twins were now playing again right merrily
<br><font color="green">{ms, 13}</font>
<br> for the troubles of childhood are but as passing summer clouds. Cissy
Caffrey played with Baby Boardman till he crowed with glee clapping
<a name="s13009ba" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009ba">baby hands</a> in
the air. She hid behind the hood of the pushcar
<a name="s13018h" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13018h">crying peep</a> and
Edie asking where was Cissy gone and then Cissy popped up her head and said ah.
And O my didn&apos;t the little chap enjoy that! And then she bade him say papa.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Say papa, baby. Say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa.</p>
<p> And baby did his level best to say it:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ja ja ja ja.</p>
<p> Cissy wiped his little mouth with the
<a name="s13020aj" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020aj">dribbling bib</a>
and wanted him to sit up properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap
she cried out to Edie, holy saint Denis, that he was
<a name="s13004q" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13004q">possing wet</a> and to
double the half blanket the other way under him. Of course his infant majesty
was most obstreperous at such toilet formalities and it was all no use telling
him about the
<a name="s13022g" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022g">geegee</a> where was
the <a name="s13018f" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13018f">puffpuff</a> but
Cissy, always readywitted, gave him in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle
and the young heathen was quickly appeased.</p>
<p> Gerty wished to goodness they would take their baby home out of that, no
hour to be out, and the little brats of twins. She gazed out towards the distant
sea. It was like a picture: the evening and the clouds coming out and the Bailey
light and to hear the music like that and the perfume they used in the church.
And while she gazed the
<a name="s13001bs" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13001bs">heart</a>
<a name="s13001bs" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13001bs">went pitapat</a>.
Yes, it was her he was looking at
<a name="s13022ah" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022ah">and there was
meaning in his look</a>.
<a name="s13017b" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13017b">His eyes burned into
her as though they would read her through and through</a> search

<a name="s13013ae" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013ae">He was in deep
mourning, she could see that, and the story of a haunting sorrow was written on
his face.</a> She would have given worlds to know what it was. He was looking up
so intensely so still and he saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the
bright steel buckles of her shoes if she swung them like that thoughtfully. She
was glad Something told her put on the transparent stockings thinking Reggy

<p> Refuge of sinners and comfortress of the afflicted: <u>Ora pro nobis.</u>
Well has it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy can
never be lost or cast away: and fitly is she too a haven of refuge for the
afflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her own heart. Gerty
could picture the whole scene in the church, the stained
<br><font color="green">{ms, 15}</font>
<br> glass windows lighted up, the candles and the smell of flowers and
<a name="s13010av" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13010av">those</a> incense
they used and the blue banners of the blessed virgin&apos;s sodality and
probably father Conroy was helping canon O&apos;Hanlon at the altar, carrying
things in and out with his eye cast down. He looked almost a saint and his
confessionbox was so quiet and dark and clean and his hands were just like white
wax. He told her that time when she told him about that at confession
<a name="s13020ak" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020ak">crimsoning up to the
very roots of her hair</a> for fear he could see, not to be troubled because
that was only the voice of nature and we were all subject to nature&apos;s laws,
he said, in this life and that that was no sin because that came from the nature
of woman instituted by God, he said, and that our Blessed Lady herself said to
the archangel Gabriel be it done unto me according to Thy word. He was so kind
and holy and often and often she thought could she work an embroidered teacosy
for him as a present or a clock but
<a name="s13009bc" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009bc">they had a clock
with a canary in it to tell the time</a> on the mantelpiece in the priest&apos;s
house that day Saturday when she went for the priest for Mr Dignam because it
was hard to know what kind of a present to give or perhaps an album of views of Dublin or some place.</p>
<p> The little brats of twins began to quarrel again and Jacky threw the ball
out towards the sea and they both ran after it. Common little monkeys. Someone
ought to take them &amp; give them a good hiding for themselves to keep them in
their places, the both of them. And Cissy &amp; Edie shouted after them</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Jacky! Tommy! they cried. Come back.</p>
<p> Because they were afraid the tide might come in on them, and be drowned.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Jacky!</p>
<p> Not they, what a notion they had! So Cissy said it was the last time
she&apos;d ever bring them out. She jumped up and called them and then she ran
down the slope past him, tossing behind her her raven hair which had a good enough colour
<br><font color="green">{ms, 16}</font>
<br> if there had been more of it but with all the thingamerry she was always
putting into it she couldn&apos;t get it to grow long because it wasn&apos;t
natural. So she could just go could throw her hat at it. She ran with long
gandery strides it was a wonder she didn&apos;t rip up her skirt at the side
that was too tight on her because there was a lot of the tomboy about Cissy
Caffrey whenever she thought she had a fine opportunity to show off and just
because she was a good runner she ran like that so that he could see all the end
of her petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as possible. It would
have served her just right if she had tripped herself over something with her
high French heels on her boots to make her look tall &amp; got a tumble. That
would have been a very charming expos&eacute; for a gentleman like that to see.</p>
<p> Queen of angels, of patriarchs, of prophets, of all saints, they prayed,
queen of the most holy rosary, and then father Conroy handed the thurible to
Canon O&apos;Hanlon and he put in the incense and censed the blessed sacrament
and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and she was itching to give them a good
clip on the ear but she didn&apos;t because she thought he was looking after her
but she never made a bigger mistake in her life because Gerty could see without
looking that he never took his eyes off her and then Canon O&apos;Hanlon handed
the thurible back to Father Conroy &amp; knelt down, looking up at the blessed
sacrament and the choir began to sing the <u>Tantum Ergo</u> and she just swung
<br><font color="green">{ms, 17}</font>
<br> her foot in and out in time to the tantumer gosa cramen tum Four and eleven
she paid for those stockings in Sparrows of George&apos;s street at the Tuesday
no the Monday before easter and there wasn&apos;t a brack on them and that was
what he was looking at, transparent, and not at hers that had neither shape nor
form because he had better taste and could see for himself the difference.</p>
<p> Cissy came along the strand with the two twins and their ball with her hat
anyhow on one side after her run and she did look a streel lugging the two kids
along, with the blouse she bought only a fortnight before like a rag on her
back. Gerty just took off her hat for a moment to settle it and a prettier, a
daintier head of
<a name="s13024e" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13024e">rich</a> nutbrown
<a name="s13024e" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13024e">tresses</a> was never
seen on a girl&apos;s shoulders.
<a name="s13023j" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13023j">A radiant little
vision</a> in sooth,
<a name="s13022bv" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022bv">maddening in its
sweetness</a>. You would have to travel many a long mile before you found a head
of hair the like of that. She could almost see a swift answering flash of
admiration in his eyes that
<a name="s13022cc" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022cc">set her tingling</a>
in every nerve. She put on her hat so that she could see from underneath and
swung her buckled shoe faster for
<a name="s13020bn" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020bn">her breath
caught</a> as she read the expression of his eyes. He was watching eying her
<a name="s13022ap" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022ap">as a snake watches
eyes its prey</a>. Her woman&apos;s instinct told her
<a name="s13009bs" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009bs">she had roused the
devil in him</a> and at the thought
<a name="s13020bl" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020bl">a burning scarlet
swept from brow to throat</a> till the lovely
<a name="s13023an" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13023an">colour of her face became a glorious rose</a>.</p>
<p> Edie Boardman was
<br><font color="green">{ms, 18}</font>
<br> noticing it too because she was looking at Gerty through her spectacles and
half smiling, pretending to hushaby baby. Irritable little gnat she was poking
her nose into what was no concern of hers. Always was and always would be. And she said to Gerty:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <a name="s13013bu" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013bu">A penny for your thoughts.</a></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What? laughed Gerty. I was only wondering is it late.</p>
<p> Because she wished they&apos;d take the twins and the baby home to the
mischief out of that so that was why she just gave a gentle hint about it being
late. And when Cissy came up Edie asked her the time and Cissy said as glib as
you like it was <a name="s13009o" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009o">half
past kissing time</a>. Time to kiss again.</p>
<p> But Edie wanted to know because they were told to be in early.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Wait, Cissy said, I&apos;ll ask
<a name="s13004ak" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13004ak">uncle</a> over there
what&apos;s the time by his conundrum.</p>
<p> So over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him taking his
hand out of his pocket and getting nervous &amp; begin to play with his
watchchain looking up at the church. Passionate nature though he was Gerty could
see that he had enormous control over himself. One moment he had been there,
<a name="s13022bu" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022bu">fascinated by a
loveliness that made him gaze</a>,
<a name="s13023ab" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13023ab">the passion
seething</a> in his veins. and
<a name="s13020bb" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020bb">the next it was the
quiet gravefaced gentleman, self control expressed in every line of his</a>
<a name="un4019ag" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4019ag">distinguished
looking</a>
<a name="s13020bb" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020bb">figure</a>. Cissy
said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the right time. And
Gerty could see him taking taking out his watch and looking at it and
<a name="un4018d" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4018d">listening</a> and
looking up and he said he was very sorry it was stopped but he thought it must
be after eight because the sun was set.
<a name="s13020c" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020c">His voice had a
cultured ring in it</a> and there was
<a name="s13023b" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13023b">a suspicion of a
quiver in the mellow tones</a> and Cissy said thanks and came back with her
tongue out and said his water works were out of order.</p>
<p> Then they sang the second verse of the <u>Tantum ergo</u> and Canon
O&apos;Hanlon got up again and censed the blessed sacrament and knelt down and he told Father Conroy that one of
<br><font color="green">{ms, 19}</font>
<br> the candles was just going to set fire to the flowers and father Conroy got
up and settled it all right and she could see the gentleman winding his watch
and listening to the works and she swung her leg more in &amp; out in time. It
was getting dark but he could see and he was looking all the time that he was
winding the watch or whatever he was doing to it and then he put it back and she
felt a kind of a sensation rushing all over her when and she knew by the feel of
her scalp and the itching against her stays that that thing was coming on
because the last time was also when she clipped hair on account of the moon and
his dark eyes fixed themselves on her again, drinking in
<a name="s13005k" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13005k">her every</a>
<a name="s13005ad" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13005ad">contour</a>,
literally
<a name="s13005ac" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13005ac">worshipping at her
shrine</a>. If ever there was undisguised admiration in a man&apos;s passionate
gaze it was there plain to be seen on his face.
<a name="s13022r" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022r">And it is for you,
Gertrude MacDowell</a>, <a name="s13025m" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13025m">and you know it</a>.</p>
<p> Edie began to get ready to go and she noticed that that little hint she gave
<a name="s13014ae" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13014ae">had had the desired
effect</a> because it was a long way along the strand to where there was the
place to push up the pushcar and Cissy took off the twins&apos; caps and combed
their hair to make herself attractive and Canon O&apos;Hanlon stood up with his
cope poking up at his neck and Father Conroy handed him the card to read off and
he read out <u>Panem de coelo praestitisti eis</u> and Edie and Cissy were
talking about the time all the time and asking her but Gerty could pay them back
in their own coin and she just answered with
<a name="s13022h" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022h">scathing
politeness</a> when Edie asked her was she
<a name="s13022ai" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022ai">heartbroken</a>
about her best boy throwing her over.
<a name="s13015d" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13015d">Gerty winced
sharply</a> A <a name="s13022u" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022u">brief
cold blaze shone from her eyes</a> that spoke of

quick stinging of tears</a>. Their eyes were
<a name="s13025a" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13025a">probing her
mercilessly</a> but with a brave effort she sparkled back in sympathy as she
glanced at her new conquest for Miss Edie to see.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;

<a name="s13023ag" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13023ag">towering rage</a>
because that <a name="s13022aa" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022aa">shaft

<p> Edie straightened up Baby Boardman to get ready to go and Cissy put in the
ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time because the

the way for master Boardman junior. And Cissy told him too that

coming and that baby was
<a name="s13017m" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13017m">to go deedaws</a> and

<br><font color="green">{ms, 21}</font>
<br> out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby without as much as by your leave
sent up his compliments to
<a name="s13022bl" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022bl">all &amp; sundry</a>

protested Ciss. The slight contretemps
<a name="s13023l" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13023l">claimed her
attention</a> but&nbsp;&hellip; and in two twos she set that little matter to rights.</p>
<p> Gerty stifled a
<a name="s13024k" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13024k">smothered
exclamation</a> and Edie asked what and she was just going to tell her to
<a name="s13025u" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13025u">catch it while it was
flying</a> but she was ever
<a name="s13017ch" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13017ch">ladylike</a> in her
<a name="s13024h" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13024h">deportment</a> so she
simply passed it off by saying that was the benediction because just then the
bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet seashore because canon
O&apos;Hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that father Conroy put round his
shoulders giving them the benediction with the blessed sacrament in his hands.</p>
<p> How beautiful the scene there in the gathering twilight the last glimpse of
Erin, the sweet chimes of those evening bells and at the sound a bat flew forth
from the ivied belfry through the dusk, hither and thither, with a tiny tiny
cry. And she could see far away the lights of lighthouses and soon the
lamplighter would be going his rounds lighting the lamp near her window where
Reggie used to turn the bicycle. like she read in that book by Mrs Cummins
author of Mabel Vaughan other tales etc The Lamplighter. For Gerty had
<a name="un5005aq" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5005aq">her dreams</a> that
no-one knew of. She loved to read poetry and when she got a keepsake from Bertha
Supple of that lovely confession Album with the
<a name="s13013bp" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013bp">coralpink cover to
write her thoughts in</a> she had laid it in her toilet table drawer which,
though it <a name="s13023ac" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13023ac">did not
err on the side of luxury</a> was
<a name="s13025n" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13025n">scrupulously neat
&amp; clean</a>, There it was she kept her girlish

the tortoiseshell combs, her

<a name="s13013a" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13013a">pouncetbox</a> and the
ribbons to change when her things came home from the wash, and there were some
beautiful thoughts written in it in violet ink that she bought for she felt that
she too could write poetry if she could only express herself like that

locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and father Conroy
handed him his hat to put on. and Edie asked was she coming but Jacky Caffrey called out:</p>

<p> And they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church, Edie
with the pushcar with baby Boardman in it and Cissy holding Tommy &amp; Jacky by
the hand so they wouldn&apos;t fall running.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Come on, Gerty, Cissy called. It&apos;s the bazaar

<p> But Gerty was
<a name="s13002t" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13002t">adamant</a>. She had
no intention now of being

call</a> if they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she could see
from where she was. The eyes that were fastened upon her set her
<a name="s13023ao" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13023ao">pulses tingling</a>.
She looked at him a moment,
<a name="s13025r" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13025r">meeting his
glance</a>, and <a name="s13023af" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13023af">a
light broke in upon her</a>.

<a name="s13009bd" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009bd">fireworks</a> were
and she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall back, looking up, and there was no-one to see only

<br> him &amp; her when she
<a name="s13022bp" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022bp">revealed all her
graceful beautifully shaped legs</a> like that,
<a name="s13022bq" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022bq">supply soft and
delicately rounded</a> and she seemed to hear the panting of his heart
<a name="s13009cd" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009cd">his hoarse
breathing</a> because she knew too about the passion of men like that hot
blooded because Bertha Supple told her once about the lodger that was staying
with them out of the custom house who had
<a name="s13004be" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13004be">pictures of
dancers</a> cut out of papers and she said he used to do something not very nice
that you could imagine sometimes in the bed. But this was different from a thing
like that because there was all the difference because she could almost feel him
<a name="s13024l" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13024l">draw her face to
his</a> and the first
<a name="s13024j" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13024j">quick hot touch of his
handsome lips</a>. Besides there was absolution so long as you didn&apos;t do
the other thing before being married and there ought to be women priests that
would understand without telling and Cissy Caffrey too sometimes had that
<a name="s13022e" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13022e">dreamy</a> kind of
soft look in her eyes so that she too, my dear, and besides it was on account of
that other thing coming on the way it did.</p>
<p> And Jacky Caffrey shouted to look, there was another, and she leaned back
and the garters were blue to match and on account of the contrast with the
transparent and then they all saw it and they all shouted to look, look, there
it was, and she leaned back ever so far to see the
<a name="s13009bd" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13009bd">fireworks</a> and
something queer was flying through the air, a soft thing, dark, to and fro,
twittering she saw a long Roman candle going up over the trees up, up, and they
were all breathless with excitement as it went higher &amp; higher and she had
to lean back more and more to look up after it high, high almost out of sight
and her face was suffused with
<a name="s13020s" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020s">a divine, an
entrancing blush</a> from straining back and he could see her other things, too
nainsook <a name="s13021d" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13021d">knickers</a>
four and eleven, on account of being white and she let him and saw that he saw
and then it went so high it went out of sight a moment and
<br><font color="green">{ms, 24}</font>
<br> she was trembling in every limb from being bent so far back that he could
see high up above her knee where noone even the cat and he wasn&apos;t ashamed
to look that immodest way because he couldn&apos;t resist the sight like those
skirtdancers behaving so immodest before men looking. She would fain have cried
to him
<a name="s13020bs" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13020bs">chokingly</a>, held
out her <a name="s13004f" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13004f">snowy</a>

come to feel <a name="s13015h" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13015h">his lips
laid on her white brow</a>. and then suddenly it burst and it was like a sigh of
O and everybody cried O, O, and it let fall out of it a stream of rain gold hair
&amp; they burst and, Ah, they were all greeny dewy stars falling with golden
rain, O so lovely, O soft, sweet, soft.</p>
<p> Then all melted away dewily in the grey air: all was silent. She glanced at
him as she bent forward quickly, a glance of
<a name="s13015e" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13015e">piteous protest</a>,
of shy reproach, under which he
<a name="s13012h" href="../../ff/unbs/s13all.htm#s13012h">coloured like a

been? But there was an infinite store of mercy in those eyes, for him too a word

<p> Gerty had an idea. She waved her handkerchief in gay reply. Wonder if
he&apos;s too far to. She rose. She had to go: but they would meet again, there,
and she would dream of it till then, till they met tomorrow.

then they parted</a>. Slowly, without looking back she went down the uneven
strand to Cissy, to Edie, to Jacky and Tommy, to little baby Boardman. It was
darker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and slippy
seaweed so she walked with a certain quiet dignity but with care and slowly
