<p> Pineapple rock, lemon platt, butter scotch. A sugarsticky girl shovelling
scoopfuls of creams for a christian brother. Some school treat. Lozenge and

<p> A sombre young man, watchful among the warm sweet fumes of Graham

<p> His slow feet walked him riverward, reading. All are washed in the blood of

Our Saviour<a target="foot" id="fhh0003">&ordm;</a>. Wake up in the dead of

<p> Phosphorus<a target="foot" id="fhh0004">&ordm;</a> it must be done with. If
you leave a bit of codfish for instance. I could see the bluey silver over it.
Night I went down to  the pantry in the kitchen. What was it she wanted? The
Malaga raisins. Before Rudy was born. The phosphorescence, that bluey greeny. Very good for the brain.</p>
<p> From Butler&apos;s monument house corner he glanced along Bachelor&apos;s walk.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 145}</font>
<br> Dedalus&apos; daughter there still outside Dillon&apos;s auctionrooms. Must
be selling off some old furniture. Knew her eyes at once from the brother.
Lobbing about waiting for the father. Home always breaks up when the mother
goes: Fifteen children he had. Birth every year almost. That&apos;s in their
theology or the priest won&apos;t give the poor woman the confession, the
absolution. Increase and multiply. Did you ever hear such an idea? No families
themselves to feed. Living on the fat of the land. A housekeeper of one of those
fellows if you could pick it out of her. Never pick it out of her: his reverence: mum&apos;s the word.</p>
<p> Good Lord, that poor child&apos;s dress is in flitters. Underfed she looks
too. It&apos;s after they feel it. Undermines the constitution.</p>
<p> As he set foot on O&apos;Connell bridge a puffball of smoke plumed up from
the parapet. Brewery barge with export stout. England. Sea air sours it, I
heard. Be interesting some day get a pass through Hitchcock to see the brewery.
Regular town in itself. Vats of porter wonderful. Rats get in too. Drink
themselves bloated as big as a collie floating. Dead drunk on the porter. Drink
till they puke like christians. Imagine drinking that. Rats: vats. Well, of course, if we knew all the things.</p>
<p> Looking down he saw flapping strongly, wheeling between the gaunt
quaywalls<a target="foot" id="fhh0007">&ordm;</a>, gulls. Rough weather outside.
R. J&apos;s son must have swallowed a good bellyful of that sewage.  They wheeled lower. Looking for grub. Wait.</p>
<p> He threw down among them a crumpled paper ball. Elijah thirtytwo feet per
second is coming. Not a bit. The ball bobbed unheeded on the wake of swells,
floated under by the bridgepiers<a target="foot" id="fhh0008">&ordm;</a>. Not
such damn fools. They wheeled, flapping.</p>

<p> That is how poets write, the similar sounds. But then Shakespeare has no
rhymes: blank verse. The flow of the language it is. The thoughts. Solemn</p>

<p class="di">&mdash; Two apples a penny. Two for a penny.</p>
<p> His gaze passed over the glazed apples serried on her stand. Australians
they must be this time of year. Shiny peels: polishes them up with a rag or a handkerchief.</p>
<p> Wait, those poor birds.</p>
<p> He halted and bought from the old applewoman two
<a name="un2026h" href="../../ff/unbs/un2all.htm#un2026h">Banbury cakes</a> for
a penny and broke the brittle paste and threw its pieces down into the Liffey.
See that? The gulls swooped silently,<a target="foot" id="fhh0010">&ordm;</a>
two, then all from their heights, pouncing on prey. Gone. Every morsel. Aware of
their greed and cunning he shook the powdery crumb from his hands. They never
expected that. Manna.

quite enough. Lot of thanks I get. If you fatten a

<p> Good idea that. Wonder if he pays rent to the corporation. How can you own
water really? It&apos;s always flowing in a stream, never the same, which in the
stream of life we trace. Because life is a stream. All kinds of places are good
for ads. That quack doctor<a target="foot" id="fhh0019">&ordm;</a> for the clap
that used to be stuck up in all the greenhouses. Never see it now. Strictly
confidential. Dr Hy Franks. Didn&apos;t cost him a cent. Got fellows to stick
them up or stick them up himself for that matter on the q.t. running in to loosen a button. Just the place too.

<p> O!</p>
<p> Eh?</p>
<p> No&nbsp;&hellip; No.<a target="foot" id="fhh0022">&ordm;</a></p>
<p> No. no. I don&apos;t believe it. He wouldn&apos;t surely?</p>
<p> No, no.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom moved forward,<a target="foot" id="fhh0023">&ordm;</a> raising his
troubled eyes. Think no more about that. After one. The timeball on the ballast
office<a target="foot" id="fhh0025">&ordm;</a> is down. Dunsink time.
Fascinating little book that is of sir<a target="foot" id="fhh0026">&ordm;</a>
Robert Ball&apos;s. Parallax. I never exactly understood. Par it&apos;s Greek:
parallel parallax. Met him pike hoses<a target="foot" id="fhh0027">&ordm;</a>
she called him till I told her about the transmigration idea. O rocks!</p>
<p> Mr Bloom smiled O rocks at two windows of the ballast
office<a target="foot" id="fhh0028">&ordm;</a>. She&apos;s right after all.
They&apos;re only big words for ordinary things on account of the sound.
She&apos;s not exactly witty. Still, I don&apos;t know. She used to say Ben
Dollard had a base barreltone voice. He has legs like barrels and you&apos;d
think he was singing into a barrel. Now, isn&apos;t that wit. They used to call
him big Ben. That&apos;s not half as witty as calling him base barreltone.
Powerful man he was for stowing<a target="foot" id="fhh0030">&ordm;</a> away
number one Bass. Barrel of Bass. See? It all works out.</p>
<p> A procession of whitesmocked men marched slowly towards him along the
gutter, scarlet sashes across their boards. Bargains. Like that priest they are
this morning: we have sinned: we have suffered. He read the scarlet letters on
their five tall white hats. H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;Y.&nbsp;S. Wisdom
Hely&apos;s. Y lagging behind drew a chunk of bread from behind his foreboard,
crammed it into his mouth and munched as he walked. Three bob a day, walking
along the gutters, street after street. Just keep skin and bone together, bread
and skilly. They are not Boyl: no, M&apos;Glade&apos;s men. Doesn&apos;t bring
in any business either. I suggested to him about a transparent
showcart<a target="foot" id="fhh0032">&ordm;</a> with two children girls sitting
inside writing copybooks, envelopes,
blottingpaper<a target="foot" id="fhh0033">&ordm;</a>. I bet that would have
caught on. Two smart young girls. Always catch the eye. Wouldn&apos;t have it of
course because he didn&apos;t think of it himself first. Well out of that ruck I
am. Devil of a job it was collecting accounts of those convents. Tranquilla
convent. That was a nice nun there, really sweet face. Sister? Sister? I am sure
she was crossed in love by her eyes. Very hard to bargain with that sort of a
woman. I disturbed her at her devotions that morning. Our great day, she said.
Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel. Sweet name too: caramel. She knew
I<a target="foot" id="fhh0036">&ordm;</a>, I think she knew by the way she. If
she had married she would have changed. I suppose they really were short of
money. Sister? And yet it was a nun invented barbed wire.</p>
<p> He crossed Westmoreland street when S had plodded by towards the Rover
cycleshop. How long ago is that? Year Phil Gilligan died. We were in Lombard
street west. Ten years ago: ninetyfour. Milly was a kiddy then. Molly had that
elephant grey dress with the braided frogs on it. She didn&apos;t like it
because I sprained my ankle first day she wore choir picnic on Killiney hill. As
if that. Never put a dress on her back like it. Fitted her like a glove,
shoulders<a target="foot" id="fhh0043">&ordm;</a> and hips. Just beginning to
plump it out well. Rabbit pie<a target="foot" id="fhh0044">&ordm;</a> we had that day. People looking after her.</p>
<p> Happy. Happier then. Snug little room that was with the red
wallpaper.<a target="foot" id="fhh0045">&ordm;</a> Milly&apos;s tubbing night.
American soap I bought: elderflower. Cosy smell of her bathwater. Funny she looked soaped all over. Shapely too.</p>
<p> He walked along the curbstone.</p>
<p> Stream of life. What was the name of that priestylooking chap was always
squinting in when he passed? Stopping in Citron&apos;s saint Kevin&apos;s
parade. Pen something. Pendennis? My memory is getting. Pen&nbsp;&hellip;?
<br><font color="green">{u22, 149}</font> </p>
<p> Bartell d&apos;Arcy was the tenor, just coming out then. Seeing her home
after practice. Conceited fellow with his waxedup moustache. Gave her that song
<i>Winds that blow from the south</i>.</p>
<p> Windy night that was I went to fetch her after Goodwin&apos;s concert in the
supperroom<a target="foot" id="fhh0048">&ordm;</a> of the
Mansion<a target="foot" id="fhh0049">&ordm;</a> house. He and I behind. Sheet of
her music blew out of my hand against the high school railings. Lucky it
didn&apos;t. Thing like that spoils effect of a night for her. Professor Goodwin
linking her in front. Shaky on his pins, poor old sot. Remember her laughing at
the wind her blizzard collar up. Corner of Harcourt road remember that gust.
Brrfoo! Blew up all her skirts and her boa nearly smothered old Goodwin. She did
get flushed in the wind. Remember when we got home raking up the fire and frying
up those pieces of lap of mutton for her with the Chutney sauce she liked. And
the mulled rum. Could see her in the bedroom from the hearth unclasping her stays: white.</p>
<p> Swish and soft flop her stays made on the bed. Always warm from her. Always
liked to let her self out. Sitting there after till near two taking out her
hairpins. Milly tucked up in beddyhouse. Happy. Happy. That was the night&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O, Mr Bloom, how do you do?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O, how do you do, Mrs Breen?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; No use complaining. How is Molly those times? Haven&apos;t seen her for ages.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; In the pink, Mr Bloom said
gaily.<a target="foot" id="fhh0050">&ordm;</a> Milly&apos;s down in Mullingar, you know.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Is that so?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes. In a photographer&apos;s there. Getting on like a
house on fire. How are all your charges?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; All on the baker&apos;s list, Mrs Breen said.</p>
<p> How many has she? No other in sight.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You&apos;re in black, I see. You have no&nbsp;&hellip;?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; No, Mr Bloom said. I have just come from a funeral.</p>
<p> Going to crop up all day, I foresee.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O, dear me, Mrs Breen said. I hope it wasn&apos;t any near relative. </p>
<p> May as well get her sympathy.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Dignam, Mr Bloom said. An old friend of mine. He died quite
<br><font color="green">{u22, 150}</font>
<br> suddenly, poor fellow. Heart trouble, I believe. Funeral was this morning.</p>
<p class="set">Your funeral&apos;s tomorrow
<br> While you&apos;re coming through the rye.
<br> Diddlediddle dumdum
<br> Diddlediddle&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Sad to lose the old friends, Mrs Breen&apos;s womaneyes said melancholily.</p>
<p> Now that&apos;s quite enough about that. Just:<a target="foot" id="fhh0051">&ordm;</a> quietly: husband.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And your lord and master?</p>
<p> Mrs Breen turned up her two large eyes. Hasn&apos;t lost them anyhow.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O, don&apos;t be talking! she said. He&apos;s a caution.
He&apos;s in there now with his lawbooks finding out the law of libel. He has me heartscalded. Wait till I show you.</p>
<p> Hot mockturtle vapour and steam of newbaked jampuffs poured out from
Harrison&apos;s. The heavy noonreek tickled the top of Mr Bloom&apos;s gullet. A
barefoot arab stood over the grating,<a target="foot" id="fhh0052">&ordm;</a>
breathing in the fumes. Deaden the gnaw of hunger that way.</p>
<p> Opening her handbag, chipped leather.
Hatpin<a target="foot" id="fhh0053">&ordm;</a>: ought to have a guard on those
things. Stick it in a chap&apos;s eye in the tram. Rummaging. Soiled
handkerchief. Medicine bottle. What is she&nbsp;&hellip;?<a target="foot" id="fhh0056">&ordm;</a></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There must be a new moon out, she said. He&apos;s always
bad then. Do you know what he did last night?</p>
<p> Her hand ceased to rummage. Her eyes fixed themselves on him, wide in alarm, yet smiling. </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What? Mr Bloom asked.</p>
<p> Let her speak. Look straight in her eyes. I believe you. Trust me.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Woke me up in the night, she said. Dream he had a nightmare.</p>
<p> Indiges.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Said the ace of spades was walking up the stairs.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The ace of spades! Mr Bloom said.</p>
<p> She took a folded postcard from her handbag.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Read that, she said. He got it this morning.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What is it? Mr Bloom asked, taking the card. U.&nbsp;P.?
<br><font color="green">{u22, 151}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; U. P:<a target="foot" id="fhh0057">&ordm;</a> up, she
said. Someone taking a rise out of him. It&apos;s a great shame for them whoever he is.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Indeed it is, Mr Bloom said.</p>
<p> She took back the card, sighing.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And now he&apos;s going round to Mr Menton&apos;s office.
He&apos;s going to take an action for ten thousand pounds, he says.</p>
<p> She folded the card back into her untidy bag and snapped the catch.</p>
<p> Same blue serge dress she had two years ago, the nap bleaching. Seen its
best days. Wispish hair over her ears. And that dusty looking toque: three old
cherries to take the harm out of it. She used to be a smart dresser. Lines round
her mouth. Only a year or two older than Molly.</p>
<p> See the eye that woman gave her, passing. Cruel.</p>
<p> He looked still at her, holding back behind his look his discontent. Pungent
mockturtle, oxtail, mulligatawny. I&apos;m hungry too. A few flakes of pastry on
the gusset of her dress: daub of sugary flour stuck to her cheek. Floey Powell
that was. U.&nbsp;P:<a target="foot" id="fhh0060">&ordm;</a> up.</p>
<p> Change the subject.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Do you ever see anything of Mrs Beaufoy? Mr Bloom asked.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Mina Purefoy? she said.</p>
<p> Philip Beaufoy I was thinking. Playgoers&apos; Club. Matcham often thinks of the masterstroke.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes. </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I just called over to ask is she over it. She&apos;s in
the maternity hospital in Holles street. Dr Horne got her in. She&apos;s three days bad now.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O, Mr Bloom said. I&apos;m sorry to hear that.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, Mrs Breen said. And a houseful of kids at home.
It&apos;s a very stiff birth, the nurse told me.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O, Mr Bloom said.</p>
<p> His heavy pitying gaze absorbed her news. His tongue clacked in compassion. Dth! Dth!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I&apos;m sorry to hear that, he said. Poor thing! Three days. That&apos;s terrible for her.</p>
<p> Mrs Breen nodded.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; She was taken bad on the Tuesday&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> Mr Bloom touched her funnybone gently, warning her:<a target="foot" id="fhh0061">&ordm;</a></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Mind! Let this man pass.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 152}</font> </p>
<p> A bony form strode along the curbstone from the river staring with a rapt
gaze into the sunlight through a
heavystringed<a target="foot" id="fhh0062">&ordm;</a> glass. Tight as a
skullpiece a tiny hat gripped his head. From his arm a folded dustcoat, a stick
and an umbrella dangled to his stride.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Watch him, Mr Bloom said. He always walks outside the lampposts. Watch.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who is he when he&apos;s at
home?<a target="foot" id="fhh0063">&ordm;</a> Mrs Breen asked. Is he dotty?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; His name is Cashel Boyle O&apos;Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall
Farrell, Mr Bloom said smiling. Watch.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He has enough of them, she said. Denis will be like that one of these days.</p>
<p> She broke off suddenly.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There he is, she said. I must go after him.
Goodbye<a target="foot" id="fhh0064">&ordm;</a>. Remember me to Molly, won&apos;t you?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I will, Mr Bloom said.</p>
<p> He watched her dodge through passers towards the shopfronts. Denis Breen in
skimpy frockcoat and blue canvas shoes shuffled out of
Harrison&apos;s<a target="foot" id="fhh0065">&ordm;</a> hugging two heavy tomes
to his ribs. Like old times. He suffered her to overtake him without surprise
 and thrust his dull grey beard towards her, his loose jaw wagging as he spoke earnestly.</p>
<p> Off his chump.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom walked on again easily, seeing ahead of him in sunlight the tight
skullpiece, the dangling
stickumbrelladustcoat<a target="foot" id="fhh0066">&ordm;</a>. Going the two
days. Watch him. Out he goes again. And that other old mosey lunatic. Hard time she must have with him.</p>
<p> U. P:<a target="foot" id="fhh0067">&ordm;</a> up. I&apos;ll take my oath
that&apos;s Alf Bergan or Richie Goulding. Wrote it for a lark in the Scotch
house<a target="foot" id="fhh0068">&ordm;</a> I bet anything. Round to
Menton&apos;s office. His oyster eyes staring at the postcard. Be a sight for the gods.</p>
<p> He passed the <i>Irish Times.</i> There might be other answers lying there.
At their lunch now. Clerk with the glasses there doesn&apos;t know me. O, let
them stay there. Enough bother wading through fortyfour of them. Wanted, smart
typist to aid gentleman in literary work. I called you naughty darling because I
do not like that other world. Please tell me what is the meaning. Please tell me
what perfume your wife. Tell me who made the world. The way they spring those
questions on you. And the other one Lizzie Twigg. My literary efforts have had
the good fortune to meet with the approval of the eminent
<br><font color="green">{u22, 153}</font>
<br> poet A.&nbsp;E (Mr Geo.<a target="foot" id="fhh0069">&ordm;</a> Russell).
No time to do her hair drinking sloppy tea with a book of poetry.</p>
<p> Best paper for a small ad. James Carlisle made that. Six and a half per cent
dividend. Cunning old Scotch fox. All the toady news. Our gracious and popular
vicereine. Bought the <i>Irish Field</i> now. Lady Mountcashel has now
completely recovered after her confinement and rode out with the Meath hounds.
Strong as a brood mare some of those horsey women. Toss off a glass of raw
brandy while you&apos;d say knife. That one at the <i>Grosvenor</i> this
morning. Up with her on the car: wishswish. Think that pugnosed tramdriver did it out of spite.</p>
<p> Poor Mrs Purefoy!</p>
<p> He stood at Fleet street crossing. A<a target="foot" id="fhh0077">&ordm;</a>
lunch at Rowe&apos;s? Must look up that ad in the national library. An eightpenny in the Burton. On my way.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 154}</font> </p>
<p> He walked on past Bolton&apos;s Westmoreland house. Tea, tea, tea. I forgot to tap Tom Kernan.</p>
<p> Ss. Dth, dth, dth! Three days imagine groaning on a bed with a vinegared
handkerchief round her forehead, her belly swollen
out.<a target="foot" id="fhh0078">&ordm;</a> Phew! Dreadful simply! Child&apos;s
head too big: forceps. Doubled up inside her trying to butt its way out blindly,
groping for the way out.  Kill me that would. Lucky Molly got over hers lightly.
They ought to invent something to stop that. Twilight
sleep<a target="foot" id="fhh0079">&ordm;</a> idea:

<p> How flat they look all of a sudden after. Peaceful eyes. Weight off their

keep them waiting months for their fees. People are very ungrateful to doctors.</p>
<p> A squad of constables debouched from College street, marching in Indian
file. Foodheated faces, sweating helmets, patting their truncheons. After their
feed with a good load of fat soup under  their belts. They split up in groups
and scattered, saluting,<a target="foot" id="fhh0089">&ordm;</a> towards

<br> their beats. Let out to graze. A squad of others, marching irregularly
rounded Trinity railings making for the station. Bound for their troughs.
Prepare to receive cavalry. Prepare to receive soup.</p>
<p> He crossed under Tommy Moore&apos;s roguish finger. They did right to put
him up over a urinal: meeting of the waters. There is not in this wide world a
vallee. Great song of Julia Morkan&apos;s. Kept her voice up to the very last.
Pupil of Michael Balfe&apos;s, wasn&apos;t she?</p>

Can&apos;t blame them after all with the job they have. That

was given his degree in Trinity he got a run for his money. My word he did! His
horse&apos;s<a target="foot" id="fhh0091">&ordm;</a> hoofs clattering after us
down Abbey street. Lucky<a target="foot" id="fhh0092">&ordm;</a> I had the
presence<a target="foot" id="fhh0093">&ordm;</a> of mind to dive into
Manning&apos;s. He did come a wallop, by George. Must have cracked his skull on
the cobblestones. I oughtn&apos;t to have got myself swept along with those medicals. Right here it was.</p>

<p> Silly game: mob of young cubs yelling their guts out. Few
years&apos;<a target="foot" id="fhh0095">&ordm;</a> time half of them
magistrates and civil servants. War comes on: into the army helterskelter: same
fellows used to. Whether on the scaffold high<a target="foot" id="fhh0097">&ordm;</a>.</p>
<p> Never know who you&apos;re talking to. Corny Kelleher he has Harvey  Duff in
his eye. Like that Peter of Denis or James Carey blew the gaff on the
invincibles. Member of the corporation too. Egging raw youths on to get in the
know all<a target="foot" id="fhh0098">&ordm;</a> the time drawing secret service pay from the castle.</p>
<p> Stephen&apos;s idea was the best. He knew them. Circles of ten so that a
fellow couldn&apos;t inform on more than his own ring.
Turnkey&apos;s<a target="foot" id="fhh0102">&ordm;</a> daughter got him out of
Richmond, off from Lusk, putting up in the Buckingham palace hotel under their very noses. Irish Garibaldi.</p>
<p> You must have a certain fascination. Parnell. Arthur Griffith is a
squareheaded fellow but he hasn&apos;t got go in him for the mob. Or gas about
our lovely land. Have your daughters inveigling them to your house. Fill them up
with meat and drink. The not far distant day.
Homerule<a target="foot" id="fhh0103">&ordm;</a> sun rising up in the northwest. </p>
<p> His smile faded as he walked, a heavy cloud hiding the sun slowly, shadowing
Trinity&apos;s surly front. Trams passed one another, ingoing, outgoing,
clanging. Useless words. Things go on:
same:<a target="foot" id="fhh0104">&ordm;</a> day after day: squads of police
marching out, back: trams in, out. Those two loonies mooching about. Dignam
carted off. Mina Purefoy swollen belly on a bed groaning to have a child tugged
out of her. One born every second somewhere. Another dying every second. Since I
fed the birds five minutes. Three hundred kicked the bucket. Other three hundred
born, washing the blood off, bawling maaaaaa.</p>
<p> Cityful passing away, other cityful coming passing away too: other coming
on, passing on. Houses, lines of houses, street, miles of pavements,
<br><font color="green">{u22, 157}</font>
<br> piled up bricks, stones. Changing hands. This owner, that. Landlord never
dies they say. Other steps into his shoes when he gets his notice to quit. They
buy the place with gold and then they have the place and gold as well. Of course
there&apos;s a swindle in it somewhere. Piled up in cities, worn away age after
age. Pyramids in sand. Babylon. Big stones left. Rest rubble, sprawling suburbs,
jerrybuilt.<a target="foot" id="fhh0106">&ordm;</a> Kerwan&apos;s houses built of breeze. Shelter, for the night.</p>
<p> No-one<a target="foot" id="fhh0107">&ordm;</a> is anything.</p>
<p> This is the very worst hour of the day. Dull, gloomy. I feel. Hate this
hour. Provost&apos;s house. The reverend tinned Salmon D.D.. Well tinned in
there. Like a mortuary chapel. Wouldn&apos;t live in it if they paid me. Hope they have liver and bacon today.</p>
<p> The sun freed itself slowly and lit glints of light among the
silverware<a target="foot" id="fhh0109">&ordm;</a> in Walter Sexton&apos;s
window opposite by which John Howard Parnell passed, unseeing.</p>
<p> There he is. The brother. Image of the brother. Haunting face. Now
that&apos;s a coincidence. Course hundreds of times you think of a person and
don&apos;t meet him. Like a man walking in his sleep. No-one knows him. Must be
a corporation meeting today. They say he never put on the city marshal&apos;s
uniform since he got the job. Charley Boulger used to  come out on his horse,
cocked hat, puffed, powdered and shaved. Look at the woebegone walk of him.
Great man&apos;s brother: his brother&apos;s brother.

pass a remark on him. Freeze them up with that eye of his. That&apos;s the
fascination. The name. Still David Sheehy beat him for south Meath. Simon
Dedalus said when they put him in parliament that Parnell would come back from
the grave and lead him out of the house of commons by the arm.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Of the twoheaded octopus, one of whose heads is the head
upon which the ends of the world are about to come while the other speaks with a

<p> And there he is now that&apos;s really a coincidence. Second time. With the
approval of the eminent poet, Mr Geo Russell. That might be Lizzie Twigg with
him. A.E: what<a target="foot" id="fhh0113">&ordm;</a> does that mean. Initials
perhaps. Albert Edward, Arthur Edmund, Alphonsus Eb Ed El Esquire. What was he
saying? The ends of the world with a Scotch accent. Tentacles: octopus:
that&apos;s some symbolism. Holding forth. She&apos;s taking it all in. Not
saying a word. To aid gentleman in literary work.</p>
<p> His eyes following the high figure in homespun, beard and bicycle, a
listening woman at his side. Coming from the vegetarian. Only vegetables and
fruits. They say it&apos;s healthier. Windandwatery though. Tried it too. Why do
they call that thing they gave me nutsteak? To give you the idea you are  eating rumpsteak. Absurd.</p>
<p> Her stockings are loose over her ankles. I detest that. So tasteless. Those
literary etherial people they are all. Dreamy, cloudy, symbolistic. Esthetes
they are. I wouldn&apos;t be surprised<a target="foot" id="fhh0117">&ordm;</a>
if it was that kind of food you see produces the like waves of the brain the
poetical. For example one of those policeman sweating soup into their
shirts<a target="foot" id="fhh0118">&ordm;</a> you couldn&apos;t squeeze poetry
out of him. Don&apos;t know what poetry is even. Must be in a certain mood.</p>

<p> He crossed at Nassau street corner and stood before the window of Yeates and
Son, pricing the fieldglasses<a target="foot" id="fhh0120">&ordm;</a>. Or will I
drop into old Harris&apos;s and have a chat with young Sinclair. Nice
wellmannered fellow. Probably at his lunch. Must get those old glasses of mine
set right. Goerz<a target="foot" id="fhh0121">&ordm;</a> lenses seven guineas.
Might chance on a pair in the railway lost property office. Astonishing the
things people leave behind them in trains and
cloakrooms<a target="foot" id="fhh0122">&ordm;</a>. What do they be thinking
about? Women too. Incredible. There&apos;s a little watch up there on the roof of the bank to test those glasses by.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 159}</font> </p>
<p> His lids came down on the lower rims of his irises. Can&apos;t see it. If
you imagine it&apos;s there you can almost see it. Can&apos;t see it.</p>
<p> He faced about and, standing between the awnings, held out his right hand at
arm&apos;s length towards the sun. Wanted to try that often. Yes: completely.
The tip of his little finger blotted out the sun&apos;s disk. Must be the focus
where the rays cross. If I had black glasses. Interesting. There was a lot of
talk about those sunspots when we were in Lombard street west. Looking up from
the back garden. Terrific explosions they are. There will be a total eclipse this year, autumn some time.</p>
<p> Now that I come to think that ball falls at Greenwich time.  It&apos;s the
clock is worked by an electric wire from Dunsink. Must go out there some first
Saturday of the month. If I could get an introduction to professor Joly or learn
up something about his family. That would do to: man always feels complimented.</p>
<p> Ah.</p>
<p> His hand fell to his side again.</p>
<p> Never know anything about it. Waste of time. Gasballs spinning about,
crossing each other, passing. Same old dingdong always. Gas, then solid, then
world, then cold, then dead shell drifting around, frozen rock, like that
pineapple rock. The moon. Must be a new moon out, she said. I believe there is.</p>
<p> He went on by la Maison<a target="foot" id="fhh0124">&ordm;</a> Claire.</p>
<p> Wait. The full moon was the night we were Sunday fortnight exactly there is
a new moon. Walking down by the Tolka. She was humming. The young may moon
she&apos;s beaming, love.<a target="foot" id="fhh0125">&ordm;</a> He other side
of her. Elbow. Fingers. He. Glowworm&apos;s laamp is gleaming,
love.<a target="foot" id="fhh0127">&ordm;</a> Touch, Fingers. Asking. Answer. Yes.</p>
<p> Stop. Stop. If it was it was. Must.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom, quickbreathing<a target="foot" id="fhh0128">&ordm;</a>, slowlier walking passed Adam court.</p>
<p> With ha quiet keep quiet relief<a target="foot" id="fhh0129">&ordm;</a> his
eyes took note this is the<a target="foot" id="fhh0130">&ordm;</a> street here
middle of the day of Bob Doran&apos;s bottle shoulders. On his annual bend,
M&apos;Coy said. Up in the Coombe with chummies and streetwalkers and then the rest of the year sober as a judge.</p>
<p> Yes. Thought so. Into the Empire. Gone. Where Pat Kinsella
had<a target="foot" id="fhh0131">&ordm;</a> his Harp theatre. Broth of a boy
Dion Boucicault business with his harvestmoon face in a poky bonnet. Three Purty
Maids from School.<a target="foot" id="fhh0133">&ordm;</a> How time
flies,<a target="foot" id="fhh0134">&ordm;</a> eh? Showing long red pantaloons
under his skirts. Drinkers, drinking, laughed. Good man, Pat. Coarse red: fun
for drunkards: guffaw and smoke. His parboiled eyes. Where is he now. Beggar
somewhere. The harp that once did starve us all.</p>
<p> I was happier then. Or was that I? Or am I now I? Twentyeight I was. She
twentythree. Can&apos;t bring back time. Like holding water in your hand. Would
I go back to then? Just beginning then. Would you? Are you not happy then in
your life you poor little naughty boy? I must answer. Write it in the library.</p>
<p> Grafton street gay with housed awnings. Muslin prints, silk dames passing,
jingle of harnesses, hoofthuds soft ringing on the cooking causeway. Thick
ankles that woman has<a target="foot" id="fhh0137">&ordm;</a> in the white
stockings. Countrybred<a target="foot" id="fhh0138">&ordm;</a>. Beef to the
heels were in. Always gives a woman clumsy feet. Molly looks out of shape.</p>
<p> He passed, dallying,<a target="foot" id="fhh0139">&ordm;</a> the window of
Brown Thomas, silk mercers. A tilted urn poured from its mouth a flood of
bloodhued poplin: lustrous blood. The huguenots brought that here. Must be washed in rainwater.</p>
<p> Pincushions. I&apos;m a long time threatening to buy one. Sticking them all over the place.</p>
<p> He bared slightly his left forearm. Scrape: nearly gone. Not today anyhow.
Must go back for that lotion. For her birthday perhaps. June, July, Augseptember
eighth. Nearly three months off. Then she mightn&apos;t like it. Women won&apos;t pick up pins. Say its cuts lo.</p>
<p> Gleaming silks, petticoats on slim brass rails, rays of silk stockings.</p>
<p> Useless to go back. Had to be. Tell me all.</p>
<p> High voices. Sunwarmth. Silk. Jingling harnesses. Women, women.</p>
<p> A warm human plumpness settled down on his brain. His brain  yielded.
Perfumes of embraces assailed him. His hungered flesh obscurely, mutely craved to adore.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 161}</font> </p>
<p> Duke street. Here we are. Must eat. The Burton. Feel better then.</p>
<p> He turned Combridge&apos;s corner, still pursued.
Jingling,<a target="foot" id="fhh0148">&ordm;</a> hoofthuds. Perfumed bodies,
warm, full. All kissed, yielded: in deep summer fields, tangled pressed grass,
in trickling hallways of tenements, along sofas, creaking beds, chairs.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Jack, love!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Darling!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Kiss me, Reggie!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; My boy!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Love!</p>
<p> His heart astir he pushed in the door of the Burton restaurant. Stink
gripped his trembling breath: pungent meatjuice, slop of greens.</p>
<p> Men, men, men.</p>
<p> Squatted on high stools by the bar, hats shoved back, at the tables, calling
for more bread, no charge, swilling, wolfing gobfuls of sloppy food, their eyes
bulging, wiping wetted moustaches. A man with a infant&apos;s napkin tucked
round him spooned gurgling soup down his gullet. A man spitting back on his
plate: gristle: no teeth to chew it. Chump chop he has. Sad booser&apos;s eyes.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Roast beef and cabbage.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; One stew.</p>
<p> Smells of men.<a target="foot" id="fhh0151">&ordm;</a>
Spat-on<a target="foot" id="fhh0152">&ordm;</a> sawdust, sweetish warmish
cigarettesmoke, reek of plug, spilt beer, men&apos;s beery piss, the stale of ferment. </p>
<p> <a name="un6008c" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6008c"></a>His gorge
rose.<a target="foot" id="fhh0153">&ordm;</a></p>
<p> Couldn&apos;t eat a morsel here. Get out of it.</p>
<p> He gazed round the stooled and tabled eaters, tightening the wings of his nose.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 162}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Two stouts here.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; One corned and cabbage.</p>
<p> That fellow ramming a knifeful of cabbage down. Give me the fidgets to look
at him. Like second nature to him. Born with a silver knife in his mouth.
That&apos;s witty, I think. Or no. Silver means born rich. Born with a knife. But then the allusion is lost.</p>
<p> An illgirt server gathered sticky clattering plates. Rock, the head bailiff,
standing at the bar blew the foamy crown from his tankard. Well up: it splashed yellow near his boot.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom raised his fingers to his lips doubtfully. His eyes said:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Not here. Don&apos;t see him.</p>
<p> Get out of it.<a target="foot" id="fhh0157">&ordm;</a> He backed towards the
door. Get something light in Davy Byrne&apos;s next door. Keep me going. Had a good breakfast.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Roast and mashed here.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Pint of stout.</p>
<p> Every fellow for his own, tooth and nail. Gulp grub gulp.</p>
<p> He came out into clearer air and turned back towards Grafton street</p>
<p> Suppose that communal kitchen. Years to come perhaps. All coming  down with
a porringer to be filled, John Howard Parnell, example, the provost of Trinity,
everybody don&apos;t talk of your provosts and provost of Trinity, women and
children and cabmen and priests and parsons and field marshals and archbishops,
Father O&apos;Flynn would make hares of them all. Want a
souppot<a target="foot" id="fhh0161">&ordm;</a> as big as the Phoenix
park<a target="foot" id="fhh0162">&ordm;</a>. Then who&apos;d wash up
<br><font color="green">{u22, 163}</font>
<br> all the plates and forks? Might be all feeding on tabloids that time. Teeth getting worse and worse.</p>
<p> After all there&apos;s a lot in that vegetarian the fine flavours of things
from the earth garlic of course<a target="foot" id="fhh0163">&ordm;</a> it
stinks after Italians crisp of onions mushrooms. Pain to the animal too. Poor
wretched brutes there at the cattle market waiting for the poleaxe to split
their skulls open. Moo. Poor trembling calves. Meh. Staggering bob. Bubble and
squeak. Butchers&apos; buckets wobbly lights. Hot fresh blood they prescribe for
decline. Insidious. Lick it up<a target="foot" id="fhh0164">&ordm;</a> smoking
hot<a target="foot" id="fhh0165">&ordm;</a>. ghosts</p>
<p> Ah, I&apos;m hungry.</p>
<p> He entered Davy Byrne&apos;s. What will I take? Let me see now. </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Hello, Bloom,<a target="foot" id="fhh0166">&ordm;</a> Nosey Flynn said from his nook.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Hello, Flynn.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; How is things going?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Tiptop&nbsp;&hellip; Let me see. I&apos;ll take a glass of burgundy and let me see.</p>
<p> Sardines on the shelves. Potted meats. What is home without Plumtree&apos;s
potted meat?<a target="foot" id="fhh0168">&ordm;</a> Incomplete. What a stupid
ad. Right under the obituary notices too. Dignam&apos;s potted meat. With it an
abode of bliss.<a target="foot" id="fhh0169">&ordm;</a> Lord knows what concoction.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Have you a cheese sandwich?
<br><font color="green">{u22, 164}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, sir.</p>
<p> Like a few olives too if they had them. Good glass of
burgundy<a target="foot" id="fhh0174">&ordm;</a> take away that feeling.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Wife well?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Quite well, thanks&nbsp;&hellip; A cheese sandwich, then. Gorgonzola, have you?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, sir.</p>
<p> Nosey Flynn sipped his grog.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Doing any singing those times? </p>
<p> Flap ears. Music. Knows as much about it as my coachman. Still better tell him. Does no harm.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; She&apos;s engaged for a big tour end of this month. You may have heard perhaps.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; No. O, that&apos;s the style. Who&apos;s getting it up?</p>
<p> The barman curate served.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; How much is that?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Seven d, sir&nbsp;&hellip; Thank you, sir.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom cut his sandwich into slender strips.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Mustard, sir.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Thank you.</p>
<p> He studded under each lifted strip yellow blobs carefully.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Getting it up? he said. Well, it&apos;s like a company
idea, you see. Part shares and part profits.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ay, now I remember, Nosey Flynn said, putting his hand in
his pocket to scratch his groin. Who is this was telling me? Isn&apos;t Blazes Boylan mixed up in it?</p>
<p> A warm shock of air, heat of mustard,
hanched<a target="foot" id="fhh0175">&ordm;</a> on Mr Bloom&apos;s heart. He
raised his eyes and met the stare of a bilious clock. Two. Time going on. Hands moving. Two. Not yet.</p>
<p> His midriff yearned then upward, sank within him, yearned more longly, longingly.</p>
<p> Wine.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 165}</font> </p>
<p> He set down his wineglass delicately, having tasted a comforting sip.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, he said. He&apos;s the organiser in point of fact.</p>
<p> No fear: no brains.</p>
<p> Nosey Flynn snuffled</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He made a tidy bit Jack Mooney was telling me over that
boxingmatch Myler Keogh won again that soldier in the  Portobello barracks. By
God,<a target="foot" id="fhh0176">&ordm;</a> he had Myler down in the country, he was telling me&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> Hope that dewdrop doesn&apos;t come down into his glass. No, snuffled it up.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; For near a month, man, before it came off. Sucking
<a name="s12009h" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12009h">duck eggs</a>, by God,
all day long. Keep him off the boose, see? O, by God, Blazes is a hairy chap.</p>
<p> Davy Byrne came forward from the hind bar in
shirtsleeves<a target="foot" id="fhh0177">&ordm;</a>, cleaning his lips with two
wipes of his napkin. Herring&apos;s blush.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And here&apos;s himself and pepper on him, Nosey Flynn
said. Can you give us a good one for the Gold cup.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I&apos;m off that, Mr Flynn, Davy Byrne answered. I never put anything on a horse.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You&apos;re right there, Nosey Flynn said.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom ate his strips of sandwich, relishing fresh clean bread, pungent
mustard, the feety savour of green cheese. Sips of his wine soothed his palate.</p>
<p> Nice quiet bar. Nice piece of wood in that counter. Nicely planed. Like the way it curves there.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I wouldn&apos;t do anything in that line at all, Davy
Byrne said. It ruined many a man, the same horses.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; True for you, Nosey Flynn said. Unless you&apos;re in the
know. There&apos;s no straight sport going now. Lenehan gets some good ones.

<p> Mild fire of wine kindled his veins. I wanted that really. Felt so off

claws. All the odd things people picked up for food. Out of shells, periwinkles
with a pin, off trees, out of the ground, out of the sea with a hook and bait.
Must have been led on by the smell or the look to know what was good.

<p> Stuck on the pane two flies buzzed, stuck.</p>
<p> Glowing wine on his palate lingered swallowed. Crushing in the winepress
grapes of Burgundy. Sun&apos;s heat it is. Seems to a secret touch telling me
memory. Touched his palate moistened remembered. Hidden under wild ferns on
Howth below<a target="foot" id="fhh0195">&ordm;</a> us bay and sky. No sound.
The bay.  The sky. Over her I lay full lips full open kissed her mouth. Yum.
Softly she gave me in my mouth
<a name="un3005i" href="../../ff/unbs/un3all.htm#un3005i">the seedcake warm and
chewed</a>. Mawkish pulp her mouth had mumbled sweetsour of her spittle. Joy: I

<br> Pebbles fell. She did not move. A goat. Nobody. High above it passed
surefooted dropping currants Screened under ferns she laughed warmfolded. Wildly
I lay on her, kissed her:<a target="foot" id="fhh0199">&ordm;</a> eyes, her
lips, her stretched throat beating, woman&apos;s breasts full in her blouse of
voile fat nipples standing. Hot I tongued her. She kissed me. I was kissed. All
yielding she tossed my hair, kissed, she kissed me.</p>
<p> Me. And me now.</p>
<p> His downcast eyes followed the silent veining of the oaken slab. Beauty: it
curves: curves are beauty. Shapely goddesses. Juno. Venus. Their curves the
world admires. I will call into the museum, see them standing in the round hall,
naked, goddesses they don&apos;t care who looks at them, all parts. Never
speaking. I mean to say to fellows like Flynn. Quaffing nectar at mess with the

<p> When the sound of his boots had ceased Davy Byrne said from his book.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What is this he is? Isn&apos;t he in the insurance line?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He&apos;s out of that long ago, Nosey Flynn said. He does canvassing for the <i>Freeman</i>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I know him well to see, Davy Byrne said. Is he in trouble?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Trouble? Nosey Flynn said. Not that I heard of. Why?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I noticed he was in mourning, Davy Byrne said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Was he? Nosey Flynn said. So he was, faith. I asked him
how was all at home. You&apos;re right, by God. So he was.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I never touch on the subject, Davy Byrne said
respectfully, if I see a person is in trouble that way. It only brings it up fresh in their minds.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It&apos;s not the wife anyhow, Nosey Flynn said. I met him the day before
<br><font color="green">{u22, 169}</font>
<br> yesterday and he coming out of that Irish farm dairy John Wyse Nolan&apos;s
wife has in Henry street with a jar of cream in his hand taking it home to his
better half. She&apos;s
<a name="un1032ej" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1032ej">well nourished</a>, I tell you. Plovers on toast.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And is he doing for the Freeman? Davy Byrne said.</p>
<p> Nosey Flynn pursed his lips.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He doesn&apos;t buy cream on the ads he picks up. You may take that from me?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; How so? Davy Byrne asked.</p>
<p> Nosey Flynn made swift passes in the air with juggling fingers and winked.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He&apos;s in the craft, he said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Do you tell me so? Davy Byrne said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Very much so, Nosey Flynn said. Ancient, free and accepted
order. He&apos;s an excellent brother. Light, life and love, by God. They give
him a leg up. I was told that by a &mdash;<a target="foot" id="fhh0207">&ordm;</a> well, I won&apos;t say who.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Is that a fact? Davy Byrne said. </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O, it&apos;s a fine order, Nosey Flynn said. They stick to
you when you&apos;re down. I know a fellow was trying to get into it. But
they&apos;re as close as damn it. By God they did right to keep the women out of it.</p>
<p> Davy Byrne smiled, yawned, nodded all in one.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Iiiiiichaaach!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There was one woman, Nosey Flynn said, hid herself in a
clock to find out what they do be doing. But be damned but they smelt her too
and swore her in on the spot a master mason. That was one of the saint Legers of Doneraile.</p>
<p> Davy Byrne sated after his yawn, said with tearwet eyes:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And is that a fact? Decent quiet man he is. I often saw
him in here and I never once saw him &mdash;<a target="foot" id="fhh0208">&ordm;</a> you know, over the line.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Couldn&apos;t make him drunk, Nosey Flynn said firmly.
Slips off when it gets too hot. Didn&apos;t you see him look at his watch? Ah,
you weren&apos;t there. If you ask him to have a drink first thing he does he
outs with the watch to see what it ought to be. Declare to God he does.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There are some like that, Davy Byrne said. He&apos;s a safe man, I&apos;d say.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He&apos;s not too bad, Nosey Flynn said. He&apos;s been
known to put his hand down too to help a fellow.
<a name="un3021t" href="../../ff/unbs/un3all.htm#un3021t">Give the devil his
due</a>. O, Bloom has his good points. But there&apos;s one thing he&apos;ll never do.</p>
<p> His hand scrawled a dry pen signature beside his grog.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I know, Davy Byrne said.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 170}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Nothing in black and white, Nosey Flynn said.</p>
<p> Paddy Leonard and Bantam Lyons came in. Tom Rochford followed frowning, a plaining hand on his claret waistcoat.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Day, Mr Byrne.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Day, gentlemen.</p>
<p> They paused at the counter.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who&apos;s standing? Paddy Leonard asked.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I&apos;m sitting anyhow, Nosey Flynn said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Well, what&apos;ll it be? Paddy Leonard asked.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I&apos;ll take a stone ginger, Bantam Lyons said. </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; How much? Paddy Leonard cried. Since when, for God&apos; sake? What&apos;s yours, Tom?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; How is the main drainage? Nosey Flynn asked.</p>
<p> For answer Tom Rochford pressed his hand to his breastbone and retched dumbly in his throat.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Would I trouble you for a glass of fresh water, Mr Byrne? he said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Certainly, sir.</p>
<p> Paddy Leonard eyed his alemates.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Lord love a duck, he said. Look at what I&apos;m standing drinks to. Water and gingerbeer.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He has some bloody horse up his sleeve, Paddy Leonard said of Lyons. For the Gold cup.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Zinfandel is it? Nosey Flynn asked.</p>
<p> Tom Rochford spilt powder from a folded paper into the water set before him.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That cursed dyspepsia, he said before drinking:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Breadsoda is very good, Davy Byrne said.</p>
<p> Tom Rochford nodded and drank.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Is it Zinfandel<a target="foot" id="fhh0209">&ordm;</a>?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Say nothing! Bantam Lyons said with a wink. I&apos;m going to have five bob on my own.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Tell us and be damned to you, Paddy Leonard said. Who gave it to you?</p>
<p> Mr Bloom on his way out raised three fingers in greeting.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; So long! Nosey Flynn said.</p>
<p> The others turned.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That&apos;s the man now that gave it to me, Bantam Lyons whispered.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 171}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Prrwh! Paddy Leonard said with scorn. Mr Byrne, sir,
we&apos;ll take two of your small whiskies after that and a&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Stone ginger, Davy Byrne added civilly.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ay, Paddy Leonard said. A sucking bottle for the baby.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom walked towards Dawson street. Something green it would have to be:
spinach, say. Then with those R&ouml;ntgen rays searchlight you could.  In Duke
lane a terrier choked up a sick knuckly cud on the
cobblestones<a target="foot" id="fhh0210">&ordm;</a> and lapped it with new
zest. Mr Bloom coasted warily. Ruminants. Wonder if Tom Rochford will do
anything with that invention of his? Wasting time explaining it to Flynn&apos;s
mouth. Lean people long mouths. Ought to be a hall or place where inventors
could go in and invent free. Course you&apos;d have cranks pestering. He hummed
in solemn echo prolonging the closes of the bars:</p>
<p class="diset">&mdash; <i>Don</i><a target="foot" id="fhh0211">&ordm;</a> <i>Giovanni, a cenar teco
<br> M&apos;invitasti.</i></p>
<p> Feel better now. That <i>Kilkenny People</i> in the National library now I must.</p>
<p> Bare clean
<a name="un1032ak" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1032ak">closestools</a>
waiting in the window of William Miller, plumber, turned back his thoughts. They
could: and watch it all the way down changing biliary duct spleen squirting
liver<a target="foot" id="fhh0212">&ordm;</a> gastric juice coils of intestines
like pipes. But the poor buffer would have to stand all the time with his insides on show. Science.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>A cenar teco.</i></p>
<p> What does <i>teco</i> mean. Tonight perhaps.</p>
<p class="diset">&mdash; <i>Don</i><a target="foot" id="fhh0213">&ordm;</a> <i>Giovanni thou hast me invited</i>
<br> <i>To come to supper tonight</i>
<br> <i>The rum the rumdum</i></p>
<p> Doesn&apos;t go properly.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 172}</font> </p>
<p> Keyes: two months if I get Nannetti to. That&apos;ll be two pounds ten about
two pounds eight. Three Hynes owes me. Two eleven.
Prescott&apos;s<a target="foot" id="fhh0214">&ordm;</a> dyeworks van over there.
If I get Billy<a target="foot" id="fhh0215">&ordm;</a>
Prescott&apos;s<a target="foot" id="fhh0216">&ordm;</a> ad: two fifteen. Five guineas about. On the pig&apos;s back.</p>
<p> Could buy one of those silk petticoats for Molly, colour of her new garters.</p>
<p> Tour the south then. What about English watering places? Those lovely
seaside girls.<a target="foot" id="fhh0218">&ordm;</a></p>
<p> He turned at Gray&apos;s confectioner&apos;s window of tarts and passed the
reverend Thomas Connellan&apos;s bookstore. <i>Why I left the church of
Rome</i>.<a target="foot" id="fhh0220">&ordm;</a> Birds&apos; nest women finance
him. They say they used to give hungry children soup to change to protestants.
<i>Why they left the church of Rome</i>.</p>
<p> A blind stripling stood tapping the curbstone with his slender cane. No tram in sight. Wants to cross.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Do you want to cross? Mr Bloom asked.</p>
<p> The blind stripling did not answer. His
wallface<a target="foot" id="fhh0223">&ordm;</a> frowned weakly. He moved his head uncertainly.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You&apos;re in Dawson street, Mr Bloom said. Molesworth
street is opposite. Do you want to cross? There&apos;s nothing in the way.</p>
<p> The cane moved out trembling to the left. Mr Bloom&apos;s gaze followed its
line and saw again the dyeworks&apos; van drawn up before Drago&apos;s. Where I
saw his
<a name="s19001o" href="../../ff/unbs/s19all.htm#s19001o">brillantined</a> hair just when I was. Horse drooping.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There&apos;s a van there, Mr Bloom said, but it&apos;s not
moving. I&apos;ll see you across. Do you want to go to Molesworth street?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, the boy answered. South Frederick street.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Come, Mr Bloom said.</p>
<p> He took the thin elbow gently and, guiding the boy across the street, set
him by the farther curbstone. He touched the thin elbow gently: then took the
limp seeing hand and guided the boy slowly forward.</p>
<p> Say something to him. Better not do the condescending. Something ordinary.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font></p>
<p>
<br><font color="green">{u22, 173}</font> </p>
<p> Stains on his coat. Slobbers his
food,<a target="foot" id="fhh0225">&ordm;</a> I suppose. Like a child&apos;s
hand, his hand. Like Milly&apos;s was. Sensitive. Sizing me up probably from my
hand. Van. Keep his cane clear of the horses&apos;
legs:<a target="foot" id="fhh0226">&ordm;</a> tired brute get his doze.
That&apos;s right. Clear. Behind a bull: in front of a horse.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Thanks, sir.</p>
<p> Knows I&apos;m a man. Voice.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Right now? First turn to the left.</p>
<p> The blind stripling tapped the curbstone and went on his way, drawing his cane back, feeling again.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom walked behind him. Poor young fellow! How on earth did he know that
van was there? Must have felt it. See things in their forehead perhaps: kind of
sense of volume. Weight or size of it, something blacker than the dark.
Wonder<a target="foot" id="fhh0227">&ordm;</a> if he&apos;d feel it if something
was removed. Feel a gap. Queer idea of Dublin he must have, tapping his way
round by the stones. Could he walk in a beeline if he hadn&apos;t that cane?
Bloodless pious face like a fellow going to be a priest.</p>
<p> Penrose! That was that chap&apos;s name.</p>
<p> Look at all the things they can learn to do. Read with their fingers. Tune
pianos, of course the other senses are more, embroider, plait baskets. People
ought to help them. Workbasket I could buy for Molly&apos;s birthday. Hates
sewing. Mightn&apos;t like it. Dark men they call them.</p>
<p> Sense of smell must be stronger too. Smells on all sides, bunched together.
Each street different smell.<a target="foot" id="fhh0228">&ordm;</a> Each person
too. Then the spring, the summer: smells. Tastes? They say you can&apos;t taste
wines with your eyes shut. Also smoke in the dark they say get no pleasure.</p>
<p> And with a woman for instance. Must be strange not to see her. Kind of a
picture in his mind&apos;s eye. The
voice,<a target="foot" id="fhh0229">&ordm;</a> temperatures: when he touches her
with his fingers must almost see the lines, the curves. His hands on her hair,
for instance. Say it was black, for instance. Good. We call it black. Then
passing over her white skin. Different feel perhaps. Feeling of white. </p>
<p> Postoffice. Must answer. Fag today. Send her a postal order. Accept my
little present. Stationer&apos;s just here too. Wait. Think over it.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 174}</font> </p>
<p> With a gentle finger he felt ever so slowly the hair combed back above his
ears. Again. Fibres of fine fine straw. Then gently his finger felt the skin of
his right cheek. Sprouting hair there too. Not smooth enough. The belly is the
smoothest. No-one about. There he goes into Frederick street. Might be settling my braces.</p>
<p> Walking by Doran&apos;s public house he slid his hand between his waistcoat
and trousers and, pulling aside his shirt gently, felt a slack fold of his
belly. But I know it&apos;s whitey yellow<a target="foot" id="fhh0232">&ordm;</a>. Want to try in the dark to see.</p>
<p> He withdrew his hand and pulled his dress to.</p>
<p> Poor fellow! Quite a boy. Terrible. Really terrible. Where is the justice
being born that way? All those children and women killed in New York yesterday.
That Karma book the transmigration for sins you did in a past life the
reincarnation. Dear, dear, dear. Pity, of course: but somehow you can&apos;t cotton on to them someway.</p>
<p> Sir Frederick Falkiner going into the freemasons&apos; hall. Solemn as Troy.
After a good lunch. I suppose he&apos;d turn up his nose at the wine I drank
Going down to the recorder&apos;s court to try fellows after. Justice. And may

 <i>Messiah</i> was first given for that. Yes. Handel. What about going out
there: Ballsbridge. Sure to know someone on the gate.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom came into Kildare street. First I must. Library.</p>
<p> Straw hat in the sunlight. Tan shoes. Turned up trousers. It is. It is.</p>
<p> His heart quopped softly. To the right. Museum. Goddesses. He swerved to the right.</p>
<p> Is it? Almost certain. Won&apos;t look. Yes, it is. The walk. Not see. Get on.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 175}</font> </p>
<p> Making towards the museum gate with long windy steps he lifted his eyes.
Handsome building. Sir Thomas Deane designed that. Not following me?</p>
<p> Didn&apos;t see me perhaps. Light in his eyes.</p>
<p> The flutter of his breath came forth in short sighs. Quick. Cold statues: quiet there. Safe in a minute.</p>
<p> No. Didn&apos;t see me. After two. Just at the gate.</p>
<p> My heart!</p>
<p> His eyes beating, looked steadfastly at the cream curves of stone. Sir Thomas Deane was the Greek architecture.</p>
<p> Look for something I.</p>
<p> His hasty hand went quick into a pocket, took out and read unfolded Agendath Netaim. Where did I?</p>
<p> Busy looking.</p>
<p> He thrust back quick Agendath.</p>

<p> I am looking for that. Yes. that. Try all pockets. Handker. Where did I? Ah, yes.</p>
