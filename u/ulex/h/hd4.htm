<p> As he set foot on O&apos;Connell bridge a puffball of smoke plumed up from
the parapet. Brewery barge with export stout. England. Sea air sours it, I
heard. Be interesting some day get a pass through Hancock to see the brewery.
Regular town in itself. Vats of porter, wonderful. Rats get in too. Drink
themselves bloated as big as a collie floating. Dead drunk on the porter. Drink
till they puke again like christians. Imagine drinking that! Rats: vats. Well of course if we knew all the things.</p>
<p> Looking down he saw flapping strongly, wheeling between the gaunt quaywalls,
gulls. Rough weather outside. If I threw myself down? Reuben J&apos;s son must
have swallowed a good bellyful of that sewage. One and eightpence too much.
Hhhhm. It&apos;s the droll way he comes out with the things.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 170}</font> </p>
<p> They wheeled lower. Looking for grub. Wait.</p>
<p> He threw down among them a crumpled paper ball. Elijah thirtytwo feet per
sec is com. Not a bit. The ball bobbed unheeded on the wake of swells, floated
under by the bridgepiers. Not such damn fools. They wheeled, flapping.</p>

<p> His gaze passed over the glazed apples serried on her stand. Australians
they must be this time of year. Shiny peels: polishes them up with a rag or a handkerchief.</p>
<p> Wait. Those poor birds.</p>
<p> He halted again and bought from the old applewoman two Banbury cakes for a
penny and broke the brittle paste and threw its fragments down into the Liffey.
See that? The gulls swooped silently, two, then all, from their heights, pouncing on prey. Gone. Every morsel.</p>
<p> Aware of their greed and cunning he shook the powdery crumb from his hands.
They never expected that. Manna. Live on fish, fishy flesh they have, all
seabirds, gulls, seagoose. Robinson Crusoe had to live on them.</p>
<p> They wheeled, flapping weakly. I&apos;m not going to throw any more. Penny
quite enough. Lot of thanks I get. Not even a caw. If you fatten a turkey say on
chestnut meal it tastes like that. But then why is it that saltwater fish are not salty? How is that?

<p> Mr Bloom moved forward, raising his troubled eyes. Think no more about that.
After one. Timeball on the ballast office is down. Dunsink time. Fascinating
little book that is of sir Robert Ball&apos;s. Parallax. I never exactly
understood. Par it&apos;s Greek: parallel, parallax. Met him pike hoses she
called it till I told her about the transmigration. O rocks!</p>
<p> Mr Bloom smiled O rocks at two windows of the ballast office. She&apos;s
right after all. Only big words for ordinary things on account of the sound.
She&apos;s not exactly witty. Still I don&apos;t know. She used to say Ben
Dollard had a base barreltone voice. He has legs like barrels and you&apos;d
think he was singing into a barrel. Now, isn&apos;t that wit? They used to call
him big Ben. Not half as witty as calling him base barreltone. Powerful man he
was at stowing away number one Bass. Barrel of Bass. See? It all works out.</p>

marched slowly towards him along the gutter, scarlet sashes across their boards.
Bargains. Like that priest they are this morning: we have sinned: we have
suffered. He read the scarlet letters on their five tall white hats:
H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;Y.&nbsp;S. Wisdom Hely&apos;s. Y lagging behind drew a
chunk of bread from under his foreboard, crammed it into his mouth and munched
as he walked. Three bob a day, walking along the gutters, street after street.
Just keep skin and bone together, bread and skilly. They are not Boyl: no:
M&apos;Glade&apos;s men. Doesn&apos;t bring in any business either. I suggested
to him about a transparent showcart with two smart girls sitting inside writing
letters, copybooks, envelopes, blottingpaper. I bet that would have caught on.
Smart girls writing something catch the eye at once. Everyone dying to know what
she&apos;s writing. Wouldn&apos;t have it of course because he didn&apos;t think
of it himself first. Well out of that ruck I am. Devil of a job it was
collecting accounts of those convents. Tranquilla convent. That was a nice nun
there, really sweet face. Sister? Sister? I am sure she was crossed in love by
her eyes. Very hard to bargain with that sort of woman. I disturbed her at her
devotions that morning. Our great day, she said. Feast of Our Lady of Mount
Carmel. Sweet name too: caramel. She knew I, I think she knew by the way she. If
she had married she would have changed. I suppose they really were short of
money. Fried everything in the best butter all the same. Sister? It was a nun they say invented barbed wire.</p>
<p> He crossed Westmoreland street when apostrophe S had plodded by. Rover
cycleshop. Those races are on today. How long ago is that? Year Phil Gilligan
died. We were in Lombard street west. Wait: was in Thom&apos;s. Got the job in

choir picnic at the Sugarloaf. As if that. Never put a dress on her back like
it. Fitted her like a glove, shoulders and hips. Just beginning to plump it out
well. Rabbit pie we had that day. People looking after her.</p>
<p> Happy. Happier then. Snug little room that was with the red wallpaper.
Milly&apos;s tubbing night. American soap I bought: elderflower. Cosy smell of
her bathwater. Funny she looked soaped all over. Shapely too.</p>
<p> He walked along the curbstone.</p>
<p> Stream of life. What was the name of that priestylooking chap was always
squinting in when he passed? Stopped in Citron&apos;s saint Kevin&apos;s parade.
Pen something. Pendennis? My memory is getting. Pen&nbsp;&hellip;?

<p> Bartell d&apos;Arcy was the tenor, just coming out then. Seeing her home
after practice. Conceited fellow with his waxedup moustache. Gave her that song
<i>Winds that blow from the south</i>.</p>
<p> Windy night that was I went to fetch her there was that lodge
<br><font color="green">{u21, 174}</font>
<br> meeting on about those lottery tickets after Goodwin&apos;s concert in the
supperroom of the Mansion house. He and I behind. Sheet of her music blew out of
my hand against the high school railings. Lucky it didn&apos;t. Thing like that
spoils the effect of a night for her. Professor Goodwin linking her in front.
Shaky on his pins, poor old sot. Remember her laughing at the wind, her blizzard
collar up. Corner of Harcourt road remember that gust? Brrfoo! Blew up all her
skirts and her boa nearly smothered old Goodwin. She did get flushed in the
wind. Remember when we got home raking up the fire and frying up those pieces of
lap of mutton for her with the Chutney sauce she liked. And the mulled rum.
Could see her in the bedroom from the hearth unclasping her stays. White.</p>
<p> Swish and soft flop her stays made on the bed. Always warm from her. Always
liked to let herself out. Sitting there after till near two, taking out her
hairpins. Milly tucked up in beddyhouse. Happy. Happy. That was the night&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O Mr Bloom, how do you do?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O how do you do, Mrs Breen?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; No use complaining. How is Molly those times? Haven&apos;t seen her for ages.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; In the pink, Mr Bloom said gaily. Milly&apos;s down in Mullingar, you know.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Is that so?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, in a photographer&apos;s there. Getting on like a
house on fire. How are all your charges?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; All on the baker&apos;s list, Mrs Breen said.</p>
<p> How many has she? No other in sight.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You&apos;re in black I see. You have no&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; No, Mr Bloom said. I have just come from a funeral.</p>
<p> Going to crop up all day, I foresee.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O dear me, Mrs Breen said, I hope it wasn&apos;t any near relation.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 175}</font> </p>
<p> May as well get her sympathy.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Dignam, Mr Bloom said. An old friend of mine. He died quite

<p class="di">&mdash; Sad to lose the old friends, Mrs Breen&apos;s womaneyes said melancholily.</p>
<p> Now that&apos;s quite enough about that. Just: quietly: husband.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And your lord and master?</p>
<p> Mrs Breen turned up her two large eyes. Hasn&apos;t lost them anyhow.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O, don&apos;t be talking, she said. He&apos;s a caution to
rattlesnakes. He&apos;s in there now with his lawbooks finding out the law of
libel. He has me heartscalded. Wait till I show you.</p>
<p> Hot mockturtle vapour and steam of newbaked jampuffs poured out from
Harrison&apos;s. The heavy noonreek tickled the top of Mr Bloom&apos;s gullet. A
barefoot arab stood over the grating, breathing in the fumes. Deaden the gnaw of hunger that way.</p>
<p> Opening her handbag, chipped leather. Hatpin: ought to have a guard on those
things. Stick it in a chap&apos;s eye in the tram. Rummaging. Soiled
handkerchief: medicine bottle. What is she&nbsp;&hellip;?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There must be a new moon out, she said. He&apos;s always
bad then. Do you know what he did last night?</p>
<p> Her hand ceased to rummage. Her eyes fixed themselves on him, wide in alarm, yet smiling.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 176}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What? Mr Bloom asked.</p>
<p> Let her speak. Look straight in her eyes. I believe you. Trust me.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Woke me up in the night, she said. Dream he had, a nightmare.</p>
<p> Indiges.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Said the ace of spades was walking up the stairs.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The ace of spades! Mr Bloom said.</p>
<p> She took a folded postcard from her handbag.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Read that, she said. He got it this morning.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What is it? Mr Bloom asked, taking the card. U.&nbsp;P.?
<br><font color="green">{u22, 151}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; U. P: up, she said. Someone taking a rise out of him.
It&apos;s a great shame for them whoever he is.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Indeed it is, Mr Bloom said.</p>
<p> She took back the card, sighing.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And now he&apos;s going round to Mr Menton&apos;s office.
He&apos;s going to take an action for ten thousand pounds, he says.</p>
<p> She folded the card into her untidy bag and snapped the catch.</p>
<p> Same blue serge dress she had two years ago, the nap bleaching. Seen its
best days. Wispish hair over her ears. And that dowdy toque, three old grapes to
take the harm out of it. She used to be a smart dresser. Lines round her mouth. Only a year or so older than Molly.</p>
<p> See the eye that woman gave her, passing. Cruel.</p>
<p> He looked still at her, holding back behind his look his discontent. Pungent
mockturtle oxtail mulligatawny. I&apos;m hungry too. Flakes of pastry on the
gusset of her dress: daub of sugary flour stuck to her cheek. Josie Powell that was. U.&nbsp;P: up.</p>
<p> Change the subject.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Do you ever see anything of Mrs Beaufoy, Mr Bloom asked.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Mina Purefoy? she said.</p>
<p> Philip Beaufoy I was thinking. Playgoers&apos; club. Matcham often thinks of
the masterstroke. Did I pull the chain?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 177}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I just called to ask on the way in is she over it.
She&apos;s in the lyingin hospital in Holles street. Dr Horne got her in. She&apos;s three days bad now.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O, Mr Bloom said. I&apos;m sorry to hear that.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, Mrs Breen said. And a houseful of kids at home.
It&apos;s a very stiff birth, the nurse told me.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O, Mr Bloom said.</p>
<p> His heavy pitying gaze absorbed her news. His tongue clacked in compassion. Dth! Dth!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I&apos;m sorry to hear that, he said. Poor thing! Three days! That&apos;s terrible for her.</p>
<p> Mrs Breen nodded.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; She was taken bad on the Tuesday&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> Mr Bloom touched her funnybone gently, warning her:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Mind! Let this man pass.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 152}</font> </p>
<p> A bony form strode along the curbstone from the river, staring with a rapt
gaze into the sunlight through a heavystringed glass. Tight as a skullpiece a
tiny hat gripped his head. From his arm a folded dustcoat, a stick and an umbrella dangled to his stride.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Watch him, Mr Bloom said. He always walks outside the lampposts. Watch!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who is he when he&apos;s at home? Mrs Breen asked. Is he dotty?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; His name is Cashel Boyle O&apos;Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall
Farrell, Mr Bloom said, smiling. Watch!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He has enough of them, she said. Denis will be like that one of these days.</p>
<p> She broke off suddenly.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There he is, she said. I must go after him. Goodbye. Remember me to Molly, won&apos;t you?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I will, Mr Bloom said.</p>
<p> He watched her dodge through passers towards the shopfronts. Denis Breen in
skimpy frockcoat and blue canvas shoes shuffled out of Harrison&apos;s hugging
two heavy tomes to his ribs. Like old times. He suffered her to overtake him without surprise
<br><font color="green">{u21, 178}</font>
<br> and thrust his dull grey beard towards her, his loose jaw wagging as he spoke earnestly.</p>
<p> Off his chump.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom walked on again easily, seeing ahead of him in sunlight the tight
skullpiece, the dangling stickumbrelladustcoat. Going the two days. Watch him!
Out he goes again. And that other old mosey lunatic. Hard time she must have with him.</p>
<p> U. P: up. I&apos;ll take my oath that&apos;s Alf Bergan or Richie Goulding.
Wrote it for a lark in the Scotch house I bet anything. Round to Menton&apos;s
office. His oyster eyes staring at the postcard. Be a feast for the gods.</p>
<p> He passed the <i>Irish Times.</i> There might be other answers lying there.
At their lunch now. Clerk with the glasses there doesn&apos;t know me. O, let
them stay there. Enough bother wading through fortyfour of them. Wanted smart
lady typist to aid gentleman in literary work. I called you naughty darling
because I do not like that other world. Please tell me what is the meaning.
Please tell me what perfume your wife. Tell me who made the world. The way they

efforts have had the good fortune to meet with the approval of the eminent

<br> poet A.&nbsp;E. (Mr Geo. Russell). No time to do her hair drinking sloppy tea with a book of poetry.</p>
<p> Best paper by long chalks for a small ad. James Carlisle made that. Six and
a half per cent dividend. Cunning old Scotch fox. All the toady news. Our
gracious and popular vicereine. Bought the <i>Irish Field</i> now. Lady
Mountcashel has quite recovered after her confinement and rode out with the
Meath hounds. Strong as a brood mare some of those horsey women. Toss off a
glass of brandy neat while you&apos;d say knife. That one at the Grosvenor this
morning. Up with her on the car: wishswish. Think that pugnosed driver did it out of spite.</p>
<p> Poor Mrs Purefoy!</p>
<p> He stood at Fleet street crossing. A sixpenny at Rowe&apos;s? Must look up
that ad in the national library. An eightpenny in the Burton. Better. On my way.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 154}</font> </p>
<p> He walked on past Bolton&apos;s Westmoreland house. Tea. Tea. Tea. I forgot to tap Tom Kernan.</p>
<p> Sss. Dth, dth, dth! Three days imagine groaning on a bed with a vinegared
handkerchief round her forehead, her belly swollen out. Phew! Dreadful simply!
Child&apos;s head too big: forceps. Doubled up inside her trying to butt its way out blindly, groping for the way out.

<br> Kill me that would. Lucky Molly got over hers lightly. They ought to invent
something to stop that. Twilight sleep idea: queen Victoria was given that. Time
someone thought about it instead of gassing about the what was it the pensive
bosom of the silver effulgence. They could easily have big establishments whole
thing quite painless out of all the taxes give every child born five quid at
compound interest up to twentyone five per cent is a hundred shillings and five
tiresome pounds multiply by twenty decimal system encourage people to put by
money save hundred and ten and a bit twentyone years want to work it out on
paper come to a tidy sum more than you think.</p>
<p> Not stillborn of course. They are not even registered. Trouble for nothing.</p>
<p> How flat they look after all of a sudden! Peaceful eyes. Weight off their
minds. Old Mrs Thornton was a jolly old soul. Snuffy Dr Brady. People knocking
them up at all hours. For God&apos; sake, doctor. Wife in her throes. Then keep
them waiting months for their fee. No gratitude in people.</p>
<p> A squad of constables debouched from College street, marching in Indian
file. Foodheated faces, sweating helmets, patting their truncheons. After their feed with a good load of fat soup under
<br><font color="green">{u21, 181}</font>
<br> their belts. They split up into groups and scattered, saluting, towards
<br><font color="green">{u22, 155}</font>
<br> their beats. Let out to graze. A squad of others, marching irregularly,
rounded Trinity railings, making for the station. Bound for their troughs.
Prepare to receive cavalry. Prepare to receive soup.</p>

him up over a urinal: meeting of the waters.

Chamberlain was given his degree in Trinity he got a run for his money. My word
he did! His horse&apos;s hoofs clattering after us down Abbey street. Lucky I

George. Must have cracked his skull on the cobblestones. I oughtn&apos;t to have

on the invincibles. Member of the corporation too. Egging raw youths on to get
in the know all the time drawing secret service pay from the castle. Why those
plainclothes men are always courting slaveys. Squarepushing up against a
backdoor. Maul her a bit. And who is the gentleman

Trinity&apos;s surly front. Trams passed one another, ingoing, outgoing,
clanging. Useless words. Things go on: same: day after day: squads of police
marching out, back: trams in, out. Those two loonies mooching about. Dignam
carted off. Mina Purefoy swollen belly on a bed groaning to have a child tugged

<p> There he is: the brother. Image of him. Haunting face. Now that&apos;s a
coincidence. Course hundreds of times you think of a person and don&apos;t meet
him. Like a man walking in his sleep. No-one knows him. Must be a corporation

<p> He faced about and, standing between the awnings, held out his right hand at
arm&apos;s length towards the sun. Wanted to try that often. Yes: completely.
The tip of his little finger blotted out the sun&apos;s disk. Must be the focus
where the rays cross. If I had black glasses. Interesting. There was a lot of
talk about those sunspots when we were in Lombard street west. Terrific

<p> Yes. Thought so. Sloping into the Empire. Gone. Where Pat Kinsella had his
Harp theatre. Broth of a boy Dion Boucicault business with his harvestmoon face
in a poky bonnet. Three Purty Maids from School. How time flies, eh? Showing

<p> Grafton street gay with housed awnings lured his senses. Muslin prints,

<p> Perched on high stools by the bar, hats shoved back, at the tables calling
for more bread no charge, swilling, wolfing gobfuls of sloppy food, their eyes
bulging, wiping wetted moustaches. A man with an infant&apos;s napkin tucked

Second nature to him. Born with a silver knife in his mouth. That&apos;s witty,

<p> An illgirt server gathered sticky clattering plates. Rock, the bailiff,
standing at the bar blew the foamy crown from his tankard. Well up: it splashed yellow near his boot.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom raised two fingers doubtfully to his lips. His eyes said:</p>

<p> What will I take now? He drew his watch. Let me see now.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 191}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Hello, Bloom, Nosey Flynn said from his nook.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Hello, Flynn.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; How&apos;s things?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Tiptop&nbsp;&hellip; Let me see. I&apos;ll take a glass of
burgundy and&nbsp;&hellip; let me see.</p>
<p> Sardines on the shelves. Potted meats. What is home without Plumtree&apos;s
potted meat? Incomplete. What a stupid ad! Under the obituary notices they stuck
it. Dignam&apos;s potted meat. Cannibals would with lemon and rice. White men
too salty. Like pickled pork. With it an abode of bliss. Lord knows what
concoction. Cauls mouldy tripes windpipes faked up. Kosher. Hygiene that was what they call now.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Have you a cheese sandwich?
<br><font color="green">{u22, 164}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, sir.</p>
<p> Like a few olives too if they had them. Good glass of burgundy take away
that. A cool salad. Tom Kernan can dress &nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Wife well?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Quite well, thanks&nbsp;&hellip; A cheese sandwich, then. Gorgonzola, have you?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, sir.</p>
<p> Nosey Flynn sipped his grog.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Doing any singing those times?
<br><font color="green">{u21, 192}</font> </p>
<p> Look at his mouth. Could whistle in his own ear. Flap ears to match. Music.
Knows as much about it as my coachman. Still better tell him. Does no harm.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; She&apos;s engaged for a big tour end of this month. You may have heard perhaps.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; No. O, that&apos;s the style. Who&apos;s getting it up?</p>
<p> The curate served.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; How much is that?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Seven d., sir&nbsp;&hellip; Thank you, sir.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom cut his sandwich into slender strips.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Mustard, sir?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Thank you.</p>
<p> He studded under each lifted strip yellow blobs.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Getting it up? he said. Well, it&apos;s like a company
idea, you see. Part shares and part profits.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ay, now I remember, Nosey Flynn said, putting his hand in
his pocket to scratch his groin. Who is this was telling me? Isn&apos;t Blazes Boylan mixed up in it?</p>
<p> A warm shock of air heat of mustard hanched on Mr Bloom&apos;s heart. He
raised his eyes and met the stare of a bilious clock. Two. Pub clock five
minutes fast. Time going on. Hands moving. Two. Not yet.</p>
<p> His midriff yearned then upward, sank within him, yearned more longly, longingly.</p>
<p> Wine.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 165}</font> </p>
<p> He smellsipped the cordial juice and, bidding his throat strongly to speed
it, set his wineglass delicately down.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, he said. He&apos;s the organiser in point of fact.</p>
<p> No fear. No brains.</p>
<p> Nosey Flynn snuffled and scratched. Flea having a good square meal.</p>

<p> Hope that dewdrop doesn&apos;t come down into his glass. No, snuffled it up.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; For near a month, man, before it came off. Sucking duck
eggs by God till further orders. Keep him off the booze, see? O, by God, Blazes is a hairy chap.</p>
<p> Davy Byrne came forward from the hindbar in shirtsleeves, cleaning his lips
with two wipes of his napkin. Herring&apos;s blush.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And here&apos;s himself and pepper on him, Nosey Flynn
said. Can you give us a good one for the Gold cup?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I&apos;m off that, Mr Flynn, Davy Byrne answered. I never put anything on a horse.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You&apos;re right there, Nosey Flynn said.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom ate his strips of sandwich, fresh clean bread, with relish of
disgust<font color="red"><sup><small>(4</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>4)</small></sup></font>
pungent mustard, the feety savour of green cheese. Sips of his wine soothed his palate.</p>
<p> Nice quiet bar. Nice piece of wood in that counter. Nicely planed. Like the way it curves there.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I wouldn&apos;t do anything at all in that line, Davy
Byrne said. It ruined many a man the same horses.</p>

for consumption on the premises. Heads I win tails you lose.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; True for you, Nosey Flynn said. Unless you&apos;re in the
know. There&apos;s no straight sport going now. Lenehan gets some good ones.
He&apos;s giving Sceptre today. Zinfandel&apos;s the favourite, lord Howard de
Walden&apos;s, won at Epsom. Morny Cannon is riding him. I could have got seven
to one against Saint Amant a fortnight before.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That so? Davy Byrne said&nbsp;&hellip;
<br><font color="green">{u22, 166}</font> </p>
<p> He went towards the window and, taking up the pettycash book, scanned its pages.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 194}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I could, faith, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling. That was a
rare bit of horseflesh. She won in a thunderstorm, Rothschild&apos;s filly, with
wadding in her ears. Bad luck to big Ben Dollard and his John O&apos;Gaunt. He put me off it. Ay.</p>
<p> He drank resignedly from his tumbler, running his fingers down the flutes.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ay, he said, sighing.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom, champing, standing, looked upon his sigh. Nosey numbskull. Will I
tell him that horse Lenehan? He knows already. Better let him forget. Go and
lose more. Fool and his money. Dewdrop coming down again. Cold nose he&apos;d
have kissing a woman. Still they might like. Prickly beards they like.
Dogs&apos; cold noses. Old Mrs Riordan with the rumbling stomach&apos;s Skye
terrier in the City Arms hotel. Molly fondling him in her lap. O the big doggybowwowsywowsy!</p>
<p> Wine soaked and softened rolled pith of bread mustard a moment mawkish
cheese. Nice wine it is. Taste it better because I&apos;m not thirsty. Bath of
course does that. Just a light snack. Then about six o&apos;clock I can. Six,
six. Time will be gone then. She&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> Mild fire of wine kindled his veins. I wanted that badly. Felt so off
colour. His eyes unhungrily saw shelves of

sardines, gaudy lobsters&apos; claws. All the odd things people pick up for
food. Out of shells, periwinkles with a pin, off trees, snails out of the ground
the French eat, out of the sea with bait on a hook. Silly fish learn nothing in
a thousand years. If you didn&apos;t know risky thing putting anything into your
mouth. Poisonous berries. One fellow told another and so on. Try it on the dog
first. Led on by the smell or the look. Instinct. Orangegroves for instance.
Need artificial irrigation. Bleibtreustrasse. Yes but what about oysters.
Unsightly like a clot of phlegm. Filthy shells. Devil to open them too. Who
found them out? Garbage, sewage they feed on. Fizz and Red bank oysters. Effect

back in the sea to keep up the price. Cheap no-one would buy. Caviare. Do the
grand. Hock in green glasses. Swell blow out. Lady this. Powdered bosom pearls.
May I tempt you to a little more filleted sole, miss Dubedat? Yes, do bedad. And
she did bedad. Huguenot name I expect that. A miss Dubedat lived in Killiney I

grapes of Burgundy. Sun&apos;s heat it is. Seems to a secret touch telling me

her eyes upon me did not turn away. Ravished over her I lay full lips full open
kissed her mouth. Yum. Softly she gave me in my mouth the seedcake warm and
chewed. Mawkish pulp her mouth had mumbled sweet and sour with spittle. Joy: I
ate it: joy. Young life, her lips that gave me pouting. Soft warm sticky
gumjelly lips. Flowers her eyes were take me willing eyes.

<br> Pebbles fell. She lay still. A goat. No-one. High on Ben Howth

ferns she laughed warmfolded. Wildly I lay on her, kissed her: eyes, her lips,
her stretched neck beating, woman&apos;s breasts full in her blouse of
nun&apos;s veiling, fat nipples upright. Hot I tongued her. She kissed me. I was
kissed. All yielding she tossed my hair. Kissed, she kissed me.</p>
<p> Me. And me now.</p>

mean to say to fellows like Flynn. Quaffing nectar at mess with gods golden
dishes all ambrosial. Not like a tanner lunch we have, boiled mutton, carrots
and turnips, bottle of Allsopp. Nectar imagine it drinking electricity:

his glass to the lees and walked to men too they gave themselves manly conscious
lay with men lovers a youth enjoyed her to the yard.</p>
<p> When the sound of his boots had ceased Davy Byrne said from his book:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What is this he is? Isn&apos;t he in the insurance line?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He&apos;s out of that long ago, Nosey Flynn said. He does canvassing for the <i>Freeman</i>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I know him well to see, Davy Byrne said. Is he in trouble?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Trouble? Nosey Flynn said. Not that I heard of. Why?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I noticed he was in
mourning<font color="red"><sup><small>(4</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,
Davy Byrne said</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>4)</small></sup></font>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Was he? Nosey Flynn said. So he was, faith. I asked him
how was all at home. You&apos;re right, by God. So he was.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I never broach the subject, Davy Byrne said humanely, if I
see a gentleman is in trouble that way. It only brings it up fresh in their minds.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It&apos;s not the wife anyhow, Nosey Flynn said. I met him the day before
<br><font color="green">{u22, 169}</font>
<br> yesterday and he coming out of that Irish farm dairy John Wyse Nolan&apos;s
wife has in Henry street with a jar of cream in his hand taking it home to his
better half. She&apos;s well nourished, I tell you. Plovers on toast.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And is he doing for the <i>Freeman</i>? Davy Byrne said.</p>
<p> Nosey Flynn pursed his lips.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He doesn&apos;t buy cream on the ads he picks up. You may take that from me.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; How so? Davy Byrne asked, coming from his book.</p>
<p> Nosey Flynn made swift passes in the air with juggling fingers. He winked.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He&apos;s in the craft, he said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Do you tell me so? Davy Byrne said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Very much so, Nosey Flynn said. Ancient free and accepted
order. Light, life and love, by God. They give him a leg up. I was told that by
a &mdash; well, I won&apos;t say who.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Is that a fact?
<br><font color="green">{u21, 198}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O, it&apos;s a fine order, Nosey Flynn said. They stick to
you when you&apos;re down. I know a fellow was trying to get into it but
they&apos;re as close as damn it. By God they did right to keep the women out of it.</p>
<p> Davy Byrne
<font color="red"><sup><small>(4</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">smiled
yawned nodded</span></span>
<font color="black">smiledyawnednodded</font><font color="red"><sup><small>4)</small></sup></font> all in one:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Iiiiiichaaaaaaach!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There was one woman, Nosey Flynn said, hid herself in a
clock to find out what they do be doing. But be damned but they smelt her out
and swore her in on the spot a master mason. That was one of the Saint Legers of Doneraile.</p>
<p> Davy Byrne, sated after his yawn, said with tearwashed eyes:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And is that a fact? Decent quiet man he is. I often saw
him in here and I never once saw him &mdash; you know, over the line.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; God Almighty couldn&apos;t make him drunk, Nosey Flynn
said firmly. Slips off when the fun gets too hot. Didn&apos;t you see him look
at his watch? Ah, you weren&apos;t there. If you ask him to have a drink first
thing he does he outs with the watch to see what he ought to imbibe. Declare to God he does.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There are some like that, Davy Byrne said. He&apos;s a safe man, I&apos;d say.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He&apos;s not too bad, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling it up.
He has been known to put his hand down too to help a fellow. Give the devil his
due. O, Bloom has his good points. But there&apos;s one thing he&apos;ll never do.</p>
<p> His hand scrawled a dry pen signature beside his grog.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I know, Davy Byrne said.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 170}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Nothing in black and white, Nosey Flynn said.</p>
<p> Paddy Leonard and Bantam Lyons came in. Tom Rochford followed, a plaining hand on his claret waistcoat.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Day, Mr Byrne.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Day, gentlemen.</p>
<p> They paused at the counter.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who&apos;s standing? Paddy Leonard asked.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I&apos;m sitting anyhow, Nosey Flynn answered.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Well, what&apos;ll it be? Paddy Leonard asked.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I&apos;ll take a stone ginger, Bantam Lyons said.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 199}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; How much? Paddy Leonard cried. Since when, for God&apos; sake? What&apos;s yours, Tom?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; How is the main drainage? Nosey Flynn asked, sipping.</p>
<p> For answer Tom Rochford pressed his hand to his breastbone and hiccoughed.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Would I trouble you for a glass of fresh water, Mr Byrne? he said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Certainly, sir.</p>
<p> Paddy Leonard eyed his alemates.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Lord love a duck, he said, look at what I&apos;m standing
drinks to! Cold water and gingerpop! Two fellows that would suck whisky off a
sore leg. He has some bloody horse up his sleeve for the Gold cup. A dead snip.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Zinfandel is it? Nosey Flynn asked.</p>
<p> Tom Rochford spilt powder from a twisted paper into the water set before him.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That cursed dyspepsia, he said before drinking.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Breadsoda is very good, Davy Byrne said.</p>
<p> Tom Rochford nodded and drank.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Is it Zinfandel?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Say nothing, Bantam Lyons winked. I&apos;m going to plunge five bob on my own.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Tell us and be damned to you, Paddy Leonard said. Who gave it to you?</p>
<p> Mr Bloom on his way out raised three fingers in greeting.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; So long, Nosey Flynn said.</p>
<p> The others turned.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That&apos;s the man now that gave it to me, Bantam Lyons whispered.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 171}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Prrwht! Paddy Leonard said with scorn. Mr Byrne, sir,
we&apos;ll take two of your small Jamesons after that and a&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Stone ginger, Davy Byrne added civilly.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ay, Paddy Leonard said. A suckingbottle for the baby.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom walked towards Dawson street, his tongue brushing his teeth smooth.
Something green it would have to be: spinach say. Then with those R&ouml;ntgen rays searchlight you could.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 200}</font> </p>
<p> At Duke lane a terrier choked up a sick knuckly cud on the cobblestones and
lapped it with new zest. Mr Bloom coasted warily. Ruminants. Wonder if Tom
Rochford will do anything with that invention of his. Wasting time explaining it
to Flynn&apos;s mouth. Lean people long mouths. Ought to be a hall or a place
where inventors could go in and invent free. Course then you&apos;d have all the cranks pestering.</p>
<p> He hummed, prolonging in solemn echo, the closes of the bars:</p>
<p class="diset">&mdash; <i>Don Giovanni, a cenar teco
<br> M&apos;invitasti.</i></p>
<p> Feel better. Burgundy. Good pick me up. Who distilled first? Some chap in
the blues. Dutch courage. That <i>Kilkenny People</i> in the national library now I must.</p>
<p> Bare clean closestools, waiting, in the window of William Miller, plumber,
turned back his thoughts. They could: and watch it all the way down changing
biliary duct spleen squirting liver gastric juice coils of intestines like
pipes. But the poor buffer would have to stand all the time with his insides entrails on show. Science.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>A cenar teco.</i></p>
<p> What does that <i>teco</i> mean? Tonight perhaps.</p>
<p class="diset">&mdash; <i>Don Giovanni, thou hast me invited</i>
<br> <i>To come to supper tonight</i>
<br> <i>The rum the rumdum</i>.</p>
<p> Doesn&apos;t go properly.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 172}</font> </p>
<p> Keyes: two months if I get Nannetti to. That&apos;ll be two pounds ten about
two pounds eight. Three Hynes owes me. Two eleven. Prescott&apos;s dyeworks van
over there. If I get Billy Prescott&apos;s ad. Two fifteen. Five guineas about. On the pig&apos;s back.</p>
<p> Could buy one of those silk petticoats for Molly, colour of her new garters.</p>
<p> Today. Today. Not think.</p>
<p> Tour the south then. What about English wateringplaces? Brighton,
<br><font color="green">{u21, 201}</font>
<br> Margate. Piers by moonlight. Her voice floating out. Those lovely seaside girls.</p>
<p> He turned at Gray&apos;s confectioner&apos;s window of unbought tarts and
passed the reverend Thomas Connellan&apos;s bookstore. <i>Why I left the church
of Rome</i>. Bird&apos;s nest women run him. They say they used to give pauper
children soup to change to protestants. Why we left the church of Rome.</p>
<p> A blind stripling stood tapping the curbstone with his slender cane. No tram in sight. Wants to cross.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Do you want to cross? Mr Bloom asked.</p>
<p> The blind stripling did not answer. His wallface frowned weakly. He moved his head uncertainly.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You&apos;re in Dawson street, Mr Bloom said. Molesworth
street is opposite. Do you want to cross? There&apos;s nothing in the way.</p>
<p> The cane moved out trembling to the left. Mr Bloom&apos;s eye followed its
line and saw again the dyeworks&apos; van drawn up before Drago&apos;s. Where I
saw his brillantined hair just when I was. Horse drooping. Driver in John Long&apos;s. Slaking his drought.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There&apos;s a van there, Mr Bloom said, but it&apos;s not
moving. I&apos;ll see you across. Do you want to go to Molesworth street?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, the stripling answered. South Frederick street.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Come, Mr Bloom said.</p>
<p> He touched the thin elbow gently: then took the limp seeing hand to guide it forward.</p>
<p> Say something to him. Better not do the condescending. Pass a remark.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The rain kept off.</p>
<p> No answer.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 173}</font> </p>
<p> Stains on his coat. Slobbers his food, I suppose. Like a child&apos;s hand
his hand. Like Milly&apos;s was. Sensitive. Sizing me up I daresay from my hand.
Van. Keep his cane clear of the horse&apos;s legs: tired drudge get his doze.
That&apos;s right. Clear. Behind a bull: in front of a horse.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Thanks, sir.</p>
<p> Knows I&apos;m a man. Voice.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Right now? First turn to the left.</p>
<p> The blind stripling tapped the curbstone and went on his way, drawing his cane back, feeling again.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom walked behind him. Poor young fellow! How on earth did he know that
van was there? Must have felt it. See things in their foreheads perhaps. Kind of
sense of volume. Weight or size of it, something blacker than the dark. Wonder
would he feel it if something was removed. Feel a gap. Queer idea of Dublin he
must have, tapping his way round by the stones. Could he walk in a beeline if he
hadn&apos;t that cane? Bloodless pious face like a fellow going in to be a priest.</p>
<p> Penrose! That was that chap&apos;s name.</p>
<p> Look at all the things they can learn to do. Read with their fingers. Tune
pianos. Of course the other senses are more. Embroider. Plait baskets. People
ought to help. Work basket I could buy Molly&apos;s birthday. Hates sewing.
Might take an objection. Dark men they call them.</p>
<p> Sense of smell must be stronger too. Smells on all sides bunched together.
Each street different smell. Each person too. Then the spring, the summer:
smells. Tastes. They say you can&apos;t taste wines with your eyes shut. Also
smoke in the dark they say get no pleasure.</p>
<p> And with a woman, for instance. Must be strange not to see her. Kind of a
form in his mind&apos;s eye. The voice, temperature when he touches her with
fingers must almost see the lines, the curves. His hands on her hair, for
instance. Say it was black for instance. Good. We call it black. Then passing
over her white skin. Different feel perhaps. Feeling of white.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 203}</font> </p>
<p> Postoffice. Must answer. Fag today. Send her a postal order two shillings
half a crown. Accept my little present. Stationer&apos;s just here too. Wait. Think over it.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 174}</font> </p>
<p> With a gentle finger he felt ever so slowly the hair combed back above his
ears. Again. Fibres of fine fine straw. Then gently his finger felt the skin of
his right cheek. Downy hair there too. Not smooth enough. The belly is the
smoothest. No-one about. There he goes into Frederick street. Perhaps to
Levenston&apos;s dancing academy piano. Might be settling my braces.</p>
<p> Walking by Doran&apos;s publichouse he slid his hand between waistcoat and
trousers and, pulling aside his shirt gently, felt a slack fold of his belly.
But I know it&apos;s whitey yellow. Want to try in the dark to see.</p>
<p> He withdrew his hand and pulled his dress to.</p>
<p> Poor fellow! Quite a boy. Terrible. Really terrible. Where is the justice
being born that way. All those women and children excursion beanfeast

Karma they call that transmigration for sins you did in a past life the
reincarnation met him pikehoses. Dear, dear, dear. Pity of course: but somehow
you can&apos;t cotton on to them someway.</p>
<p> Sir Frederick Falkiner going into the freemason&apos;s hall. Solemn as Troy.
After his good lunch in Earlsfort terrace. I suppose he&apos;d turn up his nose
at that wine I drank. Has his own ideas of justice in the recorder&apos;s court.
Wellmeaning old man. Police chargesheets crammed with cases get their percentage
manufacturing crime. Sends them to the rightabout. The devil on moneylenders.
Gave Reuben J a great strawcalling. Now he&apos;s really what they call a dirty
jew. Power those judges have. Grumpy old topers in wigs. And may the Lord have mercy on your soul.</p>
<p> Hello placard. Mirus bazaar. His Excellency the lord lieutenant. Sixteenth.
Today it is. In aid of funds for Mercer&apos;s hospital. The
<br><font color="green">{u21, 204}</font>
<br> <i>Messiah</i> was first given for that. Yes. Handel. What about going out
there. Ballsbridge. Drop in on Keyes. No use sticking to him like a leech. Sure to know someone on the gate.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom came to Kildare street. First I must. Library.</p>
<p> Straw hat in sunlight. Tan shoes. Turnedup trousers. It is. It is.</p>
<p> His heart quopped softly. To the right. Museum. Goddesses. He swerved to the right.</p>
<p> Is it? Almost certain. Won&apos;t look. Wine in my face. Why did I? Yes, it is. The walk. Not see. Not see. Get on.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 175}</font> </p>
<p> Making for the museum gate with long windy strides he lifted his eyes.
Handsome building. Sir Thomas Deane designed. Not following me?</p>
<p> Didn&apos;t see me perhaps. Light in his eyes.</p>
<p> The flutter of his breath came forth in short sighs. Quick. Cold statues: quiet there. Safe in a minute.</p>
<p> No didn&apos;t see me. After two. Just at the gate.</p>
<p> My heart!</p>
<p> His eyes beating looked steadfastly at cream curves of stone. Sir Thomas Deane was the Greek architecture.</p>
<p> Look for something I.</p>
<p> His hasty hand went quick into a pocket, took out, read unfolded Agendath Netaim. Where did I?</p>
<p> Busy looking for.</p>
<p> He thrust back quickly Agendath.</p>
<p> Afternoon she said.</p>
<p> I am looking for that. Yes, that. Try all pockets. Handker. <i>Freeman</i>.
Where did I? Ah, yes. Trousers. Purse. Potato. Where did I?</p>
<p> Hurry. Walk quietly. Moment more. My heart.</p>
<p> His hand looking for the where did I put found in his hip pocket soap lotion
have to call tepid paper stuck. Ah soap there I yes. Gate.</p>
<p> Safe!</p>  </main>
