<p> Mr Bloom smiled O rocks at two windows of the ballast office. She&apos;s
right after all. They&apos;re only big words for ordinary things on account of
the sound. She&apos;s not exactly witty. Still, I don&apos;t know. She used to
say Ben Dollard had a base barreltone voice. He has legs like barrels and
you&apos;d think he was singing into a barrel. Now, isn&apos;t that wit. They
used to call him big Ben. That&apos;s not half as witty as calling him base
barreltone.

<p> A procession of whitesmocked men marched slowly towards him along the

would have caught on. Two smart young girls. Always catch the eye. Wouldn&apos;t
have it of course because he didn&apos;t think of it himself first. Well out of
that ruck I am. Devil of a job it was collecting accounts of those convents.
Tranquilla convent. That was a nice nun there, really sweet face. Sister?
Sister? I am sure she was crossed in love by her eyes. Very hard to bargain with
that sort of a woman. I disturbed her at her devotions that morning. Our great
day, she said. Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel. Sweet name too: caramel. She
knew I, I think she knew by the way she. If she had married she would have
changed. I suppose they really were short of money. Sister?

Fitted her like a glove, shoulders and hips. Just beginning to plump it out
well. Rabbit pie we had that day. People looking after her.</p>
<p> Happy. Happier then. Snug little room that was with the red wallpaper.

<p> Bartell d&apos;Arcy was the tenor, just coming out then. Seeing her home

<p> Windy night that was I went to fetch her after Goodwin&apos;s concert in the

<p> Swish and soft flop her stays made on the bed. Always warm from her. Always

<p class="pdi">&mdash; No use complaining. How is Molly those times? Haven&apos;t seen her for ages.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; In the pink, Mr Bloom said gaily. Milly&apos;s down in Mullingar, you know.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is that so?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes. In a photographer&apos;s there. Getting on like a

<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, dear me, Mrs Breen said. I hope it wasn&apos;t any near relative.</p>
<p> May as well get her sympathy.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Dignam, Mr Bloom said. An old friend of mine. He died
quite suddenly, poor fellow. Heart trouble, I believe. Funeral was this morning.</p>

He&apos;s in there now with his lawbooks finding out the law of libel. He has me heartscalded. Wait till I show you.</p>
<p> Hot mockturtle vapour and steam of newbaked jampuffs poured out from
Harrison&apos;s. The heavy
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">re</span></span> noonreek tickled
the top of Mr Bloom&apos;s gullet. A barefoot arab stood over the grating,
breathing in the fumes. Deaden the gnaw of hunger that way.</p>

<p> Her hand ceased to rummage. Her eyes fixed themselves on him, wide in alarm, yet smiling.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What? Mr Bloom asked.</p>
<p> Let her speak. Look straight in her eyes. I believe you. Trust me.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Woke me up in the night, she said. Dream he had a nightmare.</p>
<p> Indiges.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Said the ace of spades was walking up the stairs.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The ace of spades! Mr Bloom said.</p>
<p> She took a folded postcard from her handbag.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Read that, she said. He got it this morning.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What is it? Mr Bloom asked, taking the card. U.P.?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; U.P: up, she said. Someone taking a rise out of him.
It&apos;s a great shame for them whoever he is.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Indeed it is, Mr Bloom said.</p>
<p> She took back the card, sighing.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 007}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And now he&apos;s going round to Mr Menton&apos;s office.
He&apos;s going to take an action for ten thousand pounds, he says.</p>
<p> She folded the card back into her untidy bag and snapped the catch.</p>
<p> Same blue serge dress she had two years ago, the nap bleaching.
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><font color="black">Seen

Wispish hair over her ears. And that dusty looking toque: three old cherries to
take the harm out of it. She used to be a smart dresser. Lines round her mouth. Only a year or two older than Molly.</p>
<p> See the eye that woman gave her, passing. Cruel.</p>
<p> He looked still at her, holding back behind his look his discontent. Pungent
mockturtle, oxtail, mulligatawny. I&apos;m hungry too. A few flakes of

<p> Change the subject.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do you ever see anything of Mrs Beaufoy? Mr Bloom asked.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Mina Purefoy? she said.</p>
<p> Philip Beaufoy I was thinking. Playgoers&apos; Club. Matcham often thinks of the masterstroke.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I just called over to ask is she over it. She&apos;s in
the maternity hospital in Holles street. Dr Horne got her in. She&apos;s three days bad now.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, Mr Bloom said. I&apos;m sorry to hear that.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, Mrs Breen said. And a houseful of kids at home.
It&apos;s a very stiff birth, the nurse told me.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, Mr Bloom said.</p>
<p> His heavy pitying gaze absorbed her
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">t</span></span> news. His tongue clacked in compassion. Dth! Dth!</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I&apos;m sorry to hear that, he said. Poor thing! Three days. That&apos;s terrible for her.</p>
<p> Mrs Breen nodded.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; She was taken bad on the
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Mon</span></span> Tuesday&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> Mr Bloom touched her funnybone gently, warning her:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Mind! Let this man pass.</p>
<p> A bony form strode along the curbstone from the river staring with a rapt
gaze into the sunlight through a heavystringed glass. Tight as a skullpiece a tiny hat gripped his head. From his
<br><font color="green">{ms, 008}</font>
<br> arm a folded dustcoat, a stick and an umbrella dangled to his stride.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Watch him, Mr Bloom said. He always walks outside the lampposts. Watch.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Who is he when he&apos;s at home? Mrs Breen asked. Is he dotty?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; His name is Cashel Boyle O&apos;Connor Fitzmaurice
Tisdall Farrell, Mr Bloom said smiling. Watch.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He has enough of them, she said. Denis will be like that one of these days.</p>
<p> She broke off suddenly.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; There he is, she said. I must go after him. Goodbye. Remember me to Molly, won&apos;t you?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I will, Mr Bloom said.</p>
<p> He watched her dodge through passers towards the shopfronts. Denis Breen in
skimpy frockcoat and blue canvas shoes shuffled out of Harrison&apos;s hugging
two heavy tomes to his ribs. Like old times. He suffered her to overtake him
without surprise and thrust his dull grey beard towards her, his loose jaw wagging as he spoke earnestly.</p>
<p> Off his chump.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom walked on again easily, seeing ahead of him in sunlight the tight
skullpiece, the dangling stickumbrelladustcoat.

brought that here. Must be washed in rainwater.</p>
<p> Pincushions. I&apos;m a long time threatening to buy one. Sticking them all over the place.</p>

<p> High voices. Sunwarmth. Silk. Jingling harnesses. Women, women.</p>
<p> A warm human plumpness settled down on his brain. His brain yielded.
Perfumes of embraces assailed him. His hungered flesh obscurely, mutely craved to adore.</p>
<p> Duke street. Here we are. Must eat. The Burton. Feel better then.</p>
<p> He turned Combridge&apos;s corner, still pursued. Jingling, hoofthuds.
Perfumed bodies, warm, full. All kissed, yielded: in deep summer fields, tangled

<p> A warm shock of air, heat of mustard, hanched on Mr Bloom&apos;s heart. He
raised his eyes and met the stare of a bilious clock. Two. Time going on. Hands moving. Two. Not yet.</p>

<p> When the sound of his boots had ceased Davy Byrne said from his book.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What is this he is? Isn&apos;t he in the insurance line?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He&apos;s out of that long ago, Nosey Flynn said. He does canvassing for the <u>Freeman</u>.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I know him well to see, Davy Byrne said. Is he in trouble?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Trouble? Nosey Flynn said. Not that I heard of. Why?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I noticed he was in mourning, Davy Byrne said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Was he? Nosey Flynn said. So he was, faith. I asked him
how was all at home. You&apos;re right, by God. So he was.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I never touch on the subject, Davy Byrne said
respectfully, if I see a person is in trouble that way. It only brings it up fresh in their minds.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It&apos;s not the wife anyhow, Nosey Flynn said. I met
him the day before yesterday and he coming out of that Irish farm dairy John
Wyse Nolan&apos;s wife has in Henry street with a jar of cream in his hand
taking it home to his better half. She&apos;s
<a name="un1032ej" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1032ej">well nourished</a>, I tell you. Plovers on toast.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And is he doing for the Freeman? Davy Byrne said.</p>
<p> Nosey Flynn pursed his lips.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He doesn&apos;t buy cream on the ads he picks up. You may take that from me?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; How so? Davy Byrne asked.</p>
<p> Nosey Flynn made swift passes in the air with juggling fingers and winked.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 023}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He&apos;s in the craft, he said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do you tell me so? Davy Byrne said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Very much so, Nosey Flynn said. Ancient, free and
accepted order. He&apos;s an excellent brother. Light, life and love, by God.
They give him a leg up. I was told that by a &mdash; well, I won&apos;t say who.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is that a fact? Davy Byrne said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, it&apos;s a fine order, Nosey Flynn said. They stick
to you when you&apos;re down. I know a fellow was trying to get into it. But
they&apos;re as close as damn it. By God they did right to keep the women out of it.</p>
<p> Davy Byrne smiled, yawned,
nodded<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span>
<font color="black">all in one.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Iiiiiichaaach!</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; There was one woman, Nosey Flynn
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><font color="black">said</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>,
hid herself in a clock to find out what they do be doing. But be damned but they
smelt her too and swore her in

That was one of the saint Legers of Doneraile.</p>
<p> Davy Byrne sated after his yawn, said
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><font color="black">with
tearwet eyes</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And is that a fact? Decent quiet man he is. I often saw
him in here and I never once saw him &mdash; you know, over the line.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Couldn&apos;t make him drunk, Nosey Flynn said firmly.
Slips off when it gets too hot. Didn&apos;t you see him look at his watch? Ah,
you weren&apos;t there. If you ask him to have a drink first thing he does he
outs with the watch to see what it ought to be. Declare to God he does.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; There are some like that, Davy Byrne
said<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span>. He&apos;s a safe man, I&apos;d say.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He&apos;s not too bad, Nosey Flynn said. He&apos;s been
known to put his hand down too to help a fellow.
<a name="un3021t" href="../../ff/unbs/un3all.htm#un3021t">Give the devil his

<p> His hand scrawled a dry pen signature beside his grog.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I know, Davy Byrne said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Nothing in black and white, Nosey Flynn said.</p>
<p> Paddy Leonard and Bantam Lyons came in. Tom Rochford followed frowning, a plaining
<br><font color="green">{ms, 024}</font>
<br> hand on his claret waistcoat.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Day, Mr Byrne</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Day, gentlemen</p>
<p> They paused at the counter.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Who&apos;s standing? Paddy Leonard asked.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I&apos;m sitting anyhow, Nosey Flynn said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, what&apos;ll it be? Paddy Leonard asked.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I&apos;ll take a stone ginger, Bantam Lyons said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; How much? Paddy Leonard cried. Since when, for God&apos; sake? What&apos;s yours, Tom?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; How is the main drainage? Nosey Flynn asked.</p>
<p> For answer Tom Rochford pressed his hand to his breastbone and retched dumbly in his throat.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Would I trouble you for a glass of fresh water, Mr Byrne? he said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Certainly, sir.</p>
<p> Paddy Leonard eyed his alemates.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Lord love a duck, he said. Look at what I&apos;m standing drinks to. Water and gingerbeer.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He has some bloody horse up his sleeve, Paddy Leonard said of Lyons. For the Gold cup.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Zinfandel is it? Nosey Flynn asked.</p>
<p> Tom Rochford
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">split</span></span> spilt powder
from a folded paper into the water set before him.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That cursed dyspepsia, he said before drinking:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Breadsoda is very good, Davy Byrne
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">said
civilly.</span></span> <font color="black">said.</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font></p>
<p> Tom Rochford nodded and drank.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is it Zinfandel?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Say
nothing<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">?</span></span>! Bantam
Lyons said with a wink. I&apos;m going to have five bob on my own.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Tell us and be damned to you, Paddy Leonard said. Who
gave it
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><font color="black">to</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>
you?</p>
<p> Mr Bloom on his way out raised three fingers in greeting.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; So long! Nosey Flynn said.</p>
<p> The others turned.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That&apos;s the man now that gave it to me, Bantam
<br><font color="green">{ms, 025}</font>
<br> Lyons whispered.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Prrwh! Paddy Leonard said with scorn. Mr Byrne, sir,
we&apos;ll take two of your small whiskies after that and a&nbsp;&hellip;.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Stone ginger, Davy Byrne added civilly.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ay, Paddy Leonard said. A sucking bottle for the baby.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom walked towards Dawson street. Something green it would have to be:

<p> A blind stripling stood tapping the curbstone with his slender cane. No tram in sight. Wants to cross.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do you want to cross? Mr Bloom asked.</p>
<p> The blind stripling did not answer. His wallface frowned weakly. He moved his head uncertainly.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You&apos;re in Dawson street, Mr Bloom said. Molesworth
street is opposite. Do you want to cross? There&apos;s nothing in the way.</p>
<p> The cane moved out trembling to the left. Mr Bloom&apos;s gaze followed its
line and saw again the dyeworks&apos; van drawn up before Drago&apos;s. Where I
saw his
<a name="s19001o" href="../../ff/unbs/s19all.htm#s19001o">brillantined</a> hair just when I was. Horse drooping.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; There&apos;s a van there, Mr Bloom said, but it&apos;s
not moving. I&apos;ll see you across. Do you want to go to Molesworth street?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, the boy answered. South Frederick street.</p>

<p> The blind stripling tapped the curbstone and went on his way, drawing his cane back, feeling again.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom walked behind him. Poor young fellow! How on earth did he know that
van was there? Must have felt it. See things in their forehead perhaps: kind of
sense<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span> of volume.
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><font color="black">Weight
or size of it, something blacker than the

he&apos;d feel it if something was removed. Feel a gap. Queer idea of Dublin he
must have, tapping his way round by the stones. Could he walk in a beeline if he
hadn&apos;t that cane? Bloodless pious face like a fellow going to be a priest.</p>

<p> Sense of smell must be stronger too. Smells on all sides, bunched together.
Each street different smell. Each person too. Then the spring, the summer:
smells. Tastes? They say you can&apos;t taste wines with
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the</span></span> your eyes shut.
Also smoke in the dark they say get no pleasure.</p>
<p> And with a woman
<br><font color="green">{ms, 028}</font>
<br> for instance. Must be strange not to see her. Kind of a picture in his
mind&apos;s eye. The voice, temperatures: when he touches her with his fingers
must almost see the lines, the curves. His hands on her hair, for instance. Say
it was black, for instance. Good. We call it black. Then passing over her white
skin. Different feel perhaps. Feeling of white.</p>
<p> Postoffice. Must answer. Fag today. Send her a postal order. Accept my
little present.

<p> With a gentle finger he felt ever so slowly the hair combed back above his
ears. Again. Fibres of fine fine straw. Then gently his finger felt the skin of
his right cheek. Sprouting hair there too. Not smooth enough. The belly is the
smoothest. No-one about. There he goes into Frederick street. Might be settling my braces.</p>
<p> Walking by Doran&apos;s public house he slid his hand between his waistcoat
and trousers and, pulling aside his shirt gently, felt a slack fold of his
belly. But I know it&apos;s whitey yellow. Want to try in the dark to see.</p>
<p> He withdrew his hand and pulled his dress to.</p>
