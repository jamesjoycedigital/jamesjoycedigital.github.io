<p> Phosphorus it must be done with. If you leave a bit of codfish for instance.
I could see the bluey silver over it. Night I went down to
<br><font color="green">{u21, 169}</font>
<br> the pantry in the kitchen. Don&apos;t like all the smells in it waiting to
rush out. What was it she wanted? The Malaga raisins. Thinking of Spain. Before
Rudy was born. The phosphorescence, that bluey greeny. Very good for the brain.</p>
<p> From Butler&apos;s monument house corner he glanced along Bachelor&apos;s walk.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 145}</font>
<br> Dedalus&apos; daughter there still outside Dillon&apos;s auctionrooms. Must
be selling off some old furniture. Knew her eyes at once from the father.
Lobbing about waiting for him. Home always breaks up when the mother goes.
Fifteen children he had. Birth every year almost. That&apos;s in their theology
or the priest won&apos;t give the poor woman the confession, the absolution.
Increase and multiply. Did you ever hear such an idea? Eat you out of house and
home. No families themselves to feed. Living on the fat of the land. Their
butteries and larders. I&apos;d like to see them do the black fast Yom Kippur.
Crossbuns. One meal and a collation for fear he&apos;d collapse on the altar. A
housekeeper of one of those fellows if you could pick it out of her. Never pick
it out of her. Like getting &pound;.s.d. out of him. Does himself well. No
guests. All for number one. Watching his water. Bring your own bread and butter. His reverence: mum&apos;s the word.</p>
<p> Good Lord, that poor child&apos;s dress is in flitters. Underfed she looks
too. Potatoes and marge, marge and potatoes. It&apos;s after they feel it. Proof
of the pudding. Undermines the constitution.</p>
<p> As he set foot on O&apos;Connell bridge a puffball of smoke plumed up from
the parapet. Brewery barge with export stout. England. Sea air sours it, I
heard. Be interesting some day get a pass through Hancock to see the brewery.
Regular world in itself. Vats of porter, wonderful. Rats get in too. Drink
themselves bloated as big as a collie floating. Dead drunk on the porter. Drink
till they puke again like christians. Imagine drinking that! Rats: vats. Well of course if we knew all the things.</p>
<p> Looking down he saw flapping strongly, wheeling between the gaunt quaywalls,
gulls. Rough weather outside. If I threw myself down? Reuben J&apos;s son must
have swallowed a good bellyful of that sewage. One and eightpence too much.
Hhhhm. It&apos;s the droll way he comes out with the things. Knows how to tell a story too.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 170}</font> </p>
<p> They wheeled lower. Looking for grub. Wait.</p>
<p> He threw down among them a crumpled paper ball. Elijah thirtytwo feet per
sec is com. Not a bit. The ball bobbed unheeded on the wake of swells, floated
under by the bridgepiers. Not such damn fools. Also the day I threw that stale
cake out of the Erin&apos;s King picked it up in the wake fifty yards astern.
Live by their wits. They wheeled, flapping.</p>
<p class="set"><i>The hungry famished gull</i>
<br> <i>Flaps o&apos;er the waters dull.</i>
<br><font color="green">{u22, 146}</font> </p>
<p> That is how poets write, the similar sounds. But then Shakespeare has no
rhymes: blank verse. The flow of the language it is. The thoughts. Solemn.</p>
<p class="set"><i>Hamlet, I am thy father&apos;s spirit
<br> Doomed for a certain time to walk the earth</i>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Two apples a penny! Two for a penny!</p>
<p> His gaze passed over the glazed apples serried on her stand. Australians
they must be this time of year. Shiny peels: polishes them up with a rag or a handkerchief.</p>
<p> Wait. Those poor birds.</p>
<p> He halted again and bought from the old applewoman two Banbury cakes for a
penny and broke the brittle paste and threw its fragments down into the Liffey.
See that? The gulls swooped silently, two, then all, from their heights, pouncing on prey. Gone. Every morsel.</p>
<p> Aware of their greed and cunning he shook the powdery crumb from his hands.
They never expected that. Manna. Live on fish, fishy flesh they have, all
seabirds, gulls, seagoose. Swans from Anna Liffey swim down here sometimes to
preen themselves. No accounting for tastes. Wonder what kind is swanmeat. Robinson Crusoe had to live on them.</p>
<p> They wheeled, flapping weakly. I&apos;m not going to throw any more. Penny
quite enough. Lot of thanks I get. Not even a caw. They spread foot and mouth
disease too. If you cram a turkey say on chestnut meal it tastes like that. Eat
pig like pig. But then why is it that saltwater fish are not salty? How is that?
<br><font color="green">{u21, 171}</font> </p>
<p> His eyes sought answer from the river and saw a rowboat rock at anchor on
the treacly swells lazily its plastered board.</p>
<p> <i>Kino&apos;s</i></p>
<p> <i>11/-</i></p>
<p> <i>Trousers</i></p>
<p> Good idea that. Wonder if he pays rent to the corporation. How can you own
water really? It&apos;s always flowing in a stream, never the same, which in the
stream of life we trace. Because life is a stream. All kinds of places are good
for ads. That quack doctor for the clap used to be stuck up in all the
greenhouses. Never see it now. Strictly confidential. Dr Hy Franks. Didn&apos;t
cost him a red like Maginni the dancing master self advertisement. Got fellows
to stick them up or stick them up himself for that matter on the q.t. running in
to loosen a button. Flybynight. Just the place too. POST NO BILLS. POST 110 PILLS. Some chap with a dose burning him.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 147}</font> </p>
<p> If he&nbsp;&hellip;?</p>
<p> O!</p>
<p> Eh?</p>
<p> No&nbsp;&hellip; No.</p>
<p> No, no. I don&apos;t believe it. He wouldn&apos;t surely?</p>
<p> No, no.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom moved forward, raising his troubled eyes. Think no more about that.
After one. Timeball on the ballast office is down. Dunsink time. Fascinating
little book that is of sir Robert Ball&apos;s. Parallax. I never exactly
understood. There&apos;s a priest. Could ask him. Par it&apos;s Greek: parallel,
parallax. Met him pike hoses she called it till I told her about the transmigration. O rocks!</p>
<p> Mr Bloom smiled O rocks at two windows of the ballast office. She&apos;s
right after all. Only big words for ordinary things on account of the sound.
She&apos;s not exactly witty. Can be rude too. Blurt out what I was thinking.
Still I don&apos;t know. She used to say Ben Dollard had a base barreltone
voice. He has legs like barrels and you&apos;d think he was singing into a
barrel. Now, isn&apos;t that wit? They used to call him big Ben. Not half as
witty as calling him base barreltone. Appetite like
<br><font color="green">{u21, 172}</font>
<br> an albatross. Get outside of a baron of beef. Powerful man he was at
stowing away number one Bass. Barrel of Bass. See? It all works out.</p>
<p> A procession of whitesmocked sandwichmen marched slowly towards him along
the gutter, scarlet sashes across their boards. Bargains. Like that priest they
are this morning: we have sinned: we have suffered. He read the scarlet letters
on their five tall white hats: H.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;Y.&nbsp;S. Wisdom
Hely&apos;s. Y lagging behind drew a chunk of bread from under his foreboard,
crammed it into his mouth and munched as he walked. Our staple food. Three bob a
day, walking along the gutters, street after street. Just keep skin and bone
together, bread and skilly. They are not Boyl: no: M&apos;Glade&apos;s men.
Doesn&apos;t bring in any business either. I suggested to him about a
transparent showcart with two smart girls sitting inside writing letters,
copybooks, envelopes, blottingpaper. I bet that would have caught on. Smart
girls writing something catch the eye at once. Everyone dying to know what
she&apos;s writing. Get twenty of them round you if you stare at nothing. Have a
finger in the pie. Women too. Curiosity. Pillar of salt. Wouldn&apos;t have it
of course because he didn&apos;t think of it himself first. Or the inkbottle I
suggested with a false stain of black celluloid. His ideas for ads like
Plumtree&apos;s potted under the obituaries, cold meat department. You
can&apos;t lick &apos;em. What? Our envelopes. Hello, Jones, where are you
going? Can&apos;t stop, Robinson, I am hastening to purchase the only reliable inkeraser
<br><font color="green">{u22, 148}</font>
<br> <i>Kansell</i>, sold by Hely&apos;s Ltd, 85 Dame street. Well out of that
ruck I am. Devil of a job it was collecting accounts of those convents.
Tranquilla convent. That was a nice nun there, really sweet face. Wimple suited
her small head. Sister? Sister? I am sure she was crossed in love by her eyes.
Very hard to bargain with that sort of woman. I disturbed her at her devotions
that morning. But glad to communicate with the outside world. Our great day, she
said. Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel. Sweet name too: caramel. She knew I, I
think she knew by the way she. If she had married she would have changed. I
suppose they really were short of money. Fried everything in the best butter all
the same. No lard for them. My heart&apos;s broke eating dripping. They like buttering themselves in and out. Molly
<br><font color="green">{u21, 173}</font>
<br> tasting it, her veil up. Sister? Pat Claffey, the pawnbroker&apos;s
daughter. It was a nun they say invented barbed wire.</p>
<p> He crossed Westmoreland street when apostrophe S had plodded by. Rover
cycleshop. Those races are on today. How long ago is that? Year Phil Gilligan
died. We were in Lombard street west. Wait: was in Thom&apos;s. Got the job in
Wisdom Hely&apos;s year we married. Six years. Ten years ago: ninetyfour he
died, yes that&apos;s right, the big fire at Arnott&apos;s. Val Dillon was lord
mayor. The Glencree dinner. Alderman Robert O&apos;Reilly emptying the port into
his soup before the flag fell. Bobbob lapping it for the inner alderman.
Couldn&apos;t hear what the band played. For what we have already received may
the Lord make us. Milly was a kiddy then. Molly had that elephantgrey dress with
the braided frogs. Mantailored with selfcovered buttons. She didn&apos;t like it
because I sprained my ankle first day she wore it, choir picnic at the
Sugarloaf. As if that. Old Goodwin&apos;s tall hat done up with some sticky
stuff. Flies&apos; picnic too. Never put a dress on her back like it. Fitted her
like a glove, shoulders and hips. Just beginning to plump it out well. Rabbit
pie we had that day. People looking after her.</p>
<p> Happy. Happier then. Snug little room that was with the red wallpaper.
Dockrell&apos;s, one and ninepence a dozen. Milly&apos;s tubbing night. American
soap I bought: elderflower. Cosy smell of her bathwater. Funny she looked soaped
all over. Shapely too. Now photography. Poor papa&apos;s daguerrotype atelier he told me of. Hereditary taste.</p>
<p> He walked along the curbstone.</p>
<p> Stream of life. What was the name of that priestylooking chap was always
squinting in when he passed? Weak eyes, woman. Stopped in Citron&apos;s saint
Kevin&apos;s parade. Pen something. Pendennis? My memory is getting.
Pen&nbsp;&hellip;? Of course it&apos;s years ago. Noise of the trams probably.
Well, if he couldn&apos;t remember the dayfather&apos;s name that he sees every day.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 149}</font> </p>
<p> Bartell d&apos;Arcy was the tenor, just coming out then. Seeing her home
after practice. Conceited fellow with his waxedup moustache. Gave her that song
<i>Winds that blow from the south</i>.</p>
<p> Windy night that was I went to fetch her there was that lodge
<br><font color="green">{u21, 174}</font>
<br> meeting on about those lottery tickets after Goodwin&apos;s concert in the
supperroom or oakroom of the Mansion house. He and I behind. Sheet of her music
blew out of my hand against the high school railings. Lucky it didn&apos;t.
Thing like that spoils the effect of a night for her. Professor Goodwin linking
her in front. Shaky on his pins, poor old sot. His farewell concerts. Positively
last appearance on any stage. May be for months and may be for never. Remember
her laughing at the wind, her blizzard collar up. Corner of Harcourt road
remember that gust? Brrfoo! Blew up all her skirts and her boa nearly smothered
old Goodwin. She did get flushed in the wind. Remember when we got home raking
up the fire and frying up those pieces of lap of mutton for her supper with the
Chutney sauce she liked. And the mulled rum. Could see her in the bedroom from
the hearth unclamping the busk of her stays. White.</p>
<p> Swish and soft flop her stays made on the bed. Always warm from her. Always
liked to let herself out. Sitting there after till near two, taking out her
hairpins. Milly tucked up in beddyhouse. Happy. Happy. That was the night&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O, Mr Bloom, how do you do?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O, how do you do, Mrs Breen?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; No use complaining. How is Molly those times? Haven&apos;t seen her for ages.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; In the pink, Mr Bloom said gaily. Milly has a position down in Mullingar, you know.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Go away! Isn&apos;t that grand for her?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, in a photographer&apos;s there. Getting on like a
house on fire. How are all your charges?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; All on the baker&apos;s list, Mrs Breen said.</p>
<p> How many has she? No other in sight.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You&apos;re in black I see. You have no&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; No, Mr Bloom said. I have just come from a funeral.</p>
<p> Going to crop up all day, I foresee. Who&apos;s dead, when and what did he die of? Turn up like a bad penny.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O dear me, Mrs Breen said, I hope it wasn&apos;t any near relation.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 175}</font> </p>
<p> May as well get her sympathy.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Dignam, Mr Bloom said. An old friend of mine. He died quite
<br><font color="green">{u22, 150}</font>
<br> suddenly, poor fellow. Heart trouble, I believe. Funeral was this morning.</p>
<p class="set"><i>Your funeral&apos;s tomorrow</i>
<br> <i>While you&apos;re coming through the rye.</i>
<br> <i>Diddlediddle dumdum</i>
<br> <i>Diddlediddle</i>&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Sad to lose the old friends, Mrs Breen&apos;s womaneyes said melancholily.</p>
<p> Now that&apos;s quite enough about that. Just: quietly: husband.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And your lord and master?</p>
<p> Mrs Breen turned up her two large eyes. Hasn&apos;t lost them anyhow.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O, don&apos;t be talking, she said. He&apos;s a caution to
rattlesnakes. He&apos;s in there now with his lawbooks finding out the law of
libel. He has me heartscalded. Wait till I show you.</p>
<p> Hot mockturtle vapour and steam of newbaked jampuffs rolypoly poured out
from Harrison&apos;s. The heavy noonreek tickled the top of Mr Bloom&apos;s
gullet. Want to make good pastry, butter, best flour, Demerara sugar, or
they&apos;d taste it with the hot tea. Or is it from her? A barefoot arab stood
over the grating, breathing in the fumes. Deaden the gnaw of hunger that way.
Pleasure or pain is it? Penny dinner. Knife and fork chained to the table.</p>
<p> Opening her handbag, chipped leather. Hatpin: ought to have a guard on those
things. Stick it in a chap&apos;s eye in the tram. Rummaging. Open. Money.
Please take one. Devils if they lose sixpence. Raise Cain. Husband barging.
Where&apos;s the ten shillings I gave you on Monday? Are you feeding your little
brother&apos;s family? Soiled handkerchief: medicinebottle. Pastille that was fell. What is she&nbsp;&hellip;?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There must be a new moon out, she said. He&apos;s always
bad then. Do you know what he did last night?</p>
<p> Her hand ceased to rummage. Her eyes fixed themselves on him, wide in alarm, yet smiling.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 176}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What? Mr Bloom asked.</p>
<p> Let her speak. Look straight in her eyes. I believe you. Trust me.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Woke me up in the night, she said. Dream he had, a nightmare.</p>
<p> Indiges.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Said the ace of spades was walking up the stairs.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The ace of spades! Mr Bloom said.</p>
<p> She took a folded postcard from her handbag.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Read that, she said. He got it this morning.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What is it? Mr Bloom asked, taking the card. U.&nbsp;P.?
<br><font color="green">{u22, 151}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; U. P: up, she said. Someone taking a rise out of him.
It&apos;s a great shame for them whoever he is.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Indeed it is, Mr Bloom said.</p>
<p> She took back the card, sighing.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And now he&apos;s going round to Mr Menton&apos;s office.
He&apos;s going to take an action for ten thousand pounds, he says.</p>
<p> She folded the card into her untidy bag and snapped the catch.</p>
<p> Same blue serge dress she had two years ago, the nap bleaching. Seen its
best days. Wispish hair over her ears. And that dowdy toque, three old grapes to
take the harm out of it. Shabby genteel. She used to be a tasty dresser. Lines
round her mouth. Only a year or so older than Molly.</p>
<p> See the eye that woman gave her, passing. Cruel. The unfair sex.</p>
<p> He looked still at her, holding back behind his look his discontent. Pungent
mockturtle oxtail mulligatawny. I&apos;m hungry too. Flakes of pastry on the
gusset of her dress: daub of sugary flour stuck to her cheek. Rhubarb tart with
liberal fillings, rich fruit interior. Josie Powell that was. In Luke
Doyle&apos;s long ago. Dolphin&apos;s Barn, the charades. U.&nbsp;P: up.</p>
<p> Change the subject.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Do you ever see anything of Mrs Beaufoy, Mr Bloom asked.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Mina Purefoy? she said.</p>
<p> Philip Beaufoy I was thinking. Playgoers&apos; club. Matcham often thinks of
the masterstroke. Did I pull the chain? Yes. The last act.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 177}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I just called to ask on the way in is she over it.
She&apos;s in the lying-in hospital in Holles street. Dr Horne got her in. She&apos;s three days bad now.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O, Mr Bloom said. I&apos;m sorry to hear that.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, Mrs Breen said. And a houseful of kids at home.
It&apos;s a very stiff birth, the nurse told me.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O, Mr Bloom said.</p>
<p> His heavy pitying gaze absorbed her news. His tongue clacked in compassion. Dth! Dth!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I&apos;m sorry to hear that, he said. Poor thing! Three days! That&apos;s terrible for her.</p>
<p> Mrs Breen nodded.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; She was taken bad on the Tuesday&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> Mr Bloom touched her funnybone gently, warning her:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Mind! Let this man pass.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 152}</font> </p>
<p> A bony form strode along the curbstone from the river, staring with a rapt
gaze into the sunlight through a heavystringed glass. Tight as a skullpiece a
tiny hat gripped his head. From his arm a folded dustcoat, a stick and an umbrella dangled to his stride.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Watch him, Mr Bloom said. He always walks outside the lampposts. Watch!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who is he if it&apos;s a fair question? Mrs Breen asked. Is he dotty?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; His name is Cashel Boyle O&apos;Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall
Farrell, Mr Bloom said, smiling. Watch!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He has enough of them, she said. Denis will be like that one of these days.</p>
<p> She broke off suddenly.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There he is, she said. I must go after him. Goodbye. Remember me to Molly, won&apos;t you?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I will, Mr Bloom said.</p>
<p> He watched her dodge through passers towards the shopfronts. Denis Breen in
skimpy frockcoat and blue canvas shoes shuffled out of Harrison&apos;s hugging
two heavy tomes to his ribs. Blown in from the bay. Like old times. He suffered her to overtake him without surprise
<br><font color="green">{u21, 178}</font>
<br> and thrust his dull grey beard towards her, his loose jaw wagging as he spoke earnestly.</p>
<p> Meshuggah. Off his chump.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom walked on again easily, seeing ahead of him in sunlight the tight
skullpiece, the dangling stickumbrelladustcoat. Going the two days. Watch him!
Out he goes again. One way of getting on in the world. And that other old mosey
lunatic in those duds. Hard time she must have with him.</p>
<p> U. P: up. I&apos;ll take my oath that&apos;s Alf Bergan or Richie Goulding.
Wrote it for a lark in the Scotch house I bet anything. Round to Menton&apos;s
office. His oyster eyes staring at the postcard. Be a feast for the gods.</p>
<p> He passed the <i>Irish Times.</i> There might be other answers lying there.
Like to answer them all. Good system for criminals. Code. At their lunch now.
Clerk with the glasses there doesn&apos;t know me. O, leave them there to
simmer. Enough bother wading through fortyfour of them. Wanted smart lady typist
to aid gentleman in literary work. I called you naughty darling because I do not
like that other world. Please tell me what is the meaning. Please tell me what
perfume does your wife. Tell me who made the world. The way they spring those
questions on you. And the other one Lizzie Twigg. My literary efforts have had
the good fortune to meet with the approval of the eminent
<br><font color="green">{u22, 153}</font>
<br> poet A.&nbsp;E. (Mr Geo. Russell). No time to do her hair drinking sloppy tea with a book of poetry.</p>
<p> Best paper by long chalks for a small ad. Got the provinces now. Cook and
general, exc. cuisine, housemaid kept. Wanted live man for spirit counter. Resp.
girl (R.C.) wishes to hear of post in fruit or pork shop. James Carlisle made
that. Six and a half per cent dividend. Made a big deal on Coates&apos;s shares.
Ca&apos; canny. Cunning old Scotch hunks. All the toady news. Our gracious and
popular vicereine. Bought the <i>Irish Field</i> now. Lady Mountcashel has quite
recovered after her confinement and rode out with the Ward Union staghounds at
the enlargement yesterday at Rathoath. Uneatable fox. Pothunters too. Fear
injects juices make it tender enough for them. Riding astride. Sit
<br><font color="green">{u21, 179}</font>
<br> her horse like a man. Weightcarrying huntress. No sidesaddle or pillion for
her, not for Joe. First to the meet and in at the death. Strong as a brood mare
some of those horsey women. Swagger around livery stables. Toss off a glass of
brandy neat while you&apos;d say knife. That one at the Grosvenor this morning.
Up with her on the car: wishswish. Stonewall or fivebarred gate put her mount to
it. Think that pugnosed driver did it out of spite. Who is this she was like? O
yes! Mrs Miriam Dandrade that sold me her old wraps and black underclothes in
the Shelbourne hotel. Divorced Spanish American. Didn&apos;t take a feather out
of her my handling them. As if I was her clotheshorse. Saw her in the viceregal
party when Stubbs the park ranger got me in with Whelan of the <i>Express</i>.
Scavenging what the quality left. High tea. Mayonnaise I poured on the plums
thinking it was custard. Her ears ought to have tingled for a few weeks after.
Want to be a bull for her. Born courtesan. No nursery work for her, thanks.</p>
<p> Poor Mrs Purefoy! Methodist husband. Method in his madness. Saffron bun and
milk and soda lunch in the educational dairy. Eating with a stopwatch, thirtytwo
chews to the minute. And still his muttonchop whiskers grew. Supposed to be well
connected. Theodore&apos;s cousin in Dublin Castle. One tony relative in every
family. Hardy annuals he presents her with. Saw him out at the Three Jolly
Topers marching along bareheaded and his eldest boy carrying one in a marketnet.
The squallers. Poor thing! Then having to give the breast year after year all
hours of the night. Selfish those t.t&apos;s are. Dog in the manger. Only one
lump of sugar in my tea, if you please.</p>
<p> He stood at Fleet street crossing. Luncheon interval. A sixpenny at
Rowe&apos;s? Must look up that ad in the national library. An eightpenny in the Burton. Better. On my way.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 154}</font> </p>
<p> He walked on past Bolton&apos;s Westmoreland house. Tea. Tea. Tea. I forgot to tap Tom Kernan.</p>
<p> Sss. Dth, dth, dth! Three days imagine groaning on a bed with a vinegared
handkerchief round her forehead, her belly swollen out. Phew! Dreadful simply!
Child&apos;s head too big: forceps. Doubled up inside her trying to butt its way out blindly, groping for the way out.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 180}</font>
<br> Kill me that would. Lucky Molly got over hers lightly. They ought to invent
something to stop that. Life with hard labour. Twilight sleep idea: queen
Victoria was given that. Nine she had. A good layer. Old woman that lived in a
shoe she had so many children. Suppose he was consumptive. Time someone thought
about it instead of gassing about the what was it the pensive bosom of the
silver effulgence. Flapdoodle to feed fools on. They could easily have big
establishments whole thing quite painless out of all the taxes give every child
born five quid at compound interest up to twentyone five per cent is a hundred
shillings and five tiresome pounds multiply by twenty decimal system encourage
people to put by money save hundred and ten and a bit twentyone years want to
work it out on paper come to a tidy sum more than you think.</p>
<p> Not stillborn of course. They are not even registered. Trouble for nothing.</p>
<p> Funny sight two of them together, their bellies out. Molly and Mrs Moisel.
Mothers&apos; meeting. Phthisis retires for the time being, then returns. How
flat they look after all of a sudden! Peaceful eyes. Weight off their minds. Old
Mrs Thornton was a jolly old soul. All my babies, she said. The spoon of pap in
her mouth before she fed them. O, that&apos;s nyumnyum. Got her hand crushed by
old Tom Wall&apos;s son. His first bow to the public. Head like a prize pumpkin.
Snuffy Dr Murren. People knocking them up at all hours. For God&apos; sake,
doctor. Wife in her throes. Then keep them waiting months for their fee. To
attendance on your wife. No gratitude in people. Humane doctors, most of them.</p>
<p> Before the huge high door of the Irish house of parliament a flock of
pigeons flew. Their little frolic after meals. Who will we do it on? I pick the
fellow in black. Here goes. Here&apos;s good luck. Must be thrilling from the
air. Apjohn, myself and Owen Goldberg up in the trees near Goose green playing the monkeys. Mackerel they called me.</p>
<p> A squad of constables debouched from College street, marching in Indian
file. Goose step. Foodheated faces, sweating helmets, patting their truncheons.
After their feed with a good load of fat soup under
<br><font color="green">{u21, 181}</font>
<br> their belts. Policeman&apos;s lot is oft a happy one. They split up into groups and scattered, saluting, towards
<br><font color="green">{u22, 155}</font>
<br> their beats. Let out to graze. Best moment to attack one in pudding time. A
punch in his dinner. A squad of others, marching irregularly, rounded Trinity
railings, making for the station. Bound for their troughs. Prepare to receive cavalry. Prepare to receive soup.</p>
<p> He crossed under Tommy Moore&apos;s roguish finger. They did right to put
him up over a urinal: meeting of the waters. Ought to be places for women.
Running into cakeshops. Settle my hat straight. <i>There is not in this wide
world a vallee</i>. Great song of Julia Morkan&apos;s. Kept her voice up to the
very last. Pupil of Michael Balfe&apos;s, wasn&apos;t she?</p>
<p> He gazed after the last broad tunic. Nasty customers to tackle. Jack Power
could a tale unfold: father a G man. If a fellow gave them trouble being lagged
they let him have it hot and heavy in the bridewell. Can&apos;t blame them after
all with the job they have especially the young hornies. That horsepoliceman the
day Joe Chamberlain was given his degree in Trinity he got a run for his money.
My word he did! His horse&apos;s hoofs clattering after us down Abbey street.
Lucky I had the presence of mind to dive into Manning&apos;s or I was souped. He
did come a wallop, by George. Must have cracked his skull on the cobblestones. I
oughtn&apos;t to have got myself swept along with those medicals. And the
Trinity jibs in their mortarboards. Looking for trouble. Still I got to know
that young Dixon who dressed that sting for me in the Mater and now he&apos;s in
Holles street where Mrs Purefoy. Wheels within wheels. Police whistle in my ears
still. All skedaddled. Why he fixed on me. Give me in charge. Right here it began.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Up the Boers!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Three cheers for De Wet!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; We&apos;ll hang Joe Chamberlain on a sourapple tree.</p>
<p> Silly billies: mob of young cubs yelling their guts out. Vinegar hill. The
Butter exchange band. Few years&apos; time half of them magistrates and civil
servants. War comes on: into the army helterskelter: same fellows used to: whether on the scaffold high.</p>
<p> Never know who you&apos;re talking to. Corny Kelleher he has Harvey
<br><font color="green">{u21, 182}</font>
<br> Duff in his eye. Like that Peter or Denis or James Carey that blew the gaff
on the invincibles. Member of the corporation too. Egging raw youths on to get
in the know all the time drawing secret service pay from the castle. Drop him
like a hot potato. Why those plainclothes men are always courting slaveys.
Easily twig a man used to uniform. Squarepushing up against a backdoor. Maul her
a bit. Then the next thing on the menu. And who is the gentleman
<br><font color="green">{u22, 156}</font>
<br> does be visiting there? Was the young master saying anything? Peeping Tom
through the keyhole. Decoy duck. Hotblooded young student fooling round her fat arms ironing.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Are those yours, Mary?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I don&apos;t wear such things&nbsp;&hellip; Stop or
I&apos;ll tell the missus on you. Out half the night.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There are great times coming, Mary. Wait till you see.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ah, gelong with your great times coming.</p>
<p> Barmaids too. Tobaccoshopgirls.</p>
<p> James Stephens&apos; idea was the best. He knew them. Circles of ten so that
a fellow couldn&apos;t round on more than his own ring. Sinn Fein. Back out you
get the knife. Hidden hand. Stay in. The firing squad. Turnkey&apos;s daughter
got him out of Richmond, off from Lusk. Putting up in the Buckingham Palace hotel under their very noses. Garibaldi.</p>
<p> You must have a certain fascination: Parnell. Arthur Griffith is a
squareheaded fellow but he has no go in him for the mob. Want to gas about our
lovely land. Gammon and spinach. Dublin Bakery Company&apos;s tearoom. Debating
societies. That republicanism is the best form of government. That the language
question should take precedence of the economic question. Have your daughters
inveigling them to your house. Stuff them up with meat and drink. Michaelmas
goose. Here&apos;s a good lump of thyme seasoning under the apron for you. Have
another quart of goosegrease before it gets too cold. Halffed enthusiasts. Penny
roll and a walk with the band. No grace for the carver. The thought that the
other chap pays best sauce in the world. Make themselves thoroughly at home.
Show us over those apricots, meaning peaches. The not far distant day. Homerule sun rising up in the northwest.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 183}</font> </p>
<p> His smile faded as he walked, a heavy cloud hiding the sun slowly, shadowing
Trinity&apos;s surly front. Trams passed one another, ingoing, outgoing,
clanging. Useless words. Things go on same: day after day: squads of police
marching out, back: trams in, out. Those two loonies mooching about. Dignam
carted off. Mina Purefoy swollen belly on a bed groaning to have a child tugged
out of her. One born every second somewhere. Other dying every second. Since I
fed the birds five minutes. Three hundred kicked the bucket. Other three hundred
born, washing the blood off, all are washed in the blood of the lamb, bawling maaaaaa.</p>
<p> Cityful passing away, other cityful coming, passing away too: other coming
on, passing on. Houses, lines of houses, streets, miles of pavements,
<br><font color="green">{u22, 157}</font>
<br> piledup bricks, stones. Changing hands. This owner, that. Landlord never
dies they say. Other steps into his shoes when he gets his notice to quit. They
buy the place up with gold and still they have all the gold. Swindle in it
somewhere. Piled up in cities, worn away age after age. Pyramids in sand. Built
on bread and onions. Slaves Chinese wall. Babylon. Big stones left. Round
towers. Rest rubble, sprawling suburbs, jerrybuilt. Kerwan&apos;s mushroom
houses, built of breeze. Shelter for the night.</p>
<p> No-one is anything.</p>
<p> This is the very worst hour of the day. Vitality. Dull, gloomy: hate this
hour. Feel as if I had been eaten and spewed.</p>
<p> Provost&apos;s house. The reverend Dr Salmon: tinned salmon. Well tinned in
there. Wouldn&apos;t live in it if they paid me. Hope they have liver and bacon today. Nature abhors a vacuum.</p>
<p> The sun freed itself slowly and lit glints of light among the silverware
opposite in Walter Sexton&apos;s window by which John Howard Parnell passed, unseeing.</p>
<p> There he is: the brother. Image of him. Haunting face. Now that&apos;s a
coincidence. Course hundreds of times you think of a person and don&apos;t meet
him. Like a man walking in his sleep. No-one knows him. Must be a corporation
meeting today. They say he never put on the city marshal&apos;s uniform since he got the job. Charley Kavanagh used to
<br><font color="green">{u21, 184}</font>
<br> come out on his high horse, cocked hat, puffed, powdered and shaved. Look
at the woebegone walk of him. Eaten a bad egg. Poached eyes on ghost. I have a
pain. Great man&apos;s brother: his brother&apos;s brother. He&apos;d look nice
on the city charger. Drop into the D.B.C. probably for his coffee, play chess
there. His brother used men as pawns. Let them all go to pot. Afraid to pass a
remark on him. Freeze them up with that eye of his. That&apos;s the fascination:
the name. All a bit touched. Mad Fanny and his other sister Mrs Dickinson
driving about with scarlet harness. Bolt upright like surgeon M&apos;Ardle.
Still David Sheehy beat him for south Meath. Apply for the Chiltern Hundreds and
retire into public life. The patriot&apos;s banquet. Eating orangepeels in the
park. Simon Dedalus said when they put him in parliament that Parnell would come
back from the grave and lead him out of the House of Commons by the arm.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Of the twoheaded octopus, one of whose heads is the head
upon which the ends of the world have forgotten to come while the other speaks
with a Scotch accent. The tentacles&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> They passed from behind Mr Bloom along the curbstone. Beard and bicycle. Young woman.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 158}</font> </p>
<p> And there he is too. Now that&apos;s really a coincidence: second time.
Coming events cast their shadows before. With the approval of the eminent poet
Mr Geo. Russell. That might be Lizzie Twigg with him. A.&nbsp;E.: what does that
mean? Initials perhaps. Albert Edward, Arthur Edmund, Alphonsus Eb Ed El
Esquire. What was he saying? The ends of the world with a Scotch accent.
Tentacles: octopus. Something occult: symbolism. Holding forth. She&apos;s
taking it all in. Not saying a word. To aid gentleman in literary work.</p>
<p> His eyes followed the high figure in homespun, beard and bicycle, a
listening woman at his side. Coming from the vegetarian. Only weggebobbles and
fruit. Don&apos;t eat a beefsteak. If you do the eyes of that cow will pursue
you through all eternity. They say it&apos;s healthier. Wind and watery though.
Tried it. Keep you on the run all day. Bad as a bloater. Dreams all night. Why
do they call that thing they gave me nutsteak? Nutarians. Fruitarians. To give you the idea you are
<br><font color="green">{u21, 185}</font>
<br> eating rumpsteak. Absurd. Salty too. They cook in soda. Keep you sitting by the tap all night.</p>
<p> Her stockings are loose over her ankles. I detest that: so tasteless. Those
literary etherial people they are all. Dreamy, cloudy, symbolistic. Esthetes
they are. I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if it was that kind of food you see
produces the like waves of the brain the poetical. For example one of those
policemen sweating Irish stew into their shirts you couldn&apos;t squeeze a line
of poetry out of him. Don&apos;t know what poetry is even. Must be in a certain mood.</p>
<p class="set"><i>The dreamy cloudy gull</i>
<br> <i>Waves o&apos;er the waters dull.</i></p>
<p> He crossed at Nassau street corner and stood before the window of Yeates and
Son, pricing the fieldglasses. Or will I drop into old Harris&apos;s and have a
chat with young Sinclair? Wellmannered fellow. Probably at his lunch. Must get
those old glasses of mine set right. Goerz lenses, six guineas. Germans making
their way everywhere. Sell on easy terms to capture trade. Undercutting. Might
chance on a pair in the railway lost property office. Astonishing the things
people leave behind them in trains and cloakrooms. What do they be thinking
about? Women too. Incredible. Last year travelling to Ennis had to pick up that
farmer&apos;s daughter&apos;s bag and hand it to her at Limerick junction.
Unclaimed money too. There&apos;s a little watch up there on the roof of the bank to test those glasses by.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 159}</font> </p>
<p> His lids came down on the lower rims of his irides. Can&apos;t see it. If
you imagine it&apos;s there you can almost see it. Can&apos;t see it.</p>
<p> He faced about and, standing between the awnings, held out his right hand at
arm&apos;s length towards the sun. Wanted to try that often. Yes: completely.
The tip of his little finger blotted out the sun&apos;s disk. Must be the focus
where the rays cross. If I had black glasses. Interesting. There was a lot of
talk about those sunspots when we were in Lombard street west. Terrific
explosions they are. There will be a total eclipse this year: autumn some time.</p>
<p> Now that I come to think of it that ball falls at Greenwich time.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 186}</font>
<br> It&apos;s the clock is worked by an electric wire from Dunsink. Must go out
there some first Saturday of the month. If I could get an introduction to
professor Joly or learn up something about his family. That would do to: man
always feels complimented. Flattery where least expected. Nobleman proud to be
descended from some king&apos;s mistress. His foremother. Lay it on with a
trowel. Cap in hand goes through the land. Not go in and blurt out what you know
you&apos;re not to: what&apos;s parallax? Show this gentleman the door.</p>
<p> Ah.</p>
<p> His hand fell again to his side.</p>
<p> Never know anything about it. Waste of time. Gasballs spinning about,
crossing each other, passing. Same old dingdong always. Gas, then solid, then
world, then cold, then dead shell drifting around, frozen rock like that
pineapple rock. The moon. Must be a new moon out, she said. I believe there is.</p>
<p> He went on by la Maison Claire.</p>
<p> Wait. The full moon was the night we were Sunday fortnight exactly there is
a new moon. Walking down by the Tolka. Not bad for a Fairview moon. She was
humming: The young May moon she&apos;s beaming, love. He other side of her.
Elbow, arm. He. Glowworm&apos;s la-amp is gleaming, love. Touch. Fingers. Asking. Answer. Yes.</p>
<p> Stop. Stop. If it was it was. Must.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom, quickbreathing, slowlier walking, passed Adam court.</p>
<p> With a keep quiet relief his eyes took note: this is street here middle of
the day Bob Doran&apos;s bottle shoulders. On his annual bend, M&apos;Coy said.
They drink in order to say or do something or <i>cherchez la femme</i>. Up in
the Coombe with chummies and streetwalkers and then the rest of the year as sober as a judge.</p>
<p> Yes. Thought so. Sloping into the Empire. Gone. Plain soda would do
<br><font color="green">{u22, 160}</font>
<br> him good. Where Pat Kinsella had his Harp theatre before Whitbred ran the
Queen&apos;s. Broth of a boy. Dion Boucicault business with his harvestmoon face
in a poky bonnet. Three Purty Maids from School. How time flies, eh? Showing
long red pantaloons under his skirts. Drinkers, drinking, laughed spluttering, their drink against their
<br><font color="green">{u21, 187}</font>
<br> breath. More power, Pat. Coarse red: fun for drunkards: guffaw and smoke.
Take off that white hat. His parboiled eyes. Where is he now? Beggar somewhere.
The harp that once did starve us all.</p>
<p> I was happier then. Or was that I? Or am I now I? Twentyeight I was. She
twentythree. When we left Lombard street west something changed. Could never
like it again after Rudy. Can&apos;t bring back time. Like holding water in your
hand. Would you go back to then? Just beginning then. Would you? Are you not
happy in your home, you poor little naughty boy? Wants to sew on buttons for me.
I must answer. Write it in the library.</p>
<p> Grafton street gay with housed awnings lured his senses. Muslin prints,
silkdames and dowagers, jingle of harnesses, hoofthuds lowringing in the baking
causeway. Thick feet that woman has in the white stockings. Hope the rain mucks
them up on her. Countrybred chawbacon. All the beef to the heels were in. Always
gives a woman clumsy feet. Molly looks out of plumb.</p>
<p> He passed, dallying, the windows of Brown Thomas, silk mercers. Cascades of
ribbons. Flimsy China silks. A tilted urn poured from its mouth a flood of
bloodhued poplin: lustrous blood. The huguenots brought that here. <i>La causa
&egrave; santa!</i> Tara tara. Great chorus that. Taree tara. Must be washed in
rainwater. Meyerbeer. Tara: bom bom bom.</p>
<p> Pincushions. I&apos;m a long time threatening to buy one. Sticks them all
over the place. Needles in window curtains.</p>
<p> He bared slightly his left forearm. Scrape: nearly gone. Not today anyhow.
Must go back for that lotion. For her birthday perhaps. Junejulyaugseptember
eighth. Nearly three months off. Then she mightn&apos;t like it. Women won&apos;t pick up pins. Say it cuts lo.</p>
<p> Gleaming silks, petticoats on slim brass rails, rays of flat silk stockings.</p>
<p> Useless to go back. Had to be. Tell me all.</p>
<p> High voices. Sunwarm silk. Jingling harnesses. All for a woman, home and
houses, silkwebs, silver, rich fruits spicy from Jaffa. Agendath Netaim. Wealth of the world.</p>
<p> A warm human plumpness settled down on his brain. His brain
<br><font color="green">{u21, 188}</font>
<br> yielded. Perfume of embraces all him assailed. With hungered flesh obscurely, he mutely craved to adore.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 161}</font> </p>
<p> Duke street. Here we are. Must eat. The Burton. Feel better then.</p>
<p> He turned Combridge&apos;s corner, still pursued. Jingling, hoofthuds.
Perfumed bodies, warm, full. All kissed, yielded: in deep summer fields, tangled
pressed grass, in trickling hallways of tenements, along sofas, creaking beds.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Jack, love!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Darling!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Kiss me, Reggy!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; My boy!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Love!</p>
<p> His heart astir he pushed in the door of the Burton restaurant. Stink
gripped his trembling breath: pungent meatjuice, slush of greens. See the animals feed.</p>
<p> Men, men, men.</p>
<p> Perched on high stools by the bar, hats shoved back, at the tables calling
for more bread no charge, swilling, wolfing gobfuls of sloppy food, their eyes
bulging, wiping wetted moustaches. A pallid suetfaced young man polished his
tumbler knife fork and spoon with his napkin. New set of microbes. A man with an
infant&apos;s saucestained napkin tucked round him shovelled gurgling soup down
his gullet. A man spitting back on his plate: halfmasticated gristle: gums: no
teeth to chewchewchew it. Chump chop from the grill. Bolting to get it over. Sad
booser&apos;s eyes. Bitten off more than he can chew. Am I like that? See
ourselves as others see us. Hungry man is an angry man. Working tooth and jaw.
Don&apos;t! O! A bone! That last pagan king of Ireland Cormac in the schoolpoem
choked himself at Sletty southward of the Boyne. Wonder what he was eating.
Something galoptious. Saint Patrick converted him to Christianity. Couldn&apos;t swallow it all however.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Roast beef and cabbage.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; One stew.</p>
<p> Smells of men. Spat-on sawdust, sweetish warmish cigarette smoke, reek of
plug, spilt beer, men&apos;s beery piss, the stale of ferment.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 189}</font> </p>
<p> His gorge rose.</p>
<p> Couldn&apos;t eat a morsel here. Fellow sharpening knife and fork to eat all
before him, old chap picking his tootles. Slight spasm, full, chewing the cud.
Before and after. Grace after meals. Look on this picture then on that. Scoffing
up stewgravy with sopping sippets of bread. Lick it off the plate, man! Get out of this.</p>
<p> He gazed round the stooled and tabled eaters, tightening the wings of his nose.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 162}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Two stouts here.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; One corned and cabbage.</p>
<p> That fellow ramming a knifeful of cabbage down as if his life depended on
it. Good stroke. Give me the fidgets to look. Safer to eat from his three hands.
Tear it limb from limb. Second nature to him. Born with a silver knife in his
mouth. That&apos;s witty, I think. Or no. Silver means born rich. Born with a knife. But then the allusion is lost.</p>
<p> An illgirt server gathered sticky clattering plates. Rock, the bailiff,
standing at the bar blew the foamy crown from his tankard. Well up: it splashed
yellow near his boot. A diner, knife and fork upright, elbows on table, ready
for a second helping stared towards the foodlift
<font color="red"><sup><small>|12|+</small></sup></font><font color="black">across
his stained square of
newspaper<a target="foot" id="fhh0155">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>+|12|</small></sup></font>.
Other chap telling him something with his mouth full. Sympathetic listener.
Table talk. I munched hum un thu Unchster Bunk un Munchday. Ha? Did you, faith?</p>
<p> Mr Bloom raised two fingers doubtfully to his lips. His eyes said:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Not here. Don&apos;t see him.</p>
<p> Out. I hate dirty eaters.</p>
<p> He backed towards the door. Get a light snack in Davy Byrne&apos;s. Stopgap.
Keep me going. Had a good breakfast.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Roast and mashed here.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Pint of stout.</p>
<p> Every fellow for his own, tooth and nail. Gulp. Grub. Gulp. Gobstuff.</p>
<p> He came out into clearer air and turned back towards Grafton street. Eat or be eaten. Kill! Kill!</p>
<p> Suppose that communal kitchen years to come perhaps. All trotting
<br><font color="green">{u21, 190}</font>
<br> down with porringers and tommycans to be filled. Devour contents in the
street. John Howard Parnell example the provost of Trinity every mother&apos;s
son <i>don&apos;t talk of your provosts and provost of Trinity</i> women and
children, cabmen, priests, parsons, fieldmarshals, archbishops. From Ailesbury
road, Clyde road, artisans&apos; dwellings, north Dublin union, lord mayor in
his gingerbread coach, old queen in a bathchair. My plate&apos;s empty. After

Like sir Philip Crampton&apos;s fountain. Rub off the microbes with your
handkerchief. Next chap rubs on a new batch with his. <i>Father O&apos;Flynn
would make hares of them all</i>. Have rows all the same. All for number one.
Children fighting for the scrapings of the pot. Want a souppot as big as the
Phoenix park. Harpooning flitches and hindquarters out of it. Hate people all
round you. City Arms hotel <i>table d&apos;h&ocirc;te</i> she called it. Soup,
joint and sweet. Never know whose thoughts you&apos;re chewing. Then who&apos;d wash up
<br><font color="green">{u22, 163}</font>
<br> all the plates and forks? Might be all feeding on tabloids that time. Teeth getting worse and worse.</p>
<p> After all there&apos;s a lot in that vegetarian fine flavour of things from
the earth garlic of course it stinks Italian organgrinders crisp of onions,
mushrooms, truffles. Pain to the animal too. Pluck and draw fowl. Wretched
brutes there at the cattlemarket waiting for the poleaxe to split their skulls
open. Moo. Poor trembling calves. Meh. Staggering bob. Bubble and squeak.
Butchers&apos; buckets wobble lights. Give us that brisket off the hook. Plup.
Rawhead and bloody bones. Flayed glasseyed sheep hung from their haunches,
sheepsnouts bloodypapered snivelling nosejam on sawdust. Top and lashers going
out. Don&apos;t maul them pieces, young one.</p>
<p> Hot fresh blood they prescribe for decline. Blood always needed. Insidious.
Lick it up smoking hot, thick sugary. Famished ghosts.</p>
<p> Ah, I&apos;m hungry.</p>
<p> He entered Davy Byrne&apos;s. Moral pub. He doesn&apos;t chat. Stands a
drink now and then. But in leapyear once in four. Cashed a cheque for me once.</p>
<p> What will I take now? He drew his watch. Let me see now. Shandygaff?
<br><font color="green">{u21, 191}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Hello, Bloom, Nosey Flynn said from his nook.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Hello, Flynn.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; How&apos;s things?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Tiptop&nbsp;&hellip; Let me see. I&apos;ll take a glass of
burgundy and&nbsp;&hellip; let me see.</p>
<p> Sardines on the shelves. Almost taste them by looking. Sandwich? Ham and his
descendants musterred and bred there. Potted meats. What is home without
Plumtree&apos;s potted meat? Incomplete. What a stupid ad! Under the obituary
notices they stuck it. All up a plumtree. Dignam&apos;s potted meat. Cannibals
would with lemon and rice. White missionary too salty. Like pickled pork. Expect
the chief consumes the parts of honour. Ought to be tough from exercise. His
wives in a row to watch the effect. <i>There was a right royal old nigger. Who
ate or something the somethings of the reverend Mr MacTrigger.</i> With it an
abode of bliss. Lord knows what concoction. Cauls mouldy tripes windpipes faked
and minced up. Puzzle find the meat. Kosher. No meat and milk together. Hygiene
that was what they call now. Yom Kippur fast spring cleaning of inside. Peace
and war depend on some fellow&apos;s digestion. Religions. Christmas turkeys and
geese. Slaughter of innocents. Eat, drink and be merry. Then casual wards full
after. Heads bandaged. Cheese digests all but itself. Mity cheese.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Have you a cheese sandwich?
<br><font color="green">{u22, 164}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, sir.</p>
<p> Like a few olives too if they had them. Italian I prefer. Good glass of
burgundy take away that. Lubricate. A nice salad, cool as a cucumber. Tom Kernan
can dress. Puts gusto into it. Pure olive oil. Milly served me that cutlet with
a sprig of parsley. Take one Spanish onion. God made food, the devil the cooks. Devilled crab.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Wife well?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Quite well, thanks&nbsp;&hellip; A cheese sandwich, then. Gorgonzola, have you?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, sir.</p>
<p> Nosey Flynn sipped his grog.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Doing any singing those times?
<br><font color="green">{u21, 192}</font> </p>
<p> Look at his mouth. Could whistle in his own ear. Flap ears to match. Music.
Knows as much about it as my coachman. Still better tell him. Does no harm. Free ad.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; She&apos;s engaged for a big tour end of this month. You may have heard perhaps.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; No. O, that&apos;s the style. Who&apos;s getting it up?</p>
<p> The curate served.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; How much is that?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Seven d., sir&nbsp;&hellip; Thank you, sir.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom cut his sandwich into slender strips. <i>Mr MacTrigger</i>. Easier
than the dreamy creamy stuff. <i>His five hundred wives. Had the time of their lives.</i></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Mustard, sir?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Thank you.</p>
<p> He studded under each lifted strip yellow blobs. <i>Their lives</i>. I have
it. <i>It grew bigger and bigger and bigger</i>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Getting it up? he said. Well, it&apos;s like a company
idea, you see. Part shares and part profits.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ay, now I remember, Nosey Flynn said, putting his hand in
his pocket to scratch his groin. Who is this was telling me? Isn&apos;t Blazes Boylan mixed up in it?</p>
<p> A warm shock of air heat of mustard hanched on Mr Bloom&apos;s heart. He
raised his eyes and met the stare of a bilious clock. Two. Pub clock five
minutes fast. Time going on. Hands moving. Two. Not yet.</p>
<p> His midriff yearned then upward, sank within him, yearned more longly, longingly.</p>
<p> Wine.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 165}</font> </p>
<p> He smellsipped the cordial juice and, bidding his throat strongly to speed
it, set his wineglass delicately down.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, he said. He&apos;s the organiser in point of fact.</p>
<p> No fear. No brains.</p>
<p> Nosey Flynn snuffled and scratched. Flea having a good square meal.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He had a good slice of luck, Jack Mooney was telling me,
over that boxing match Myler Keogh won again that soldier in the
<br><font color="green">{u21, 193}</font>
<br> Portobello barracks. By God, he had the little kipper down in the county Carlow he was telling me&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> Hope that dewdrop doesn&apos;t come down into his glass. No, snuffled it up.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; For near a month, man, before it came off. Sucking duck
eggs by God till further orders. Keep him off the boose, see? O, by God, Blazes is a hairy chap.</p>
<p> Davy Byrne came forward from the hindbar in tuckstitched shirtsleeves,
cleaning his lips with two wipes of his napkin. Herring&apos;s blush. Whose
smile upon each feature plays with such and such replete. Too much fat on the parsnips.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And here&apos;s himself and pepper on him, Nosey Flynn
said. Can you give us a good one for the Gold cup?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I&apos;m off that, Mr Flynn, Davy Byrne answered. I never put anything on a horse.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You&apos;re right there, Nosey Flynn said.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom ate his strips of sandwich, fresh clean bread, with relish of
disgust, pungent mustard, the feety savour of green cheese. Sips of his wine
soothed his palate. Not logwood that. Tastes fuller this weather with the chill off.</p>
<p> Nice quiet bar. Nice piece of wood in that counter. Nicely planed. Like the way it curves there.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I wouldn&apos;t do anything at all in that line, Davy
Byrne said. It ruined many a man the same horses.</p>
<p> Vintners&apos; sweepstake. Licensed for the sale of beer, wine and spirits
for consumption on the premises. Heads I win tails you lose.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; True for you, Nosey Flynn said. Unless you&apos;re in the
know. There&apos;s no straight sport going now. Lenehan gets some good ones.
He&apos;s giving Sceptre today. Zinfandel&apos;s the favourite, lord Howard de
Walden&apos;s, won at Epsom. Morny Cannon is riding him. I could have got seven
to one against Saint Amant a fortnight before.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That so? Davy Byrne said&nbsp;&hellip;
<br><font color="green">{u22, 166}</font> </p>
<p> He went towards the window and, taking up the pettycash book, scanned its pages.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 194}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I could, faith, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling. That was a
rare bit of horseflesh. Saint Frusquin was her sire. She won in a thunderstorm,
Rothschild&apos;s filly, with wadding in her ears. Blue jacket and yellow cap.
Bad luck to big Ben Dollard and his John O&apos;Gaunt. He put me off it. Ay.</p>
<p> He drank resignedly from his tumbler, running his fingers down the flutes.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ay, he said, sighing.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom, champing, standing, looked upon his sigh. Nosey numbskull. Will I
tell him that horse Lenehan? He knows already. Better let him forget. Go and
lose more. Fool and his money. Dewdrop coming down again. Cold nose he&apos;d
have kissing a woman. Still they might like. Prickly beards they like.
Dogs&apos; cold noses. Old Mrs Riordan with the rumbling stomach&apos;s Skye
terrier in the City Arms hotel. Molly fondling him in her lap. O the big doggybowwowsywowsy!</p>
<p> Wine soaked and softened rolled pith of bread mustard a moment mawkish
cheese. Nice wine it is. Taste it better because I&apos;m not thirsty. Bath of
course does that. Just a bite or two. Then about six o&apos;clock I can. Six,
six. Time will be gone then. She&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> Mild fire of wine kindled his veins. I wanted that badly. Felt so off
colour. His eyes unhungrily saw shelves of tins, sardines, gaudy lobsters&apos;
claws. All the odd things people pick up for food. Out of shells, periwinkles
with a pin, off trees, snails out of the ground the French eat, out of the sea
with bait on a hook. Silly fish learn nothing in a thousand years. If you
didn&apos;t know risky putting anything into your mouth. Poisonous berries.
Johnny Magories. Roundness you think good. Gaudy colour warns you off. One
fellow told another and so on. Try it on the dog first. Led on by the smell or
the look. Tempting fruit. Ice cones. Cream. Instinct. Orangegroves for instance.
Need artificial irrigation. Bleibtreustrasse. Yes but what about oysters.
Unsightly like a clot of phlegm. Filthy shells. Devil to open them too. Who
found them out? Garbage, sewage they feed on. Fizz and Red bank oysters. Effect
on the sexual. Aphrodis. He was in the Red bank this morning. Was he oysters old
fish at table perhaps he young flesh in bed. No. June
<br><font color="green">{u21, 195}</font>
<br> has no ar no oysters. But there are people like tainted game. Jugged hare.
First catch your hare. Chinese eating eggs fifty years old, blue and green
again. Dinner of thirty courses. Each dish harmless might mix inside. Idea for a
poison mystery. That archduke Leopold was it, no, yes, or was it Otto one of those Habsburgs?
<br><font color="green">{u22, 167}</font>
<br> Or who was it used to eat the scruff off his own head? Cheapest lunch in
town. Of course, aristocrats. Then the others copy to be in the fashion. Milly
too rock oil and flour. Raw pastry I like myself. Half the catch of oysters they
throw back in the sea to keep up the price. Cheap no-one would buy. Caviare. Do
the grand. Hock in green glasses. Swell blowout. Lady this. Powdered bosom
pearls. The <i>&eacute;lite. Cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me</i>. They want
special dishes to pretend they&apos;re. Hermit with a platter of pulse keep down
the stings of the flesh. Know me come eat with me. Royal sturgeon. High sheriff,
Coffey, the butcher, right to venisons of the forest from his ex. Send him back
the half of a cow. Spread I saw down in the Master of the Rolls&apos; kitchen
area. Whitehatted <i>chef</i> like a rabbi. Combustible duck. Curly cabbage
<i>&agrave; la duchesse de Parme</i>. Just as well to write it on the bill of
fare so you can know what you&apos;ve eaten. Too many drugs spoil the broth. I
know it myself. Dosing it with Edwards&apos; desiccated soup. Geese stuffed
silly for them. Lobsters boiled alive. Do ptake some ptarmigan. Wouldn&apos;t
mind being a waiter in a swell hotel. Tips, evening dress, halfnaked ladies. May
I tempt you to a little more filleted lemon sole, miss Dubedat? Yes, do bedad.
And she did bedad. Huguenot name I expect that. A miss Dubedat lived in Killiney
I remember. <i>Du de la</i>, French. Still it&apos;s the same fish perhaps old
Micky Hanlon of Moore street ripped the guts out of making money hand over fist,
finger in fishes&apos; gills, can&apos;t write his name on a cheque, think he
was painting the landscape with his mouth twisted. Moooikill A Aitcha Ha.
Ignorant as a kish of brogues, worth fifty thousand pounds.</p>
<p> Stuck on the pane two flies buzzed, stuck.</p>
<p> Glowing wine on his palate lingered swallowed. Crushing in the winepress
grapes of Burgundy. Sun&apos;s heat it is. Seems to a secret touch telling me
memory. Touched his sense moistened remembered. Hidden under wild ferns on Howth below us bay sleeping: sky. No sound.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 196}</font>
<br> The sky. The bay purple by the Lion&apos;s head. Green by Drumleck.
Yellowgreen towards Sutton. Fields of undersea, the lines faint brown in grass,
buried cities. Pillowed on my coat she had her hair, earwigs in the heather
scrub my hand under her nape, you&apos;ll toss me all. O wonder! Coolsoft with
ointments her hand touched me, caressed: her eyes upon me did not turn away.
Ravished over her I lay, full lips full open, kissed her mouth. Yum. Softly she
gave me in my mouth the seedcake warm and chewed. Mawkish pulp her mouth had
mumbled sweet and sour with spittle. Joy: I ate it: joy. Young life, her lips
that gave me pouting. Soft warm sticky gumjelly lips. Flowers her eyes were, take me, willing eyes.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 168}</font>
<br> Pebbles fell. She lay still. A goat. No-one. High on Ben Howth
rhododendrons a nannygoat walking surefooted, dropping currants. Screened under
ferns she laughed warmfolded. Wildly I lay on her, kissed her: eyes, her lips,
her stretched neck beating, woman&apos;s breasts full in her blouse of
nun&apos;s veiling, fat nipples upright. Hot I tongued her. She kissed me. I was
kissed. All yielding she tossed my hair. Kissed, she kissed me.</p>
<p> Me. And me now.</p>
<p> Stuck, the flies buzzed.</p>
<p> His downcast eyes followed the silent veining of the oaken slab. Beauty: it
curves: curves are beauty. Shapely goddesses, Venus, Juno: curves the world
admires. Can see them library museum standing in the round hall, naked
goddesses. Aids to digestion. They don&apos;t care what man looks. All to see.
Never speaking. I mean to say to fellows like Flynn. Suppose she did Pygmalion
and Galatea what would she say first? Mortal! Put you in your proper place.
Quaffing nectar at mess with gods, golden dishes, all ambrosial. Not like a
tanner lunch we have, boiled mutton, carrots and turnips, bottle of Allsopp.
Nectar imagine it drinking electricity: gods&apos; food. Lovely forms of woman
sculped Junonian. Immortal lovely. And we stuffing food in one hole and out
behind: food, chyle, blood, dung, earth, food: have to feed it like stoking an
engine. They have no. Never looked. I&apos;ll look today. Keeper won&apos;t see.
Bend down let something fall see if she.</p>
<p> Dribbling a quiet message from his bladder came to go to do not
<br><font color="green">{u21, 197}</font>
<br> to do there to do. A man and ready he drained his glass to the lees and
walked, to men too they gave themselves, manly conscious, lay with men lovers, a youth enjoyed her, to the yard.</p>
<p> When the sound of his boots had ceased Davy Byrne said from his book:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What is this he is? Isn&apos;t he in the insurance line?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He&apos;s out of that long ago, Nosey Flynn said. He does canvassing for the <i>Freeman</i>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I know him well to see, Davy Byrne said. Is he in trouble?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Trouble? Nosey Flynn said. Not that I heard of. Why?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I noticed he was in mourning.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Was he? Nosey Flynn said. So he was, faith. I asked him
how was all at home. You&apos;re right, by God. So he was.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I never broach the subject, Davy Byrne said humanely, if I
see a gentleman is in trouble that way. It only brings it up fresh in their minds.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It&apos;s not the wife anyhow, Nosey Flynn said. I met him the day before
<br><font color="green">{u22, 169}</font>
<br> yesterday and he coming out of that Irish farm dairy John Wyse Nolan&apos;s
wife has in Henry street with a jar of cream in his hand taking it home to his
better half. She&apos;s well nourished, I tell you. Plovers on toast.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And is he doing for the <i>Freeman</i>? Davy Byrne said.</p>
<p> Nosey Flynn pursed his lips.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He doesn&apos;t buy cream on the ads he picks up. You can make bacon of that.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; How so? Davy Byrne asked, coming from his book.</p>
<p> Nosey Flynn made swift passes in the air with juggling fingers. He winked.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He&apos;s in the craft, he said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Do you tell me so? Davy Byrne said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Very much so, Nosey Flynn said. Ancient free and accepted
order. Light, life and love, by God. They give him a leg up. I was told that by
a &mdash; well, I won&apos;t say who.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Is that a fact?
<br><font color="green">{u21, 198}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O, it&apos;s a fine order, Nosey Flynn said. They stick to
you when you&apos;re down. I know a fellow was trying to get into it, but
they&apos;re as close as damn it. By God they did right to keep the women out of it.</p>
<p> Davy Byrne smiledyawnednodded all in one:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Iiiiiichaaaaaaach!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There was one woman, Nosey Flynn said, hid herself in a
clock to find out what they do be doing. But be damned but they smelt her out
and swore her in on the spot a master mason. That was one of the Saint Legers of Doneraile.</p>
<p> Davy Byrne, sated after his yawn, said with tearwashed eyes:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And is that a fact? Decent quiet man he is. I often saw
him in here and I never once saw him &mdash; you know, over the line.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; God Almighty couldn&apos;t make him drunk, Nosey Flynn
said firmly. Slips off when the fun gets too hot. Didn&apos;t you see him look
at his watch? Ah, you weren&apos;t there. If you ask him to have a drink first
thing he does he outs with the watch to see what he ought to imbibe. Declare to God he does.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There are some like that, Davy Byrne said. He&apos;s a safe man, I&apos;d say.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He&apos;s not too bad, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling it up.
He has been known to put his hand down too to help a fellow. Give the devil his
due. O, Bloom has his good points. But there&apos;s one thing he&apos;ll never do.</p>
<p> His hand scrawled a dry pen signature beside his grog.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I know, Davy Byrne said.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 170}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Nothing in black and white, Nosey Flynn said.</p>
<p> Paddy Leonard and Bantam Lyons came in. Tom Rochford followed, a plaining hand on his claret waistcoat.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Day, Mr Byrne.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Day, gentlemen.</p>
<p> They paused at the counter.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who&apos;s standing? Paddy Leonard asked.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I&apos;m sitting anyhow, Nosey Flynn answered.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Well, what&apos;ll it be? Paddy Leonard asked.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I&apos;ll take a stone ginger, Bantam Lyons said.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 199}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; How much? Paddy Leonard cried. Since when, for God&apos; sake? What&apos;s yours, Tom?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; How is the main drainage? Nosey Flynn asked, sipping.</p>
<p> For answer Tom Rochford pressed his hand to his breastbone and hiccupped.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Would I trouble you for a glass of fresh water, Mr Byrne? he said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Certainly, sir.</p>
<p> Paddy Leonard eyed his alemates.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Lord love a duck, he said, look at what I&apos;m standing
drinks to! Cold water and gingerpop! Two fellows that would suck whisky off a
sore leg. He has some bloody horse up his sleeve for the Gold cup. A dead snip.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Zinfandel is it? Nosey Flynn asked.</p>
<p> Tom Rochford spilt powder from a twisted paper into the water set before him.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That cursed dyspepsia, he said before drinking.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Breadsoda is very good, Davy Byrne said.</p>
<p> Tom Rochford nodded and drank.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Is it Zinfandel?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Say nothing, Bantam Lyons winked. I&apos;m going to plunge five bob on my own.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Tell us if you&apos;re worth your salt and be damned to
you, Paddy Leonard said. Who gave it to you?</p>
<p> Mr Bloom on his way out raised three fingers in greeting.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; So long, Nosey Flynn said.</p>
<p> The others turned.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That&apos;s the man now that gave it to me, Bantam Lyons whispered.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 171}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Prrwht! Paddy Leonard said with scorn. Mr Byrne, sir,
we&apos;ll take two of your small Jamesons after that and a&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Stone ginger, Davy Byrne added civilly.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ay, Paddy Leonard said. A suckingbottle for the baby.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom walked towards Dawson street, his tongue brushing his teeth smooth.
Something green it would have to be: spinach say. Then with those R&ouml;ntgen rays searchlight you could.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 200}</font> </p>
<p> At Duke lane a ravenous terrier choked up a sick knuckly cud on the
cobblestones and lapped it with new zest. Surfeit. Returned with thanks having
fully digested the contents. First sweet then savoury. Mr Bloom coasted warily.
Ruminants. His second course. Their upper jaw they move. Wonder if Tom Rochford
will do anything with that invention of his. Wasting time explaining it to
Flynn&apos;s mouth. Lean people long mouths. Ought to be a hall or a place where
inventors could go in and invent free. Course then you&apos;d have all the cranks pestering.</p>
<p> He hummed, prolonging in solemn echo, the closes of the bars:</p>
<p class="diset">&mdash; <i>Don Giovanni, a cenar teco
<br> M&apos;invitasti.</i></p>
<p> Feel better. Burgundy. Good pick me up. Who distilled first? Some chap in
the blues. Dutch courage. That <i>Kilkenny People</i> in the national library now I must.</p>
<p> Bare clean closestools, waiting, in the window of William Miller, plumber,
turned back his thoughts. They could: and watch it all the way down, swallow a
pin sometimes come out of the ribs years after, tour round the body, changing
biliary duct spleen squirting liver gastric juice coils of intestines like
pipes. But the poor buffer would have to stand all the time with his insides entrails on show. Science.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>A cenar teco.</i></p>
<p> What does that <i>teco</i> mean? Tonight perhaps.</p>
<p class="diset">&mdash; <i>Don Giovanni, thou hast me invited</i>
<br> <i>To come to supper tonight,</i>
<br> <i>The rum the rumdum</i>.</p>
<p> Doesn&apos;t go properly.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 172}</font> </p>
<p> Keyes: two months if I get Nannetti to. That&apos;ll be two pounds ten,
about two pounds eight. Three Hynes owes me. Two eleven. Prescott&apos;s
dyeworks van over there. If I get Billy Prescott&apos;s ad. Two fifteen. Five guineas about. On the pig&apos;s back.</p>
<p> Could buy one of those silk petticoats for Molly, colour of her new garters.</p>
<p> Today. Today. Not think.</p>
<p> Tour the south then. What about English wateringplaces? Brighton,
<br><font color="green">{u21, 201}</font>
<br> Margate. Piers by moonlight. Her voice floating out. Those lovely seaside
girls. Against John Long&apos;s a drowsing loafer lounged in heavy thought,
gnawing a crusted knuckle. Handy man wants job. Small wages. Will eat anything.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom turned at Gray&apos;s confectioner&apos;s window of unbought tarts
and passed the reverend Thomas Connellan&apos;s bookstore. <i>Why I left the
church of Rome</i>. Bird&apos;s nest women run him. They say they used to give
pauper children soup to change to protestants in the time of the potato blight.
Society over the way papa went to for the conversion of poor jews. Same bait. Why we left the church of Rome.</p>
<p> A blind stripling stood tapping the curbstone with his slender cane. No tram in sight. Wants to cross.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Do you want to cross? Mr Bloom asked.</p>
<p> The blind stripling did not answer. His wallface frowned weakly. He moved his head uncertainly.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You&apos;re in Dawson street, Mr Bloom said. Molesworth
street is opposite. Do you want to cross? There&apos;s nothing in the way.</p>
<p> The cane moved out trembling to the left. Mr Bloom&apos;s eye followed its
line and saw again the dyeworks&apos; van drawn up before Drago&apos;s. Where I
saw his brillantined hair just when I was. Horse drooping. Driver in John
Long&apos;s. Slaking his
<font color="red"><sup><small>|12</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">drouht</span></span>
<font color="black">drouth</font><font color="red"><sup><small>12|</small></sup></font>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There&apos;s a van there, Mr Bloom said, but it&apos;s not
moving. I&apos;ll see you across. Do you want to go to Molesworth street?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, the stripling answered. South Frederick street.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Come, Mr Bloom said.</p>
<p> He touched the thin elbow gently: then took the limp seeing hand to guide it forward.</p>
<p> Say something to him. Better not do the condescending. They mistrust what you tell them. Pass a common remark.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The rain kept off.</p>
<p> No answer.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 173}</font> </p>
<p> Stains on his coat. Slobbers his food, I suppose. Tastes all different for
him. Have to be spoonfed first. Like a child&apos;s hand his hand. Like
Milly&apos;s was. Sensitive. Sizing me up I daresay from my hand. Wonder if
<br><font color="green">{u21, 202}</font>
<br> he has a name. Van. Keep his cane clear of the horse&apos;s legs: tired
drudge get his doze. That&apos;s right. Clear. Behind a bull: in front of a horse.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Thanks, sir.</p>
<p> Knows I&apos;m a man. Voice.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Right now? First turn to the left.</p>
<p> The blind stripling tapped the curbstone and went on his way, drawing his cane back, feeling again.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom walked behind the eyeless feet, a flatcut suit of herringbone
tweed. Poor young fellow! How on earth did he know that van was there? Must have
felt it. See things in their foreheads perhaps. Kind of sense of volume. Weight
or size of it, something blacker than the dark. Wonder would he feel it if
something was removed. Feel a gap. Queer idea of Dublin he must have, tapping
his way round by the stones. Could he walk in a beeline if he hadn&apos;t that
cane? Bloodless pious face like a fellow going in to be a priest.</p>
<p> Penrose! That was that chap&apos;s name.</p>
<p> Look at all the things they can learn to do. Read with their fingers. Tune
pianos. Or we are surprised they have any brains. Why we think a deformed person
or a hunchback clever if he says something we might say. Of course the other
senses are more. Embroider. Plait baskets. People ought to help. Work basket I
could buy Molly&apos;s birthday. Hates sewing. Might take an objection. Dark men they call them.</p>
<p> Sense of smell must be stronger too. Smells on all sides bunched together.
Each street different smell. Each person too. Then the spring, the summer:
smells. Tastes. They say you can&apos;t taste wines with your eyes shut or a
cold in the head. Also smoke in the dark they say get no pleasure.</p>
<p> And with a woman, for instance. More shameless not seeing. That girl passing
the Stewart institution, head in the air. Look at me. I have them all on. Must
be strange not to see her. Kind of a form in his mind&apos;s eye. The voice,
temperature when he touches her with fingers must almost see the lines, the
curves. His hands on her hair, for instance. Say it was black for instance.
Good. We call it black. Then passing over her white skin. Different feel perhaps. Feeling of white.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 203}</font> </p>
<p> Postoffice. Must answer. Fag today. Send her a postal order two shillings,
half a crown. Accept my little present. Stationer&apos;s just here too. Wait. Think over it.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 174}</font> </p>
<p> With a gentle finger he felt ever so slowly the hair combed back above his
ears. Again. Fibres of fine fine straw. Then gently his finger felt the skin of
his right cheek. Downy hair there too. Not smooth enough. The belly is the
smoothest. No-one about. There he goes into Frederick street. Perhaps to
Levenston&apos;s dancing academy piano. Might be settling my braces.</p>
<p> Walking by Doran&apos;s publichouse he slid his hand between waistcoat and
trousers and, pulling aside his shirt gently, felt a slack fold of his belly.
But I know it&apos;s whitey yellow. Want to try in the dark to see.</p>
<p> He withdrew his hand and pulled his dress to.</p>
<p> Poor fellow! Quite a boy. Terrible. Really terrible. What dreams would he
have, not seeing. Life a dream for him. Where is the justice being born that
way. All those women and children excursion beanfeast burned and drowned in New
York. Holocaust. Karma they call that transmigration for sins you did in a past
life the reincarnation met him pikehoses. Dear, dear, dear. Pity of course: but
somehow you can&apos;t cotton on to them someway.</p>
<p> Sir Frederick Falkiner going into the freemasons&apos; hall. Solemn as Troy.
After his good lunch in Earlsfort terrace. Old legal cronies cracking a magnum.
Tales of the bench and assizes and annals of the bluecoat school. I sentenced
him to ten years. I suppose he&apos;d turn up his nose at that stuff I drank.
Vintage wine for them, the year marked on a dusty bottle. Has his own ideas of
justice in the recorder&apos;s court. Wellmeaning old man. Police chargesheets
crammed with cases get their percentage manufacturing crime. Sends them to the
rightabout. The devil on moneylenders. Gave Reuben J a great strawcalling. Now
he&apos;s really what they call a dirty jew. Power those judges have. Crusty old
topers in wigs. Bear with a sore paw. And may the Lord have mercy on your soul.</p>
<p> Hello, placard. Mirus bazaar. His Excellency the lord lieutenant. Sixteenth.
Today it is. In aid of funds for Mercer&apos;s hospital. The
<br><font color="green">{u21, 204}</font>
<br> <i>Messiah</i> was first given for that. Yes. Handel. What about going out
there. Ballsbridge. Drop in on Keyes. No use sticking to him like a leech. Wear
out my welcome. Sure to know someone on the gate.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom came to Kildare street. First I must. Library.</p>
<p> Straw hat in sunlight. Tan shoes. Turnedup trousers. It is. It is.</p>
<p> His heart quopped softly. To the right. Museum. Goddesses. He swerved to the right.</p>
<p> Is it? Almost certain. Won&apos;t look. Wine in my face. Why did I? Too
heady. Yes, it is. The walk. Not see. Not see. Get on.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 175}</font> </p>
<p> Making for the museum gate with long windy strides he lifted his eyes.
Handsome building. Sir Thomas Deane designed. Not following me?</p>
<p> Didn&apos;t see me perhaps. Light in his eyes.</p>
<p> The flutter of his breath came forth in short sighs. Quick. Cold statues: quiet there. Safe in a minute.</p>
<p> No, didn&apos;t see me. After two. Just at the gate.</p>
<p> My heart!</p>
<p> His eyes beating looked steadfastly at cream curves of stone. Sir Thomas Deane was the Greek architecture.</p>
<p> Look for something I.</p>
<p> His hasty hand went quick into a pocket, took out, read unfolded Agendath Netaim. Where did I?</p>
<p> Busy looking for.</p>
<p> He thrust back quickly Agendath.</p>
<p> Afternoon she said.</p>
<p> I am looking for that. Yes, that. Try all pockets. Handker. <i>Freeman</i>.
Where did I? Ah, yes. Trousers. Purse. Potato. Where did I?</p>
<p> Hurry. Walk quietly. Moment more. My heart.</p>
<p> His hand looking for the where did I put found in his hip pocket soap lotion
have to call tepid paper stuck. Ah, soap there I yes. Gate.</p>
<p> Safe!</p>  </main>
