<p class="di">&mdash; There must be a new moon out, she said. He&apos;s always
bad then. Do you know what he did last night?</p>
<p> Her hand ceased to rummage. Her eyes fixed themselves on him, wide in alarm, yet smiling.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What? Mr Bloom asked.</p>
<p> Let her speak. Look straight in her eyes. I believe you. Trust me.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Woke me up in the night, she said. Dream he had, a nightmare.</p>
<p> Indiges.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Said the ace of spades was walking up the stairs.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The ace of spades! Mr Bloom said.</p>
<p> She took a folded postcard from her handbag.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Read that, she said. He got it this morning.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What is it? Mr Bloom asked, taking the card. U.&nbsp;P.?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; U. P p:<a target="foot" id="fhh0057">&ordm;</a> up, she
said. Someone taking a rise out of him. It&apos;s a great shame for them whoever he is.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Indeed it is, Mr Bloom said.</p>
<p> She took back the card, sighing.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And now he&apos;s going round to Mr Menton&apos;s office.
He&apos;s going to take an action for ten thousand pounds, he says.</p>
<p> She folded the card into her untidy bag and snapped the catch.</p>
<p> Same blue serge dress she had two years ago, the nap bleaching. Seen its
best days. Wispish hair over her ears. And that dowdy toque: three old grapes to
take the harm out of it.

<p class="di">&mdash; Do you ever see anything of Mrs Beaufoy? Mr Bloom asked.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Mina Purefoy? she said.</p>
<p> Philip Beaufoy I was thinking. Playgoers&apos; Club. Matcham often thinks of
the masterstroke. Did I pull the chain? Yes. The last act.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I just called to ask on the way in is she over it.
She&apos;s in the lying-in hospital in Holles street. Dr Horne got her in. She&apos;s three days bad now.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O, Mr Bloom said. I&apos;m sorry to hear that.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, Mrs Breen said. And a houseful of kids at home.
It&apos;s a very stiff birth, the nurse told me.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O, Mr Bloom said.</p>
<p> His heavy pitying gaze absorbed her news. His tongue clacked in compassion. Dth! Dth!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I&apos;m sorry to hear that, he said. Poor thing! Three days! That&apos;s terrible for her.</p>
<p> Mrs Breen nodded.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; She was taken bad on the Tuesday&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> Mr Bloom touched her funnybone gently, warning her:<a target="foot" id="fhh0061">&ordm;</a></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Mind! Let this man pass.</p>
<p> A bony form strode along the curbstone from the river staring with a rapt
gaze into the sunlight through a
heavystringed<a target="foot" id="fhh0062">&ordm;</a> glass. Tight as a
skullpiece a tiny hat gripped his head. From his arm a folded dustcoat, a stick
and an umbrella dangled to his stride.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Watch him, Mr Bloom said. He always walks outside the lampposts. Watch!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who is he if it&apos;s a fair
question?<a target="foot" id="fhh0063">&ordm;</a> Mrs Breen asked. Is he dotty?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; His name is Cashel Boyle O&apos;Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall
Farrell, Mr Bloom said smiling. Watch!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He has enough of them, she said. Denis will be like that one of these days.</p>
<p> She broke off suddenly.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There he is, she said. I must go after him.
Goodbye<a target="foot" id="fhh0064">&ordm;</a>. Remember me to Molly, won&apos;t you?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I will, Mr Bloom said. </p>
<p> He watched her dodge through passers towards the shopfronts. Denis Breen in
skimpy frockcoat and blue canvas shoes shuffled out of
Harrison&apos;s<a target="foot" id="fhh0065">&ordm;</a> hugging two heavy tomes
to his ribs. <a name="un4009aa" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4009aa">Blown
in from the bay.</a> Like old times. He suffered her to overtake him without
surprise and thrust his dull grey beard towards her, his loose jaw wagging as he spoke earnestly.</p>
<p> Meshuggah. Off his chump.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom walked on again easily, seeing ahead of him in sunlight the tight
skullpiece, the dangling
stickumbrelladustcoat<a target="foot" id="fhh0066">&ordm;</a>. Going the two
days. Watch him! Out he goes again.

<p> When the sound of his boots had ceased Davy Byrne said from his book:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What is this he is? Isn&apos;t he in the insurance line? </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He&apos;s out of that long ago, Nosey Flynn said. He does canvassing for the <i>Freeman</i>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I know him well to see, Davy Byrne said. Is he in trouble?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Trouble? Nosey Flynn said. Not that I heard of. Why?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I noticed he was in mourning.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Was he? Nosey Flynn said. So he was, faith. I asked him
how was all at home. You&apos;re right, by God. So he was.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I never broach the subject, Davy Byrne said humanely, if I
see a gentleman is in trouble that way. It only brings it up fresh in their minds.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It&apos;s not the wife anyhow, Nosey Flynn said. I met him
the day before yesterday and he coming out of that Irish farm dairy John Wyse
Nolan&apos;s wife has in Henry street with a jar of cream in his hand taking it
home to his better half. She&apos;s
<a name="un1032ej" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1032ej">well nourished</a>, I tell you. Plovers on toast.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And is he doing for the <i>Freeman</i>? Davy Byrne said.</p>
<p> Nosey Flynn pursed his lips.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He doesn&apos;t buy cream on the ads he picks up. You can
<a name="un4009cv" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4009cv">make bacon of that</a>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; How so? Davy Byrne asked, coming from his book.</p>
<p> Nosey Flynn made swift passes in the air with juggling fingers. He winked.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He&apos;s in the craft, he said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Do you tell me so? Davy Byrne said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Very much so, Nosey Flynn said. Ancient free and accepted
order. He&apos;s an excellent brother. Light, life and love, by God. They give
him a leg up. I was told that by a &mdash;<a target="foot" id="fhh0207">&ordm;</a> well, I won&apos;t say who.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Is that a fact?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O, it&apos;s a fine order, Nosey Flynn said. They stick to
you when you&apos;re down. I know a fellow was trying to get into it. But
they&apos;re as close as damn it. By God they did right to keep the women out of it.</p>
<p> Davy Byrne smiledyawnednodded all in one:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Iiiiiichaaaaaaach!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There was one woman, Nosey Flynn said, hid herself in a
clock to find out what they do be doing. But be damned but they smelt her out
and swore her in on the spot a master mason. That was one of the saint Legers of Doneraile.</p>
<p> Davy Byrne, sated after his yawn, said with tearwashed eyes:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And is that a fact? Decent quiet man he is. I often saw
him in here and I never once saw him &mdash;<a target="foot" id="fhh0208">&ordm;</a> you know, over the line.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; God Almighty couldn&apos;t make him drunk, Nosey Flynn
said firmly. Slips off when the fun gets too hot. Didn&apos;t you see him look
at his watch? Ah, you weren&apos;t there. If you ask him to have a drink first
thing he does he outs with the watch to see what he ought to imbibe. Declare to God he does. </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There are some like that, Davy Byrne said. He&apos;s a safe man, I&apos;d say.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He&apos;s not too bad, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling it up.
He&apos;s been known to put his hand down too to help a fellow.
<a name="un3021t" href="../../ff/unbs/un3all.htm#un3021t">Give the devil his
due</a>. O, Bloom has his good points. But there&apos;s one thing he&apos;ll never do.</p>
<p> His hand scrawled a dry pen signature beside his grog.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I know, Davy Byrne said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Nothing in black and white, Nosey Flynn said.</p>
<p> Paddy Leonard and Bantam Lyons came in. Tom Rochford followed frowning, a plaining hand on his claret waistcoat.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Day, Mr Byrne.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Day, gentlemen.</p>
<p> They paused at the counter.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who&apos;s standing? Paddy Leonard asked.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I&apos;m sitting anyhow, Nosey Flynn answered.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Well, what&apos;ll it be? Paddy Leonard asked.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I&apos;ll take a stone ginger, Bantam Lyons said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; How much? Paddy Leonard cried. Since when, for God&apos; sake? What&apos;s yours, Tom?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; How is the main drainage? Nosey Flynn asked, sipping.</p>
<p> For answer Tom Rochford pressed his hand to his breastbone and hiccupped.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Would I trouble you for a glass of fresh water, Mr Byrne? he said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Certainly, sir.</p>
<p> Paddy Leonard eyed his alemates.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Lord love a duck, he said. Look at what I&apos;m standing
drinks to! Cold water and gingerpop! Two fellows that would suck whisky off a
sore leg. He has some bloody horse up his sleeve for the Gold cup. A dead snip.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Zinfandel is it? Nosey Flynn asked.</p>
<p> Tom Rochford spilt powder from a twisted paper into the water set before him.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That cursed dyspepsia, he said before drinking.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Breadsoda is very good, Davy Byrne said.</p>
<p> Tom Rochford nodded and drank.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Is it Zinfandel<a target="foot" id="fhh0209">&ordm;</a>?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Say nothing! Bantam Lyons winked. I&apos;m going to plunge five bob on my own.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Tell us if you&apos;re
<a name="un4008cq" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4008cq">worth your salt</a>
and be damned to you, Paddy Leonard said. Who gave it to you?</p>
<p> Mr Bloom on his way out raised three fingers in greeting.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; So long! Nosey Flynn said. </p>
<p> The others turned.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That&apos;s the man now that gave it to me, Bantam Lyons whispered.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Prrwht! Paddy Leonard said with scorn. Mr Byrne, sir,
we&apos;ll take two of your small Jamesons after that and a&nbsp;&hellip;.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Stone ginger, Davy Byrne added civilly.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ay, Paddy Leonard said. A suckingbottle for the baby.</p>

<p> A blind stripling stood tapping the curbstone with his slender cane. No tram in sight. Wants to cross.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Do you want to cross? Mr Bloom asked.</p>
<p> The blind stripling did not answer. His

<p class="di">&mdash; You&apos;re in Dawson street, Mr Bloom said. Molesworth
street is opposite. Do you want to cross? There&apos;s nothing in the way.</p>
<p> The cane moved out trembling to the left. Mr Bloom&apos;s eye followed its
line and saw again the dyeworks&apos; van drawn up before Drago&apos;s. Where I
saw his

hair just when I was. Horse drooping. Driver in John Long&apos;s. Slaking his drouth.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There&apos;s a van there, Mr Bloom said, but it&apos;s not
moving. I&apos;ll see you across. Do you want to go to Molesworth street?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, the stripling answered. South Frederick street.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Come, Mr Bloom said.</p>
<p> He touched the thin elbow gently: then took the limp seeing hand to guide it forward.</p>

<p> The blind stripling tapped the curbstone and went on his way, drawing his cane back, feeling again.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom walked behind the

flatcut suit of
<a name="un4051bm" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4051bm">herringbone

have felt it. See things in their forehead perhaps: kind of sense of volume.
Weight or size of it, something blacker than the dark.
Wonder<a target="foot" id="fhh0227">&ordm;</a> would he feel it if something was
removed. Feel a gap. Queer idea of Dublin he must have, tapping his way round by
the stones. Could he walk in a beeline if he hadn&apos;t that cane? Bloodless
pious face like a fellow going in to be a priest.</p>
<p> Penrose! That was that chap&apos;s name.</p>

head</a>. Also smoke in the dark they say get no pleasure.</p>
<p> And with a woman, for instance. More shameless not seeing.
<a name="un6008ab" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6008ab">That girl
passing</a> the Stewart institution, head in the air. Look at me. I have them
all on. Must be strange not to see her. Kind of a form in his mind&apos;s eye.
The voice,<a target="foot" id="fhh0229">&ordm;</a>
temperatures:<a target="foot" id="fhh0230">&ordm;</a> when he touches her with
his fingers must almost see the lines, the curves. His hands on her hair, for
instance. Say it was black, for instance. Good. We call it black. Then passing
over her white skin. Different feel perhaps. Feeling of white.</p>
<p> Postoffice. Must answer. Fag today. Send her a postal order two shillings,
half a crown. Accept my little present. Stationer&apos;s just here too. Wait. Think over it.</p>
<p> With a gentle finger he felt ever so slowly the hair combed back above his
ears. Again. Fibres of fine fine straw. Then gently his finger felt the skin of
his right cheek. Downy hair there too. Not smooth enough. The belly is the
smoothest. No-one about. There he goes into Frederick street. Perhaps to
Levenston&apos;s dancing academy piano. Might be settling my braces.</p>
<p> Walking by Doran&apos;s publichouse<a target="foot" id="fhh0231">&ordm;</a>
he slid his hand between his waistcoat and trousers and, pulling aside his shirt
gently, felt a slack fold of his belly. But I know it&apos;s whitey
yellow<a target="foot" id="fhh0232">&ordm;</a>. Want to try in the dark to see.</p>
<p> He withdrew his hand and pulled his dress to.</p>
<p> Poor fellow! Quite a boy. Terrible. Really terrible.

Pity, of course: but somehow you can&apos;t cotton on to them someway.</p>

<p> Mr Bloom came to Kildare street. First I must. Library.</p>
<p> Straw hat in sunlight. Tan shoes. Turnedup trousers. It is. It is.</p>
<p> His heart quopped softly. To the right. Museum. Goddesses. He swerved to the right.</p>
<p> Is it? Almost certain. Won&apos;t look. Wine in my face. Why did I? Too
<a name="un4051aa" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4051aa">heady</a>. Yes, it
is. The walk. Not see. Not see. Not see. Get on.</p>
<p> Making for the museum gate with long windy steps he lifted his eyes.
Handsome building. Sir Thomas Deane designed. Not following me?</p>
<p> Didn&apos;t see me perhaps. Light in his eyes.</p>
<p> The flutter of his breath came forth in short sighs. Quick. Cold statues: quiet there. Safe in a minute.</p>
<p> No. Didn&apos;t see me. After two. Just at the gate.</p>
<p> My heart!</p>
<p> His eyes beating looked steadfastly at cream curves of stone. Sir Thomas Deane was the Greek architecture.</p>
<p> Look for something I.</p>
<p> His hasty hand went quick into a pocket, took out, read unfolded Agendath Netaim. Where did I?</p>
<p> Busy looking. </p>
<p> He thrust back quick Agendath.</p>
<p> Afternoon she said.</p>
<p> I am looking for that. Yes, that. Try all pockets. Handker. <i>Freeman</i>.
