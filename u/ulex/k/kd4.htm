<p> Urbane, to comfort them, the quaker librarian purred:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And we have, have we not, those priceless pages of
<i>Wilhelm
Meister</i><font color="red"><sup><small>(4</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span><font color="black">?</font><font color="red"><sup><small>4)</small></sup></font>
A great poet on a great brother poet. A hesitating soul taking arms against a
sea of troubles, torn by conflicting doubts, as one sees in real life.</p>
<p> He came a step a sinkapace forward on neatsleather creaking and a step backward a sinkapace on the solemn floor.</p>
<p> A noiseless attendant, setting open the door but slightly, made him a noiseless beck.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Directly, said he, creaking to go, albeit lingering. The
beautiful ineffectual dreamer who comes to grief against hard facts. One always
feels that Goethe&apos;s judgments are so true. True in the larger analysis.</p>
<p> Twicreakingly analysis he corantoed off. Bald, most zealous by the door he
gave his large ear all to the attendant&apos;s words: heard them: and was gone.</p>
<p> Two left.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Monsieur de la Palice, Stephen sneered, was alive fifteen minutes before his death.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Have you found those six brave medicals, John Eglinton

<p> Folly. Persist.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Our young Irish bards, John Eglinton censured, have yet to
create a figure which the world will set beside Saxon Shakespeare&apos;s Hamlet
though I admire him, as old Ben did, on this side idolatry.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; All these questions are purely academic, Russell oracled
out of his shadow. I mean, whether Hamlet is Shakespeare or James I or Essex.
Clergyman&apos;s discussions of the historicity of Jesus. Art has to reveal to
us ideas, formless spiritual essences. The supreme question about a work of art
is out of how deep a life does it spring. The painting of Gustave Moreau is the
painting of ideas. The deepest poetry of Shelley, the words of Hamlet bring our
mind into contact with the eternal wisdom, Plato&apos;s world of ideas. All the
rest is the speculation of schoolboys for schoolboys.

<p class="di">&mdash; The schoolmen were schoolboys first, Stephen said
superpolitely. Aristotle was once Plato&apos;s schoolboy.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And has remained so, one should hope, John Eglinton
sedately said. One can see him, a model schoolboy with his diploma under his arm.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 178}</font> </p>
<p> He laughed again at the now smiling bearded face.</p>
<p> Formless spiritual. Father, Son and Holy Breath. This verily is that. I am

<font color="black"><i>Pfuiteufel!</i></font><font color="red"><sup><small>4|</small></sup></font>
You naughtn&apos;t to look, missus, so you naughtn&apos;t when a lady&apos;s ashowing of her elemental.</p>
<p> Mr Best entered, tall, young, mild, light. He bore in his hand with grace a notebook, new, large, clean, bright.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That model schoolboy, Stephen said, would find
Hamlet&apos;s musings about the afterlife of his princely soul, the improbable,
insignificant and undramatic monologue, as shallow as Plato&apos;s.</p>
<p> John Eglinton, frowning, said, waxing wroth:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Upon my word it makes my blood boil to hear anyone compare Aristotle with Plato.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Which of the two, Stephen asked, would have banished me from his commonwealth?</p>
<p> Unsheathe your dagger definitions. Streams of tendency and eons they worship. God: noise

<br> in the street: very peripatetic. Space: what you damn well have to see.
Through spaces smaller than red globules of man&apos;s blood they creepycrawl
after Blake&apos;s buttocks into eternity of which this vegetable world is but a
shadow. Hold to the now, the here, through which all future plunges to the past.</p>
<p> Mr Best came forward, amiable, towards his colleague.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Haines is gone, he said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Is he?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I was showing him Jubainville&apos;s book. He&apos;s quite
enthusiastic, don&apos;t you know, about Hyde&apos;s <i>Lovesongs of
Connacht.</i> I couldn&apos;t bring him in to hear the discussion. He&apos;s gone to Gill&apos;s to buy it.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 179}</font> </p>
<p class="set"><i>Bound thee forth, my booklet, quick</i>
<br> <i>To greet the callous public.</i>
<br> <i>Writ, I ween, &apos;twas not my wish</i>
<br> <i>In lean unlovely English.</i></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The peatsmoke is going to his head, John Eglinton opined.</p>
<p> We feel in England. Penitent thief. Gone. I smoked his baccy. Green
twinkling stone. An emerald set in the ring of the sea.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; People do not know how dangerous lovesongs can be, the
auric egg of Russell warned occultly. The movements which work revolutions in
the world are born out of the dreams and visions in a peasant&apos;s heart on
the hillside. For them the earth is not an exploitable ground but the living
mother. The rarefied air of the academy and the arena produce the sixshilling
novel, the musichall song. France produces the finest flower of corruption in
Mallarm&eacute; but the desirable life is revealed only to the poor of heart,
the life of Homer&apos;s

<font color="black">Phaeacians<a target="foot" id="fkk0007">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>4)</small></sup></font>.</p>
<p> From these words Mr Best turned an unoffending face to Stephen.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Mallarm&eacute;, don&apos;t you know, he said, has written
those wonderful prose poems Stephen MacKenna used to read to me in Paris. The
one about <i>Hamlet</i>. He says: <i>il se prom&egrave;ne, lisant au livre de
lui-m&ecirc;me</i>, don&apos;t you know, <i>reading the book of himself</i>. He
describes <i>Hamlet</i> given in a French town, don&apos;t you know, a provincial town. They advertised it.</p>
<p> His free hand graciously wrote tiny signs in air.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 209}</font> </p>
<p class="center"><i>Hamlet</i></p>
<p class="center"><i>ou</i></p>
<p class="center"><i>Le Distrait</i></p>
<p class="center"><i>pi&egrave;ce de Shakespeare</i></p>
<p> He repeated to John Eglinton&apos;s newgathered frown:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>Pi&egrave;ce de Shakespeare</i>, don&apos;t you know.
It&apos;s so French, the French point of view. <i>Hamlet ou</i>&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The absentminded beggar, Stephen ended.</p>
<p> John Eglinton laughed.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, I suppose it would be, he said. Excellent people, no
doubt, but distressingly shortsighted in some matters.</p>
<p> Sumptuous and stagnant exaggeration of murder.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 180}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A deathsman of the soul Robert Greene called him, Stephen
said. Not for nothing was he a butcher&apos;s son, wielding the sledded poleaxe
and spitting in his palm. Nine lives are taken off for his father&apos;s one.
Our Father who art in purgatory. Khaki Hamlets don&apos;t hesitate to shoot. The

<p> Cranly, I his mute orderly, following battles from afar.</p>
<p class="set"><i>Whelps and dams of murderous foes whom none
<br> But we had spared</i>&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He will have it that Hamlet is a ghoststory, John Eglinton
said for Mr Best&apos;s behoof. Like the fat boy in Pickwick he wants to make our flesh creep.</p>
<p class="set"><i>List! List! O list!</i></p>
<p> My flesh hears him: creeping, hears.</p>
<p class="set"><i>If thou didst ever</i>&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What is a ghost? Stephen said with tingling energy. One who
<br><font color="green">{u21, 210}</font>
<br> has faded into impalpability through death, through absence, through change
of manners. Elizabethan London lay as far from Stratford as corrupt Paris lies
from virgin Dublin. Who is the ghost, returning to the world that has forgotten him? Who is king Hamlet?</p>
<p> John Eglinton shifted his spare body, leaning back to judge.</p>
<p> Lifted.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It is this hour of a June day, Stephen said, begging with
a swift glance their hearing. The flag is up on the playhouse by the bankside.
The bear Sackerson growls in the pit near it, Paris garden. Canvasclimbers who
sailed with Drake chew their sausages among the groundlings.</p>
<p> Local colour. Work in all you know. Make them accomplices.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Shakespeare has left the huguenot&apos;s house in Silver
street and walks by the swanmews along the riverbank. But he does not stay to
feed the pen chivying her game of cygnets towards the rushes. The swan of Avon has other thoughts.</p>
<p> Composition of place. Ignatius Loyola, make haste to help me!
<br><font color="green">{u22, 181}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The play begins. A player comes on under the shadow, clad
in the castoff mail of a court buck, a wellset man with a bass voice. It is the
ghost, king Hamlet, and the player is Shakespeare. He speaks the words to
Burbage, the young player who stands before him, calling him by a name:</p>
<p class="set"><i>Hamlet, I am thy father&apos;s spirit</i></p>
<p class="flush">bidding him list. To a son he speaks, the son of his soul, the
prince, young Hamlet and to the son of his body, Hamlet Shakespeare who has died
in Stratford that his namesake may live for ever.</p>
<p> Is it possible that that player Shakespeare, a ghost by absence, and in the
vesture of buried Denmark, a ghost by death, speaking his own words to his own
son&apos;s name (had Hamlet Shakespeare lived he would have been prince
Hamlet&apos;s twin) is it possible, I want to know,
<br><font color="green">{u21, 211}</font>
<br> or probable that he did not draw or foresee the logical conclusion of those
premises: you are the dispossessed son. I am the murdered father: your mother is
the guilty queen, Ann Shakespeare, born Hathaway?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; But this prying into the family life of a great man, Russell began impatiently.</p>
<p> Art thou there, truepenny?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Interesting only to the parish clerk. I mean, we have the
plays. I mean when we read the poetry of <i>King Lear</i> what is it to us how
the poet lived? As for living our servants can do that for us, Villiers de
l&apos;Isle said. Peeping and prying into greenroom gossip of the day, the
poet&apos;s drinking, the poet&apos;s debts. We have <i>King Lear</i>: and it is immortal.</p>
<p> Mr Best&apos;s face, appealed to, agreed.</p>
<p class="set"><i>Flow over them with your waves and with your waters, Mananaan,
<br> Mananaan MacLir</i>&nbsp;&hellip;.</p>
<p> By the way, that pound he lent you when you were hungry?</p>
<p> I wanted it.</p>
<p> Take thou this noble.</p>
<p> You spent most of it in Georgina Johnson&apos;s bed, clergyman&apos;s daughter.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 182}</font> </p>
<p> Do you intend to pay it back?</p>
<p> O, yes.</p>
<p> When? Now?</p>
<p> Well&nbsp;&hellip; no.</p>
<p> When, then?</p>
<p> I paid my way. I paid my way.</p>
<p> Steady on. He&apos;s from north of Boyne water. You owe it.</p>
<p> Wait. Five months. Molecules all change. I am other I now. Other I got pound.</p>

<p> But I, entelechy, form of forms, am I by memory under ever changing forms.

<p> A. E. I. O. U.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Do you mean to fly in the face of the tradition of three
centuries? John Eglinton&apos;s carping voice asked. Her ghost at least has been
laid for ever. She died, for literature at least, before she was born.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; She died, Stephen retorted, sixtyseven years after she was
born. She saw him into and out of the world. She took his first embraces. She
bore his children and she laid pennies on his eyes to keep his eyelids closed when he lay on his deathbed.</p>
<p> Mother&apos;s deathbed. Candle. The sheeted mirror. Who brought me into this
world lies there, bronzelidded, under few cheap flowers. <i>Liliata rutilantium</i>.</p>
<p> I wept alone.</p>
<p> John Eglinton looked in the tangled glowworm of his lamp.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The world believes that Shakespeare made a mistake, he
said, and got out of it as quickly and as best he could.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Bosh! Stephen said rudely. A man of genius makes no
mistakes. His errors are volitional and are the portals of discovery.</p>
<p> Portal of discovery opened to let in the quaker librarian, softcreakfooted, bald, eared and assiduous.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A shrew, John Eglinton said shrewdly, is not a useful
portal of discovery, one should imagine. What useful discovery did Socrates learn from Xanthippe?
<br><font color="green">{u22, 183}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Dialectic, Stephen answered: and from his mother how to
bring thought into the world. But neither the midwife&apos;s lore nor the
caudlelectures saved him from the archons of Sinn Fein and their naggin of hemlock.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; But Ann Hathaway? Mr Best&apos;s quiet voice said
forgetfully. Yes, we seem to be forgetting her as Shakespeare himself forgot her.</p>
<p> His look went from brooder&apos;s beard to carper&apos;s skull, to remind, to
<br><font color="green">{u21, 213}</font>
<br> chide them not unkindly, then to the baldpink lollard costard, guiltless though maligned.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He had a good groatsworth of wit, Stephen said, and no
truant memory. He carried a memory in his wallet as he trudged to Romeville
whistling <i>The girl I left behind me</i>. If the earthquake did not time it we
should know where to place poor Wat, sitting in his form, the studded bridle and
her blue windows. That memory, <i>Venus and Adonis</i>, lay in the bedchamber of
every light-of-love in London. Is Katharine the shrew illfavoured? Hortensio
calls her young and beautiful. Do you think the writer of <i>Antony and
Cleopatra</i>, a passionate pilgrim, had his eyes in the back of his head that
he chose the ugliest doxy in all Warwickshire to lie withal? Good: he left her
and gained the world of men. But his boywomen are the women of a boy. Their
life, thought, speech are lent them by males. He chose badly? He was chosen, it
seems to me. If others have their will Ann hath a way. By cock, she was to
blame. She put the comether on him, sweet and twentysix. The goddess who bends
over the boy Adonis is a boldfaced Stratford wench who tumbles in a cornfield a lover younger than herself.</p>
<p> And my turn? When?</p>
<p> Come!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ryefield, Mr Best said brightly, gladly, raising his new book, gladly, brightly.</p>
<p> He murmured then with blond delight for all:</p>
<p class="diset">&mdash; <i>Between the acres of the rye
<br> These pretty countryfolk would lie</i>.</p>
<p> Paris: the wellpleased pleaser.

<p> A tall figure in bearded homespun rose from
<font color="red"><sup><small>(4</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">its</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>4)</small></sup></font>
shadow and unveiled its cooperative watch.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I am afraid I am due at the <i>Homestead</i>.</p>
<p> Whither away? Exploitable ground.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Are you going, John Eglinton&apos;s eyebrows asked. Shall
we see you at Moore&apos;s tonight? Piper is coming.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 214}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Piper! Mr Best piped. Is Piper back?</p>
<p> Peter Piper pecked a peck of pick of peck of pickled pepper.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I don&apos;t know if I can. Thursday. We have our meeting. If I can get away in time.</p>
<p> Yogibogeybox in Dawson chambers. <i>Isis Unveiled</i>. Their Pali book we

<p class="set"><i>In quintessential triviality</i>
<br> <i>For years in this fleshcase a shesoul dwelt.</i></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; They say we are to have a literary surprise, the quaker
librarian said, friendly and earnest. Mr Russell, rumour has it, is gathering
together a sheaf of our younger poets&apos; verses. We are all looking forward anxiously.</p>
<p> Anxiously he glanced in the cone of lamplight where three faces, lighted, shone.</p>
<p> See this. Remember.</p>
<p> Stephen looked down on a wide headless caubeen, hung on his

over his knee. My casque and sword.</p>
<p> Listen.</p>
<p> Young Colum and Starkey. George Roberts is doing the commercial part.
Longworth will give it a good puff in the <i>Express</i>. O, will he? I liked
Colum&apos;s drover. Yes, I think he has that queer thing, genius. Do you think
he has genius really? Yeats admired his line: <i>As in wild earth a Grecian vase.</i> Did he?
<br><font color="green">{u22, 185}</font>
<br> I hope you&apos;ll be able to come tonight. Malachi
<br><font color="green">{u21, 215}</font>
<br> Mulligan is coming too. Moore asked him to bring Haines. Did you hear Miss
Mitchell&apos;s joke about Moore and Martyn? That Moore is Martyn&apos;s wild
oats? Awfully clever, isn&apos;t it? They remind one of don Quixote and Sancho
Panza. Our national epic has yet to be written. Moore is the man for it. A
knight of the rueful countenance here in Dublin. With a saffron kilt?
O&apos;Neill Russell? O, yes, he must speak the grand old tongue. And his
Dulcinea? James Stephens is doing some clever sketches. We are becoming important, it seems.</p>
<p> Cordelia. <i>Cordoglio</i>. Lir&apos;s loneliest daughter.</p>
<p> Now your best French polish.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Thank you very much, Mr Russell, Stephen said, rising. If
you will be so kind as to give the letter to Mr Norman&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O, yes. If he considers it important it will go in. We have so much correspondence.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I understand, Stephen said. Thank you.</p>
<p> The pigs&apos; paper. Bullockbefriending.</p>
<p> Synge has promised me an article for <i>Dana</i> too. Are we going to be
read? I feel we are. The Gaelic league wants something in Irish. I hope you will come round tonight. Bring Starkey.</p>
<p> Stephen sat down.</p>
<p> The quaker librarian came from the leavetakers. Blushing his mask said:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Mr Dedalus, your views are most illuminating.</p>
<p> He creaked to and fro, tiptoing up nearer heaven by the altitude of a
chopine, and, covered by the noise of outgoing, said low:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Is it your view, then, that she was not faithful to the poet?</p>
<p> Alarmed face asks me. Why did he come? Courtesy or an
<font color="red"><sup><small>(4</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">inner</span></span>
<font color="black">inward</font><font color="red"><sup><small>4)</small></sup></font> light?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Where there is a reconciliation, Stephen said, there must have been first a sundering.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes.</p>
<p> Christfox in leather trews, hiding, a runaway in blighted treeforks from hue
and cry. Knowing no vixen, walking lonely in the chase.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 216}</font>
<br> Women he won to him, tender people, a whore of Babylon, ladies of justices,
bully tapsters&apos; wives. Fox and geese. And in New place a slack dishonoured
body that once was comely, once as sweet, as fresh as cinnamon, now her leaves
falling, all, bare, frighted of the narrow grave and unforgiven.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes. So you think&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> The door closed behind the outgoer.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 186}</font> </p>
<p> Rest, suddenly possessed the discreet vaulted cell, rest of warm and brooding air.</p>
<p> A vestal&apos;s lamp.</p>
<p> Here he ponders things that were not: what Caesar would have lived to do had
he believed the soothsayer: what might have been: possibilities of the possible
as possible: things not known: what name Achilles bore when he lived among women.</p>
<p> Coffined thoughts around me, in mummycases, embalmed in spice of words.
Thoth, god of libraries, a birdgod, moonycrowned. And I heard the voice of that
Egyptian highpriest. <i>In painted chambers loaded with tilebooks</i>.</p>
<p> They are still. Once quick in the brains of men. Still: but an itch of death
is in them, to tell me in my ear a maudlin tale, urge me to wreak their will.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Certainly, John Eglinton mused, of all great men he is the
most enigmatic. We know nothing but that he lived and suffered. Not even so
much. Others abide our question. A shadow hangs over all the rest.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; But <i>Hamlet</i> is so personal, isn&apos;t it? Mr Best
pleaded. I mean, a kind of private paper, don&apos;t you know, of his private
life. I mean I don&apos;t care a button, don&apos;t you know, who is killed or who is guilty&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> He rested an innocent book on the edge of the desk, smiling his defiance.
His private papers. <i>Ta an bad ar an tir. Taim imo shagart</i>. Put beurla on it, littlejohn.</p>
<p> Quoth littlejohn Eglinton:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I was prepared for paradoxes from what Malachi Mulligan
told us but I may as well warn you that if you want to shake my belief that
Shakespeare is Hamlet you have a stern task before you.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 217}</font> </p>
<p> Bear with me.</p>
<p> Stephen withstood the bane of miscreant eyes, glinting stern under wrinkled
brows. A basilisk. <i>E quando vede l&apos;uomo l&apos;attosca</i>. Messer Brunetto, I thank thee for the word.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; As we, or mother Dana, weave and unweave our bodies,
Stephen said, from day to day, their molecules shuttled to and fro, so does the
artist weave and unweave his image. And as the mole on my right breast is where
it was when I was born, though all my body has been woven of new stuff time
after time, so through the ghost of the unquiet father the image of the unliving
son looks forth. In the intense instant of imagination, when the mind, Shelley
says, is a fading coal, that which I was is that which I am and that which in
possibility I may come to be. So in the future, the sister of the past, I may see
<br><font color="green">{u22, 187}</font>
<br> myself as I sit here now but by reflection from that which then I shall be.</p>
<p> Drummond of Hawthornden helped you at that stile.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, Mr Best said youngly. I feel Hamlet quite young. The
bitterness might be from the father but the passages with Ophelia are surely from the son.</p>
<p> Has the wrong sow by the lug.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That mole is the last to go, Stephen said, laughing.</p>
<p> John Eglinton made a nothing pleasing mow.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; If that were the birthmark of genius, he said, genius
would be a drug in the market. The plays of Shakespeare&apos;s later years which
Renan admired so much breathe another spirit.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The spirit of reconciliation, the quaker librarian breathed.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There can be no reconciliation, Stephen said, if there has not been a sundering.</p>
<p> Said that.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; If you want to know what are the events which cast their
shadow over the
<font color="red"><sup><small>(4</small></sup></font><font color="black">hell
of</font><font color="red"><sup><small>4)</small></sup></font> time of <i>King
Lear</i>, <i>Othello</i>, <i>Hamlet</i>, <i>Troilus and Cressida</i> look to see
when and how the shadow lifts. What softens the heart of a man, shipwrecked in
life&apos;s storms, tried, like another Ulysses, Pericles, prince of Tyre?</p>
<p> Head, redconecapped, buffeted, brineblinded.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 218}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A child, a girl placed in his arms, Marina.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The leaning of sophists towards the bypaths of apocrypha
is a constant quantity, John Eglinton detected. The highroads are dreary but they lead to the town.</p>
<p> Good Bacon: gone musty. Shakespeare Bacon&apos;s wild oats. Cypherjugglers
going the highroads. What town, good masters? Mummed in names: A.&nbsp;E, eon:
Magee, John Eglinton. East of the sun, west of the moon: <i>Tir nan Og</i>. Booted the twain and staved.</p>
<p class="set"><i>How many miles to Dublin?
<br> Three score and ten, sir.
<br> Will we be there by candlelight?</i></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Mr Brandes accepts it, Stephen said, as the first play of the closing period.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Does he? What does Mr Sidney Lee, or Mr Simon Lazarus, as some aver his name is, say of it?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Marina, Stephen said, a child of storm, Miranda, a wonder,
Perdita, that which was lost. What was lost is given back to him: his daughter&apos;s child.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 188}</font>
<br> <i>My dearest wife</i>, Pericles says, <i>was like this maid</i>. Will any
man love the daughter if he has not loved the mother?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The art of being a grandfather, Mr Best gan murmur.
<i>L&apos;art d&apos;&ecirc;tre grandp</i>&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; His own image to a man with that queer thing genius is the
standard of all experience, material and moral. Such an appeal will touch him.
The images of other males of his blood will repel him. He will see in them
grotesque attempts of nature to foretell or repeat himself.</p>
<p> The benign forehead of the quaker librarian enkindled rosily with hope.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I hope Mr Dedalus will work out his theory for the
enlightenment of the public. And we ought to mention another Irish commentator,
Mr Frank Harris. His articles on Shakespeare in the <i>Saturday Review</i> were
surely brilliant. Oddly enough he too draws for us an unhappy relation with the dark
<br><font color="green">{u21, 219}</font>
<br> lady of the sonnets. The favoured rival is William Herbert, earl of
Pembroke. I own that if the poet must be rejected such a rejection would seem
more in harmony with &mdash; what shall I say? &mdash; our notions of what ought not to have been.</p>
<p> Felicitously he ceased and held a meek head among them, auk&apos;s egg, prize of their fray.</p>
<p> He thous and thees her with grave husbandwords. Dost love, Miriam? Dost love thy man?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That may be too, Stephen said. There is a saying of
Goethe&apos;s which Mr Magee likes to quote. Beware of what you wish for in
youth because you will get it in middle life. Why does he send to one who is a
<i>buonaroba</i>, a bay where all men ride, a maid of honour with a scandalous
girlhood, a lordling to woo for him? He was himself a lord of language and had
made himself a coistrel gentleman and had written <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>. Why?
Belief in himself has been untimely killed. He was overborne in a cornfield
first (a ryefield, I should say) and he will never be a victor in his own eyes
after nor play victoriously the game of laugh and lie down. Assumed
dongiovannism will not save him. No later undoing will undo the first undoing.
If the shrew is worsted there remains to her woman&apos;s invisible weapon.
There is, I feel in the words, some goad of the flesh driving him into a new
passion, a darker shadow of the first, darkening even his own understanding of
himself. A like fate awaits him and the two rages commingle in a whirlpool.</p>
<p> They list. And in the porches of their ears I pour.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The soul has been before stricken mortally, a poison poured in the
<br><font color="green">{u22, 189}</font>
<br> porch of a sleeping ear. But those who are done to death in sleep cannot
know the manner of their quell unless their Creator endow their souls with that
knowledge in the life to come. The poisoning and the beast with two backs that
urged it king Hamlet&apos;s ghost could not know of were he not endowed with
knowledge by his creator. That is why the speech is always turned elsewhere,
backward. Ravisher and ravished go with him from Lucrece&apos;s bluecircled ivory globes to Imogen&apos;s breast,
<br><font color="green">{u21, 220}</font>
<br> bare, with its mole cinquespotted. He goes back, weary of the creation he
has piled up to hide him from himself, an old dog licking an old sore. But,
because loss is his gain, he passes on towards eternity in undiminished
personality, untaught by the wisdom he has written or by the laws he has
revealed. His beaver is up. He is a ghost, a shadow now, the wind by
Elsinore&apos;s rocks or what you will, the sea&apos;s voice, a voice heard only
in the heart of him who is the substance of his shadow, the son consubstantial with the father.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Amen! responded from the doorway.</p>
<p> Hast thou found me, O mine enemy?</p>
<p> A ribald face, sullen as a dean&apos;s, Buck Mulligan came forward, then
blithe in motley, towards the greeting of their smiles. My telegram.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You were speaking of the gaseous vertebrate, if I mistake not? he asked of Stephen.</p>
<p> Primrosevested he greeted gaily with his doffed Panama as with a bauble.</p>
<p> They make him welcome.</p>
<p> Brood of mockers: Photius, pseudo Malachi, Johann Most.</p>
<p> He Who Himself begot, middler the Holy Ghost, and Himself sent Himself,
agenbuyer, between Himself and others, Who, put upon by His fiends, stripped and
whipped, was nailed like a bat to a barndoor, starved on crosstree, Who let Him
bury, stood up, harrowed hell, fared into heaven and there these nineteen
hundred years sitteth on the right hand of His Own Self but yet shall come in
the latter day to doom the quick and dead when all the quick shall be dead already.</p>

<p> He lifts his hands. Veils fall. O, flowers! Bells with bells with bells aquiring.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, indeed, the quaker librarian said. A most instructive
discussion. Mr Mulligan, I&apos;ll be bound, has his theory too of the play and
of Shakespeare. All sides of life should be represented.</p>
<p> He smiled on all sides equally.</p>
<p> Buck Mulligan thought, puzzled:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Shakespeare? he said. I seem to know the name.</p>
<p> A flying sunny smile rayed in his loose features.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; To be sure, he said, remembering brightly. The chap that writes like Synge.</p>
<p> Mr Best turned to him:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Haines missed you, he said. Did you meet him? He&apos;ll
see you after at the D.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;C. He&apos;s gone to Gill&apos;s to buy
Hyde&apos;s <i>Lovesongs of Connacht</i>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I came through the museum, Buck Mulligan said. Was he here?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The bard&apos;s fellowcountrymen, John Eglinton answered,
are rather tired perhaps of our brilliancies of theorising. I hear that an
actress is playing Hamlet in Dublin. Vining held that the prince was a woman.
Has no-one made him out to be an Irishman? He swears by saint Patrick.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The most brilliant of all is that story of Wilde&apos;s,
Mr Best said, lifting his brilliant notebook. That <i>Portrait of Mr W.H.</i>
where he proves that the sonnets were written by a Willie Hughes, a man all hues.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; For Willie Hughes, is it not? the quaker librarian asked.</p>
<p> Or Hughie Wills.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I mean, for Willie Hughes, Mr Best said, amending his
gloss easily. Of course it&apos;s all paradox, don&apos;t you know, Hughes and
hews and hues the colour, but it&apos;s so typical the way he works it out.
It&apos;s the very essence of Wilde, don&apos;t you know. The light touch.</p>
<p> His glance touched their faces lightly as he smiled, a blond ephebe. Tame essence of Wilde.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 222}</font> </p>
<p> You&apos;re darned witty. Three drams of usquebaugh you drank with Dan Deasy&apos;s ducats.</p>
<p> How much did I spend? O,
<font color="red"><sup><small>(4</small></sup></font><font color="black">a</font><font color="red"><sup><small>4)</small></sup></font>
few shillings.</p>
<p> For a plump of pressmen. Humour wet and dry.</p>
<p> Wit. You would give your five wits for youth&apos;s proud livery he pranks in. Lineaments of gratified desire.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 191}</font> </p>
<p> There be many mo. Take her for me. In pairing time. Jove, a cool ruttime send them. Yea, turtledove her.</p>
<p> Eve. Naked wheatbellied sin. A snake coils her, fang in&apos;s kiss.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Do you think it is only a paradox, the quaker librarian
was asking. The mocker is never taken seriously when he is most serious.</p>
<p> They talked seriously of mocker&apos;s seriousness.</p>
<p> Buck Mulligan&apos;s again heavy face eyed Stephen awhile. Then, his head
wagging, he came near, drew a folded telegram from his pocket. His mobile lips read, smiling with new delight.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Telegram! he said. Wonderful inspiration! Telegram! A papal bull!</p>
<p> He sat on a corner of the unlit desk, reading aloud joyfully:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without
incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done.</i> Signed: Dedalus. Where
did you launch it from? The kips? No. College Green. Have you drunk the four
quid? Telegram! Malachi Mulligan, The Ship, lower Abbey street. O, you peerless mummer! O, you priestified kinchite!</p>
<p> Joyfully he thrust message and envelope into a pocket but keened in querulous brogue:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It&apos;s what I&apos;m telling you, mister honey,
it&apos;s queer and sick we were, Haines and myself, the time himself brought it
in. And we one hour and two hours and three hours in Connery&apos;s sitting civil waiting for pints apiece.</p>
<p> He wailed:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And we to be there, mavrone, and you to be unbeknownst
sending your conglomerations the way we to have our tongues out a yard long like
the drouthy clerics do be fainting for a pussful.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 223}</font> </p>
<p> Stephen laughed.</p>
<p> Quickly, warningfully Buck Mulligan bent down:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The tramper Synge is looking for you, he said, to murder
you. He heard you pissed on his halldoor in Glasthule. He&apos;s out in pampooties to murder you.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Me! Stephen exclaimed. That was your contribution to literature.</p>
<p> Buck Mulligan gleefully bent back, laughing to the dark eavesdropping ceiling.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Murder you! he laughed.</p>
<p> Harsh gargoyle face that warred against me over our mess of hash of
<br><font color="green">{u22, 192}</font>
<br> lights in <i>rue saint Andr&eacute; des Arts</i>. In words of words for
words, palabras. Oisin with Patrick. Faunman he met in Clamart woods,
brandishing a winebottle. <i>C&apos;est vendredi saint!</i> His image,
wandering, he met. I mine. I met a fool i&apos;the forest.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Mr Lyster, an attendant said from the door ajar.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; &hellip; in which everyone can find his own. So Mr Justice
Madden in his <i>Diary of Master William Silence</i> has found the hunting terms&nbsp;&hellip; Yes? What is it?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There&apos;s a gentleman here, sir, the attendant said,
coming forward and offering a card. From the <i>Freeman</i>. He wants to see the
files of the <i>Kilkenny People</i> for last year.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Certainly, certainly, certainly. Is the gentleman&nbsp;&hellip;?</p>
<p> He took the eager card, glanced, not saw, laid down, unglanced, looked, asked, creaked, asked:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Is he&nbsp;&hellip;? O, there!</p>
<p> Brisk in a galliard he was off and out. In the daylit corridor he talked
with voluble pains of zeal, in duty bound, most fair, most kind, most honest broadbrim.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; This gentleman? <i>Freeman&apos;s Journal</i>? <i>Kilkenny
People</i>? To be sure. Good day, sir. <i>Kilkenny</i>&nbsp;&hellip; We have certainly&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> A patient silhouette waited, listening.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; All the leading provincial&nbsp;&hellip; <i>Northern
Whig</i>. <i>Cork Examiner</i>. <i>Enniscorthy Guardian</i>. 1903&nbsp;&hellip;
Will you please&nbsp;&hellip;? Evans, conduct this gentleman&nbsp;&hellip; If
you just follow the atten&nbsp;&hellip; Or please allow me&nbsp;&hellip; This
way&nbsp;&hellip; Please, sir&nbsp;&hellip;
<br><font color="green">{u21, 224}</font> </p>
<p> Voluble, dutiful, he led the way
<font color="red"><sup><small>(4</small></sup></font><font color="black">to<a target="foot" id="fkk0056">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>4)</small></sup></font>
all the provincial papers, a bowing dark figure following his hasty heels.</p>
<p> The door closed.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The sheeny! Buck Mulligan cried.</p>
<p> He jumped up and snatched the card.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What&apos;s his name? Ikey Moses? Bloom.</p>
<p> He rattled on:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Jehovah, collector of prepuces, is no more. I found him
over in the museum where I went to hail the foamborn Aphrodite. The Greek mouth
that has never been twisted in prayer. Every day we must do homage to her. <i>Life of life, thy lips enkindle</i>.</p>
<p> Suddenly he turned to Stephen:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He knows you. He knows your old fellow. O, I fear me, he
is Greeker than the Greeks. His pale Galilean eyes were upon her mesial groove. Venus
<br><font color="green">{u22, 193}</font>
<br> Kalipyge. O, the thunder of those loins! <i>The god pursuing, the maiden hid</i>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; We want to hear more, John Eglinton decided with Mr
Best&apos;s approval. We begin to be interested in Mrs S. Till now we had
thought of her, if at all, as a patient Griselda, a Penelope stayathome.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Antisthenes, pupil of Gorgias, Stephen said, took the palm
of beauty from Kyrios Menelaus&apos; broodmare, Argive Helen, and handed it to
poor Penelope. Twenty years he lived in London and, during part of that time, he
drew a salary equal to that of the lord chancellor of Ireland. His life was
rich. His art, more than the art of feudalism, as Walt Whitman called it, is the
art of surfeit. Hot herringpies, green mugs of sack, honeysauces, gooseberried
pigeons, ringocandies. Sir Walter Raleigh, when they arrested him, had half a
million francs on his back. The gombeenwoman Eliza Tudor had underlinen enough
to vie with her of Sheba. Twenty years he dallied there. You know

<font color="black">Manningham&apos;s</font><font color="red"><sup><small>4)</small></sup></font>
story of the burgher&apos;s wife who bade Dick Burbage to her bed after she had
seen him in <i>Richard III</i> and how Shakespeare,
<br><font color="green">{u21, 225}</font>
<br> overhearing, took the cow by the horns and, when Burbage came knocking,
answered from the blankets: <i>William the conqueror came before Richard
III</i>. And mistress Fitton, mount and cry O, and his dainty birdsnies, lady
Penelope Rich, and the punks of the bankside, a penny a time.</p>
<p> <i>Cours la Reine</i>. <i>Encore vingt sous. Nous ferons des petites cochonneries. Minette? Tu veux?</i></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The height of fine society. And sir William Davenant of
Oxford&apos;s mother with her cup of canary for every cockcanary.</p>
<p> Buck Mulligan, his pious eyes upturned, prayed:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Blessed Margaret Mary Anycock!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And Harry of six wives&apos; daughter and other lady
friends from neighbour seats, as Lawn Tennyson, gentleman poet, sings. But all
those twenty years what do you suppose poor Penelope in Stratford was doing behind the diamond panes?</p>
<p> Do and do. Thing done. In a rosery of Fetter lane of Gerard, herbalist, he
walks, greyedauburn. An azured harebell like her veins. Lids of Juno&apos;s
eyes, violets. He walks. One life is all. One body. Do. But do. Afar, in a reek
of lust and squalor, hands are laid on whiteness.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 194}</font> </p>
<p> Buck Mulligan rapped John Eglinton&apos;s desk sharply.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Whom do you suspect? he challenged.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Say that he is the spurned lover in the sonnets. Once
spurned twice spurned. But the court wanton spurned him for a lord, his dearmylove.</p>
<p> Love that dare not speak its name.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; As an Englishman, you mean, John sturdy Eglinton put in, he loved a lord.</p>
<p> Old wall where sudden lizards flash. At Charenton I watched them.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It seems so, Stephen said, when he wants to do for him,
and for all other and singular uneared wombs, the office an ostler does for the
stallion. Maybe, like Socrates, he had a midwife to mother as he had a shrew to
wife. But she, the wanton, did not break a bedvow. Two deeds are rank in that ghost&apos;s mind: a broken vow and
<br><font color="green">{u21, 226}</font>
<br> the dullbrained yokel on whom her favour has declined. Sweet Ann, I take
it, was hot in the blood. Once a wooer twice a wooer.</p>
<p> Stephen turned boldly in his chair.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The burden of proof is with you not with me, he said,
frowning. If you deny that in the fifth scene of <i>Hamlet</i> he has branded
her with infamy tell me why there is no mention of her during the thirtyfour
years between the day she married him and the day she buried him. All those
women saw their men down and under: Mary, her goodman John, Ann, her William,
when he died on her, Joan, her four brothers, Judith, her husband and all her
sons, Susan, her husband
too<font color="red"><sup><small>(4</small></sup></font><font color="black">,<a target="foot" id="fkk0065">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>4)</small></sup></font>
while Susan&apos;s daughter, Elizabeth, to use granddaddy&apos;s words, wed her second, having killed her first.</p>
<p> O, yes, mention there is. In the years when he was living richly in royal
London to pay a debt she had to borrow forty shillings from her father&apos;s
shepherd. Explain you then. Explain the swansong too wherein he has commended her to posterity.</p>
<p> He faced their silence.</p>
<p> To whom thus Eglinton:</p>
<p class="set">You mean the will.
<br> That has been explained, I believe, by jurists.
<br> She was entitled to her widow&apos;s dower
<br> At common law. His legal knowledge was great

<br><font color="green">{u22, 195}</font> </p>
<p class="center">Him Satan fleers,</p>

<br> And therefore he left out her name
<br> From the first draft but he did not leave out
<br> The presents for his granddaughter, for his daughters,
<br> For his sister, for his old cronies in Stratford
<br> And in London. And therefore when he was urged,
<br> As I believe, to name her
<br><font color="green">{u21, 227}</font>
<br> He left her his

then, John Eglinton observed, as they have still if our peasant plays are true to type.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He was a rich countrygentleman, Stephen said, with a coat
of arms and landed estate at Stratford and a house in Ireland yard, a capitalist
shareholder, a bill promoter, a tithefarmer. Why did he not leave her his best
bed if he wished her to snore away the rest of her nights in peace?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It is clear that there were two beds, a best and a secondbest, Mr Secondbest Best said finely.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>Separatio a mensa et a thalamo</i>, said Buck Mulligan and was smiled on.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Antiquity mentions famous beds, John Eglinton puckered, bedsmiling. Let me think.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 196}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Do you mean he died so? Mr Best asked with concern. I mean&nbsp;&hellip;
<br><font color="green">{u21, 228}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He died dead drunk, Buck Mulligan stated. <i>A quart of
ale is a dish for a king.</i> O, I must tell you what Dowden said!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What? asked Besteglinton.</p>
<p> William Shakespeare and company, limited. The people&apos;s William. For
terms apply: E. Dowden, Highfield house&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Lovely! Buck Mulligan suspired amorously. I asked him what
he thought of the charge of pederasty brought against the bard. He lifted his
hands and said: <i>All we can say is that life ran very high in those days.</i> Lovely!</p>
<p> Catamite.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The sense of beauty leads us astray, Mr Best with some sadness said.</p>
<p> Will they wrest from us, from me, the palm of beauty?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And the sense of property, Stephen said. He drew Shylock
out of his own long pocket. The son of a maltjobber and moneylender he was
himself a cornjobber and moneylender with ten tods of corn hoarded in famine
years. His borrowers are no doubt those divers of worship mentioned by Chettle
Falstaff who reported his uprightness of dealing. He sued a fellowplayer for the
price of a few bags of malt and exacted his pound of flesh in interest for every
money lent. How else could Aubrey&apos;s ostler and callboy get rich quick? All
events brought grist to his mill. Shylock chimes with the jewbaiting that
followed the hanging and quartering of the queen&apos;s leech Lopez, his
jew&apos;s heart being plucked forth while the sheeny was yet alive:
<i>Hamlet</i> and <i>Macbeth</i> with the coming to the throne of a Scotch
philosophaster with a turn for witchroasting. The lost armada is his jeer in
<i>Love&apos;s Labour Lost</i>. His pageants, the histories, sail fullbellied on
a tide of Mafeking enthusiasm. Warwickshire jesuits are tried and we have a
porter&apos;s theory of equivocation. The <i>Sea Venture</i> comes home from
Bermudas and the play Renan admired is written with Patsy Caliban,
<br><font color="green">{u21, 229}</font>
<br> our American cousin. The sugared sonnets follow Sidney&apos;s. As for fay

<p> I think you&apos;re getting on very nicely. Just mix up a mixture of
theolologicophilolological. <i>Mingo, minxi, mictum, mingere</i>.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 197}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Prove that he was a jew, John Eglinton dared, expectantly.
Your dean of studies holds he was a holy Roman.</p>
<p> <i>Sufflaminandus sum</i>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He was made in Germany, Stephen replied, as the champion French polisher of Italian scandals.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A myriadminded man, Mr Best reminded. Coleridge called him myriadminded.</p>
<p> <i>Amplius. In societate humana hoc est maxime necessarium ut sit amicitia inter multos.</i></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Saint Thomas, Stephen began&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>Ora pro nobis</i>, Monk Mulligan groaned, sinking to a chair.</p>
<p> There he keened a wailing rune.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It&apos;s destroyed we are from this day! It is destroyed we are surely!</p>
<p> All smiled their smiles.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Saint Thomas, Stephen, smiling, said, writing of incest
from a stand point different from that of the Viennese school Mr Magee spoke of,
likens it in his wise and curious way to an avarice of the emotions. He means
that the love so given to one near in blood is covetously withheld from some
stranger who, it may be, hungers for it. Jews, whom christians tax with avarice,
are of all races the most given to intermarriage. Accusations are made in anger.
The christian laws which built up the hoards of the jews (for whom, as for the
lollards, storm was shelter) bound their affections too with hoops of steel.
Whether these be sins or virtues old Nobodaddy will tell us at doomsday leet.
But a man who holds so tightly to what he calls his rights over what he calls
his debts will hold tightly also to what he calls his rights over
<br><font color="green">{u21, 230}</font>
<br> her whom he calls his wife. No sir smile neighbour shall covet his ox or
his wife or his manservant or his maidservant or his jackass.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Or his jennyass, Buck Mulligan antiphoned.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Gentle Will is being roughly handled, gentle Mr Best said gently.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Which will? asked sweetly Buck Mulligan. We are getting mixed.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The will to live, John Eglinton philosophised, for poor
Ann, Will&apos;s widow, is the will to die.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>Requiescat!</i> Stephen prayed.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 198}</font> </p>
<p class="set"><i>What of all the will to do?
<br> It has vanished long ago</i>&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; She lies laid out in stark stiffness in that secondbest
bed even though you prove that a bed in those days was as rare as a motorcar is
now and that its carvings were the wonder of seven parishes. In old age she
takes up with gospellers (one stayed at New Place and drank a quart of sack the
town paid for but in which bed he slept it skills not to ask) and heard she had
a soul. Venus has twisted her lips in prayer. Agenbite of inwit: remorse of
conscience. It is an age of exhausted whoredom groping for its god.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; History shows that to be true, <i>inquit Eglinton
Chronolologos</i>. The ages succeed one another. But we have it on high
authority that a man&apos;s worst enemies shall be those of his own house and
family. I feel that Russell is right. What do we care for his wife and father? I
should say that only family poets have family lives. Falstaff was not a family
man. I feel that the fat knight is his supreme creation.</p>
<p> Lean, he lay back. Shy, deny thy kindred, the unco guid. Shy, supping with
the godless, he sneaks the cup. A sire in Ultonian Antrim bade it him. Visits
him here on quarter days. Mr Magee, sir, there&apos;s
<br><font color="green">{u21, 232}</font>
<br> a gentleman to see you. Me? Says he&apos;s your father, sir. Give me my
Wordsworth. Enter Magee Mor Matthew, a rugged, rough, rugheaded kern, his nether

<p class="di">&mdash; A father, Stephen said, battling against hopelessness, is
a necessary evil. He wrote the play in the months that followed his
father&apos;s death. If you hold that he, a greying man with two marriageable
daughters, with thirtyfive years of life, <i>nel mezzo del cammin di nostra
vita</i>, with fifty of experience is the beardless undergraduate from
Wittenberg then you must hold that his seventyyear old mother is the lustful
queen. No. The corpse of John Shakespeare does not walk the night. From hour to hour it rots and rots. He rests,
<br><font color="green">{u22, 199}</font>
<br> disarmed of fatherhood, having devised that mystical estate upon his son.
Boccaccio&apos;s Calandrino was the first and last man who felt himself with
child. Fatherhood, in the sense of conscious begetting, is unknown to man. It is
a mystical estate, an apostolic succession, from only begetter to only begotten.
On that mystery and not on the madonna which the cunning Italian intellect flung
to the mob of Europe the church is founded and founded irremovably because
founded, like the world, macro and microcosm, upon the void. Upon incertitude,
upon unlikelihood. <i>Amor matris</i>, subjective and objective genitive, may be
the only true thing in life. Paternity may be a legal fiction. Who is the father
of any son that any son should love him or he any son?</p>
<p> What the hell are you driving at?</p>
<p> I know. Shut up. Blast you! I have reasons.</p>
<p> <i>Amplius. Adhuc. Iterum. Postea.</i></p>

<p class="di">&mdash; They are sundered by bodily shame so steadfast that the
criminal annals of the world, stained with all other incests and bestialities,
do not record its breach: sons with mothers, sires with
<br><font color="green">{u21, 232}</font>
<br> daughters, lesbic sisters, loves that dare not speak their name, nephews
with grandmothers, queens with prize bulls. The son unborn mars beauty: born, he
brings pain, divides affection, increases care. He is a male: his growth is his
father&apos;s decline, his youth his father&apos;s envy, his friend his father&apos;s enemy.</p>
<p> In <i>rue Monsieur le Prince</i> I thought it.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What links them in nature? An instant of blind rut.</p>
<p> Am I a father? If I were?</p>
<p> Shrunken uncertain hand.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Sabellius, the African, subtlest heresiarch of all the
beasts of the field, held that the Father was Himself His Own Son. The bulldog
of Aquin, with whom no word shall be impossible, refutes him. Well: if the
father who has not a son be not a father can the son who has not a father be a
son? When Rutlandbaconsouthamptonshakespeare wrote <i>Hamlet</i> he was not the
father of his own son merely but, being no more a son, he was and felt himself
the father of all his race, the father of his own grandfather, the father of his
unborn grandson who, by the same token, never was born for nature, as Mr Magee understands her, abhors perfection.</p>

<p class="di">&mdash; As for his family, Stephen said, his mother&apos;s name
lives in the forest of Arden. Her death brought from him the scene with Volumnia
in <i>Coriolanus</i>. His boyson&apos;s death is the deathscene of prince Arthur
in <i>King John</i>. Hamlet, the black prince, is Hamlet Shakespeare. Who the

the plays, a super here, a clown there, as a painter of old Italy set his face
in a dark corner of his canvas. He has revealed it in the sonnets where there is
Will in overplus. Like John o&apos; Gaunt his name is dear to him, as dear as
the coat of arms he toadied for, on a bend sable a spear or steeled argent,
honorificabilitudinitatibus, dearer than his glory of greatest shakescene in the
country. What&apos;s in a name? That is what we ask ourselves in childhood when
we write the name that we are told is ours. A star, a daystar, a firedrake rose
at his birth. It shone by day in the heavens
alone<font color="red"><sup><small>(4</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>4)</small></sup></font>
brighter than Venus in the night, and by night it shone over delta in
Cassiopeia, the recumbent constellation which is the signature of his initial
among the stars. His eyes watched it, lowlying on the horizon, eastward of the
bear, as he walked by the slumberous summer fields at midnight, returning from Shottery and from her arms.</p>
<p> Both satisfied. I too.</p>

<p class="di">&mdash; What is that, Mr Dedalus? the quaker librarian asked. Was it a celestial phenomenon?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A star by night, Stephen said, a pillar of the cloud by day.</p>
<p> What more&apos;s to speak?</p>
<p> Stephen looked on his hat, his stick, his boots.</p>
<p> <i>Stephanos</i>, my crown. My sword. His boots are spoiling the shape of my
feet. Buy a pair. Holes in my socks. Handkerchief too.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You make good use of the name, John Eglinton allowed. Your
own name is strange enough. I suppose it explains your fantastical humour.</p>
<p> Me, Magee and Mulligan.</p>
<p> Fabulous artificer, the hawklike man. You flew. Whereto? Newhaven-Dieppe,
steerage passenger. Paris and back. Lapwing. Icarus. <i>Pater, ait</i>.
Seabedabbled, fallen weltering. Lapwing you are. Lapwing be.</p>
<p> Mr Best eagerquietly lifted his book to say:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That&apos;s very interesting because that brother motive,
don&apos;t you know, we find also in the old Irish myths. Just what you say. The
three brothers Shakespeare. In Grimm too, don&apos;t you know, the fairytales.
The third brother that always marries the sleeping beauty and wins the best prize.</p>
<p> Best of Best brothers. Good, better, best.</p>
<p> The quaker librarian springhalted near.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I should like to know, he said, which brother
you&nbsp;&hellip; I understand you to suggest there was misconduct with one of
the brothers&nbsp;&hellip; But perhaps I am anticipating?</p>
<p> He caught himself in the act: looked at all: refrained.</p>
<p> An attendant from the doorway called:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Mr Lyster! Father Dineen wants&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O! Father Dineen! Directly.</p>
<p> Swiftly rectly creaking rectly rectly he was rectly gone.</p>
<p> John Eglinton touched the foil.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Come, he said. Let us hear what you have to say of Richard
and Edmund. You kept them for the last, didn&apos;t you?
<br><font color="green">{u21, 236}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; In asking you to remember
<font color="red"><sup><small>(4</small></sup></font><font color="black">those
two noble kinsmen</font><font color="red"><sup><small>4)</small></sup></font> nuncle Richie
<br><font color="green">{u22, 203}</font>
<br> and nuncle Edmund, Stephen answered, I feel I am asking too much perhaps. A
brother is as easily forgotten as an umbrella.</p>
<p> Lapwing.</p>
<p> Where is your brother? Apothecaries&apos; hall. My whetstone. Him, then
Cranly, Mulligan: now these. Speech, speech. But act. Act speech. They mock to try you. Act. Be acted on.</p>
<p> Lapwing.</p>
<p> I am tired of my voice.</p>
<p> On.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You will say those names were already in the chronicles
from which he took the stuff of his plays. Why did he take them rather than
others? Richard, a crookback, misbegotten, makes love to a widowed Ann
(what&apos;s in a name?), woos and wins her. Richard the
conqueror<font color="red"><sup><small>(4</small></sup></font><font color="black">,
third brother,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>4)</small></sup></font> came
after William the conquered. The other four acts of that play hang limply from
that first. Of all his kings Richard is the only king unshielded by
Shakespeare&apos;s reverence, the angel of the world. Why is the underplot of
<i>King Lear</i> in which Edmund figures lifted out of Sidney&apos;s
<i>Arcadia</i> and spatchcocked on to a Celtic legend older than history?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That was Will&apos;s way, John Eglinton defended. We
should not now combine a Norse saga with an excerpt from a novel by George
Meredith. <i>Que voulez-vous?</i> Moore would say. He puts Bohemia on the
seacoast and makes Ulysses quote Aristotle.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Why? Stephen answered himself. Because the theme of the
false or the usurping or the adulterous brother or all three in one is to
Shakespeare what the poor is not, always with him. The note of banishment,
banishment from the heart, banishment from home, sounds uninterruptedly from
<i>The Two Gentlemen of Verona</i> onward till Prospero breaks his staff, buries
it certain fathoms in the earth and drowns his book. It doubles itself in the
middle of his life, reflects itself in another, repeats itself. It repeats
itself again when he is near the grave, when his married daughter Susan, chip of
the old block, is accused of adultery. But it
<br><font color="green">{u21, 237}</font>
<br> was the original sin that darkened his understanding, weakened his will and
left in him a strong inclination to evil. The words are those of my lords
bishops of Maynooth &mdash; an original sin and, like original sin, committed by
another in whose sin he too has sinned. It is between the lines of his last
written words, it is petrified on his tombstone under which her four bones are
not to be laid. Age has not withered it. Beauty and peace have not done it away. It is in
<br><font color="green">{u22, 204}</font>
<br> infinite variety everywhere in the world he has created, in <i>Much Ado
about Nothing</i>, twice in <i>As You Like It</i>, in <i>The Tempest</i>, in
<i>Hamlet</i>, in <i>Measure for Measure</i> &mdash; and in the other plays which I have not read.</p>
<p> He laughed to free his mind from his mind&apos;s bondage.</p>
<p> Judge Eglinton summed up.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The truth is midway, he affirmed. He is the ghost and the prince. He is all in all.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He is, Stephen said. The boy of act one is the mature man
of act five. All in all. In <i>Cymbeline</i>, in <i>Othello</i> he is bawd and
cuckold. He acts and is acted on. His unremitting intellect is the Iago
ceaselessly willing that the moor in him shall suffer.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Buck Mulligan clucked lewdly. O word of fear!</p>
<p> Dark dome received, reverbed.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And what a character is Iago! undaunted John Eglinton
exclaimed. When all is said Dumas
<font color="red"><sup><small>(4</small></sup></font><font color="black">fils</font><font color="red"><sup><small>4)</small></sup></font>
(or is it
<font color="red"><sup><small>(4</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Victor
Hugo</span></span> <font color="black">Dumas
p&egrave;re</font><font color="red"><sup><small>4)</small></sup></font>?) is
right. After God Shakespeare has created most.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Man delights him not nor woman neither, Stephen said. He
returns after a life of absence to that spot of earth where he was born, where
he has always been a silent witness and there, his journey of life ended, he
plants his mulberrytree in the earth. Then dies. Gravediggers bury Hamlet
<i>p&egrave;re</i> and Hamlet <i>fils</i>. If you like the last scene
<br><font color="green">{u21, 238}</font>
<br> look long on it: prosperous Prospero, the good man rewarded, Lizzie,
grandpa&apos;s lump of love, and nuncle Richie, the bad man taken off by poetic
justice to the place where the bad niggers go. He found in the world without as
actual what was in his world within as possible. Maeterlinck says: If Socrates
leave his house today he will find the sage seated on his doorstep, If Judas go
forth tonight it is to Judas his steps will go. Every life is many days, day
after day. We walk through ourselves, meeting robbers, ghosts, giants, old men,
young men, wives, but always meeting ourselves. The playwright who wrote this
world and wrote it badly (He gave us light first and the sun two days later),
the lord of things as they are whom the most Roman of catholics call <i>dio
boia</i>, hangman god, is doubtless all in all in all of us, ostler and butcher, and would be bawd and
<br><font color="green">{u22, 205}</font>
<br> cuckold too but that in the economy of heaven, foretold by Hamlet, there
are no more marriages, glorified man being a wife unto himself.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>Eureka!</i> Buck Mulligan cried. <i>Eureka!</i></p>
<p> Suddenly happied he jumped up and reached in a stride John Eglinton&apos;s desk.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; May I? he said. The Lord has spoken to Malachi.</p>
<p> He began to scribble on a slip of paper.</p>
<p> Take some slips from the counter going out.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Those who are married, Mr Best douce herald, said, all
save one, shall live. The rest shall keep as they are.</p>
<p> He laughed, unmarried, at Eglinton Johannes, of arts a bachelor.</p>
<p> Unwed, unfancied, ware of wiles, they fingerponder nightly each his variorum
edition of <i>The Taming of the Shrew</i>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You are a delusion, said roundly John Eglinton to Stephen.
You have brought us all this way to show us a French triangle. Do you believe your own theory?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; No, Stephen said promptly.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Are you going to write it? Mr Best asked. You ought to
make it a dialogue, don&apos;t you know, like the Platonic dialogues Wilde wrote.</p>
<p> John Eglinton smiled doubly.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 239}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Well, in that case, he said, I don&apos;t see why you
should expect payment for it since you don&apos;t believe it yourself. Dowden
believes there is some mystery in <i>Hamlet</i> but will say no more. Herr
Bleibtreu, the man Piper met in Berlin who is working up that Rutland theory,
believes that the secret is hidden in the Stratford monument. He is going to
visit the present duke, Piper says, and prove to him that his ancestor wrote the
plays. It will come as a surprise to his grace. But he believes his theory.</p>
<p> I believe, O Lord, help my unbelief. That is, help me to believe or help me
to unbelieve? Who helps to believe? <i>Egomen</i>. Who to unbelieve? Other chap.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You are the only contributor to <i>Dana</i> who asks for
pieces of silver. Then I don&apos;t know about the next number. Fred Ryan wants space for an article on economics.</p>
<p> Fraidrine. Two pieces of silver he lent me. Tide you over. Economics.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; For a guinea, Stephen said, you can publish this interview.</p>
<p> Buck Mulligan stood up from his laughing scribbling, laughing: and then gravely said, honeying malice:
<br><font color="green">{u22, 206}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I called upon the bard Kinch at his summer residence in
upper Mecklenburgh street and found him deep in the study of the <i>Summa contra
Gentiles</i> in the company of two gonorrheal ladies, Fresh Nelly and Rosalie, the coalquay whore.</p>
<p> He broke away.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Come, Kinch. Come, wandering Aengus of the birds.</p>
<p> Come, Kinch, you have eaten all we left. Ay. I will serve you your orts and offals.</p>
<p> Stephen rose.</p>
<p> Life is many days. This will end.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; We shall see you tonight, John Eglinton said. <i>Notre
ami</i> Moore says Malachi Mulligan must be there.</p>
<p> Buck Mulligan flaunted his slip and panama.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Monsieur Moore, he said, lecturer on French letters to the
youth of Ireland. I&apos;ll be there. Come, Kinch, the bards must drink. Can you walk straight?
<br><font color="green">{u21, 240}</font> </p>
<p> Laughing he&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> Swill till eleven. Irish nights entertainment.</p>
<p> Lubber&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> Stephen followed a lubber&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> One day in the national library we had a discussion. Shakes. After his lub back I followed.</p>
<p> Stephen, greeting, then all amort, followed a lubber jester, a wellkempt
head, newbarbered, out of the vaulted cell into a shattering daylight of no thoughts.</p>
<p> What have I learned? Of them? Of me?</p>
<p> Walk like Haines now.</p>

<p> He spluttered to the air:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O, the chinless Chinaman! We went over to their playbox,
Haines and I, the plumbers&apos; hall. Abbey theatre! I smell the pubic sweat of monks.</p>
<p> He spat blank.</p>

<p> Eh&nbsp;&hellip; I just eh&nbsp;&hellip; wanted&nbsp;&hellip; I forgot&nbsp;&hellip; eh&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Longworth and M&apos;Curdy Atkinson were there&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> Puck Mulligan footed featly, trilling:</p>
<p class="diset">&mdash; <i>I hardly hear a purlieu cry</i>
<br> <i>Or a Tommy talk as I pass one by</i>
<br> <i>Before my thoughts begin to run</i>
<br> <i>On F. M&apos;Curdy Atkinson,</i>
<br> <i>The same that had the wooden leg</i>
<br> <i>And that filibustering filibeg</i>
<br> <i>That never dared to slake his drought,</i>
<br> <i>Magee that had the chinless mouth</i> &nbsp;&hellip; </p>
<p> Jest on. Know thyself.</p>
<p> Halted below me, a quizzer looks at me. I halt.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Mournful mummer, Buck Mulligan moaned. Synge has left off
wearing black to be like nature. Only crows, priests and English coal are black.</p>
<p> A laugh tripped over his lips.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 208}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Longworth is awfully sick, he said, after what you wrote
about that old hake Gregory. O you inquisitional drunken jewjesuit! She gets you
a job on the paper and then you go and slate her book to Jaysus. Couldn&apos;t you do the Yeats touch?</p>
<p> He went on and down, chanting with waving graceful arms:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The most beautiful book that has come out of Ireland in my time.</p>
<p> He stopped at the stairfoot.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I have conceived a play for the mummers, he said solemnly.</p>
<p> The pillared Moorish hall, shadows entwined. Gone the nine men&apos;s morrice with caps of indices.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 242}</font> </p>
<p> In sweetly varying voices Buck Mulligan read his tablet:</p>
<p class="center"><i>Everyman His Own Wife</i></p>
<p class="center"><i>or</i></p>
<p class="center"><i>A Honeymoon in the Hand</i></p>
<p class="center">(<i>a national immorality in three orgasms</i>)</p>
<p class="center"><i>by</i></p>
<p class="center"><i>Ballocky Mulligan</i></p>
<p> He turned a happy patch&apos;s smirk to Stephen, saying:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The disguise, I fear, is thin. But listen.</p>
<p> He read, <i>marcato</i>:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Characters:</p>
<p class="set"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Toby</span>
<span style="font-variant:small-caps">Tostoff</span> (a ruined Pole)

<br> <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Fresh Nelly</span>
<br> and
<br> <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Rosalie</span> (the coalquay whore).</p>
<p> He laughed, lolling a to and fro head, walking on, followed by Stephen: and
mirthfully he told the shadows, souls of men:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O, the night in the Camden hall when the daughters of Erin had to lift
<br><font color="green">{u22, 209}</font>
<br> their skirts to step over you as you lay in your mulberrycoloured, multicoloured, multitudinous vomit!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The most innocent son of Erin, Stephen said, for whom they ever lifted them.</p>
<p> About to pass through the doorway, feeling one behind, he stood aside.</p>
<p> Part. The moment is now. Where then? If Socrates leave his house today, if
Judas go forth tonight. Why? That lies in space which I in time must come to, ineluctably.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 243}</font> </p>
<p> My will: his will that fronts me. Seas between.</p>
<p> A man passed out between them, bowing, greeting:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Good day again, Buck Mulligan said.</p>
<p> The portico.</p>
<p> Here I watched the birds for augury. Aengus of the birds. They go, they
come. Last night I flew. Easily flew. Men wondered. Street of harlots after. A
creamfruit melon he held to me. In. You will see.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The wandering jew, Buck Mulligan whispered with
clown&apos;s awe. Did you see his eye? He looked upon you to lust after you. I
fear thee, ancient mariner. O, Kinch, thou art in peril. Get thee a breechpad.</p>
<p> Manner of Oxenford.</p>
<p> Day. Wheelbarrow sun over arch of bridge.</p>
<p> A dark back went before them, step of a pard, down, out by the gateway, under portcullis barbs.</p>
<p> They followed.</p>
<p> Offend me still. Speak on.</p>
<p> Kind air defined the coigns of houses in Kildare street. No birds. Frail
from the housetops two plumes of smoke ascended, pluming, and in a flaw of softness, softly were blown.</p>
<p> Cease to strive. Peace of the druids priests of Cymbeline hierophantic: from wide earth an altar.</p>
