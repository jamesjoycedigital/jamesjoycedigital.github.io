<p class="pdi">&mdash; And we have have we not, those priceless pages of
<u>Wilhelm Meister</u>, A great poet on a great brother poet. A soul hesitating
confronted with a task beyond its powers, taking arms against a sea of troubles
torn by conflicting doubts as one sees in life.</p>
<p> He tiptoed himself nigher heaven by the altitude of a
chopine<a target="foot" id="fkz0002">&ordm;</a> made a step a sinkapace on a

<p> A noiseless attendant setting open the door but slightly made him a noiseless beck.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Directly, he said, creaking to go. The beautiful dreamer
who comes to grief against hard facts. One always feels that Goethe&apos;s
judgments are so true. True in the larger analysis.</p>
<p> Twicreakingly analysis he hasted off. Bald, zealous, by the door he heard
the attendant&apos;s summons and was gone</p>
<p> Two left.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Monsieur de la Palice, Stephen sneered, was alive fifteen minutes before his death.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Have you found those

<p> Folly. Persist.</p>
<p> Mulligan has my telegram.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Our young Irish bards, John Eglinton censured, have yet
to create something which the world will set beside Saxon Shakespeare&apos;s
<u>Hamlet</u> though I admire him, as old Ben did, on this side idolatry. The
peatsmoke is exhilarating, George Moore says. We want men not wraiths and spooks. </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; All these questions are purely academic, Russell said
from his shadow. For professors of the university. I mean, if Hamlet is
Shakespeare or James I or Essex. Clergymen&apos;s discussions of
<a name="un1014e" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1014e">the historicity of
Jesus</a>. Art has to reveal to us ideas, formless spiritual essences. The
supreme question about a work of art is out of how deep a life does it spring.
The action and the actors are shadows in time, their thoughts are actions in
eternity. The painting of Gustave Moreau is the painting of ideas. The deepest
poetry of Shelley, the words of <u>Hamlet</u>, bring our minds into contact with
the eternal wisdom, the world of ideas of Plato. The rest is the speculation of schoolboys for schoolboys.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The schoolmen were schoolboys at first, Stephen said.
Aristotle himself was Plato&apos;s prize schoolboy at first.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He is so still, John Eglinton said sedately. I can see
him quite proud of it too. A model schoolboy With a neat diploma under his arm.</p>
<p> He laughed again towards the now smiling bearded face. Formless spiritual essences. Father,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 3}</font>

<p> Mr Best entered, tall, young, mild, light. He bore in his hand with grace a notebook, new, large, clean, bright.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That model schoolboy, Stephen said, would find
Hamlet&apos;s thinking on the immortality of his soul improbable, insignificant
&amp; undramatic monologue, as shallow as Plato&apos;s.</p>
<p> John Eglinton said frowning, waxing wroth:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Upon my word it makes my blood boil to hear anyone compare Aristotle with Plato.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Which of the two would have banished the creator of
<u>Hamlet</u> from his commonwealth, Stephen asked.
<br> <a name="un5016d" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5016d">Petrus Lombardus:
He always do all that he ever did.</a></p>
<p> Unsheathe your dagger definitions. Streams of tendency and {<u>oms</u>} they
worship. God: noise in the street: very peripatetic. Space: that which you damn
well have to see. Must be seen to be believed. Through spaces smaller than red
globules of man&apos;s blood he beardily creeps into eternity of which this
vegetable world is but a shadow. This now through which the future plunges towards into the past.</p>
<p> Mr Best came forward amiably towards his colleague.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Haines is gone, he said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is he? John Eglinton said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I was showing him Jubainville&apos;s book. He&apos;s so
enthusiastic, don&apos;t you know, about Hyde&apos;s lovesongs of Connacht. I
couldn&apos;t bring him in to hear the prolusion. He&apos;s gone to Gill&apos;s to buy a copy.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The peatsmoke works wonders, John Eglinton said.</p>
<p> We feel in England that we have. The penitent thief. An Irishman must
<br><font color="green">{ms, 4}</font>
<br> think<a target="foot" id="fkz0006">&ordm;</a> like that I daresay.</p>
<p> Gone. I smoked his cigarette. Twinkling emerald.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; People do not know how dangerous lovesongs can be,
Russell said darkly. The movements which work revolutions in the world are born
out of the dreams in a peasant&apos;s heart on the hillside. For them the earth
is not an exploitable ground but a living mother. The rarefied air of the
academy and of the political arena produces only the sixshilling novel, the
musichall songs. France produces a fine flower of corruption in Mallarm&eacute;
but the desirable life is made known only to the poor of heart, the life of Homer&apos;s Phaecians.</p>
<p> Mr Best turned his inoffensive face from these words to Stephen, saying</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Mallarm&eacute;, don&apos;t you know, he said, has
written those wonderful prose poems Stephen MacKenna used to read me in Paris.
There&apos;s one about <u>Hamlet</u>. He says he il se prom&egrave;ne, lisant au
livre de lui-m&ecirc;me, don&apos;t you know, <u>the reading the book of
himself</u>. He describes a performance of <u>Hamlet</u> in a French provincial town. They advertised it.</p>
<p> His gracious hand wrote tiny signs in the air:</p>
<p class="center">Hamlet</p>
<p class="center">ou</p>
<p class="center">Le Distrait</p>
<p class="center">pi&egrave;ce de Shakespeare</p>
<p> He repeated to John Eglinton&apos;s gathering frown:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Pi&egrave;ce de Shakespeare</u>, don&apos;t
<br><font color="green">{ms, 5}</font>
<br> you<a target="foot" id="fkz0007">&ordm;</a> know. It&apos;s so French. The
French point of view. Hamlet or&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The absentminded beggar, Stephen said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, I suppose it would be, John Eglinton laughed.
Excellent people, no doubt, but distressingly shortsighted in some matters. </p>
<p> Haml. {gasses} about him.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He kills nine lives for his father&apos;s one,
<a name="un5016e" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5016e">His father who is in
purgatory.</a> Sumptuous and stagnant exaggeration of murder, Mallarm&eacute;
calls it, but not, as he says, killed of by his philosophy of doubt. a deathsman
of the soul, as Robert Greene called him Stephen said. Khaki Hamlet, as Mr
Balfour knows, don&apos;t hesitate to shoot. He was not for nothing a
butcher&apos;s son. In his youth he wielded the sledded
poleaxe<a target="foot" id="fkz0008">&ordm;</a> and spat in his palm. The stage in act five is a concentration camp.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He insists that Hamlet is a ghoststory, John Eglinton said for Mr Best&apos;s behoof. Like</p>
<p>
<br> the fat boy in Pickwick he wants to make our flesh creep.</p>
<p> List! List! O list!</p>
<p> My flesh hears him: creeping, hears.
<br> <u>If thou didst ever</u>&nbsp;&hellip;.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What is a ghost? Stephen said with tingling energy. One
who has faded into impalpability through death, or through absence and through
change of manners, through that oblivion which death and absence bring.
Elizabethan London lay as far from Stratford as corrupt Paris lies from this city in our day. Who is this ghost,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 6}</font>
<br> a<a target="foot" id="fkz0009">&ordm;</a> sablesilvered man returning to
the world that has forgotten him? Who is King Hamlet?</p>
<p> John Eglinton shifted his spare body, leaning back to judge.</p>
<p> Lifted him.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It is this hour of a June day, Stephen said, begging with
a swift glance their hearing, in Shakespeare&apos;s London. He has left Mountjoy
the huguenot&apos;s house in Silver street and goes along the riverside &amp;
walks by the swanmews along the riverbank but does not stay to feed the pen
chivying her brood towards the rushes. The swan of Avon has other thoughts. We
are in his Globe theatre on the bankside. The flag is up. The bear Sackerson
growls in the bearpit hard by Paris
garden<a target="foot" id="fkz0010">&ordm;</a>. Shipmen, canvasclimbers who
sailed with Drake chew their sausages and stand with the groundlings. Gooseberry pigeon The play begins.</p>
<p> An actor comes on under the shadow, clad in the cast-off mail of a buck of
the court, a wellset man with a deep voice. It is the ghost, King Hamlet. The
actor is Shakespeare. And Shakespeare speaks his own words, calling the young
man Burbage to whom he speaks, by name.</p>
<p class="set"><u>Hamlet, I am thy father&apos;s spirit</u></p>
<p class="flush">and bidding him list. To his son he speaks, to the son of his
soul, the prince, young Hamlet and to son of his body, Hamlet Shakespeare who
has died in Stratford that his namesake may live for ever.</p>
<p> Is it possible that that actor, a ghost by absence, in the vesture of the
elder Hamlet, a ghost by death, speaking his own words to his own son, (for had
Hamlet Shakespeare lived he would have been then a young man of twenty)
<br><font color="green">{ms, 7}</font>
<br> is<a target="foot" id="fkz0011">&ordm;</a> it possible, I ask, that he did
not draw or foresee the logical conclusion of those premises? I am the murdered
father; <a name="jn2007h" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2007h">you are the
dispossessed son</a>: your mother is the guilty queen, Anne Shakespeare, born Hathaway.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But this prying into the family secrets of a great man,
Russell said impatiently, is interesting only to the parish clerk. I mean we
have the plays. I mean when we read the poetry of <u>King Lear</u> what is it to
us how the poet lived? As for living, Villiers de l&apos;Isle said, our servants
can do that for us. This peeping and prying into the greenroom gossip of the
day, the poet&apos;s drinking habits, the poet&apos;s debts.</p>

<p class="pdi">&mdash; She<a target="foot" id="fkz0013">&ordm;</a> died, Stephen
retorted, sixtyseven years after she was born. She saw him into and out of the
world. She suffered his first embraces. She bore and bred his children and she closed his eyes in death.</p>
<p> John Eglinton looked into the tangled glowworm of his lamp.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The world believes that Shakespeare made a mistake, he
said, and got out of it as quickly as he could.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Bosh! Stephen said rudely. A man of genius makes no
mistakes. His errors are volitional and are the portals of discovery.</p>
<p> Portal of discovery opened. The quaker librarian came in softcreakfooted, assiduous, bald and eared.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A shrew, John Eglinton said shrewdly, is not a useful
portal of discovery, one should imagine. What useful discovery did Socrates learn from his wife Xanthippe.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Dialectic, Stephen said. And from his midwife mother how
to bring thoughts of others into the world. But neither the midwife lore nor
caudle lectures saved him from the archons of the Gaelic league and the hemlock cup.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But Ann Hathaway? Mr Best&apos;s quiet accent said
forgetfully. Yes, we seem to forget her as Shakespeare himself forgot her.</p>
<p> His face went from the brooder&apos;s beard to the carper&apos;s skull, to
remind, to chide most kindly, then to the pinkbald head of the quaker librarian,
guiltless though maligned.
<a name="un5016f" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5016f">Celestial Love and its Chaste Delights.</a></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He had a good groatsworth of wit, Stephen said, and no
truant memory. He carried a memory in the wallet as he trudged to Romeville,
whistling <u>The girl I left behind me</u>. If the earthquake did not time it we
should know where to place poor Wat, sitting in his form, the studded bridle,
her blue windows. Gray eyes The book in which he sang it lay in the bedchamber

ugliest doxy in all Warwickshire to lie withal? He left her: good: and gained
the world of men. But because he left his boywomen are the women of a boy who
has not lived with a woman. Life, thought and speech are lent them by males. He
chose badly? He was chosen more than a chooser. She put the comether on him for

<p> And my turn, when? O come! By cock you are to blame.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ryefield, Mr Best said, raising his bright books gladly.</p>
<p> He murmured then with blond delight for all to hear:</p>
<p class="pdiset">&mdash; <u>Between the acres of the rye</u>
<br> <u>These pretty countryfolk would lie</u></p>

<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, Is Piper back? Mr Best asked.</p>
<p> Peter Piper pecked a peck of pick of peck of pickled pepper.</p>

<p> Anxiously he glanced in the cone of lamplight where three faces, lighted to
expression, shone. See this. Remember this.</p>
<p> Stephen looked down upon a wide black hat Caubeen hung headless on his
ashplant&apos;s handle over his knee.

<p> Stephen sat down again.</p>
<p> The quaker librarian came away from the leavetakers. Blushing his
<br><font color="green">{ms, 11}</font>
<br> mask<a target="foot" id="fkz0018">&ordm;</a> said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Mr Dedalus, your views are most illuminating.</p>
<p> He creaked to and fro and, covered by the outgoing noises, said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is it your idea, then, that she was not faithful to the poet?</p>
<p> <a name="un5016h" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5016h">the church qua church</a></p>
<p> Stephen gazed at the alarmed face before him. Inner light he too seeks. A
zealous lollard. Why did he come to me? Politeness or an inner light? His
Christfox in leather trews, hiding runaway in in a
<a name="un1032bs" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1032bs">blighted</a>
treefork from hue and cry, walking lonely in the chase. Women he won, tender
people, whores of Babylon, justices&apos; wives, the wives of tapsters. Fox and
geese. And in New Place a slack dishonoured body that once was comely, sweet as
cinnamon, now her leaves falling all, bare, frighted of the bare grave unforgiven.</p>
<p> per cui tanto reo tempo si volse</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; There is no reconciliation, Stephen said, unless there has been a sundering.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; So you think&nbsp;&hellip;.</p>
<p> The door closed behind the outgoer.</p>
<p> Without warm brooding air&nbsp;&hellip;......</p>
<p> A sudden rest filled the discreet vaulted cell where a vestel&apos;s lamp
burned. Here he meditates on things that were not. What Caesar would have done
had he believed the soothsayer, on things not known, what name Achilles bore
when he lived among women,

still. The itch of death is in them yet. To speak in my ear their maudlin story, urge me to their will.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Certainly, John Eglinton said, of all great men he is the
most enigmatic but that he lived and suffered. A shadow hangs over all the rest.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But <u>Hamlet</u> is so personal, isn&apos;t it, Mr Best said. I mean
<br><font color="green">{ms, 12}</font>
<br> a<a target="foot" id="fkz0019">&ordm;</a> kind of private paper, don&apos;t
you know, of his private life. I mean, I don&apos;t care about who is killed or&nbsp;&hellip;.</p>
<p> He rested his innocent books on the edge of the desk. His Private papers.

O&apos;Donn&cdot;a&delta;a, put beurla on it. I am in my priest. Let littlejohn</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He is still doomed for a certain term to walk the night
of criticism &amp; misunderstanding, Stephen said, if that be fame.</p>
<p> John Eglinton horsed a knee impatiently, saying</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I was prepared for paradoxes from what Mulligan told me
but I may as well warn you if you want to shake my belief that Shakespeare is
Hamlet you have a stern task before you. Stephen withstood the bane of miscreant
eyes glinting askance from under stern wrinkled brows.
<a name="gn1015a" href="../../ff/unbs/gn1all.htm#gn1015a">Basilisk eyed. <u>E
quando vede l&apos;uomo l&apos;attosca.</u> Messer Brunetto, I thank thee for the word.</a></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Bear with me, Stephen said.
<a name="un1032ec" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1032ec">As we weave and
unweave our bodies</a>, Stephen said, from day to day its molecules shuttled
carelessly to and fro, so does the artist
<a name="un1032ec" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1032ec">weave and
unweave</a> his image. And as the mole on my left shoulder is where it was when
I was born, though all my body has been woven of new stuff time after time so
though the ghost of the unquiet father the image of the unliving son looks
forth. At his age I shall see myself as I sit here today but by reflection from that which then I shall be.</p>
<p> Drummond of Hawthornden helped me over that stile.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, I feel Hamlet quite young, Mr Best said youngly. The
bitterness might be the reflection of the father
<br><font color="green">{ms, 13}</font>
<br> but<a target="foot" id="fkz0020">&ordm;</a> the passages with Ophelia is surely the son.</p>
<p> Has the wrong sow by the ear. But what harm.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That is the last mole to disappear, Stephen said laughing.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; If that were the sole birthmark of genius, John
Eglinton&apos;s knitted brows with a sour
mow<a target="foot" id="fkz0021">&ordm;</a> said sourly, it would be a drug in
the market. The plays of Shakespeare&apos;s last years which Renan admired so much breathe a different spirit.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The spirit of reconciliation, the quaker librarian said appeasingly.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; There is no reconciliation, Stephen said, without a
sundering. Tragic events darken the period of <u>Othello</u>, <u>Lear</u> and
<u>Hamlet</u> but that those events did not cast the deepest shadow is shown by
the way in which their shadow lifted. Who and what is it that softens for awhile
the heart of a man, shipwrecked in the storms of a life&apos;s bitterness tried
like Ulysses, Pericles, prince of Tyre? A baby girl. Marina. A head buffeted by
waves, redconecapped, brineblinded. My dearest wife was like this maid.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The affection of sophists for the bypaths of apocrypha is
a constant quantity, John Eglinton said detectively. The highroads are dreary but they lead to the town.</p>
<p> Good Bacon, gone musty. Cypher jugglers going the highroads. Shakespeare
Bacon&apos;s wild oats. What town is he bound for mummed in their names,

<p class="pdi">&mdash; Mr<a target="foot" id="fkz0022">&ordm;</a> Brandes places
it as the first play of the closing period, Stephen said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Does he? John Eglinton said. What does Mr Sidney Lee, or
Mr Simon Lazarus as some say his name is, say of that play?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Marina, Stephen said, child of seastorm, Imogen,
<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font>,
Miranda, a childish wonder, Perdita, that which was lost. That which was lost in
youth is reborn strangely in his wane of life: his daughter&apos;s child. But
who will love the daughter if he has not loved the mother? I don&apos;t know but
will he not see in her recreated and with the memory of his own youth and his
own image added to her the images which first awakened his love?</p>
<p> Do you know what you are talking about? Love, yes. Word known to all men.
<u>Amor vero aliquid alicui bonum vult, unde et ea quae concupiscimus</u>&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A man with
<a name="jn1034q" href="../../ff/unbs/jn1all.htm#jn1034q">that queer thing</a>
genius above all whose own image is to him, morally and materially, the Handmaid
of all experience. He will be touched by that appeal as he will be infallibly
repelled by <a name="gn1010b" href="../../ff/unbs/gn1all.htm#gn1010b">images of
other males of his brood in whom he will see grotesque attempts of nature to foretell</a> or to repeat himself.</p>
<p> The quaker librarian said, his forehead blushing benignly:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I hope Mr Dedalus will develop his theory for the
instruction of the public. And we ought to mention another Irish commentator, Mr
Frank Harris. His articles on Shakespeare in the <u>Saturday</u>
<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font> were surely brilliant. Oddly
<br><font color="green">{ms, 15}</font>
<br> enough,<a target="foot" id="fkz0023">&ordm;</a> he too draws for us an
unhappy relation with the dark lady of the sonnets Mary Fitton. The favoured
rival is the young earl of Pembroke William Herbert. I own that if the poet is
to appear as rejected such a rejection would seem more in harmony with &mdash;
what shall I say? &mdash; our notions of what ought not to have been.</p>
<p> Having shaped the words felicitously he held his head meekly among them, an
auk&apos;s egg, prize of their fray. A faint benign smile appeared on his mask,
echoing pleased his thought and
p<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps"><sub>unread</sub></span></font>&mdash;</p>
<p> He thous and thees her. Dost love, Miriam? Dost love thy hubsy? laugh and lie down leman</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That may be too, Stephen said. There is a saying of
Goethe&apos;s which Mr Magee likes to quote. Beware of what you wish in youth
because in middle life it will be granted you. No wealth of words or richness of
experience will make him who was overborne in a cornfield, excuse me, a ryefield
a victor in his own eyes ever. Why does he then to one who is a maid of honour
with a scandalous girlhood, a buonaroba, a bay where all men ride he, who has
written <u>Romeo and Juliet</u> &amp; &mdash;, a gentleman bearing arms, a
coistrel gentleman<a target="foot" id="fkz0024">&ordm;</a> a lord of language,
send a lordling as his proxy? Why? Belief in himself has been untimely sapped.
No later undoing will efface the first. No assumed dongiovannism will save him
for there remains to the worsted shrew an invisible weapon. That goad of the
flesh will drive him into a new passion &mdash; its darker shadow &mdash;
darkening after a moment of flame his own understanding of himself. A like fate
awaits him and both rages like whirlpools commingle. But the later
<br><font color="green">{ms, 16}</font>
<br> rage<a target="foot" id="fkz0025">&ordm;</a> is a fever of the blood which
tortures but does not strike mortally the soul. The soul has been before
stricken mortally, a poison poured in the porches of a sleeping ear. Those who
are done to death in sleep cannot know the manner of their undoing unless the
creator endows their souls with that knowledge in the life to come. That
poisoning and the treason that urged it the ghost of King Hamlet could not know
were it not endowed with knowledge by its creator. Under the apparent dialogue
and diatribe the speech is always turned elsewhere, backward. He returns,
unsatisfied by the creations he has piled up between himself and himself, to
lick his old sore. Imogen the ravished is Lucrece the undeflowered. And in the
porches of their ears I pour There are no mangods in our time. Shakespeare
passes towards eternity, in undiminished personality, untaught by the eternal
wisdom he has {believed}, untaught by the laws he has exemplified. His beaver is
up but he will not speak or stay. A ghost, his words are for the night, the wind
around Elsinore&apos;s rocks, the sea&apos;s voice, and only by him who is the
substance of his shadow, the son consubstantial with the father.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Amen!</p>

<p> Hast thou found me, O mine enemy?</p>
<p> A ribald face, sullen for an instant, Buck Mulligan came forward in blithe
motley<a target="foot" id="fkz0026">&ordm;</a>, primrose vested, towards a
greeting of smiles, greeting gaily with his doffed Panama as with a bauble.</p>

<p class="pdi">&mdash; A most interesting discussion on Shakespeare, the quaker
librarian said. Mr Mulligan, I am sure, has his theory too. All sides of life should be
<br><font color="green">{ms, 17}</font>
<br> represented.<a target="foot" id="fkz0027">&ordm;</a></p>
<p> Buck Mulligan thought, puzzled.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Shakespeare? he said. I seem to know the name.</p>
<p> A sudden sunny smile rayed into his loose features.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ah, To be sure, he said, remembering brightly. The chap that writes like Synge.</p>
<p> Mr Best turned to him:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Haines was here, he said. He&apos;ll meet you after at
the D.B.C. He&apos;s gone to buy the <u>Lovesongs of Connacht</u>, don&apos;t you know. I was showing them to him.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Here? Buck Mulligan asked, looking round.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, Mr Best said. I asked him to come in&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Shakespeare&apos;s fellowcountrymen, John Eglinton said,
are rather tired of our brilliancies of theorising.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The most brilliant of all is that story of Wilde&apos;s,
don&apos;t you know, Mr Best said, lifting his brilliant notebook. That picture
of Mr W.H where he proves the sonnets were written by Willie Hughes. <u>A man all hues.</u></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; For Mr William Hughes, is it not? the quaker librarian said. Or for Hughy Wills.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I mean, for Mr William Hughes, Mr Best said amending his
gloss. Of course it&apos;s all paradoxical, don&apos;t you know, Hughes and hews
and hues, the colours. But it&apos;s so typical the whole theory the way he
works it out. It&apos;s the very essence of Wilde, don&apos;t you know. The light touch</p>
<p> His glance touched their faces lightly. as he smiled, a blond ephebe. Essence of Wilde. Tame essence of Wilde.

<p> They talked.</p>
<p> Buck Mulligan&apos;s again heavy face eyed Stephen awhile. Then, shaking his
head, he came forward. He drew a folded telegram from his pocket, read it with
his mobile lips, smiling with new delight.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Telegram! he said. Wonderful inspiration! We waited for
you in the Ship, Haines and myself. Telegram! A papal bull!</p>
<p> He sat on a corner of the unlit desk near Stephen, reading with delight.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without
incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done. Where did you send it from?

<p class="pdi">&mdash; There&apos;s a gentleman here, sir, the attendant said
offering a card, from the <u>Evening Telegraph</u>. He wants to see the files of
the <u>Kilkenny People</u> for last year.</p>
<p> A patient figure, hat in hand, looked darkly in outlined in the looked into the discreet room.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Certainly, certainly, certainly, the quaker librarian
said. Is the gentleman&nbsp;&hellip;...? I&apos;m coming directly.</p>
<p> patient figure from the daylight without looked darkly in. dutifully
<a name="un5016k" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5016k">brisk as a
galliard</a> he went a galliard to the door and, honest eager broadbrim, talked with zeal.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; This gentleman? Evening Telegraph <u>Kilkenny People</u>
to be sure. We have the <u>Kilkenny People</u>, <u>Enniscorthy Guardian</u>,
<u>Cork Examiner</u>&nbsp;&hellip;. Good day, sir&nbsp;&hellip; Will you
please&nbsp;&hellip; Evans, conduct this gentleman&nbsp;&hellip; If you just

<p> He pushed on out of the lighted span of doorway, ever vol &amp; dutifully,
the bowing figure at his stumbling heels.</p>
<p> Treading whither?</p>
<p> In the world without in circumstances of squalor hands laid upon whiteness.</p>
<p> The door closed.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The sheeny! Buck Mulligan cried, jumping up and snatching
<br><font color="green">{ms, 20}</font>
<br> the<a target="foot" id="fkz0032">&ordm;</a> card. My first
<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font>
What&apos;s his name? Ikey Moses? Bloom. He turned his tongue rattling on: I
found him over in the museum bent down worshipping Uranian Venus. Jehovah, the

before foamborn Aphrodite. We must salute her every day. The Greek mouth that
has never been twisted in whining prayer. Hellas, the lamp of love. <u>Life of life, thy lips enkindle</u>.</p>
<p> He turned suddenly to Stephen, saying:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He knows you. He&apos;s after you

<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">unread</span></font>.
O, I fear me he is Greeker than the Greeks. His pale Galilean eyes were upon her

<p class="pdi">&mdash; We want to hear more, John Eglinton said with Mr
Best&apos;s approval. We are beginning to be interested in Mrs W. Till now we
had thought of her, if at all, as a patient Griselda or as Penelope stayathome.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Remember, Stephen said, that Antisthenes took the palm of
beauty from Kyrios Menelaus&apos; broodmare, Helen, and handed it to poor Penelope. </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Twenty years he lived in London, Stephen said, and,
during a great part of that time he was drawing a salary equal to that of the
lord chancellor of Ireland. His life was rich. His art is more than the art of
feudalism, as good Walt accused him. It is the art of surfeit. Spicy
herringpies, sack in green mugs, honeysauces, gooseberried pigeons,
<a name="un3021k" href="../../ff/unbs/un3all.htm#un3021k">ringocandies</a>. Sir
Walter Raleigh&apos;s apparel when he was arrested was more than worth half a
million francs. The gombeenwoman Elizabeth Tudor&apos;s {starched} underlinen
was as great as that of the queen of Sheba. While he consorted with his

Fritton and lady Penelope Rich and his other lady friends from neighbour seats
as Lawn Tennyson has it (I say nothing of the punks on the Bankside) what do you imagine Poor Penelope
<br><font color="green">{ms, 21}</font>
<br> was<a target="foot" id="fkz0033">&ordm;</a> doing in Stratford behind the diamond panes?</p>
<p> Buck Mulligan rose from the desk abruptly and asked judicially:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Whom do you suspect?</p>
<p> He sat down, talking to himself rimes audible.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Say that Shakespeare is the spurned lover in the sonnets.
Once spurned twice spurned. At least one, the court wanton, spurned him for a lord. Dear, my love.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; As an English liberal, you mean, he loved a lord, John Eglinton put in. His master-mistress!</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It seems so, Stephen said, when he wishes to do for him
with all and singular uneared wombs the service that the ostler does for the
stallion. Maybe he too had a midwife to mother as he had a shrew to wife.</p>
<p> A mind not slumbered. Old wall where sudden lizards flash. At Charenton I watched them.</p>
<p> The love that dare not speak its name.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; For one younger and handsome. Nor did she betray a vow.
For these two offenses are as raw in the ghost&apos;s mind as is the carnal act
itself: the broken vow and the dullbrained yokel on whom her favour has
descended. Young Women who seduce men younger than themselves are, I daresay,
hot in the blood. And once a seducer, twice a seducer.</p>
<p> Stephen turned sharply in his chair.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The burden of proof is with you and not with me, he said
frowning. If you deny that in the third scene in <u>Hamlet</u> he has branded
her with infamy explain why there is no mention of her during the thirtyfour
years between the day he married her and the day she buried him. O yes, one
mention there is. In the years when he was living richly in royal London to pay a
<br><font color="green">{ms, 22}</font>
<br> debt<a target="foot" id="fkz0034">&ordm;</a> she had to borrow five
shillings from her father&apos;s shepherd. Explain you then. He faced their
silence And explain the swansong with which he has commended her to posterity.</p>
<p> To whom thus Eglinton</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You mean the will. That has been explained, I believe, by
jurists. His legal knowledge was great men of law say.
<a name="un3007b" href="../../ff/unbs/un3all.htm#un3007b">She was entitled at
common law to her widow&apos;s dower</a>. Besides she was too old.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And therefore he omitted her name in the first draft,
Stephen said mockingly. But he did not omit the presents for his granddaughter,
for his daughters, for his sister, for his old cronies in Stratford and in
London and therefore when he was urged (as I believe) to name her he left her his secondbest bed.
<br> To whom thus Eglinton:</p>

<br> So say the men of law.</p>
<p> Him Satan fleers at, </p>
<p> &mdash; and therefore he left out her name
<br> From the first draft but he did not leave out
<br> The presents for his granddaughter, for his daughters,

<p> Woa!</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Pretty Countryfolk had few chattles in those times
perhaps, John Eglinton said, as they have still if our Irish dramatists are true to type.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He was a rich country gentleman, Stephen said, with a
coat of arms and a fortune in landed estate. Why did he not leave her his best
bed if he wished her to snore away the rest of her life in peace?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It seems clear that there were two beds in the case, Mr Best said finely.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Separatio a mensa et a thalamo</u>, Buck Mulligan said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Perhaps if we could produce the bed, said. Antiquity
mentions several famous beds. Let me think.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But do you mean that he died so, Mr Best asked. I mean
<br><font color="green">{ms, 23}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He<a target="foot" id="fkz0035">&ordm;</a> died dead
drunk, Buck Mulligan said. <u>A quart of ale is a dish for a king.</u> Do you know what Dowden said?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What? John Eglinton and Mr Best asked in unison.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Lovely! Buck Mulligan said gaily. I asked him what he
thought of the charge of pederasty brought against the bard. He lifted his hands
and said: <u>All we say is that life ran very high in those days</u>. Lovely!</p>
<p> Catamite.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The sense of beauty leads us astray, Mr Best said with some sadness. Boywomen</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; All events brought grist to his will. Shylock chimes with
the jewbaiting that followed the execution of the queen&apos;s jew doctor Lopez.
Hamlet and Macbeth with the coming to the throne of a Scotch philosophaster with
a turn for witchroasting. He jeers at the lost armada of the Spaniards in
<u>Love&apos;s Labour Lost</u>. His pageants sail on the tide of national
enthusiasms, his sonnets follow Sidney&apos;s. Of the gross virgin who inspired
Mids. N. Dream and the Merry Wives it is needless to speak. And the sense of
property, Stephen said. He drew Shylock out of his own long pocket. The hostler
and callboy became a man of substance in an age when players were vagabonds. He
was the son of a cornjobber and moneylender. He was himself a maltjobber and
moneylender. He had corn hoarded during the Stratford famine. He sued a fellow
actor for the price of a few bags of malt and exacted every penny of interest on
the money he had lent. His borrowers are no doubt those divers of worship
mentioned by Chettle Falstaff who have reported his uprightness of dealing.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Prove that he was a jew, John Eglinton said expectantly.
Your dean of studies proves that he was a good Roman Catholic. We shall hear next that he was a Warwickshire Celt.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A catholic Celt, Stephen jeered, who wrote in protestant
English and was made in Germany the champion French polisher of Italian scandals</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A myriadminded man, Mr Best put in, Coleridge calls him.</p>
<p> (quotation)</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Saint Thomas, Stephen began&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

destroyed we are from this day. Holy Thomas has
come!<a target="foot" id="fkz0036">&ordm;</a> It&apos;s destroyed we are surely!</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Saint Thomas, Stephen went on smiling, writing of incest
from a standpoint different from that of the Viennese school Mr Magee spoke of
likens it in his wise and curious way to an avarice of the affections. He means that the love so given
<br><font color="green">{ms, 24}</font>
<br> to<a target="foot" id="fkz0037">&ordm;</a> one near in blood is covetously
withheld from a stranger who, it may be, hungers for it. The jews who are
accused by christians of avarice are also the most given to intermarriage.
Accusations are made in anger. The christian laws which built up the hoards
&amp; power of the jews bound their affections too with hoops of steel. Whether
these be sins of virtues Old Nobodaddy will tell us at the general assizes. But
a man who holds so closely to what he calls his rights over what he calls his
debts will hold tightly also to what he calls his rights over her whom he calls
his wife. No neighbour must covet his wife or his ox or his horse or his parlourmaid or his jackass.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Or his jennyass, Buck Mulligan added softly.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Gentle Will is being ungently handled, gentle Mr Best said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Which will? Mulligan sweetly asked. We are getting mixed.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; If others have their will, Stephen answered, Ann hath a
way. She will remain laid out for all posterity in puritanical stiffness in that
secondbest bed even though you prove that a bed was as rare in those days as a
motorcar is now and that its carvings were the wonder of seven parishes. In her
age she takes up with lollard prechers and hears about her soul. Venus has
turned bigot. It is the agenbite of inwit, the remorse of conscience: it is the
age of exhausted whoredom groping for its god.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That seems to me to be true, John Eglinton said. The ages
<br><font color="green">{ms, 25}</font>
<br> succeed<a target="foot" id="fkz0038">&ordm;</a> one another. But it has
been well said that a man&apos;s worst enemies shall be those of his own house
and family. I feel that A.E. is right. What do we care about his father or his
wife I should say that only family poets have family lives. The creator of
Falstaff was not a family man. I feel that the fat knight is his supreme creation.</p>
<p> Lean, rejoycing, he lay back. Shy denier of kindred, the unco guid. He sups
sparely, but sneaks the cup<a target="foot" id="fkz0039">&ordm;</a> among
blasphemies. A father in Ultonian Antrim. Visits him here on quarter days. Mr
Magee Sir, there&apos;s a gentleman outside to see you. Me? Says he&apos;s your
father, sir. Enter Magee Mor: a rugged rough rugheaded kern nether stocks signed
with clauber of ten forests, a wilding in his hand.</p>
<p> And mine?</p>
<p> Hurrying to her squalid deathbed from gay Paris on the quayside I touched
his hand. Fine, brown and shrunken, drunkard&apos;s hand. The voice, new warmth,
speaking new tones remembered. Dr Bob Kenny is attending her. The eyes that wish me well. But do they know me?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A father is a necessary evil, Stephen said battling
against despair. He wrote the play in the months following his father&apos;s
death. If you hold that he, a greying man with thirty five years of life and
fifty of experience, with two marriageable daughters is the beardless
undergraduate then you must hold that his seventyyear old mother is the lustful
queen. The corpse of his father in Stratford does not walk the night. He rests,
disarmed of fatherhood, having devised that mystical estate upon his son.
Boccaccio&apos;s Calandrino was the first and last man who felt himself with
child. Fatherhood, in the sense of conscious begetting, is unknown to man: it is
a mystical estate, an apostolic succession. from Only begetter to only begotten.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 24v}</font>
<br> It<a target="foot" id="fkz0040">&ordm;</a> is on this mystery and not on
the madonna which the cunning Italian intellect flung to the mob of Europe that
the church is founded &mdash; and founded irremovably because it is founded on
as world and atoms are upon the void incertitude. On unlikelihood, I might add.
For if <u>amor matris</u>, subjective &amp; objective genitive, is the central
secret, the only true thing in life as the human say is not that other love
mysterious because unnatural? Paternity is a legal fiction. Who is my father? Or
why should there be love between son and father?</p>
<p> What the hell are you coming at?</p>
<p> I know. Leave me alone. Shut up, blast you. I have my reason.</p>
<p> Adhuc. Postea. Etiam. Amplius.</p>
<p> Are you condemned to do this?</p>
<p> They are sundered by a bodily shame so steadfast that the criminal annals of
the world, rich in all other incest and bestiality, mothers with sons, fathers
with daughters, nephews with grandmothers, queens with prize bulls, do not
record its breach. The son unborn disfigures the mother&apos;s beauty and upsets
their social life, being born he pains her, born he divides her affection,
increases cares. A second male in the house, his growth is his father&apos;s
decline, his youth his father&apos;s envy, his friends his father&apos;s enemies
&amp; the enemies of his father&apos;s generation. What links in nature? An instant of blind rut.</p>

<p> And now?</p>

<p> Sobuntur objecta.</p>
<p> Shrunken uncertain hand</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Sabellius the African, the subtlest of heresiarchs, held
that the Father was himself His Son. Aquinas refutes him (how?) for with Whom no
word shall be impossible. Divinely He is an eternal Father who has begotten
before all ages. But in our own narrow life is he a son whose father does not live? When Rutland-South-Bacon-Shakespeare
<br><font color="green">{ms, 25}</font>
<br> When<a target="foot" id="fkz0041">&ordm;</a> he wrote the play he was not
the father of his own son merely, but because no longer a son, he was and felt
himself the father of all his race, the father
<br><font color="green">{ms, 26}</font>
<br> of<a target="foot" id="fkz0042">&ordm;</a> his own grandfather, the father
of his unborn grandson who, by the same token, never was born for, as Mr Magee
has written, nature abhors perfection.</p>
<p> John Eglinton looked up, his eyes quick with pleasure.</p>
<p> Flatter. Rarely. But flatter.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Every man his own father, Buck Mulligan said. Wait, wait.
I am big with child. I have a child in my brain. A play! A play! Let me parturiate! precipitation</p>
<p> He clasped his high forehead with birthaiding hands.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; As for his family, Stephen said, his mother&apos;s name
he gave to the forest of Arden. Her death brought from him the encounter with
Volumnia in <u>Coriolanus</u>. His boyson&apos;s is the deathscene of prince
Arthur in <u>King John</u>. His son&apos;s name is given to <u>Hamlet</u>. His
father&apos;s death gave birth to <u>Hamlet</u>. But there is one member of his family who is otherwise recorded.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Now I feel that the plot thickens, John Eglinton said.</p>
<p> The quaker librarian tiptoed in,
<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font>
presenting the same mask flushed with haste.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Shakespeare, Stephen said, had three brothers, Gilbert,
Edmund and Richard. Of the first I can find little except that in his old age he
told courtiers that he had seen brother Will carry a man on his back in a play.
The playhouse sausage said more to him that what he heard or saw. The names of
Edmund and Richard occur in the plays and as the names of two in the trinity of
stage villains &mdash; Richard III, Iago and Edmund in <u>King Lear</u>. And
note that this last play was written about the time that his brother Edmund was dying in London.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Names, John Eglinton said. What&apos;s in a name?
<br><font color="green">{ms, 27}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Much,<a target="foot" id="fkz0043">&ordm;</a> Stephen
said. Do you not think he knew how to hide his own name in his plays, giving it
only once in jest to poor William in <u>As You Like It</u>? As a painter of the
middle age sometimes puts his own face in an obscure corner of his canvas? And
did he not reveal it in the sonnets where there is Will in overplus? Like John
O&apos; Gaunt his name is dear to him. As dear as the coat of arms with the
shaken spear which he intrigued for. It was more to him to have that patent in
his name than to be the greatest shakescene in the country. How often do we
write as children the name that we are told is ours? A star, a daystar rose at
his birth. It shone by day in the heavens over delta in Cassiopeia, the
<u>strange</u> constellation which is the signature of his name among the stars.

<p class="pdi">&mdash; What is that, Mr Dedalus? the quaker librarian asked. Was it a celestial phenomenon really?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;

<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, Mr Best said. The brother theme we find also in the
old Irish epics, don&apos;t you know. Just what you say, the three brothers
Shakespeare. It&apos;s always the third brother that marries the sleeping beauty and gets the crown.</p>
<p> Best of his brothers: good, better, best.

<p class="pdi">&mdash; But<a target="foot" id="fkz0044">&ordm;</a> I should like

<p> John Eglinton took up the foil.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Let us hear of Richard and Edmund, he said. Are these nuncle Richie &amp; nuncle Edmund.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; In asking you to remember them, Stephen said, I am
perhaps asking much for a brother is as easily forgotten as an umbrella. I ought
to have mentioned them before. It is my fault.</p>
<p> Lapwing.</p>
<p> Where is your brother? In the Apothecaries&apos; hall. Old

is act. Act as you speak. They mock and try you. Act.</p>
<p> Lapwing.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, Mr Best said. It is very interesting.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But those names were already in the chronicles from which
he took the plays, John Eglinton said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Why did he take them in preference to others? Stephen
said. Why is Richard Crookback the misbegotten, a halfbrother who makes love to
a widowed Ann (What&apos;s in a name?), to a loving wife who feigns to repel him
and yield why is he introduced into the pageant of the histories &mdash; the
only king in the plays unhedged by divinity or by reverence, angel of the world?
Why is the subplot of <u>King Lear</u> in
<br><font color="green">{ms, 29}</font>
<br> which<a target="foot" id="fkz0045">&ordm;</a> Edmund appears taken from
Sidney&apos;s <u>Arcadia</u> and grafted on to a Celtic legend of Lir and his
daughters, a legend older than history and, Mr Russell would say, older than humanity.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Gentle Will was wilful, John Eglinton said indulgently.
We should not now combine characters from a Norse saga with an episode from George Moore&apos;s latest novel.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Why? Stephen answered himself. Because the theme of the
false brother is to Shakespeare, what the poor are not, always with him. In glad
days and in sad. If he has suppressed it anywhere it is where he has allowed
another shame to darken his understanding. But it was it, the original sin,
uncommitted by him as original sin is too which darkened his understanding,
weakened his will &amp; left in him a strong inclination. The words are taken
from their lordships of Maynooth. It appears in his last will, petrified on his
tombstone between which her four bones are not to lie, unsolved by his
daughters&apos; influence, unmitigated by age &amp; weakness. It is not the
betrayal by a wanton with a lordling but that she who first touched his lips
with the live coal of passion unmindful of his greatness has betrayed him in the
silent country with one of his own blood &amp; earthly brood, adulterous incest
gainst his body with one who bears likeness to him but by a jest of birth
&mdash; a churls It is the inevitable accompaniment of a wife&apos;s infidelity?
in <u>Much Ado about Nothing</u>, twice in <u>As You Like It</u>, in <u>The
Tempest</u>, in <u>Hamlet</u>, in <u>Measure for Measure</u> &mdash; and in the other plays which I have not read.</p>
<p> He laughed to free his mind from his mind&apos;s bondage.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The truth is probably midway, John Eglinton said. He is
the ghost and Hamlet too. He is all his characters</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, Stephen said. And so the beardless youth of the
first act becomes a mature man in act five.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Even Homer sometimes nods, John Eglinton said. In the
Odyssey we have Telemachus a young magistrate when he was really a schoolboy</p>
<p> He acts and is acted on. He is, as in <u>Othello</u> and in Cymbeline, the
bawd and the cuckold. his unremitting intellect is the Iago which ceaselessly
wills that the moor in him shall suffer.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Cuckoo, cuckoo, Buck Mulligan cooed. O, word of fear.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And what a character is Iago! John Eglinton exclaimed
undaunted imploring. When all is said Dumas (or is Victor Hugo?) is right. After God Shakespeare has created most.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; His worlds is conjured up about him, Stephen said, to
people his loneliness. He launches world after world on his orbit and in each is
his own image, one banished, Prospero Angelo, one betrayed, the elder
<br><font color="green">{ms, 30}</font>
<br> Hamlet.<a target="foot" id="fkz0046">&ordm;</a> And after nuncle
Richie&apos;s death grandpapa Will, prosperous Propero and Lizzie, his little
lump of love. He returns then to that part of the earth where he was born, where
he has always been, an invisible witness, and, his journeys ended, returns to
his conacre holding plants a mulberry tree. Maeterlinck says: If Socrates go
forth today he will find the sage seated on the doorstep. If Judas go forth
tonight it is to Judas his steps will tend. Every life is only many days, day
after day. We walk through one after another, encountering robbers, giants, old
men, ghosts, young men, wives. The dramatist who wrote this world and wrote it
so badly that he made light for us first and sun and moon two days later, He
whom the most Roman of catholics call dio boia, hangman god, is also, I suppose,
in all his characters. He would be bawd and cuckold too but that, as he is
hostler and butcher,

<p class="pdi">&mdash; May I? he said</p>
<p> He began to scribble on a slip of paper</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Those who are married, Mr Best quoted, all but one, shall

roundly<a target="foot" id="fkz0048">&ordm;</a>. You have brought us all this
way to show us a French triangle. Do you believe your own theory?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, Stephen said promptly.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Are you going to write it? Mr Best asked. You ought to make it a dialogue, don&apos;t
<br><font color="green">{ms, 31}</font>
<br> you<a target="foot" id="fkz0049">&ordm;</a> know, like the Platonic dialogues, like Wilde wrote.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well in that case, John Eglinton said, smiling doubly, I
don&apos;t see why you should expect payment for what you don&apos;t believe
yourself. You are the only contributor to <u>Dana</u> who asks for pieces of
silver. Then I don&apos;t know about the next number. Fred Ryan wants space for

Mulligan said. I shall bring my trilogy.</p>

amort, into the shattering daylight of no thoughts: and through the turnstile of
the constant readers&apos; room and by the curving sliding marble balustrade.

<p> He read, marking:

<p> He raised his arms again gracefully, walking on, waving:</p>

<p> He laughed, lolling his head to and fro, crying mirthfully to the soft
