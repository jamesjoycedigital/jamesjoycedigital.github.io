<p class="pdi">&mdash; Have you found those six brave

<p> Folly. Persist.</p>
<p> Mulligan has my telegram.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Our young Irish bards, John Eglinton censured, have yet
to create a figure which the world will set beside Saxon Shakespeare&apos;s
Hamlet though I admire him, as old Ben did, on this side idolatry.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; All these questions are purely academic, Russell said
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">from</span></span>
<font color="black">out
of</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font> his shadow. I
mean, if Hamlet is Shakespeare or James I or Essex. Clergymen&apos;s discussions
of the historicity of Jesus. Art has to reveal to us ideas, formless spiritual
essences. The supreme question about a work of art is out of how deep a life
does it spring. The painting of Gustave Moreau is the painting of ideas. The
deepest poetry of
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext"><u>Hamlet</u></span></span>
Shelley, the words of Hamlet bring our minds into contact with the eternal
wisdom, Plato&apos;s world of ideas. All the rest is the speculation of schoolboys for schoolboys.</p>
<p>

<p class="pdi">&mdash; The schoolmen were schoolboys once, Stephen said
superpolitely. Aristotle was once Plato&apos;s prize schoolboy.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And has remained so, one should hope, John Eglinton
sedately said. One can see him. A prize schoolboy with his diploma under his arm.</p>
<p> He laughed again at the now smiling bearded face.</p>
<p> Formless spiritual. Father, Son and Holy Breath. This verily is that. I am
the fire upon the altar. I am the sacrificial butter.</p>
<p> Dunlop, Judge, the noblest Roman of them all, A.E. Arval in heaven hight:
K.H, their master. Adepts of the great white lodge always watching to see if
they can help. The Christ with the bridesister, moisture of light, born of a
virgin, repentant sophia, departed to the plane of buddhi. Mrs Cooper Oakley
once glimpsed our very illustrious sister H.P.B&apos;s elemental.</p>
<p> O, fie! Out on&apos;t! Pfuiteufel! You naughtn&apos;t to look, missus, so you naughtn&apos;t when a lady&apos;s

<br> ashowing of her elemental.</p>
<p> Mr Best entered, tall, young, mild, light. He bore in his hand with grace a notebook, new, large, clean, bright.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That model schoolboy, Stephen said, would find Hamlet
musings about his princely soul, the improbable, insignificant and undramatic monologue, as shallow as Plato&apos;s.</p>
<p> John Eglinton, frowning, said, waxing wroth:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Upon my word it makes my blood boil to hear anyone compare Aristotle with Plato.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Which of the two, Stephen asked, would have banished Shakespeare from his commonwealth.</p>
<p> Unsheathe your dagger definitions. Streams of tendency and eons they
worship. God: noise in the street: very peripatetic. Space: what you damn well
have to see. Through spaces smaller than red globules of man&apos;s blood they
creepycrawl after Blake&apos;s buttocks into eternity of which this vegetable
world is but a shadow. Hold to the now, the here, through which all future plunges to the past.</p>
<p> Mr Best came forward, amiable, towards his colleague.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Haines is gone, he said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is he?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I was showing him Jubainville&apos;s book. He&apos;s
quite enthusiastic, don&apos;t you know, about Hyde&apos;s <u>Lovesongs of
Connacht</u>. I couldn&apos;t bring him in to hear the discussion. He&apos;s gone to Gill&apos;s to buy it.</p>
<p class="set">Bound thee, forth, my booklet quick
<br> To greet the callous public,
<br> Writ, I ween, &apos;twas not my wish
<br> In lean unlovely English.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The peatsmoke is going to his head, John Eglinton opined.</p>
<p> We feel in England. Penitent thief. Gone. I smoked his baccy. Green
twinkling stone. An emerald set in the ring of the sea.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; People do not know how dangerous lovesongs can be, the
auric egg of Russell said occultly. The movements which work revolutions in the
world are born out of the dreams and visions in a peasant&apos;s heart on the
hillside. For them the earth is not an exploitable ground but the living mother.
The rarefied air of the academy and the arena produce the sixshilling novel, the
musichall song. France produces the finest flower of corruption in Mallarm&eacute; but the desirable life is
<br><font color="green">{ms, 004}</font>
<br> revealed only to the poor of heart, the life of Homer&apos;s Phaeecians.</p>
<p> From these words Mr Best turned an unoffending face to Stephen.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Mallarm&eacute;, don&apos;t you know, he said, has
written those wonderful prose poems Stephen MacKenna used to read to me in
Paris. The one about <u>Hamlet</u>. He says: il se prom&egrave;ne, lisant au
livre de lui-m&ecirc;me, don&apos;t you <u>know</u>, reading the book of
himself. He describes <u>Hamlet</u> given in a French town, don&apos;t you know,
a provincial town. They advertised it.</p>
<p> His free hand graciously wrote tiny signs in air.</p>
<p class="center"><u>Hamlet</u></p>
<p class="center"><u>ou</u></p>
<p class="center"><u>Le Distrait</u></p>
<p class="center">pi&egrave;ce de Shakespeare</p>
<p> He repeated to John Eglinton&apos;s newgathered frown:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Pi&egrave;ce de Shakespeare</u>, don&apos;t you know.
It&apos;s so French. The French point of view. <u>Hamlet ou</u>&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The absentminded beggar, Stephen ended.</p>
<p> John Eglinton laughed.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, I suppose it would be, he said.
Excellent<a target="foot" id="fkz0090">&ordm;</a> people, no doubt, but distressingly shortsighted in some matters.</p>
<p> Sumptuous and stagnant exaggeration of murder.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A deathsman of the soul Robert Greene called him, Stephen
said. Not for nothing was he a butcher&apos;s son, wielding the sledded poleaxe
and spitting in his palms. Nine lives are taken off for his
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">dad&apos;s</span></span>

one. Our Father who art in purgatory. Khaki Hamlets don&apos;t hesitate to
shoot. The shambles in act five is a forecast of the concentration camp sung by Algy Swinburne.</p>
<p class="set"><u>Whelps and dams of murderous foes whom none</u>
<br> <u>But we had spared</u>&nbsp;&hellip;.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He will have it that Hamlet is a ghoststory, John
Eglinton said for Mr Best&apos;s behoof. Like the fat boy in Pickwick he wants to make our flesh creep.</p>
<p> List! List! O list!</p>
<p> My flesh hears him<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span>: creeping, hears.</p>
<p class="set"><u>If thou didst ever</u>&nbsp;&hellip;.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What is a ghost? Stephen said with
<br><font color="green">{ms, 005}</font>
<br> tingling energy. One who has faded into impalpability through death,
through absence, through change of manners. Elizabethan London lay as far from
Stratford as corrupt Paris lies from virgin Dublin. Who is the ghost, returning
to the world that has forgotten him? Who is King Hamlet?</p>
<p> John Eglinton shifted his spare body, leaning back to judge.</p>
<p> Lifted.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It is this hour of a June day, Stephen said, begging with
a swift glance their hearing. The flag is up on the playhouse by the bankside.
The bear Sackerson growls in the bearpit near
it<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span>, Paris garden.
Canvasclimber<a target="foot" id="fkz0091">&ordm;</a> who sailed with Drake chew
their sausages among the groundlings.</p>
<p> Local colour. Work in all you know. Make them accomplices.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Shakespeare has left the huguenot&apos;s house in Silver
street and walks by the swanmews along the riverbank. But he does not stay to
feed the pen chivying her brood towards the rushes. The swan of Avon has other thoughts.</p>
<p> Composition of place.
<a name="gn1005a" href="../../ff/unbs/gn1all.htm#gn1005a">Ignatius Loyola, make haste to help me!</a></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The play begins. A player comes on under the shadow, clad
in the castoff mail of a court buck, a wellset man with a bass voice. It is the
ghost, King Hamlet: and the player is Shakespeare. He speaks the words of his
part to Burbage, the young player who stands before him, calling him by a name,</p>
<p class="set"><u>Hamlet, I am thy father&apos;s spirit</u>,</p>
<p class="flush">bidding him list. To a son he speaks, the son of his soul, the
prince, young Hamlet and to the son of his body, Hamlet Shakespeare who has died
in Stratford that his namesake may live for ever.</p>
<p> Is it possible that that player Shakespeare, a ghost by absence, and in the
vesture of the elder Hamlet, a ghost by death, speaking his own words to his own
son&apos;s name (had Hamlet Shakespeare lived he would have been prince
Hamlet&apos;s twin) is it possible or probable, I want to know, that he did not
draw or foresee the logical conclusion of those premises? I am the murdered
father: you are the dispossessed son: your mother is the guilty queen, Ann Shakespeare, born Hathaway?
<br><font color="green">{ms, 006}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But this prying into the family life of a great man, Russell began impatiently.</p>
<p> Art thou there, truepenny?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Interesting only to the parish clerk. I mean, we have the
plays. I mean when we read the poetry of <u>King Lear</u> what is it to us how
the poet lived? As for living our servants can do that for us, Villiers de
l&apos;Isle said. Peeping and prying into the
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">greengroom</span></span> greenroom
gossip of the day, the poet&apos;s drinking, the
poets&apos;<a target="foot" id="fkz0092">&ordm;</a> debts. We have <u>King Lear</u>. And it is immortal.</p>

John Eglinton&apos;s carping voice asked. Her ghost at least has been laid for
ever. She died, for literature at least, before she was born.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; She died, Stephen retorted, sixtyseven years after she
was born. She saw him into and out of the world. She took his first embraces.
She bore and bred his children and she put pennies on his eyes to keep his eyelids closed when he lay on his deathbed.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 007}</font> </p>
<p> Mother&apos;s deathbed. Candle. The sheeted mirror. Who brought me into this
world lies there, bronzelidded, under few cheap flowers. <u>Liliata rutilantium.</u></p>
<p> I wept alone.</p>
<p> John Eglinton looked in the tangled glowworm of his lamp.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The world believes that Shakespeare made a mistake, he
said, and got out of it as quickly and as best he could.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Bosh! Stephen said rudely. A man of genius makes no
mistakes. His errors are volitional and are the portals of discovery.</p>
<p> Portal of discovery
opened<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.
The</span></span> <font color="black">to let in

<font color="black">said</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>
shrewdly, is not a useful portal of discovery, one should imagine. What useful
discovery did Socrates learn from his wife Xanthippe?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Dialectic, Stephen answered: and from his mother how to
bring thought into the world. But neither the midwife&apos;s lore nor the
caudlelectures saved him from the archons of Sinn Fein and their cup of hemlock.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But Ann Hathaway? Mr Best&apos;s quiet voice said
forgetfully. Yes, we seem to have forgotten her as Shakespeare himself forgot her.</p>
<p> His face went from brooder&apos;s beard to carper&apos;s skull, to remind,
to chide them kindly, then to the pinkbald quaker pumpkin, guiltless though maligned.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He had a good groatsworth of wit, Stephen said, and no
truant memory. He carried a memory in his wallet as he trudged to Romeville
whistling <u>The Girl I left behind me</u>. If the earthquake did not time
<u>Venus and Adonis</u> we should know where to place poor Wat, sitting in his
form; the studded bridle and her blue windows. That memory lay in the bedchamber
of every light-of-love in London. Is Katharine the shrew illfavoured? Hortensio
calls her young and beautiful. Do you think the writer of <u>Antony and</u>
<br><font color="green">{ms, 008}</font>
<br> <u>Cleopatra</u>, a passionate pilgrim, had his eyes in the back of his
head that he chose the ugliest doxy in all Warwickshire to lie withal? Good: he
left her and gained the world of men: But his boywomen are the women of a boy.
Their life, thought, speech are lent them by males. He chose badly? He was
chosen, it seems to me. If others have their will Ann hath a way.

<font color="black">book</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>, gladly, brightly.</p>
<p> He murmured then with blond delight for all:</p>

<br> <u>These pretty countryfolk would lie</u></p>
<p> Paris: the wellpleased pleaser.</p>

<p class="pdi">&mdash; Are you going? John Eglinton&apos;s eyebrows asked. Shall

<p> Anxiously he glanced in the cone of lamplight where three lighted faces shone.</p>
<p> See this. Remember.</p>
<p> Stephen looked down on a wide headless caubeen, hung on his ashplant handle over his knee. My casque and sword.</p>
<p> Listen.</p>

I think he has that queer thing genius. Do you think he has genius really? Yeats
admired his phrase <u>as in wild earth a Grecian vase</u>. Did he? I hope
you&apos;ll be able to come tonight. Malachi Mulligan is coming too. Moore asked
him to bring Haines. Did you hear Miss Mitchell&apos;s joke about Moore and
Martyn. That Moore is Martyn&apos;s wild oats? Awfully clever, isn&apos;t it?
They remind one of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza. Our national epic has yet to
come. Moore is the man for it. A knight of the rueful countenance here in
Dublin. With a saffron kilt? O&apos;Neill Russell? O, yes, he must speak the
grand old tongue. And his Dulcinea? James Stephens is doing some clever
sketches. We are becoming important, it seems.</p>
<p> Cordelia. Cordoglio. Lir&apos;s loneliest daughter.</p>
<p> Now your best French polish.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Thank you very much, Mr Russell, Stephen said, rising. If
you will be so kind as to give the letter to Mr Norman&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, yes. If he considers it important of course it will go in. We have so much correspondence.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I understand, Stephen said. Thank you.</p>
<p> The pigs&apos; paper. Bullockbefriending.</p>
<p> Synge has promised me an article for <u>Dana</u> too. Are we going to be read? I feel we are. The

<br> Gaelic League wants something in Irish. I hope you will come round tonight. Bring Starkey.</p>
<p> Stephen sat down.</p>
<p> The quaker librarian came from the leavetakers. Blushing, his mask said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Mr Dedalus, your views are most illuminating.</p>
<p> He creaked to and fro, tiptoing up the altitude of a chopine, and, covered by the noise of outgoing, said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is it your view, then, that she was not faithful to the poet?</p>
<p> Alarmed face asks me. Why did he come? Courtesy or an inner light?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Where there is a reconciliation, Stephen said, there must have been first a sundering.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes.</p>
<p> Christfox in leather trews, hiding, a runaway in blighted treeforks from hue
and cry. Knowing no vixen, walking lonely in the chase. Women he won to him,
tender people, a whore of Babylon, justices&apos; ladies, wives of tapsters. Fox
and geese. And in New Place a slack dishonoured body that once was comely, once
as sweet, as fresh as cinnamon, now her leaves falling, all, bare, frighted of the narrow grave and unforgiven.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes. So you think&nbsp;&hellip;.</p>
<p> The door closed behind the outgoer.</p>
<p> Rest, suddenly, possessed the discreet vaulted cell, the rest of warm and brooding air.</p>
<p> A vestal&apos;s lamp.</p>
<p> Here he ponders things that were not: what Caesar would have done had he
believed the soothsayer:
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext"><font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">unread</span></font></span></span>
what might have been: possibilities of the possible as possible: on things not
known: what name Achilles bore when he lived among women.</p>
<p> Coffined thoughts around me, in mummy cases, embalmed in spice of words.
Thoth, god of libraries, a birdgod, moonycrowned. And I heard the voice of that
Egyptian highpriest. In &ldquo;painted chambers loaded with tilebooks&rdquo;.</p>
<p> They are still. Once quick in the live brains of men. Still: but
<br><font color="green">{ms, 011}</font>
<br> the itch of death is in them, to tell me in my ear a maudlin tale, urge me to wreak their will.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Certainly, John Eglinton mused, of all great men he is
the most enigmatic. We know nothing but that he lived and suffered. A shadow hangs over all the rest.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But <u>Hamlet</u> is so personal, isn&apos;t it, Mr Best
pleaded. I mean, a kind of personal private paper, don&apos;t you know, of his
private life. I mean, I don&apos;t care a button, don&apos;t you know, who is
killed or who
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><font color="black">is
guilty</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font> &nbsp;&hellip;.</p>
<p> He rested

<font color="black">an</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>
innocent book, smiling his defiance, on the edge of the desk. His private
papers. <u>Ta an bad ar an tir. Taim in mo sagart.</u> In my priest. Littlejohn, put beurla on it.</p>
<p> Littlejohn Eglinton said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I was prepared for paradoxes from what Malachi Mulligan
told me but I may as well warn you that if you want to shake my belief that
Shakespeare is Hamlet you have a stern task before you.</p>
<p> Bea<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps"><sub>unread</sub></span></font> with me.</p>
<p> Stephen withstood the bane of miscreant eyes glinting from under stern
wrinkled brows. Basilisk eyes. <u>E quando vede l&apos;uomo l&apos;attosca.</u>
Messer Brunetto, I thank thee for the word.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; As we, or Dana, weave and unweave our bodies, Stephen
said, from day to day, their
<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">unread</span></font>
shuttled to and fro, so does the artist weave and unweave his image. And as the
mole on my right shoulder is where it was when I was born, though all my body
has been woven of new stuff time after time, so through the ghost of the unquiet
father the image of the unliving son looks forth. In the intense instant of imagination, wherein the mind,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 012}</font>
<br> Shelley says, is a fading coal, that which I was is that
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext"><font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">unread</span></font></span></span>
which I am and that which in possibility I shall come to be. So, in the future,
sister of the past, I see that I shall see myself as I sit here now today but by
reflection from that which then I shall be.</p>
<p> Drummond of Hawthornden helped you at that stile.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, Mr Bet<a target="foot" id="fkz0093">&ordm;</a> said
youngly. I feel Hamlet quite young. The bitterness might be from the father but
the passages with Ophelia are surely from the son.</p>
<p> Has the wrong sow by the ear.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That mole is the last to go, Stephen said, laughing.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; If that were the birthmark of genius, John Eglinton said
with a sour mow, genius would be a drug in the market. The plays of
Shakespeare&apos;s later years which Renan admired so much breathe another spirit.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The spirit of reconciliation, the quaker librarian said appeasingly.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; There can be no reconciliation, Stephen said, if there has not been a sundering.</p>
<p> Said that.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; If you want to know what are the events which cast their
shadow over the period of <u>King Lear</u>, <u>Othello</u>, <u>Hamlet</u>,
<u>Troilus and Cressida</u> look to see when and how the shadow lifts. What
softens the heart of a man, shipwrecked in life&apos;s storms, tried, like
another Ulysses, Pericles, prince of Tyre?</p>
<p> Head, redconecapped, buffeted, brineblinded.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A child, a girl, placed in his arms, Marina.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The leaning of sophists towards the bypaths of apocrypha
is a constant quantity, John Eglinton detected. The highroads are dreary but they lead to the town.</p>
<p> Good Bacon: smoked musty. Cypherjugglers going the highroads. What town, good masters? Mummed
<br><font color="green">{ms, 013}</font>
<br> in names: A.&nbsp;E, eon: Magee, John Eglinton. East of the sun, west of
the moon: Tir nan Og. Booted the twain and staved.</p>
<p class="set"><u>How many miles to Dublin?</u>
<br> <u>Three score and ten, sir.</u>
<br> <u>Will we be there by candlelight?</u></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Mr Brandes accepts
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">in</span></span> it, Stephen said,
as the first play of the closing period.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Does he? What does Mr Sidney Lee, or Mr Simon Lazarus as some aver his name is, say of it?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Marina, Stephen said, a child of storm, Miranda, a
wonder, Perdita, that which was lost. What was lost is given back to him: his
daughter&apos;s child. <u>My dearest wife</u>, Pericles says, <u>was like this
maid</u>. Will any man love the daughter if he has not loved the mother?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The art of being a grandfather, Mr Best murmured.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Will he not see reborn in her, with the memory of his own youth added, another image?</p>
<p> Do you know what you are talking about? Love, yes. Word known to all men.
<u>Amor vero aliquid alicui bonum vult unde et ea quae concupiscimus</u>&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; His own image to a man with that queer thing genius is
the standard of all experience, material and moral. Such an appeal will touch
him. The images of other males of his brood will repel him. He will see in them
grotesque attempts of nature to foretell or to repeat himself.</p>
<p> The benign forehead of the quaker librarian enkindled rosily with hope.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I hope Mr Dedalus will work out his theory for the
enlightenment<a target="foot" id="fkz0094">&ordm;</a> of the public. And we
ought to mention another Irish commentator Mr Frank Harris. His articles on
Shakespeare in the <u>Saturday Review</u>
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">are</span></span> were surely
brilliant. Oddly enough he too draws for us an unhappy relation with the dark lady
<br><font color="green">{ms, 014}</font>
<br> of the sonnets. The favoured rival is William Herbert, earl of Pembroke. I
own that if the poet is to be rejected such a rejection would seem more in
harmony with - what shall I say? &mdash; our notions of what ought not to have been.</p>
<p> Felicitously he ceased and held a meek head among them, auk&apos;s egg, prize of their fray.</p>
<p> He thous her with grave husbandwords. Dost love, Miriam? Dost love thy man?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That may be too, Stephen said.
There<span class="strike"><span class="striketext"><font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps"><sub>unread</sub></span></font></span></span>
is a saying of Goethe&apos;s which Mr Magee likes to quote. Beware of what you
wish for in youth because you
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><font color="black">will</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>
get it in middle life. Why does he send to one who is a buonaroba, a bay where
all men ride, a maid of honour with a scandalous girlhood, a lordling to woo for
him. He was himself a lord of language and had made himself a coistrel gentleman
and he had written <u>Romeo and Juliet</u>. Why? Belief in himself has been
untimely killed. He was overborne in a cornfield first, (a ryefield, I should
say) and he will never be a victor in his own eyes after. Nor play victoriously
the game of laugh and lie down<a target="foot" id="fkz0095">&ordm;</a>. Assumed
dongiovannism will not save him. No later undoing will undo the first undoing.
If the shrew is worsted there remains to her woman&apos;s invisible weapon.
There is, I feel in the words, some goad of the flesh driving him into a new
passion, a darker shadow of the first, darkening also his own understanding of
himself. A like fate awaits him and the double rages commingle in a whirlpool</p>
<p> They listen. And in the porches of their ears I pour.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Those who are done to death in sleep cannot know the

unless the creator endows their souls
<br><font color="green">{ms, 015}</font>
<br> with that knowledge in the life to come. The soul has been before stricken
mortally, a poison poured in the porch of a sleeping ear. The poisoning and the
lust that urged it the ghost of King Hamlet could not know of were it not
endowed with knowledge by its creator. That is why the speech is always turned
elsewhere, backward. Ravisher and ravished go with him from Lucrece to Imogen.
He goes back, weary of the creation he has piled up to hide himself from
himself, to lick his sore. But, because loss is his gain, he passes on towards
eternity in undiminished personality, untaught by the wisdom he has uttered or
by the laws he has revealed. His beaver is up. He is a ghost
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><font color="black">a
shadow now</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font> or the
wind around Elsinore&apos;s rocks or the sea&apos;s voice, a voice heard only in
the heart of him who is the substance of his shadow, the son consubstantial with the father.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Amen! was responded from the doorway.</p>
<p> Hast thou found me, O mine enemy?</p>
<p> A ribald face, sullen an instant, Buck Mulligan came forward, blithe in his
motley towards the greeting of their smiles. My telegram.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You were speaking of the gaseous vertebrate if I mistake
not<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span>? he asked of Stephen.</p>
<p> Primrosevested he greeted gaily with his doffed Panama as with a bauble.</p>

<p class="set">Glo-ria in ex-cel-sis De-o.</p>
<p> He lifts his hands. Veils fall. O, flowers! Bells with bells with bells aquiring.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, indeed, the quaker librarian said. A most
interesting discussion. Mr Mulligan, I&apos;ll be bound, has his theory too of
the play<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span> and of
Shakespeare. All sides of life should be represented.</p>
<p> He smiled on all sides equally.</p>
<p> Buck Mulligan, thought, puzzled:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Shakespeare? he said. I seem to know the name.</p>
<p> A flying sunny smile rayed in his loose features.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; To be sure, he said, remembering brightly. The chap that writes like Synge.</p>
<p> Mr Best turned to him.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Haines missed you, he said. Did you meet him? He&apos;ll
meet you after at the D.B.C. He&apos;s gone to Gill&apos;s to buy Hyde&apos;s <u>Lovesongs of Connacht</u>.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I came through the museum, Buck Mulligan said. Was he here?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The bard&apos;s fellowcountrymen, John Eglinton answered,
are rather tired perhaps of our
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">brilliancy</span></span>
brilliancies of theorising. I hear that an actress is playing <u>Hamlet</u> in
Dublin. Has no-one made him out to be an Irishman? He swears by saint Patrick.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The most brilliant of all is that story of Wilde&apos;s,
Mr Best said, lifting his brilliant notebook. That
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext"><u>Picture</u></span></span>
<font color="black"><u>Portrait</u></font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>
<u>of Mr W.H.</u> where he proves that the sonnets were written by a Willie Hughes, a man all hues.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; For Willie Hughes, is it not? the quaker librarian asked.</p>
<p> <font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><font color="black">Or
Hughy Wills?</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I mean, for Willie Hughes, Mr
<br><font color="green">{ms, 017}</font>
<br> Best said, amending his gloss easily. Of course it&apos;s all paradox,
don&apos;t you know, Hughes and hews and hues, the colour, but it&apos;s so
typical the way he works it out. It&apos;s the very essence of Wilde, don&apos;t you know. The light touch.</p>
<p> His glance touched their faces lightly as he smiled, a blond ephebe. Tame essence of Wilde.</p>
<p> You&apos;re damn witty. Three drams of usquebaugh you drank with Dan Deasy&apos;s ducats.</p>
<p> How much did I spend. O, few shillings.</p>
<p> For a plump of pressmen. Humour wet and dry.</p>
<p> Witty. You would give your five wits for his youth&apos;s proud livery, the lineaments of gratified desire.</p>
<p> Take her for me. In pairing time. Yea, turtledove her.</p>
<p> Eve. O naked wheatbellied sin. A snake coils her. Fang in&apos;s kiss.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do you think it is only a
paradox<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span>? the quaker
librarian was asking. The mocker is never taken seriously when he is serious.</p>
<p> They talked seriously of mocker&apos;s seriousness.</p>
<p> Buck Mulligan&apos;s again heavy face eyed Stephen awhile. Then, shaking his
head, he came near, drew a folded telegram from his pocket. His mobile lips read, smiling with new delight.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Telegram! he said. Wonderful inspiration! Telegram! A papal bull!</p>
<p> He sat on a corner of the unlit desk, reading aloud joyfully:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without
incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done.</u> Signed: Dedalus. Where
did you launch it from. The kips? No. College Green. Have you drunk the four
quid? Telegram! Malachi Mulligan, The Ship, Middle Abbey Street. O, you peerless
mummer! O, you priestified Kinchite!</p>
<p> Joyfully he thrust
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the</span></span> message and
envelope into his pocket but crooned
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">querulously:</span></span>
<font color="black">in a querulous brogue:</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>
<br><font color="green">{ms, 018}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It&apos;s what I&apos;m telling you, mister honey,
it&apos;s queer and sick we were, Haines and myself, the time himself brought it
in. And we one hour and two hours and three hours in Connery&apos;s sitting
civil waiting for pints apiece.
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><font color="black">He
wailed softly:</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font> And
we to be there and you to be unbeknownst sending your conglomerations the way we
to have our tongues out a yard long like the drouthy clerics do be fainting for a pussful.</p>
<p> Stephen laughed.</p>
<p> Quickly and warningfully Buck Mulligan bent down.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The tramper Synge is looking for you, he said, to murder
you. He heard you pissed on his halldoor in Glasthule. He&apos;s out to murder you in pampooties.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Me! Stephen exclaimed. That was your contribution to literature.</p>
<p> Buck Mulligan gleefully bent back, laughing
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><font color="black">up</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>
at the dark eavesdropping ceiling.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Murder you! he laughed.</p>
<p> Harsh gargoyle face that warred against over our mess of hash of lights in
rue Saint Andr&eacute; des Arts. In words of words for words, palabras. Oisin
with Patrick. Faunman he met in Clamart woods, brandishing a winebottle.
C&apos;est vendredi saint! His image, wandering, he met. I mine. I met a fool i&apos;the forest.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Mr Lyster, an attendant said with the door ajar.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; &hellip;.. in which everyone can find his own. So Mr
Justice Madden in his <u>Diary of Master William Silence</u> has found the
hunting terms&nbsp;&hellip;. Yes? What is it?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; There&apos;s a gentleman here, sir, the attendant said,
coming forward and offering a card. From the <u>Freeman</u>. He wants to see the
files of the <u>Kilkenny People</u> for last year.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Certainly, certainly, certainly. Is the gentleman&nbsp;&hellip;...?</p>
<p> He took the
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><font color="black">eager</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>
card, glanced, not saw, laid down
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><font color="black">unglanced</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>
looked, asked, creaked, asked:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is he&nbsp;&hellip;..? O, there!</p>
<p> Brisk as a galliard he was
off<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">:
and</span></span><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>
out. In the daylit corridor he talked with all the pains of zeal
<br><font color="green">{ms, 019}</font>
<br> in duty bound, most fair, most kind, most honest broadbrim.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; This gentleman? <u>Freeman&apos;s Journal</u>?
<u>Kilkenny People</u>? To be sure. Good day, sir. <u>Kilkenny</u>&nbsp;&hellip;. We have certainly&nbsp;&hellip;.</p>
<p> A patient silhouette waited, listening.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; All<a target="foot" id="fkz0097">&ordm;</a> the leading
provincial. <u>Northern Whig</u>. <u>Cork Examiner</u>. <u>Enniscorthy
Guardian</u>. Last <u>year</u>. 1903&nbsp;&hellip;. Will you
please&nbsp;&hellip; Evans, conduct this gentleman&nbsp;&hellip; If you just
follow the atten&nbsp;&hellip;. Or, please allow me&nbsp;&hellip;. This way&nbsp;&hellip; Please, sir&nbsp;&hellip;.</p>
<p> Voluble, dutiful, he led the way all the principal papers, a bowing figure following his hasty heels.</p>
<p> The door closed.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The sheeny! Buck Mulligan cried.</p>
<p> He jumped up and snatched the card.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What&apos;s his name? Ikey Moses? Bloom.</p>
<p> He rattled on:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Jehovah, collector of prepuces,
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><font color="black">is no
more.</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font> I found him
over in the museum where I went to hail the foamborn Aphrodite. The Greek mouth
that has never been twisted in prayer. Every day we must do homage to her.
<u>Life of life, thy lips enkindle</u>&nbsp;..</p>
<p> Suddenly he turned to Stephen.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He knows you, he said. He knows your old fellow. O, I
fear me, he is Greeker than the Greeks. His pale Galilean eyes were upon her
fatty parts.
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><font color="black">Venus
Callipyge, the world&apos;s

thunder of those loins! <u>The god pursuing the maiden hid.</u></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; We want to hear more, John Eglinton decided with Mr
Best&apos;s approval. We begin to be interested in Mrs S. Till now we had
thought of her, if at all, as a patient Griselda, a Penelope stay-at-home.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Antisthenes, pupil of Gorgias, Stephen said, took the
palm of beauty from Kyrios Menelaus&apos; broodmare,
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><font color="black">Argive</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>
Helen, and handed it to poor Penelope. Twenty years he lived in London and,
during part of that time, he drew a salary equal to that of the lord chancellor
of Ireland. His life was rich. His art, more than the art of feudalism as Walt
Whitman called it, is the art of surfeit. Hot herringpies, green mugs of sack,
honeysauces, gooseberried pigeons, ringocandies. Sir Walter Raleigh, when they arrested him,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 020}</font>
<br> had half a million francs on his back. The gombeenwoman Eliza Tudor had
underlinen enough to vie with her of Sheba. Twenty years he dallied there. You
know Bannington&apos;s story of the burgher&apos;s wife who bade Dick Burbage to
her bed after she had seen him in Richard III and how Shakespeare took the cow
by the horns and, when Burbage knocked, answered from the blankets
&ldquo;William the conqueror came first.&rdquo; And mistress Fitton, mount and
cry O, and his dainty birdsnies, lady Penelope Rich, and the punks of the bankside a penny a time.</p>
<p>

<p> Encore vingt sous. Nous ferons des petites cochonneries. Minette? Tu veux?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The height of fine society. And sir William Davenant of
Oxford&apos;s mother with her cup of canary for any cock canary.</p>
<p> Buck Mulligan prayed
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">in</span></span>
<font color="black">with</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>

<p class="pdi">&mdash; Blessed Margaret Mary Anycock!</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And Harry of six wives&apos; daughter. And other lady
friends from neighbour seats as Lawn Tennyson, gentleman poet, has it. But all
those twenty years what do you suppose poor Penelope in Stratford was doing behind the diamond panes?</p>
<p> Do and do. Thing done. Thing done.
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><font color="black">In</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>
A rosery of Fetter lane of Gerard, herbalist, he walks, greyedauburn. An azured
harebell like her veins. Violets,
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><font color="black">the</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>
lids of Juno&apos;s eyes. He walks. One life is all. One body. Do. But do. Afar,
in a reek of lust, in squalor, hands are laid on whiteness.</p>
<p> Buck Mulligan rapped John Eglinton&apos;s desk sharply.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Whom do you suspect? he said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Say that he is the spurned lover in the sonnets. Once
spurned twice spurned. But the court wanton spurned him for a lord, dear my love.</p>
<p> Love that dare not speak its name.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; As an Englishman, you mean, John sturdy Eglinton
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">said</span></span>
<font color="black">put in</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>, he loved a lord.</p>
<p> Old wall where sudden lizards flash. At Charenton I watched them.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It seems so, Stephen said, when he wants to do for him,
and for all other and singular uneared wombs, the office an ostler does for the
stallion. Maybe, like Socrates, he had a midwife to mother as he had a
<br><font color="green">{ms, 021}</font>
<br> shrew to wife. But she, the wanton, did not break a bedvow. Two deeds are
rank in that ghost&apos;s mind a broken vow and the dullbrained yokel on whom
her favour has declined. Sweet Anne, I take it, was hot in the blood. Once a wooer, twice a wooer.</p>
<p> Stephen turned boldly in his chair.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The burden of proof is with you not with me, he said
frowning. If you deny that in the
<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font>
scene in <u>Hamlet</u> he has branded her with infamy tell me why there is no
mention of her during the thirtyfour years between the day he married her and
the day she buried him. O, yes, there is. In the years when he was living richly
in royal London to pay a debt she had to borrow five bob from her father&apos;s
shepherd. Explain you then. Explain
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">his</span></span>
<font color="black">the</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>
swansong too<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span> wherein he has commended her to posterity.</p>
<p> He faced their silence.
<br> To whom thus Eglinton: You mean the will.
<br> But that has been explained, I believe, by jurists.
<br> She was entitled to her widow&apos;s dower
<br> At common law. His legal knowledge was great
<br> Our judges tell us.</p>
<p> Him Satan fleers,
<br> Mocker:</p>
<p> And therefore he left out her name
<br> From the first draft but he did not leave out
<br> The presents for his granddaughter, for his daughters,
<br> For his sister, for his old cronies in Stratford
<br> And in London. And therefore when he was urged,
<br> As I believe, to name her
<br> He left her his
<br> Secondbest
<br> Bed.</p>
<p> Punkt.
<br> Leftherhis
<br> Secondbest
<br> Leftherhis
<br> Bestabed
<br> Secabest
<br> Leftabed</p>
<p> Woa!</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Pretty countryfolk had few chattles then, John Eglinton
observed, as they have still if our peasant plays are true to type.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He was a rich country gentleman,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 022}</font>
<br> Stephen said, with a coat of arms and landed estate. Why did he not leave
her his best bed if he wished her to snore away the rest of her nights in peace?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It is clear that there were two beds, Mr Best said finely</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Separatio a mensa et a thalamo</u>, said Buck Mulligan and was smiled on.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Antiquity mentions famous beds, John Eglinton puckered,
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">smiling</span></span>
<font color="black">bedsmiling</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>. Let me think.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do you mean he died so? Mr Best asked with concern. I mean&nbsp;&hellip;.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He died dead drunk, Buck Mulligan stated. <u>A quart of
ale is a dish for a king.</u> O, I must tell you what Dowden said!</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What?
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><font color="black">asked</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>
Besteglinton</p>
<p> William Shakespeare and company, limited.

<p class="pdi">&mdash; Lovely! Buck Mulligan suspired amorously. I asked him
what he thought of the charge of pederasty brought against the bard. He lifted
his hands and said: <u>All we can say is that life ran very high in those days</u>. Lovely!</p>
<p> Catamite.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The sense of beauty leads
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">m</span></span> us astray, Mr Best with some sadness said.</p>
<p> Will they wrest from us, from me, the palm of beauty?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And the sense of property, Stephen said. He drew Shylock
out of his own long pocket. The son of a maltjobber and moneylender he was
himself a cornjobber and moneylender, with ten tods of corn hoarded in famine
years. His borrowers are no doubt
the<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps"><sub>unread</sub></span></font>
divers of worship mentioned by Chettle Falstaff who reported his uprightness of
dealing. He sued a fellowplayer for the price of a few bags of malt and exacted
his pound of flesh in interest for every money lent. How can could Aubrey&apos;s
ostler and callboy get rich quick? All events brought grist to his mill. Shylock
chimes with the jewbaiting that followed the hanging and quartering of the

<p class="pdi">&mdash; Prove that he was a jew, John Eglinton dared,
expectantly. Your dean of studies holds he was a holy Roman.</p>
<p> <u>Sufflamindanus sum.</u></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He was made in Germany, Stephen replied, as the champion French polisher of Italian scandals.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A myriadminded man, Mr Best reminded. Coleridge called him myriadminded.</p>
<p> <u>Amplius. In societate humana hoc est maxime necessarium ut sit amicitia inter multos</u></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Saint Thomas, Stephen began&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Ora pro nobis</u>, Buck Mulligan groaned, sinking to a chair.</p>
<p> He keened to a rune:</p>
<p class="pdiset">&mdash; It&apos;s destroyed we are from this day,
<br> It&apos;s destroyed we are surely.</p>
<p> All smiled</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Saint Thomas, Stephen smiling said, writing of incest
from a standpoint different from that of the Viennese school Mr Magee spoke of,
likens it in his wise and curious way to an avarice of the emotions. He means
that the love so given to one near in blood is covetously withheld from a
stranger who, it may be, hungers for it. Jews, whom christians tax with avarice,
are of all races the most given to intermarriage. But accusations are made in
anger. The christian laws which built up the hoards of the jews (for, like the
lollards, storm was their shelter) bound their affections too with hoops of
steel. Whether these be sins or virtues old Nobodaddy will tell us at the
doomsday leet. But a man who holds so
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">closely</span></span>
<font color="black">tightly</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>
to what he calls his rights over what he calls his debts will hold tightly also to what he calls his rights over her
<br><font color="green">{ms, 024}</font>
<br> whom he calls his wife. No sir smile neighbour shall covet his ox or his
wife or his manservant or his maidservant or his jackass.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Or jennyass, Buck Mulligan antiphoned.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Gentle Will is being roughly handled, gently Mr Best said gently</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Which will? asked Buck Mulligan. We are getting mixed.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The will to live, John Eglinton philosophised. Poor Ann,
Will&apos;s widow, is the will to die.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Requiescat</u>, Stephen said. She lies laid out in
stark stiffness in that secondbest bed even though you prove that a bed in those
days was as rare as a motorcar is now and that its carvings were the wonder of
seven parishes. In old age she takes up with gospellers (one stayed with her at
New Place and drank a quart of sack the town council paid for but in which bed
he slept it skills not) and heard she had a soul. Venus has twisted her lips in
prayer. Agenbite of inwit, remorse of conscience. It is an age of exhausted whoredom groping for its god.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That appears to be true, John Eglinton said,
chronolologos. The ages succeed one another. But it has been said that a
man&apos;s worst enemies shall be those of his own house and family. I feel that
A.E. is right. What do we care for his wife or father? I should say that only
family poets have family lives. Falstaff was not a family man. I feel that the fat knight is his supreme creation.</p>
<p> Lean, he lay back. Shy, deny thy kindred, the unco guid. Shy, supping with
blasphemers, he sneaks the cup. A sire in Ultonian Antrim bade it him. Visits
him here at quarter tense. Mr Magee, sir, there&apos;s a gentleman to see you.
Me? Says he&apos;s your father, sir. Give me a Wordsworth. Enter Magee Mor
Matthew, a rugged, rough, rugheaded kern,
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">with</span></span> his nether

<p> Hurrying to her squalid deathlair from gay Paris on the quayside I touched
his hand. The voice, new warmth, speaking. Dr Bob Kenny is attending her. The
eyes that wish me well. But do not know me.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A father, Stephen said, battling with
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><font color="black">against</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>
hopelessness, is a necessary

He wrote the play in the months that followed his father&apos;s death. If you
hold that he, a greying man with two marriageable daughters with thirty five
years of life, nel mezzo del cammin, and fifty of experience is the beardless
undergraduate from Wittenberg then you must hold that his seventyyear old mother
is the lustful queen. No. The corpse of John Shakespeare does not walk the
night. From hour to hour he rots and rots. He rests, disarmed of fatherhood,
having devised that mystical estate upon his son. Boccaccio&apos;s Calandrino
was the first and last man who felt himself with child. Fatherhood, in the sense
of conscious begetting, is unknown to man. It is a mystical estate, an apostolic
succession, from only begetter to only begotten. On this mystery and not on the
madonna whom the cunning Italian intellect flung to the mob of Europe the church
is founded and founded
irremovably<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span> because
founded, like the world, macro and microcosm, upon the void. Upon incertitude,
upon unlikelihood. <u>Amor matris</u>, subjective and objective genitive, may be
the only true thing in life. Paternity may be a legal fiction. Who is the father
of any son that any son should love him or he any son?</p>
<p> What the hell are you driving at?</p>
<p> I know. Shut up. Blast you. I have reasons.</p>
<p> Amplius. Adhuc. Rursus. Postea.</p>
<p> Are you condemned to do this?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; They are sundered by bodily shame so steadfast that the
criminal annals of the world, stained with all other incests and bestialities do
not record its breach. Sons with mothers, sires with daughters, nephews with grandmothers,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 026}</font>
<br> queens with prize bulls. The unborn son mars
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">her</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>
beauty, born, he brings pain, divides affection, increases care. He is a new
male<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span>: his growth is
his father&apos;s decline, his youth his father&apos;s envy, his friend his
father&apos;s enemy. What links them in nature? An instant of blind rut.</p>
<p> Am I a father? If I were?</p>
<p> Shrunken uncertain hand.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Sabellius, the African, subtlest of heresiarchs held that
the Father was Himself His Own Son. The bulldog of Aquin, with whom no word
shall be impossible, refutes him. Well, if the father
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><font color="black">who has
not a son</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font> be not a
father can the son who has not a father be a son? When
Rutland-Bacon-Southampton-Shakespeare wrote <u>Hamlet</u> he was not the father
of his own son merely but being no more a son, he was and felt himself the
father of all his race, the father of his own grandfather, the father of his
unborn grandson who, by the same token, never was born for nature, as Mr Magee understands her, abhors perfection.</p>
<p> Eglintoneyes, quick with pleasure, looked up shybrightly.</p>
<p> Flatter. Rarely. But flatter.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Himself his own father, Buck Mulligan told himself. Wait.
I am big with child. I have an unborn child in Minerv my brain. Pallas Athena! A
play! The play&apos;s the thing! Let me parturiate!</p>
<p> He clasped his paunchbrow with
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><font color="black">both</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>
birthaiding hands.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; As for his family, Stephen said, his mother&apos;s name
lives in the forest of Arden. Her death brought from him the scene with Volumnia
in
<u>Coriolanus</u><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span>.

has revealed it in the sonnets where there is will in overplus. Like John o&apos;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 028}</font>
<br> Gaunt his name is dear to him, as dear as the coat and crest he toadied
for, dearer than his glory of the greatest shakescene in the country.
What&apos;s in his name? That is what we ask ourselves in childhood when we
write the name that we are told is ours. A star, a star shining by day, a
firedrake, rose at his birth. It shone by day in the heavens alone and by night
it shone over delta in Cassiopeia, the recumbent constellation which is the
signature of his initial among the stars. Pillar of cloud and pillar of fire,
eh? His eyes watched it, lowlying on the horizon, eastward of the bear, as he
walked by the slumberous summer fields at midnight returning from Shottery and from her arms.</p>
<p> Both satisfied. I too.</p>
<p> Wait to be wooed and won. Ay, imbecile. Who would woo you?</p>
<p> Read the skies. Autontimorumenos. Bous Stephanoumenos. Where&apos;s your
configuration? S.D: sua donna. Gi&agrave;: di lui. Gelindo risolve di non amare S.D.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What is that, Mr Dedalus? the quaker librarian asked. Was it a celestial phenomenon?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A star by night, Stephen said. A pillar of the cloud by day.</p>
<p> What more&apos;s to say?</p>
<p> Stephen looked on his hat, his stick, his boots.</p>
<p> My crown. My sword. His boots are spoiling the shape of my feet. Buy a pair. Holes in my socks.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You make good use of the name, John Eglinton allowed.
Your own is strange enough. I suppose it explains your fantastical humour.</p>
<p> Me, Magee and Mulligan</p>
<p> Fabulous artificer. The hawklike man. You flew. Whereto? Newhaven-Dieppe,
steerage passenger. Paris and back. Lapwing. Icarus. Pater, ait. Seabedabbled,
fallen, weltering. Lapwing you are. Lapwing be.</p>
<p> Mr Best eagerquietly lifted his book to say:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That&apos;s very interesting because that brother motive,
don&apos;t you know, we find also in the old Irish myths. Just what you say. The three
<br><font color="green">{ms, 029}</font>
<br> brothers Shakespeare. In Grimm too, don&apos;t you know, the fairytale. The
third brother that marries the sleeping beauty and gets the best prize always.</p>
<p> Best of Best brothers. Good, better, best.</p>
<p> The quaker librarian came anear.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I should like to know, he said, which brother
you&nbsp;&hellip;. I understand you to
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">say</span></span>
<font color="black">suggest</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>
there was misconduct with one of the brothers&nbsp;&hellip;. But perhaps I am anticipating?</p>
<p> He caught himself in the act: looked at all: refrained.</p>
<p> An attendant from the doorway called:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Mr Lyster! Father Dineen wants&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, Father Dineen! Directly.</p>
<p> Swiftly rectly creaking rectly rectly rectly he was rectly gone.</p>
<p> John Eglinton touched the foil.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Come, he said. Let us hear what you have to say of
Richard and Edmund. You kept them for the last, didn&apos;t you?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; In asking you to remember nuncle Richie and nuncle
Edmund, Stephen answered, I feel I am asking too much perhaps. A brother is as easily forgotten as an umbrella.</p>
<p> Lapwing.</p>
<p> Where is your brother?
Apothecaries&apos;<a target="foot" id="fkz0098">&ordm;</a> Hall. My whetstone.
Him, then Cranly, Mulligan: now these. Speech, speech. But act. Act speech. They mock to try you. Act.</p>
<p> Lapwing.</p>
<p> I am tired of my voice.</p>
<p> On.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You will say those names were already in the chronicles
from which he took the stuff of his plays. Why did he take them rather than
others? Richard, a crookback, misbegotten, makes love to a widowed Ann, woos and
wins her.
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><font color="black">Richard
the conqueror came after William the
conquered.</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font> The other
four acts of the play hang limply from that first. Of all his kings Richard is
the only king unshielded by Shakespeare&apos;s reverence, the angel of the
world. Why is the underplot of King Lear in which
<br><font color="green">{ms, 030}</font>
<br> Edmund figures lifted out of Sidney&apos;s Arcadia and spatchcocked on to a Celtic legend older than history.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That was Will&apos;s way, John Eglinton defended. We
should not now combine a Norse saga with an excerpt from a novel by George
Meredith. Que
voulez-vous<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span>? George
Moore would say. He puts Bohemia on the seacoast and makes Ulysses quote Aristotle.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Why? Stephen answered himself. Because the theme of the
false or the usurping or the adulterous brother or all three in one is to
Shakespeare, what the poor are not, always with him. The note of banishment,
banished from the heart, banished from the home, sounds uninterruptedly from
<u>The Two Gentlemen of Verona</u> onward till Prospero lays down his wand and
burns his books. It doubles itself in the middle of his life, reflects itself in
another, repeats itself. But it was an original sin that darkened his
understanding, weakened his will and left in him a strong inclination to evil.
The words are those of the lords bishops of Maynooth. An original sin and, like
original sin,
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext"><font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">unread</span></font></span></span>
committed by another in whom he sinned. It is between the lines of his last
written words, it is petrified on his tombstone under which her four bones are
not to be laid. Age has not withered it. Beauty and peace have not done it away.
It is in infinite variety everywhere in the world he has created, in <u>Much Ado
about Nothing</u>, twice in <u>As You Like It</u>, in <u>The Tempest</u>, in
<u>Hamlet</u>, in <u>Measure for Measure</u> &mdash; and in the other plays which I have not read.</p>
<p> He laughed to

<p class="pdi">&mdash; The truth is midway, he affirmed. He is the ghost and the prince too. He is all in all.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, Stephen said. The boy of act one becomes

<font color="black">a mature
man</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font> in act five. All
in all. In <u>Cymbeline</u> in <u>Othello</u> he is pimp and cuckold. He acts
and is acted on. His unremitting intellect is the Iago ceaselessly willing that the moor in him shall suffer.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Cuckoo! cuckoo! Buck Mulligan
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">clucked</span></span>
<font color="black">cooed</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font> softly. O word of fear!</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And what a character is Iago!
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><font color="black">undaunted</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>
John Eglinton exclaimed
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">undaunted</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>.
When all is said Dumas (or is it Victor Hugo?) is right. After God Shakespeare has created most.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Man delights him not nor woman neither, Stephen said. He
returns after a life of absence to that spot of earth where he was born, where
he has been always a silent witness. and there, his journey of life ended, he
plants his mulberry tree. Then dies. Gravediggers bury Hamlet and they buried
Hamlet&apos;s father. If you like the last scene look long on it: prosperous
Propero, the good man, Lizzie, grandpa&apos;s lump of love, and nuncle Richie,
the bad man taken off by providence to the place where the bad niggers go. He
found in his world without as actual that which was in his world within as
possible. Maeterlinck says: If Socrates
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">g</span></span> leave his house
today he will find the sage seated on the doorstep. If Judas go forth tonight it
is to Judas his steps will go. Every life is many days, day after day. We walk
through ourselves meeting robbers, giants, ghosts, old men, young men, wives,
but always meeting ourselves. The dramatist who wrote this world and wrote it
badly (He gave us light first and the sun two days later), the lord of things as
they are whom the most Roman of catholics call <u>dio boia</u>, hangman god, is also all in all in all
<br><font color="green">{ms, 032}</font>
<br> of us, ostler and butcher and would be coupler and cuckold also but that in
the economy of heaven there are no more marriages, the glorified man being a wife unto himself.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Eureka! Buck Mulligan cried. Eureka!</p>
<p> At once happied, he jumped up and reached in a stride John Eglinton&apos;s desk.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; May I? he said.</p>
<p> He began to scribble on a slip of paper.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Those who are married, Mr Best said
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><font color="black">quoted</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>,

<p> He laughed, unmarried, at John Eglinton,

<p class="pdi">&mdash; You are a delusion, said roundly John Eglinton to
Stephen. You have brought us all this way to show us a French triangle. Do you believe your own theory?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, Stephen said promptly.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Are you going to write it? Mr Bests asked. You ought to
make it a dialogue, don&apos;t you know, like the Platonian dialogues Wilde wrote.</p>
<p> John Eglinton smiled doubly.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, in that case, he said, I don&apos;t see why you
should expect payment for it since you don&apos;t believe it yourself.
Dowden<a target="foot" id="fkz0099">&ordm;</a> believes there is a mystery in

<p> Fred Ryan. Two pieces of silver he lent me. To tide you over. Economics.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; For a guinea, Stephen said, you can publish this interview.</p>
<p> Buck Mulligan stood up from his laughing scribbling, laughing: and then
gravely said<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">:</span></span>, honeying malice:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I called upon the bard Kinch at his summer residence in
Mecklenburgh street and found him deep in the study of the <u>Summa contra

<p> He broke away.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Come, Kinch. Come, wandering Aengus of the birds.</p>
<p> Come, Kinch. You have eaten all we left. Ay. I will serve you your orts and offals.</p>
<p> Stephen rose.</p>
<p> Life is many days. This will end.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; We shall see you tonight, John Eglinton said. <u>Notre

<p> Buck Mulligan waved his slip and panama.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Lecturer on French letters to young Ireland, he said.
I&apos;ll be there. Come, Kinch, the bards must drink. Can you walk straight?</p>
<p> Laughing, he&nbsp;&hellip;.</p>
<p> Swill till midnight. Irish nights entertainment.</p>
<p> Lubber&nbsp;&hellip;.</p>
<p> Stephen followed a lubber&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> One day in the national library we had a I a discussion. Shakes. After. His lub back: I followed.</p>
<p> A lubber jester out of the vaulted cell out of into shattering daylight of no thought.</p>
<p> What did I learn? Of them? Of me?</p>
<p> Walk like Haines now.</p>
<p> The constant readers&apos; room. In the readers&apos; book Cashel Boyle
O&apos;Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell parafes his polysyllables. Item, was
Hamlet mad? The quaker&apos;s pate godlily with a priesteen in booktalk.</p>
<p> The turnstile.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 034}</font> </p>
<p> Is that&nbsp;&hellip;? Blueribboned hat&nbsp;&hellip;? Idly
writing&nbsp;&hellip;? What?&nbsp;&hellip;. Looked&nbsp;&hellip;?</p>
<p> The curving balustrade, smoothsliding Mincius.</p>
<p> Puck Mulligan, panamahelmeted, went step by step, iambing, trolling:</p>
<p class="pdiset">&mdash; John Eglinton, my jo, John
<br> Why won&apos;t you wed a wife?</p>
<p> He spluttered to the air:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, the chinless Chinaman! We went over to their playbox,
the plumbers&apos; hall. Abbey Theatre! I smell the pubic sweat of monks.</p>
<p> He spat blank.</p>
<p> Forgot: any more than he forgot the whipping lousy Lucy gave him. And left
her, femme de trente ans. And why no other children born?</p>
<p> Afterwit. Go back.</p>
<p> The dour recluse still there and the douce youngling, minion of pleasure, Phedo&apos;s toyable fair hair.</p>
<p> Eh&nbsp;&hellip; I just eh&nbsp;&hellip;. wanted&nbsp;&hellip; I forgot&nbsp;&hellip; eh&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Longworth and M<sup><small>c</small></SUP>Curdy Atkinson were there&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> Buck Mulligan footed featly, trilling:</p>
<p class="pdiset">&mdash; I hardly hear a purlieu cry
<br> Or a Tommy talk as I pass one by
<br> Before my thoughts begin to run
<br> On F. M(supcCurdy Atkinson
<br> The same that had the wooden leg
<br> And that filibustering filibeg
<br> That never dared to slake his drouth
<br> Magee that had the chinless mouth.</p>
<p> Jest on. Know thyself.</p>
<p> Halted, below me, a quizzer looks at me. I halt.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Mournful mummer, Buck Mulligan moaned. Synge has left off
wearing black to be like nature. Only crows, priests and English coal are black.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 035}</font> </p>
<p> A laugh tripped over his lips.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Longworth is awfully sick, he said,
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">about that</span></span> after
what you wrote about that old hake Gregory. O you inquisitional drunken
jewjesuit! She gets you a job on the paper and then you go and slate her book to
Jaysus. Couldn&apos;t you do the Yeats touch?</p>
<p> He went on and down, chanting with waving graceful arms:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The most beautiful book that has come out of Ireland in my time.</p>
<p> He stopped at the stairfoot.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I have conceived a play
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><font color="black">for the
mummers</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>, he said solemnly.</p>
<p> The pillared Moorish hall, shadows entwined. Gone the nine men&apos;s morrice with caps of indices.</p>
<p> With sweetly varying voices Buck Mulligan read his tablet:</p>
<p class="pdiset">&mdash; Everyman His Own Wife</p>
<p> or
<br> A Honeymoon in the Hand
<br> (a national immorality in three orgasms)</p>
<p> by
<br> Ballocky Mulligan</p>
<p> He turned a happy patch&apos;s
<a name="un1032fd" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1032fd">smirk</a> to Stephen, saying:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The disguise, I fear, is thin. But listen.</p>
<p> He read, marking:
<br> Characters:
<br> Toby Tostof (a ruined Pole)
<br> Crab (a bushranger)
<br> Medical Dick</p>
<p> and
<br> Medical Davy (two birds with one stone)
<br> Mother Grogan (a watercarrier)
<br> Fresh Nelly</p>
<p> <u>and</u>
<br> Rosalie, the coalquay whore.</p>
<p> He laughed, lolling a to and fro head, walking on, followed by Stephen: and
mirthfully he told the
shadows<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><font color="black">,
souls of moors</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, the night in the Camden hall the daughters of Erin had to lift their skirts to step over
<br><font color="green">{ms, 036}</font>
<br> you as you lay in your mulberrycoloured multicoloured, multitudinous
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">puke</span></span>
<font color="black">vomit</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>!</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The most innocent son of Erin, Stephen said, for whom they ever lifted them.</p>
<p> About to pass through the doorway, feeling one behind, he stood aside:</p>
<p> Part. The moment is now. Where then? If Socrates leave his house today, if
Judas go forth tonight. Why? That lies in space which I in time must come to, ineluctably.</p>
<p> My will, his will that fronts me. Seas between.</p>
<p> A man passed out between them, bowing, greeting:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Good day again, Buck Mulligan said.</p>
<p> The portico.</p>
<p> Here I watched the birds for augury. Aengus of the birds. They go, they
come. Last night I flew. Easily flew. Men wondered. Street of harlots after. The
creamfruit melon he held to me. In. You will see.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The wandering jew, Buck Mulligan whispered with
clown&apos;s awe. Did you see his eye? He looked upon you to lust after you. I
fear thee, ancient mariner. O, Kinch, thou art in peril. Get thee a breechpad.</p>
<p> Manner of Oxenford.</p>
<p> Day. Wheelbarrow sun over arch of bridge.</p>
<p> A dark
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext"><font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">unread</span></font></span></span>
back went before them, step of a pard, down, out by the gateway, under portcullis barbs.</p>
<p> They followed.</p>
<p> Offend me still. Speak on.</p>
<p> Kind air defined the coigns of houses in Kildare street. No birds. Frail
from the housetops two plumes of smoke ascended, pluming, and in a flow of softness, softly were blown.</p>
<p> Cease to strive. Peace of the druid priests of Cymbeline: hierophantic:
<br><font color="green">{ms, 037}</font>
<br> from wide earth an altar.</p>
<p> Laud we the gods
<br> And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils
<br> From our bless&apos;d altars.</p> </p>  </main>
