<br>
<p> Urbane, to comfort them, the quaker librarian purred:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And we have, have we not, those priceless pages of
<i>Wilhelm Meister</i>. A great poet on a great brother poet. A hesitating soul
taking arms against a sea of troubles, torn by conflicting doubts as one sees in real life.</p>
<p> He made a step a sinkapace forward on creaking neatsleather and a step
backward creaking a sinkapace on the solemn floor.</p>
<p> A noiseless attendant setting open the door but slightly made him a noiseless beck.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Directly, he said, creaking to go, albeit lingering. The
beautiful ineffectual dreamer who comes to grief against hard facts. One always
feels that Goethe&apos;s judgments are so true. True in the larger analysis.</p>
<p> Twicreakingly analysis he corantoed off. Bald, zealous, by the door he gave
his large ear all to the attendant&apos;s words. Heard them: and was gone.</p>
<p> Two left.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Monsieur de la
Palice<a target="foot" id="fkk0001">&ordm;</a>, Stephen sneered, was alive fifteen minutes before his death.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Have you found those
<a name="jn1046b" href="../../ff/unbs/jn1all.htm#jn1046b">six brave medicals,
John Eglinton asked with elder&apos;s gall, to write <i>Paradise
Lost</i></a><a target="foot" id="fkk0002">&ordm;</a>
<a name="jn1046b" href="../../ff/unbs/jn1all.htm#jn1046b">at your dictation</a>.</p>
<p> Smile. Smile Cranly&apos;s smile. </p>
<p class="set"><i>First he tickled her,</i>
<br> <i>Then he patted her
<br> Then he passed the female catheter
<br> For he was a medical

<br><font color="green">{u22, 177}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I feel you would need one more for <i>Hamlet</i>. Seven is
dear is to the mystic mind. The shining seven WB calls them.</p>
<p> Glittereyed his rufous skull close to his greencapped desklamp sought the
face bearded amid darkgreener shadow, an ollav, holyeyed. He laughed low: a
sizar&apos;s laugh of Trinity: unanswered.</p>
<p class="set"><i>Orchestral Satan, weeping many a rood
<br> Tears such as angels weep</i>
<br> <i>Ed egli avea del cul fatto trombetta</i></p>
<p> He holds my follies hostage.</p>
<p> Cranly&apos;s eleven true Wicklowmen to free their sireland. Gaptoothed
Kathleen her four beautiful green fields, the stranger in her house. And one to
hail him: ave, rabbi: the Tinahely twelve. In the shadow of the glen he cooees
for them. My Soul&apos;s youth I gave him, night by night. God speed. Good hunting.</p>
<p> Folly. Persist.</p>
<p> Mulligan has my telegram.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Our young Irish bards, John Eglinton censured, have yet to
create a figure which the world will set beside Saxon Shakespeare&apos;s Hamlet
though I admire him, as old Ben did, on this side idolatry.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; All these questions are purely academic, Russell said out
of his shadow. I mean, if Hamlet is Shakespeare or James I or Essex.
Clergymen&apos;s discussions of
<a name="un1014e" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1014e">the historicity of
Jesus</a>. Art has to reveal to us ideas, formless spiritual essences. The
supreme question about a work of art is out of how deep a life does it spring.
The painting of Gustave Moreau is the painting of ideas. The deepest poetry of
Shelley, the words of Hamlet bring our minds into contact with the eternal
wisdom, Plato&apos;s world of ideas. All the rest is the speculation of schoolboys for schoolboys. </p>
<p> Well, tarnation strike me. A.E has been telling an interviewer.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The schoolmen were schoolboys once, Stephen said
superpolitely. Aristotle was once Plato&apos;s prize schoolboy.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And has remained so, one should hope, John Eglinton
sedately said. One can see him. A prize schoolboy with his diploma under his arm.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 178}</font> </p>
<p> He laughed again at the now smiling bearded face.</p>
<p> Formless spiritual. Father, Son and Holy Breath. This verily is that. I am
the fire upon the altar. I am the sacrificial butter.</p>

<p> Mr Best entered, tall, young, mild, light. He bore in his hand with grace a notebook, new, large, clean, bright.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That model schoolboy, Stephen said, would find Hamlet
musings about his princely soul, the improbable, insignificant and undramatic monologue, as shallow as Plato&apos;s.</p>
<p> John Eglinton, frowning, said, waxing wroth:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Upon my word it makes my blood boil to hear anyone compare Aristotle with Plato.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Which of the two, Stephen asked, would have banished Shakespeare from his commonwealth.</p>
<p> Unsheathe your dagger definitions. Streams of tendency and eons they
worship. God: noise  in the street: very peripatetic. Space: what you damn well
have to see. Through spaces smaller than red globules of man&apos;s blood they
creepycrawl after Blake&apos;s buttocks into eternity of which this vegetable
world is but a shadow. Hold to the now, the here, through which all future plunges to the past.</p>
<p> Mr Best came forward, amiable, towards his colleague.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Haines is gone, he said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Is he?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I was showing him Jubainville&apos;s book. He&apos;s quite
enthusiastic, don&apos;t you know, about Hyde&apos;s <i>Lovesongs of
Connacht.</i> I couldn&apos;t bring him in to hear the discussion. He&apos;s gone to Gill&apos;s to buy it.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 179}</font> </p>
<p class="set">Bound thee, forth, my booklet quick
<br> To greet the callous public,
<br> Writ, I ween, &apos;twas not my wish
<br> In lean unlovely English.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The peatsmoke is going to his head, John Eglinton opined.</p>
<p> We feel in England. Penitent thief. Gone. I smoked his baccy. Green
twinkling stone. An emerald set in the ring of the sea.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; People do not know how dangerous lovesongs can be, the
auric egg of Russell said occultly. The movements which work revolutions in the
world are born out of the dreams and visions in a peasant&apos;s heart on the
hillside. For them the earth is not an exploitable ground but the living mother.
The rarefied air of the academy and the arena produce the sixshilling novel, the
musichall song.<a target="foot" id="fkk0006">&ordm;</a> France produces the
finest flower of corruption in Mallarm&eacute; but the desirable life is
revealed only to the poor of heart, the life of Homer&apos;s Phaeecians.</p>
<p> From these words Mr Best turned an unoffending face to Stephen.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Mallarm&eacute;, don&apos;t you know, he said, has written
those wonderful prose poems Stephen MacKenna used to read to me in Paris. The
one about <i>Hamlet</i>. He says: il se prom&egrave;ne, lisant au livre de
lui-m&ecirc;me, don&apos;t you <i>know</i>, reading the book of himself. He
describes <i>Hamlet</i> given in a French town, don&apos;t you know, a provincial town. They advertised it.</p>
<p> His free hand graciously wrote tiny signs in air. </p>
<p class="center"><i>Hamlet</i></p>
<p class="center"><i>ou</i></p>
<p class="center"><i>Le Distrait</i></p>
<p class="center">pi&egrave;ce de Shakespeare</p>
<p> He repeated to John Eglinton&apos;s newgathered frown:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>Pi&egrave;ce de Shakespeare</i>, don&apos;t you know.
It&apos;s so French. The French point of view. <i>Hamlet ou</i>&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The absentminded beggar, Stephen ended.</p>
<p> John Eglinton laughed.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, I suppose it would be, he said. Excellent people, no
doubt, but distressingly shortsighted in some matters.</p>
<p> Sumptuous and stagnant exaggeration of murder.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 180}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A deathsman of the soul Robert Greene called him, Stephen
said. Not for nothing was he a butcher&apos;s
son,<a target="foot" id="fkk0008">&ordm;</a> wielding the sledded poleaxe and
spitting in his palms. Nine lives are taken off for his father&apos;s
one.<a target="foot" id="fkk0010">&ordm;</a>
<a name="un5016e" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5016e"></a>Our Father who art
in purgatory<a target="foot" id="fkk0011">&ordm;</a>. Khaki Hamlets don&apos;t
hesitate to shoot. The shambles in act five is a forecast of the concentration camp sung by Algy Swinburne.</p>
<p class="set"><i>Whelps and dams of murderous foes whom none
<br> But we had spared</i>&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He will have it that Hamlet is a ghoststory, John Eglinton
said for Mr Best&apos;s behoof. Like the fat boy in Pickwick he wants to make our flesh creep.</p>
<p class="set">List! List! O list!</p>
<p> My flesh hears him: creeping, hears.</p>
<p class="set"><i>If thou didst ever</i>&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What is a ghost? Stephen said with tingling energy. One
who  has faded into impalpability through death, through absence, through change
of manners. Elizabethan London lay as far from Stratford as corrupt Paris lies
from virgin Dublin. Who is the ghost, returning to the world that has forgotten him? Who is King Hamlet?</p>
<p> John Eglinton shifted his spare body, leaning back to judge.</p>
<p> Lifted.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It is this hour of a June day, Stephen said, begging with
a swift glance their hearing. The flag is up on the playhouse by the bankside.
The bear Sackerson growls in the bearpit near it, Paris garden.
Canvasclimbers<a target="foot" id="fkk0013">&ordm;</a> who sailed with Drake
chew their sausages among the groundlings.</p>
<p> Local colour. Work in all you know. Make them accomplices.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Shakespeare has left the huguenot&apos;s house in Silver
street and walks by the swanmews along the riverbank. But he does not stay to
feed the pen chivying her brood towards the rushes. The swan of Avon has other thoughts.</p>
<p> Composition of place.
<a name="gn1005a" href="../../ff/unbs/gn1all.htm#gn1005a">Ignatius Loyola, make haste to help me!</a>
<br><font color="green">{u22, 181}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The play begins. A player comes on under the shadow, clad
in the castoff mail of a court buck, a wellset man with a bass voice. It is the
ghost, King Hamlet: and the player is Shakespeare. He speaks the words of his
part to Burbage, the young player who stands before him, calling him by a name,</p>
<p class="set"><i>Hamlet, I am thy father&apos;s spirit</i>,</p>
<p class="flush">bidding him list. To a son he speaks, the son of his soul, the
prince, young Hamlet and to the son of his body, Hamlet Shakespeare who has died
in Stratford that his namesake may live for ever.</p>
<p> Is<a target="foot" id="fkk0015">&ordm;</a> it possible that that player
Shakespeare, a ghost by absence, and in the vesture of the elder Hamlet, a ghost
by death, speaking his own words to his own son&apos;s name (had Hamlet
Shakespeare lived he would have been prince Hamlet&apos;s twin) is it possible
or probable, I want to know,  that he did not draw or foresee the logical
conclusion of those premises? I am the murdered father:
<a name="jn2007h" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2007h">you are the
dispossessed son</a>: your mother is the guilty queen, Ann Shakespeare, born Hathaway?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; But this prying into the family life of a great man, Russell began impatiently.</p>
<p> Art thou there, truepenny?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Interesting only to the parish clerk. I mean, we have the
plays. I mean when we read the poetry of <i>King Lear</i> what is it to us how
the poet lived? As for living our servants can do that for us, Villiers de
l&apos;Isle said. Peeping and prying into the greenroom gossip of the day, the
poet&apos;s drinking, the poets&apos; debts. We have <i>King Lear</i>. And it is immortal.</p>
<p> Mr Best&apos;s face,<a target="foot" id="fkk0017">&ordm;</a> appealed to, agreed.</p>
<p class="set"><i>Flow over them with your waves and with your waters, Mananaan,
<br> Mananaan MacLir</i>&nbsp;&hellip;.<a target="foot" id="fkk0018">&ordm;</a></p>
<p> By the way that pound he lent you when you were hungry?</p>
<p> I wanted it.</p>
<p> Take thou this noble.</p>
<p> You spent most of it in Georgina Johnson&apos;s bed, clergyman&apos;s daughter.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 182}</font> </p>
<p> Do you intend to pay it back?</p>
<p> O, yes.</p>
<p> When? Now?</p>
<p> Well&nbsp;&hellip; No.</p>
<p> When, then?</p>
<p> I paid my way. I paid my way.</p>
<p> Steady on. He&apos;s from north of Boyne water. You owe it.</p>
<p> Wait. Five months. Molecules all
<a name="un5016ab" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5016ab">change. I am other I</a> now. Other I got pound.</p>
<p> Buzz. Buzz.</p>
<p> But <a name="jn1004b" href="../../ff/unbs/jn1all.htm#jn1004b">I, entelechy,
form of forms,</a> am I by memory under everchanging forms. </p>
<p> I that sinned and prayed and fasted.</p>
<p> A child Conmee saved from pandies.</p>
<p> I, I and I.</p>
<p> A. E. I. O. U.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Do you mean to fly in the face of the tradition of three
centuries, John Eglinton&apos;s carping voice asked. Her ghost at least has been
laid for ever. She died, for literature at least, before she was born.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; She died, Stephen retorted, sixtyseven years after she was
born. She saw him into and out of the world. She took his first embraces. She
bore and bred his children and she put pennies on his eyes to keep his eyelids closed when he lay on his deathbed.</p>
<p> Mother&apos;s deathbed. Candle. The sheeted mirror. Who brought me into this
world lies there, bronzelidded, under few cheap flowers. <i>Liliata rutilantium</i>.</p>
<p> I wept alone.</p>
<p> John Eglinton looked in the tangled glowworm of his lamp.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The world believes that Shakespeare made a mistake, he
said, and got out of it as quickly and as best he could.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Bosh! Stephen said rudely. A man of genius makes no
mistakes. His errors are volitional and are the portals of discovery.</p>
<p> Portal of discovery opened to let in the quaker librarian, softcreakfooted, assiduous, bald and eared.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A shrew, John Eglinton said shrewdly, is not a useful
portal of discovery, one should imagine. What useful discovery did Socrates learn from his wife Xanthippe?
<br><font color="green">{u22, 183}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Dialectic, Stephen answered: and from his mother how to
bring thought into the world. But neither the midwife&apos;s lore nor the
caudlelectures saved him from the archons of Sinn Fein and their cup of hemlock.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; But Ann Hathaway? Mr Best&apos;s quiet voice said
forgetfully. Yes, we seem to have forgotten her as Shakespeare himself forgot her.</p>
<p> His face went from brooder&apos;s beard to carper&apos;s skull, to remind,
to  chide them kindly, then to the pinkbald quaker pumpkin,
guiltless<a target="foot" id="fkk0020">&ordm;</a> though maligned.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He had a good groatsworth of wit, Stephen said, and no
truant memory. He carried a memory in his wallet as he trudged to Romeville
whistling <i>The Girl I left behind me</i>. If the earthquake did not time
<i>Venus and Adonis</i> we should know where to place poor Wat, sitting in his
form; the studded bridle and her blue windows. That memory lay in the
bedchamber<a target="foot" id="fkk0021">&ordm;</a> of every light-of-love in
London. Is Katharine the shrew illfavoured? Hortensio calls her young and
beautiful. Do you think the writer of <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, a passionate
pilgrim, had his eyes in the back of his head that he chose the ugliest doxy in
all Warwickshire to lie withal?<a target="foot" id="fkk0022">&ordm;</a> Good: he
left her and gained the world of men: But his boywomen are the women of a boy.
Their life, thought, speech are lent them by males. He chose badly? He was
chosen, it seems to me. If others have their will Ann hath a way. By cock, she
was to blame. She put the comether on him, sweet and twentysix. The goddess who
bends over the boy Adonis is a boldfaced Stratford wench who tumbles in a cornfield a lover younger than herself.</p>
<p> And my turn? When?</p>
<p> Come!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ryefield, Mr Best said brightly, gladly, raising his new book, gladly, brightly.</p>
<p> He murmured then with blond delight for all:</p>
<p class="diset">&mdash; <i>Between</i><a target="foot" id="fkk0023">&ordm;</a> <i>the acres of the rye
<br> These pretty countryfolk would lie</i></p>
<p> Paris: the wellpleased pleaser.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 184}</font> </p>
<p> A tall figure in bearded homespun rose from its shadow and unchained its cooperative watch.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I am afraid I am due at the <i>Homestead</i>.</p>
<p> Whither away? Exploitable ground.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Are you going? John Eglinton&apos;s eyebrows asked. Shall
we see you at Moore&apos;s tonight. Piper is coming. </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Piper! Mr Best said. Is Piper back?</p>
<p> Peter Piper pecked a peck of pick of peck of pickled pepper.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I don&apos;t know if I can. Thursday. We have our meeting. If I can get away in time.</p>

<p> See this. Remember.</p>

<p class="di">&mdash; Thank you very much, Mr Russell, Stephen said, rising. If

<p class="di">&mdash; O, yes. If he considers it important of course it will go in. We have so much correspondence.</p>

<p> Stephen sat down.</p>
<p> The quaker librarian came from the leavetakers. Blushing,<a target="foot" id="fkk0025">&ordm;</a> his mask said:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Mr Dedalus, your views are most illuminating.</p>
<p> He creaked to and fro, tiptoing up the altitude of a chopine, and, covered by the noise of outgoing, said:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Is it your view, then, that she was not faithful to the poet?</p>
<p> Alarmed face asks me. Why did he come? Courtesy or an inner light?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Where there is a reconciliation, Stephen said, there must have been first a sundering.</p>

 Women he won to him, tender people, a whore of Babylon, justices&apos; ladies,

once was comely, once as sweet, as fresh as cinnamon, now her leaves falling,
all, bare, frighted of the narrow grave and unforgiven.</p>

<p> Rest, suddenly, possessed the discreet vaulted cell, the rest of warm and brooding air.</p>
<p> A vestal&apos;s lamp.</p>
<p> Here he ponders things that were not: what
Caesar<a target="foot" id="fkk0028">&ordm;</a> would have done had he believed
the soothsayer: what might have been:
<a name="jn1012i" href="../../ff/unbs/jn1all.htm#jn1012i">possibilities of the
possible as possible</a>: on things not known: what name Achilles bore when he lived among women.</p>
<p> Coffined thoughts around me, in mummy cases, embalmed in spice of words.
Thoth, god of libraries, a birdgod, moonycrowned. And I heard the voice of that
Egyptian highpriest. In &ldquo;painted chambers loaded with tilebooks&rdquo;.</p>
<p> They are still. Once quick in the live brains of men. Still: but the itch of
death is in them, to tell me in my ear a maudlin tale, urge me to wreak their will.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Certainly, John Eglinton mused, of all great men he is the
most enigmatic. We know nothing but that he lived and suffered. A shadow hangs over all the rest.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; But <i>Hamlet</i><a target="foot" id="fkk0029">&ordm;</a>
is so personal, isn&apos;t it, Mr Best pleaded. I mean, a kind of personal
private paper, don&apos;t you know, of his private life. I mean, I don&apos;t
care a button, don&apos;t you know, who is killed or who is guilty&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> He rested an innocent book, smiling his defiance, on the edge of the desk.
His private papers. <i>Ta an bad ar an tir. Taim in mo sagart</i>. In my priest.
Littlejohn, put beurla<a target="foot" id="fkk0030">&ordm;</a> on it.</p>
<p> Littlejohn Eglinton said:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I was prepared for paradoxes from what Malachi Mulligan
told me but I may as well warn you that if you want to shake my belief that
Shakespeare is Hamlet you have a stern task before you. </p>
<p> Bear with me.</p>
<p> Stephen withstood the bane of miscreant eyes glinting from under stern
wrinkled brows.
<a name="gn1015a" href="../../ff/unbs/gn1all.htm#gn1015a">Basilisk eyes. <i>E
quando vede l&apos;uomo l&apos;attosca</i>. Messer Brunetto, I thank thee for the word.</a></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; As we, or Dana,
<a name="un1032ec" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1032ec">weave and unweave
our bodies</a>, Stephen said, from day to day, their molecules shuttled to and
fro, so does the artist
<a name="un1032ec" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1032ec">weave and unweave
his image</a>. And as the mole on my right shoulder is where it was when I was
born, though all my body has been woven of new stuff time after time, so through
the ghost of the unquiet father the image of the unliving son looks forth. In
the intense instant of imagination, wherein the mind, Shelley says, is a fading
coal,<a target="foot" id="fkk0031">&ordm;</a> that which I was is that which I
am and that which in possibility I shall come to be. So, in the future, sister of the past, I see that I shall see
<br><font color="green">{u22, 187}</font>
<br> myself as I sit here now today but by reflection from that which then I shall be.</p>
<p> Drummond of Hawthornden helped you at that stile.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, Mr Best<a target="foot" id="fkk0032">&ordm;</a> said
youngly.<a target="foot" id="fkk0033">&ordm;</a> I feel Hamlet quite young. The
bitterness might be from the father but the passages with Ophelia are surely from the son.</p>
<p> Has the wrong sow by the ear.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That mole is the last to go, Stephen said, laughing.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; If that were the birthmark of genius, John Eglinton said
with a sour mow, genius would be a drug in the market. The plays of
Shakespeare&apos;s later years which Renan admired so much breathe another spirit.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The spirit of reconciliation, the quaker librarian said appeasingly.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There can be no reconciliation, Stephen said, if there has not been a sundering.</p>
<p> Said that.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; If you want to know what are the events which cast their
shadow over the period of <i>King Lear</i>, <i>Othello</i>,
<i>Hamlet</i>,<a target="foot" id="fkk0034">&ordm;</a> <i>Troilus and
Cressida</i> look to see when and how the shadow lifts. What softens the heart
of a man, shipwrecked in life&apos;s storms, tried, like another Ulysses, Pericles, prince of Tyre?</p>
<p> Head, redconecapped, buffeted, brineblinded. </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A child, a girl, placed in his arms, Marina.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The leaning of sophists towards the bypaths of apocrypha
is a constant quantity, John Eglinton detected. The highroads are dreary but they lead to the town.</p>
<p> Good Bacon: smoked musty. Cypherjugglers going the highroads. What town,
good masters? Mummed in names:
<a name="un3010h" href="../../ff/unbs/un3all.htm#un3010h">A.&nbsp;E, eon: Magee,
John Eglinton</a>. East of the sun, west of the moon: Tir nan Og. Booted the twain and staved.</p>
<p class="set"><i>How many miles to Dublin?
<br> Three score and ten, sir.
<br> Will we be there by candlelight?</i></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Mr Brandes accepts it, Stephen said, as the first play of the closing period.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Does he? What does Mr Sidney Lee, or Mr Simon Lazarus as some aver his name is, say of it?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Marina, Stephen said, a child of storm, Miranda, a wonder,
Perdita, that which was lost. What was lost is given back to him: his daughter&apos;s child.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 188}</font>
<br> <i>My dearest wife</i>, Pericles says, <i>was like this maid</i>. Will any
man love the daughter if he has not loved the mother?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The art of being a grandfather, Mr Best murmured.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Will he not see reborn in her, with the memory of his own youth added, another image?</p>
<p> Do you know what you are talking about? Love, yes. Word known to all men.
<i>Amor vero aliquid alicui bonum vult unde et ea quae concupiscimus</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; His own image to a man with
<a name="jn1034q" href="../../ff/unbs/jn1all.htm#jn1034q">that queer thing
genius</a> is the standard of all experience, material and moral. Such an appeal
will touch him. The
<a name="gn1010b" href="../../ff/unbs/gn1all.htm#gn1010b">images of other males
of his brood will repel him. He will see in them grotesque attempts of nature to foretell</a> or to repeat himself.</p>
<p> The benign forehead of the quaker librarian enkindled rosily with hope.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I hope Mr Dedalus will work out his theory for the
enlightenment of the public. And we ought to mention another Irish commentator
Mr Frank Harris. His articles on Shakespeare in the <i>Saturday Review</i> were
surely brilliant. Oddly enough he too draws for us an unhappy relation with the
dark  lady of the sonnets. The favoured rival is William Herbert, earl of
Pembroke. I own that if the poet is to be
rejected<a target="foot" id="fkk0039">&ordm;</a> such a rejection would seem
more in harmony with &mdash; what shall I say? &mdash; our notions of what ought not to have been.</p>
<p> Felicitously he ceased and held a meek head among them, auk&apos;s egg, prize of their fray.</p>
<p> He thous her with grave husbandwords. Dost love, Miriam? Dost love thy man?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That may be too, Stephen said. There is a saying of
Goethe&apos;s which Mr Magee likes to quote. Beware of what you wish for in
youth because you will get it in middle life. Why does he send to one who is a
buonaroba, a bay where all men ride, a maid of honour with a scandalous
girlhood, a lordling to woo for him. He was himself a lord of language and had
made himself a coistrel gentleman and he had written <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>.
Why? Belief in himself has been untimely killed. He was overborne in a cornfield
first, (a<a target="foot" id="fkk0041">&ordm;</a> ryefield, I should say) and he
will never be a victor in his own eyes after. Nor play victoriously the game of
laugh and lie down. Assumed dongiovannism will not save him. No later undoing
will undo the first undoing. If the shrew is worsted there remains to her
woman&apos;s invisible weapon. There is, I feel in the words, some goad of the
flesh driving him into a new passion, a darker shadow of the first, darkening
also his own understanding of himself. A like fate awaits him and the double rages commingle in a whirlpool.</p>
<p> They listen. And in the porches of their ears I pour.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Those who are done to death in sleep cannot know the
manner of their quell unless the creator endows their souls with that knowledge
in the life to come. The soul has been before stricken mortally, a poison poured
in the porch of a sleeping ear. The poisoning and the lust that urged it the
ghost of King Hamlet could not know of were it not endowed with knowledge by its
creator. That is why the speech is always turned elsewhere, backward. Ravisher
and ravished go with him from Lucrece to Imogen. He goes back, weary of the
creation he has piled up to hide himself from himself, to lick his sore. But,
because loss is his gain, he passes on towards eternity in undiminished
personality, untaught by the wisdom he has uttered or by the laws he has
revealed. His beaver is up. He is a ghost a shadow now or the wind around
Elsinore&apos;s rocks or the sea&apos;s voice, a voice heard only in the heart
of him who is the substance of his shadow, the son consubstantial with the father.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Amen! was responded from the doorway.</p>
<p> Hast thou found me, O mine enemy?</p>
<p> A ribald face, sullen an instant, Buck Mulligan came forward, blithe in his
motley towards the greeting of their smiles. My telegram.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You were speaking of the gaseous vertebrate if I mistake not? he asked of Stephen.</p>
<p> Primrosevested he greeted gaily with his doffed Panama as with a bauble.</p>
<p> They make him welcome.</p>
<p> Brood of mockers: Photius, pseudo Malachi<a target="foot" id="fkk0042">&ordm;</a>, Johann Most.</p>
<p> He Who Himself begot middles the Holy Ghost and Himself sent Himself,

whipped, was nailed like a bat on a barndoor, starved on crosstree, Who let Him

hundred years sitteth on the right hand of His Own Self but yet shall come in

<p> He lifts his hands. Veils fall. O, flowers! Bells with bells with bells aquiring.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, indeed, the quaker librarian said. A most interesting
discussion. Mr Mulligan, I&apos;ll be bound, has his theory too of the play and
of Shakespeare. All sides of life should be represented.</p>
<p> He smiled on all sides equally.</p>
<p> Buck Mulligan, thought, puzzled:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Shakespeare? he said. I seem to know the name.</p>
<p> A flying sunny smile rayed in his loose features.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; To be sure, he said, remembering brightly. The chap that writes like Synge.</p>
<p> Mr Best turned to him.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Haines missed you, he said. Did you meet him? He&apos;ll
meet you after at the D.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;C. He&apos;s gone to Gill&apos;s to buy
Hyde&apos;s <i>Lovesongs of Connacht</i>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I came through the museum, Buck Mulligan said. Was he here?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The bard&apos;s fellowcountrymen, John Eglinton answered,
are rather tired perhaps of our brilliancies of theorising. I hear that an
actress is playing <i>Hamlet</i> in Dublin. Has no-one made him out to be an Irishman? He swears by saint Patrick.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The most brilliant of all is that story of Wilde&apos;s,
Mr Best said, lifting his brilliant notebook. That <i>Portrait of Mr W.H.</i>
where he proves that the sonnets were written by a Willie Hughes, a man all hues.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; For Willie Hughes, is it not? the quaker librarian asked.</p>
<p> Or Hughy Wills?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I mean, for Willie Hughes, Mr Best said, amending his
gloss easily. Of course it&apos;s all paradox, don&apos;t you know, Hughes and
hews and hues, the colour, but it&apos;s so typical the way he works it out.
It&apos;s the very essence of Wilde, don&apos;t you know. The light touch.</p>
<p> His glance touched their faces lightly as he smiled, a blond ephebe. Tame essence of Wilde. </p>
<p> You&apos;re damn witty. Three drams of usquebaugh you drank with Dan Deasy&apos;s ducats.</p>
<p> How much did I spend. O, few shillings.</p>
<p> For <a name="un1032dn" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1032dn">a plump of</a> pressmen. Humour wet and dry.</p>
<p> Witty. You would give your five wits for his youth&apos;s proud livery,
<a name="un1032fb" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1032fb">the lineaments of gratified desire</a>.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 191}</font> </p>
<p> Take her for me. In pairing time. Yea, turtledove her.</p>
<p> Eve. O naked wheatbellied sin. A snake<a target="foot" id="fkk0043">&ordm;</a> coils her. Fang in&apos;s kiss.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Do you think it is only a paradox? the quaker librarian
was asking. The mocker is never taken seriously when he is serious.</p>
<p> They talked seriously of mocker&apos;s seriousness.</p>
<p> Buck Mulligan&apos;s again heavy face eyed Stephen awhile. Then, shaking his
head, he came near, drew a folded telegram from his pocket. His mobile lips read, smiling with new delight.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Telegram! he<a target="foot" id="fkk0044">&ordm;</a> said.
Wonderful inspiration! Telegram! A papal bull!</p>
<p> He sat on a corner of the unlit desk, reading aloud joyfully:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without
incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done.</i> Signed: Dedalus. Where
did you launch it from. The kips? No. College Green. Have you drunk the four
quid? Telegram! Malachi Mulligan, The<a target="foot" id="fkk0045">&ordm;</a>
Ship, Middle Abbey Street. O, you peerless mummer! O, you priestified Kinchite!</p>
<p> Joyfully he thrust message and envelope into his pocket but crooned in a querulous brogue:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It&apos;s what I&apos;m telling you, mister honey,
it&apos;s queer and sick we were, Haines and myself, the time himself brought it
in. And we one hour and two hours and three hours in Connery&apos;s sitting
civil waiting for pints apiece. He wailed softly: And we to be there and you to
be unbeknownst sending your conglomerations the way we to have our tongues out a
yard long like the drouthy clerics do be fainting for a pussful. </p>
<p> Stephen laughed.</p>
<p> Quickly and warningfully Buck Mulligan bent down.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The tramper Synge is looking for you, he said, to murder
you. He heard you pissed on his halldoor in Glasthule. He&apos;s out  to murder
you in <a name="un3007p" href="../../ff/unbs/un3all.htm#un3007p">pampooties</a>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Me! Stephen exclaimed. That was your contribution to literature.</p>
<p> Buck Mulligan gleefully bent back, laughing up at the dark eavesdropping ceiling.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Murder you! he laughed.</p>
<p> <a name="un1011i" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1011i">Harsh gargoyle
face that warred against over our mess of hash of
<br><font color="green">{u22, 192}</font>
<br> lights</a> in rue Saint Andr&eacute; des Arts. In words of words for words,

<p class="di">&mdash; Mr Lyster, an attendant said with the door ajar.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; &hellip; in which everyone can find his own. So Mr Justice
Madden in his <i>Diary of Master
William</i><a target="foot" id="fkk0047">&ordm;</a> <i>Silence</i> has found the
hunting terms&nbsp;&hellip; Yes? What is it?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There&apos;s a gentleman here, sir, the attendant said,
coming forward and offering a card. From the <i>Freeman</i>. He wants to see the
files of the <i>Kilkenny People</i> for last year.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Certainly, certainly, certainly. Is the
gentleman&nbsp;&hellip;?<a target="foot" id="fkk0048">&ordm;</a></p>
<p> He took the eager card, glanced, not saw, laid down unglanced looked, asked, creaked, asked:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Is he&nbsp;&hellip;?<a target="foot" id="fkk0049">&ordm;</a> O, there!</p>
<p> <a name="un5016k" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5016k">Brisk as a
galliard</a> he was off, out. In the daylit corridor he talked with all the
pains of zeal in duty bound, most fair, most kind, most honest broadbrim.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; This gentleman? <i>Freeman&apos;s Journal</i>? <i>Kilkenny
People</i>?<a target="foot" id="fkk0050">&ordm;</a> To be sure. Good day, sir.
<i>Kilkenny</i>&nbsp;&hellip; We have certainly&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> A patient silhouette waited, listening.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; All<a target="foot" id="fkk0051">&ordm;</a> the leading
provincial. <i>Northern Whig</i>. <i>Cork Examiner</i>. <i>Enniscorthy
Guardian</i>.<a target="foot" id="fkk0054">&ordm;</a> Last year.

gentleman&nbsp;&hellip; If you just follow the atten&nbsp;&hellip; Or, please
allow me&nbsp;&hellip; This way&nbsp;&hellip; Please, sir&nbsp;&hellip; </p>
<p> Voluble, dutiful, he led the way all the principal papers, a bowing figure following his hasty heels.</p>
<p> The door closed.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The sheeny! Buck Mulligan cried.<a target="foot" id="fkk0057">&ordm;</a></p>
<p> He jumped up and snatched the card.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What&apos;s his name? Ikey Moses? Bloom.</p>
<p> He rattled on:<a target="foot" id="fkk0058">&ordm;</a></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Jehovah, collector of prepuces, is no more. I found him
over in the museum where<a target="foot" id="fkk0059">&ordm;</a> I went to hail
the foamborn Aphrodite. The Greek mouth that has never been twisted in prayer.
Every day we must do homage to her. <i>Life of life, thy lips enkindle</i>&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> Suddenly he turned to Stephen.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He knows you, he said. He knows your old fellow. O, I fear
me, he is Greeker than the Greeks. His pale Galilean eyes were upon her fatty parts. Venus
<br><font color="green">{u22, 193}</font>
<br> Callipyge, the world&apos;s desire. O, the thunder of those loins! <i>The
god pursuing,</i><a target="foot" id="fkk0060">&ordm;</a> <i>the maiden hid</i>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; We want to hear more, John Eglinton decided with Mr
Best&apos;s approval. We begin to be interested in Mrs S. Till now we had
thought of her, if at all, as a patient Griselda, a Penelope stay-at-home.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Antisthenes, pupil of Gorgias, Stephen said, took the palm
of beauty from Kyrios Menelaus&apos; broodmare, Argive Helen, and handed it to
poor Penelope. Twenty years he lived in London and, during part of that time, he
drew a salary equal to that of the lord chancellor of Ireland. His life was
rich. His art, more than the art of feudalism as Walt Whitman called it, is the
art of surfeit. Hot herringpies, green mugs of sack, honeysauces, gooseberried
pigeons,
<a name="un3021k" href="../../ff/unbs/un3all.htm#un3021k">ringocandies</a>. Sir
Walter Raleigh, when they arrested him, had half a million francs on his back.
The gombeenwoman Eliza Tudor had underlinen enough to vie with her of Sheba.
Twenty years he dallied there. You know Bannington&apos;s story of the
burgher&apos;s wife who bade Dick Burbage to her bed after she had seen him in
Richard III and how Shakespeare took the cow by the horns and, when Burbage
knocked, answered from the blankets &ldquo;William the conqueror came
first&rdquo;. And mistress Fitton, mount and cry O, and his dainty
<a name="un3020q" href="../../ff/unbs/un3all.htm#un3020q">birdsnies</a>, lady
Penelope Rich, and the punks of the bankside a penny a time.</p>
<p> Cours la Reine</p>
<p> Encore vingt sous. Nous ferons des petites cochonneries. Minette? Tu veux?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The height of fine society. And sir William Davenant of
Oxford&apos;s mother with her cup of canary for any cock canary.</p>
<p> Buck Mulligan prayed with pious eyes:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Blessed Margaret Mary Anycock!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And Harry of six wives&apos; daughter. And other lady
friends from neighbour seats as Lawn Tennyson, gentleman poet, has it. But all
those twenty years what do you suppose poor Penelope in Stratford was doing behind the diamond panes?</p>
<p> Do and do. Thing done. Thing done. In A rosery of Fetter
lane<a target="foot" id="fkk0063">&ordm;</a> of Gerard, herbalist, he walks,
greyedauburn. An azured harebell like her veins. Violets, the lids of
Juno&apos;s eyes. He walks. One life is all. One body. Do. But do. Afar, in a
reek of lust, in squalor, hands are laid on whiteness.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 194}</font> </p>
<p> Buck Mulligan rapped John Eglinton&apos;s desk sharply.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Whom do you suspect? he said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Say that he is the spurned lover in the sonnets. Once
spurned twice spurned. But the court wanton spurned him for a lord, dear my love.</p>
<p> Love that dare not speak its name.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; As an Englishman, you mean, John sturdy Eglinton put in, he loved a lord.</p>
<p> Old wall where sudden lizards flash. At Charenton I watched them.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It seems so, Stephen said, when he wants to do for him,
and for all other and singular uneared wombs, the office an ostler does for the
stallion. Maybe, like Socrates, he had a midwife to mother as he had a shrew to
wife. But she, the wanton, did not break a bedvow. Two deeds are rank in that
ghost&apos;s mind a broken vow and  the dullbrained yokel on whom her favour has
declined. Sweet Anne,<a target="foot" id="fkk0064">&ordm;</a> I take it, was hot
in the blood. Once a wooer, twice a wooer.</p>
<p> Stephen turned boldly in his chair.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The burden of proof is with you not with me, he said
frowning. If you deny that in the
<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font>
scene in <i>Hamlet</i> he has branded her with infamy tell me why there is no
mention of her during the thirtyfour years between the day he married her and
the day she buried him. O,<a target="foot" id="fkk0066">&ordm;</a> yes, there
is. In the years when he was living richly in royal London to pay a debt she had
to borrow five bob from her father&apos;s shepherd. Explain you then. Explain
the swansong too wherein he has commended her to posterity.</p>
<p> He faced their silence.</p>
<p> To whom thus Eglinton: You<a target="foot" id="fkk0067">&ordm;</a> mean the will.
<br> But that has been explained, I believe, by jurists.
<br> <a name="un3007b" href="../../ff/unbs/un3all.htm#un3007b">She was entitled to her widow&apos;s dower</a>

<br> From the first draft but he did not leave out
<br> The presents for his granddaughter, for his daughters,

<br> As I believe, to name her 
<br> He left her his

<p class="di">&mdash; Pretty countryfolk had few chattles then, John Eglinton
observed, as they have still if our peasant plays are true to type.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He was a rich country gentleman, Stephen said, with a coat
of arms and landed estate. Why did he not leave her his best bed if he wished
her to snore away the rest of her nights in peace?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It is clear that there were two beds, Mr Best said finely.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>Separatio a mensa et a thalamo</i>, said Buck Mulligan and was smiled on.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Antiquity mentions famous beds, John Eglinton puckered,
bedsmiling.<a target="foot" id="fkk0069">&ordm;</a> Let me think.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 196}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Do you mean he died so? Mr Best asked with concern. I mean&nbsp;&hellip; </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He died dead drunk, Buck Mulligan stated. <i>A quart of
ale is a dish for a king.</i><a target="foot" id="fkk0070">&ordm;</a> O, I must tell you what Dowden said!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What? asked Besteglinton.</p>
<p> William Shakespeare and company, limited. The people&apos;s William. For
terms apply: Edward Dowden, Highfield house&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Lovely! Buck Mulligan suspired amorously. I asked him what
he thought of the charge of pederasty brought against the bard. He lifted his
hands and said: <i>All we can say is that life ran very high in those days.</i> Lovely!</p>
<p> Catamite.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The sense of beauty leads us astray, Mr Best with some sadness said.</p>
<p> Will they wrest from us, from me,<a target="foot" id="fkk0071">&ordm;</a> the palm of beauty?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And the sense of property, Stephen said. He drew Shylock
out of his own long pocket. The son of a maltjobber and moneylender he was
himself a cornjobber and moneylender, with ten tods of corn hoarded in famine
years. His borrowers are no doubt the
<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">unread</span></font>
divers of worship mentioned by Chettle Falstaff who reported his uprightness of
dealing. He sued a fellowplayer for the price of a few bags of malt and exacted
his pound of flesh in interest for every money lent. How can could Aubrey&apos;s
ostler and callboy get rich quick? All events brought grist to his mill. Shylock
chimes with the jewbaiting that followed the hanging and quartering of the
queen&apos;s leech Lopez, his jew&apos;s heart being plucked forth while the
sheeny was yet alive: <i>Hamlet</i> and <i>Macbeth</i> with the coming to the
throne of a Scotch philosophaster with a turn for witchroasting. The lost armada
is his jeer in <i>Love&apos;s Labour Lost</i>. His pageants, the histories, sail
fullbellied on a tide of Mafeking enthusiasm. His sugared sonnets follow
Sidney&apos;s<a target="foot" id="fkk0072">&ordm;</a>. As for the gross virgin
who inspired the <i>Merry Wives of Windsor</i> let her be. A Meinherr from Almany will be her champion.</p>
<p> I think you&apos;re getting on very nicely. Just mix up a mixture of mixed

<p class="di">&mdash; Prove that he was a jew, John Eglinton dared, expectantly.
Your dean of studies holds he was a holy Roman.</p>
<p> <i>Sufflamindanus sum</i>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He was made in Germany, Stephen replied, as the champion French polisher of Italian scandals.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A myriadminded man, Mr Best reminded. Coleridge called him myriadminded.</p>
<p> <i>Amplius. In societate humana hoc est maxime necessarium ut sit amicitia inter multos.</i></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Saint Thomas, Stephen began&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>Ora pro nobis</i>, Buck Mulligan groaned, sinking to a chair.</p>
<p> He keened to a rune.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It&apos;s destroyed we are from this day, It&apos;s destroyed we are surely.</p>
<p> All smiled</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Saint Thomas, Stephen smiling said, writing of incest from
a standpoint different from that of the Viennese school Mr Magee spoke of,
likens it in his wise and curious way to an avarice of the emotions. He means
that the love so given to one near in blood is covetously withheld from a
stranger who, it may be, hungers for it. Jews, whom christians tax with avarice,
are of all races the most given to intermarriage. But accusations are made in
anger. The christian laws which built up the hoards of the jews (for, like the
lollards, storm was their shelter) bound their affections too with hoops of
steel. Whether these be sins or virtues old Nobodaddy will tell us at the
doomsday leet. But a man who holds so tightly to what he calls his rights over
what he calls his debts will hold tightly also to what he calls his rights over
 her whom he calls his wife. No sir smile neighbour shall covet his ox or his
wife or his manservant or his maidservant or his jackass.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Or jennyass, Buck Mulligan antiphoned.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Gentle Will<a target="foot" id="fkk0074">&ordm;</a> is
being roughly handled, gently Mr Best said gently.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Which will?<a target="foot" id="fkk0075">&ordm;</a> asked Buck Mulligan. We are getting mixed.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The will to live, John Eglinton philosophised. Poor Ann,
Will&apos;s widow, is the will to die.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>Requiescat</i>, Stephen said.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 198}</font>
<br> She lies laid out in stark stiffness in that secondbest bed even though you
prove that a bed in those days was as rare as a motorcar is now and that its
carvings were the wonder of seven parishes. In old age she takes up with
gospellers (one stayed with her at New Place and drank a quart of sack the town
council paid for but in which bed he slept it skills not) and heard she had a
soul. Venus has twisted her lips in prayer. Agenbite of inwit, remorse of
conscience. It is an age of exhausted whoredom groping for its god.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That appears to be true, John Eglinton said,
chronolologos. The ages succeed one another. But it has been said that a
man&apos;s worst enemies shall be those of his own house and family. I feel that
A.&nbsp;E. is right. What do we care for his wife or
father?<a target="foot" id="fkk0077">&ordm;</a> I should say that only family
poets have family lives. Falstaff was not a family man. I feel that the fat knight is his supreme creation.</p>
<p> Lean, he lay back. Shy, deny thy kindred, the unco guid.
Shy,<a target="foot" id="fkk0078">&ordm;</a> supping with blasphemers, he sneaks
the cup. A sire in Ultonian Antrim bade it him. Visits him here at quarter
tense. Mr Magee, sir, there&apos;s  a gentleman to see you. Me? Says he&apos;s
your father, sir. Give me a Wordsworth. Enter Magee Mor Matthew, a rugged,
rough, rugheaded kern, his nether socks signed with clauber of ten forests, a wilding in his hand.</p>
<p> Your own? He knows your old fellow.</p>
<p> Hurrying to her squalid deathlair from gay Paris on the quayside I touched
his hand. The voice, new warmth, speaking. Dr Bob Kenny is attending her. The
eyes that wish me well. But do not know me.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A father, Stephen said, battling with against
hopelessness, is a necessary evil. He wrote the play in the months that followed
his father&apos;s death. If you hold that he, a greying man with two
marriageable daughters with thirty five years of life, nel mezzo del cammin, and
fifty of experience is the beardless undergraduate from
Wittenberg<a target="foot" id="fkk0081">&ordm;</a> then you must hold that his
seventyyear old mother is the lustful queen. No. The corpse of John Shakespeare
does not walk the night. From hour to hour he rots and rots. He rests,
<br><font color="green">{u22, 199}</font>
<br> disarmed of fatherhood, having devised that mystical estate upon his son.
Boccaccio&apos;s Calandrino was the first and last man who felt himself with
child. Fatherhood, in the sense of conscious begetting, is unknown to man. It is
a mystical estate, an apostolic succession, from only begetter to only begotten.
On this mystery and not on the madonna whom the cunning Italian intellect flung
to the mob of Europe the church is founded and founded irremovably because
founded, like the world, macro and microcosm, upon the void. Upon incertitude,
upon unlikelihood.<a target="foot" id="fkk0082">&ordm;</a> <i>Amor matris</i>,
subjective and objective genitive, may be the only true thing in life. Paternity
may be a legal fiction. Who is the father of any son that any son should love him or he any son?</p>
<p> What the hell are you driving at?</p>
<p> I know. Shut up. Blast you. I have reasons.</p>
<p> Amplius. Adhuc. Rursus. Postea.</p>
<p> Are you condemned to do this?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; They are sundered by bodily shame so steadfast that the
criminal annals of the world, stained with all other incests and bestialities do
not record its breach. Sons with mothers, sires with  daughters, nephews with
grandmothers, queens with prize bulls. The unborn son mars beauty, born, he
brings pain, divides affection, increases care. He is a new male: his growth is
his father&apos;s decline, his youth his father&apos;s envy, his friend his father&apos;s enemy.</p>
<p> What links them in nature? An instant of blind rut.</p>
<p> Am I a father? If I were?</p>
<p> Shrunken uncertain hand.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Sabellius, the African, subtlest of heresiarchs held that
the Father was Himself His Own Son. The bulldog of Aquin, with whom no word
shall be impossible, refutes him. Well, if the father who has not a son be not a
father can the son who has not a father be a son? When
Rutland-Bacon-Southampton-Shakespeare wrote <i>Hamlet</i> he was not the father
of his own son merely but being no more a son, he was and felt himself the
father of all his race, the father of his own grandfather, the father of his
unborn grandson who, by the same token, never was born for nature, as Mr Magee understands her, abhors perfection.</p>
<p> Eglintoneyes, quick with pleasure, looked up shybrightly.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 200}</font> </p>
<p> Flatter. Rarely. But flatter.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Himself his own father, Buck Mulligan told himself. Wait.
I am big with child. I have an unborn child in Minerv my brain. Pallas Athena! A
play! The play&apos;s the thing! Let me parturiate!</p>
<p> He clasped his paunchbrow with both birthaiding hands.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; As for his family, Stephen said, his mother&apos;s name
lives in the forest of Arden. Her death brought from him the scene with Volumnia
in <i>Coriolanus</i>. His boyson&apos;s death the deathscene of prince Arthur in
<i>King John</i>. Hamlet The black prince is Hamlet Shakespeare. Who the girls
are in <i>The Tempest</i>, in <i>Pericles</i>, in <i>Winter&apos;s Tale</i> we
know. who <i>Venus</i> and who Cressid we may guess. But there is another member of his family who is recorded. </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The plot thickens, John Eglinton said.</p>

<p class="scylla"><i>Stephen</i></p>
<p> He had three brothers, Gilbert, Edmund, Richard. Gilbert in his old age told
some cavaliers he seen his brud wud a man on his back in a play one time. The
playhouse sausage filled Gilbert&apos;s soul. An Edmund and a Richard are recorded in the plays of William.</p>
<p class="scylla"><i>Johneglinton</i></p>

<p class="scylla"><i>Stephen</i></p>
<p> He has hidden his own name in the plays, a super here, a clown there, as a
painter in old Italy put his face in a dark corner of his canvas. He has
revealed it in the sonnets where there is will in overplus. Like John o&apos;
Gaunt<a target="foot" id="fkk0085">&ordm;</a> his name is dear to him, as dear
as the coat and crest he toadied for, dearer than his glory of the greatest
shakescene in the country. What&apos;s in his name? That is what we ask
ourselves in childhood when we write the name that we are told is ours. A star,
a star shining by day, a firedrake, rose at his birth. It shone by day in the
heavens alone and by night it shone over delta in Cassiopeia, the recumbent
constellation which is the signature of his initial among the stars. Pillar of
cloud and pillar of fire, eh? His eyes watched it, lowlying on the horizon,
eastward of the bear, as he walked by the slumberous summer fields at midnight
returning from Shottery and from her arms.</p>
<p> Both satisfied. I too.</p>
<p>

<p class="di">&mdash; What is that, Mr Dedalus? the quaker librarian asked. Was it a celestial phenomenon?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="un3015i" href="../../ff/unbs/un3all.htm#un3015i">A star by night,
Stephen said. A pillar of the cloud by day</a>.</p>
<p> What more&apos;s to say?</p>
<p> Stephen looked on his hat, his stick, his boots.</p>
<p> My crown. My sword. His boots are spoiling the shape of my feet. Buy a pair. Holes in my socks.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You make good use of the name, John Eglinton allowed. Your
own is strange enough. I suppose it explains your fantastical humour.</p>
<p> Me, Magee and Mulligan.</p>
<p> Fabulous artificer. The hawklike man. You flew. Whereto? Newhaven-Dieppe,
steerage passenger. Paris and back. Lapwing. Icarus. Pater, ait. Seabedabbled,
fallen, weltering. Lapwing you are. Lapwing be.</p>
<p> Mr Best eagerquietly lifted his book to say:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That&apos;s very interesting because that brother motive,
don&apos;t you know, we find also in the old Irish myths. Just what you say. The
three brothers Shakespeare. In Grimm too, don&apos;t you know, the fairytale.
The third brother that marries the sleeping beauty and gets the best prize always.</p>
<p> Best of Best brothers. Good, better, best.</p>
<p> The quaker librarian came anear.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I should like to know, he said, which brother
you&nbsp;&hellip; I understand you to suggest there was misconduct with one of
the brothers&nbsp;&hellip; But perhaps I am anticipating?</p>
<p> He caught himself in the act: looked at all: refrained.</p>
<p> An attendant from the doorway called:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Mr Lyster! Father Dineen<a target="foot" id="fkk0091">&ordm;</a> wants&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O, Father Dineen! Directly.</p>
<p> Swiftly rectly creaking rectly rectly rectly he was rectly gone.</p>
<p> John Eglinton touched the foil.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Come, he said. Let us hear what you have to say of Richard
and Edmund. You kept them for the last, didn&apos;t you? </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; In asking you to remember nuncle Richie
<br><font color="green">{u22, 203}</font>
<br> and nuncle Edmund, Stephen answered, I feel I am asking too much perhaps. A
brother is as easily forgotten as an umbrella.</p>
<p> Lapwing.</p>
<p> Where is your brother? Apothecaries&apos; Hall. My
<a name="jn2008f" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2008f">whetstone</a>. Him,
then Cranly, Mulligan: now these. Speech, speech. But act. Act speech. They mock to try you. Act.</p>
<p> Lapwing.</p>
<p> I am tired of my voice.</p>
<p> On.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You will say those names were already in the chronicles
from which he took the stuff of his plays. Why did he take them rather than
others? Richard, a crookback, misbegotten, makes love to a widowed Ann, woos and
wins her. Richard the conqueror came after William the conquered. The other four
acts of the play hang limply from that first. Of all his kings Richard is the
only king unshielded by Shakespeare&apos;s reverence, the angel of the world.
Why is the underplot of King Lear in which Edmund figures lifted out of
Sidney&apos;s Arcadia and spatchcocked on to a Celtic legend older than history.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That was Will&apos;s way, John Eglinton defended. We
should not now combine a Norse saga with an excerpt from a novel by George
Meredith. Que voulez-vous? George Moore would say. He puts Bohemia on the
seacoast and makes Ulysses quote Aristotle.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Why? Stephen answered himself. Because the theme of the
false or the usurping or the adulterous brother or all three in one is to
Shakespeare, what the poor are not, always with him. The note of banishment,
banished from the heart, banished from the home, sounds uninterruptedly from
<i>The Two Gentlemen</i><a target="foot" id="fkk0092">&ordm;</a> <i>of
Verona</i> onward till Prospero lays down his wand and burns his books. It
doubles itself in the middle of his life, reflects itself in another, repeats
itself. But it  was an original sin that darkened his understanding, weakened
his will and left in him a strong inclination to evil. The words are those of
the lords bishops of Maynooth. An original sin and, like original sin, committed
by another in whom he sinned. It is between the lines of his last written words,
it is petrified on his tombstone under which her four bones are not to be laid.
Age has not withered it. Beauty and peace have not done it away. It is in
<br><font color="green">{u22, 204}</font>
<br> infinite variety everywhere in the world he has created, in <i>Much Ado
about Nothing</i>, twice in <i>As You
Like</i><a target="foot" id="fkk0094">&ordm;</a> <i>It</i>, in <i>The
Tempest</i>, in <i>Hamlet</i>, in <i>Measure for Measure</i> &mdash;
and<a target="foot" id="fkk0095">&ordm;</a> in the other plays which I have not read.</p>
<p> He laughed to free his mind from his mind&apos;s bondage.</p>
<p> Judge Eglinton summed up.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The truth is midway, he affirmed. He is the ghost and the prince too. He is all in all.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, Stephen said. The boy of act one becomes a mature man
in act five. All in all. In <i>Cymbeline</i> in <i>Othello</i> he is pimp and
cuckold. He acts and is acted on. His unremitting intellect is the Iago
ceaselessly willing that the moor in him shall suffer.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Cuckoo! cuckoo! Buck Mulligan cooed softly. O word of fear!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And what a character is Iago! undaunted John Eglinton
exclaimed. When all is said Dumas (or is it Victor Hugo?) is right. After God Shakespeare has created most.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Man delights him not nor woman neither, Stephen said. He
returns after a life of absence to that spot of earth where he was born, where
he has been always a silent witness. and there, his journey of life ended, he
plants his mulberry tree. Then dies. Gravediggers bury Hamlet and they buried
Hamlet&apos;s father. If you like the last scene  look long on it: prosperous
Propero, the good man, Lizzie, grandpa&apos;s lump of love, and nuncle Richie,
the bad man taken off by providence to the place where the bad niggers go. He
found in his world without as actual that which was in his world within as
possible. Maeterlinck says: If Socrates leave his house today he will find the
sage seated on the doorstep. If Judas go forth tonight it is to Judas his steps
will go. Every life is many days, day after day. We walk through ourselves
meeting robbers, giants, ghosts, old men, young men,
wives,<a target="foot" id="fkk0100">&ordm;</a>
but<a target="foot" id="fkk0101">&ordm;</a> always meeting ourselves. The
dramatist who wrote this world and wrote it badly (He gave us light first and
the sun two days later), the lord of things as they are whom the most Roman of
catholics call <i>dio boia</i>, hangman god, is also all in all in all of us,
ostler and butcher and would be coupler and
<br><font color="green">{u22, 205}</font>
<br> cuckold also but that in the economy of heaven there are no more marriages,
the glorified man being a wife unto himself.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Eureka! Buck Mulligan cried. Eureka!</p>
<p> At once happied, he jumped up and reached in a stride John Eglinton&apos;s desk.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; May I? he said.</p>
<p> He began to scribble on a slip of paper.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Those who are married, Mr Best said quoted, all save one,
shall live. The rest shall keep as they are.</p>
<p> He laughed, unmarried, at John Eglinton, of arts a bachelor.</p>
<p> Uncaught, unfancied, they of wiles, they fingerponder nightly each his
variorum edition of <i>The Taming of the Shrew</i>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You are a delusion, said roundly John Eglinton to Stephen.
You have brought us all this way to show us a French triangle. Do you believe your own theory?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; No, Stephen said promptly.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Are you going to write
it?<a target="foot" id="fkk0104">&ordm;</a> Mr Bests asked. You ought to make it
a dialogue, don&apos;t you know, like the Platonian dialogues Wilde wrote.</p>
<p> John Eglinton smiled doubly. </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Well, in that case, he said, I don&apos;t see why you
should expect payment for it since you don&apos;t believe it yourself. Dowden
believes there is a mystery in <i>Hamlet</i> but will say no more. Piper met
that man in Berlin, the Mr Bleibtreu I mentioned. He believes the secret is
hidden in the Stratford monument. The Rutland theory. He is going to visit the
present duke. But he believes his theory.</p>
<p> I believe, O Lord, help my unbelief. That is, help me to believe or help me
to unbelieve? Who helps to believe? I myself. Who to unbelieve? Other chap.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You are the only contributor to <i>Dana</i> who asks for
pieces of silver. Then I don&apos;t know about the next number. Fred Ryan wants space for an article on economics.</p>
<p> Fred Ryan. Two pieces of silver he lent me. To tide you over. Economics.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; For a guinea, Stephen said, you can publish this interview.</p>
<p> Buck Mulligan stood up from his laughing scribbling, laughing: and then gravely said, honeying malice:
<br><font color="green">{u22, 206}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I called upon the bard Kinch at his summer residence in
Mecklenburgh street and found him deep in the study of the <i>Summa contra
Gentiles</i> in the company of two gonorrheal ladies, Fresh Nelly and Rosalie, the coalquay whore.</p>
<p> He broke away.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Come, Kinch. Come, wandering Aengus<a target="foot" id="fkk0106">&ordm;</a> of the birds.</p>
<p> Come, Kinch. You have eaten all we left. Ay. I will serve you your orts and offals.</p>
<p> Stephen rose.</p>
<p> Life is many days. This will end.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; We shall see you tonight, John Eglinton said. <i>Notre
ami</i> Moore says Malachi Mulligan must be there.</p>
<p> Buck Mulligan waved his slip and panama.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Lecturer on French letters to young Ireland, he said.
I&apos;ll be there. Come, Kinch, the bards must drink. Can you walk straight? </p>
<p> Laughing, he&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> Swill till midnight. Irish nights entertainment.</p>
<p> Lubber&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p> He laughed, lolling a to and fro head, walking on, followed by Stephen: and
mirthfully he told the shadows, souls of moors:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O, the night in the Camden hall the daughters of Erin had to lift
<br><font color="green">{u22, 209}</font>
<br> their skirts to step over you as you lay in your mulberrycoloured multicoloured, multitudinous vomit!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The most innocent son of Erin, Stephen said, for whom they ever lifted them.</p>

<p> Part. The moment is now. Where then? If Socrates leave his house today, if
Judas go forth tonight. Why? That lies in space which I in time must come to, ineluctably. </p>

<p> Manner of Oxenford.</p>
<p> Day. Wheelbarrow sun over arch of bridge.</p>
<p> A dark back went before them, step<a target="foot" id="fkk0123">&ordm;</a>
of a pard, down, out by the gateway, under portcullis barbs.</p>
<p> They followed.</p>
<p> Offend me still. Speak on.</p>
<p> Kind air defined the coigns of houses in Kildare street. No birds. Frail
from the housetops two plumes of smoke ascended, pluming, and in a flaw of softness, softly were blown.</p>
<p> Cease to strive. Peace of the druid priests of Cymbeline: hierophantic: from wide earth an altar.</p>
<p class="set">Laud we the gods
<br> And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils
<br> From our bless&apos;d altars.</p>  </main>
