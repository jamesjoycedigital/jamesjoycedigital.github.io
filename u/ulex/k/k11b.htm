<p class="pdi">&mdash; And we have those priceless pages of <u>Wilhelm
Meister</u>, the quaker librarian said, have we not? A great poet on a great
brother poet. A soul confronted with a task beyond its powers, torn by conflicting doubts as one sees in life.</p>
<p> He made a step wearily on creaking bootsole and stepped backward creaking on the solemn floor.</p>
<p> An attendant opening the door made
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">to</span></span> him a noiseless sign.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Immediately, he said, creaking to go.
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">For Goethe is always</span></span>
The dreamer who comes to grief against hard facts. One always feels that
Goethe&apos;s words are so true. True in the larger sense.</p>
<p> Zealous, bold, urbane he hasted twicreakingly towards
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the</span></span> his summons;
bald he heard the attendant&apos;s summons and was gone</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">And</span></span> Monsieur de la

<p class="pdi">&mdash; Have you your

John Eglinton&apos;s carping voice asked, to write <u>Paradise Lost</u> at your

<p> Glittereyed his

<p> Folly. Persist.</p>
<p> Mulligan has my telegram.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Our young Irish bards, John Eglinton said, have yet to
create something which the world will set beside Saxon Shakespeare&apos;s
<u>Hamlet</u> The peatsmoke is exhilarating, George Moore says. We want men not wraiths and spooks.
<br><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">&mdash; What is a ghost? Stephen asked. Is it not</span></span></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; All these questions are purely academic, Russell said
from his shadow. For professors of the university. I mean, if Hamlet is
Shakespeare or James I or Essex. Art has to show us ideas, formless spiritual
essences. The supreme question about a work of art is
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">h</span></span> out of how deep a
life does it spring. The action and the actors are shadows in time, their
thoughts are actions in eternity. The painting of Gustave Moreau is the painting
of ideas. The deepest poetry of Shelley, the words of <u>Hamlet</u>, bring our
minds into contact with the eternal realities. The rest is schoolboy speculation.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The schoolmen were schoolboys at first, Stephen said.
Aristotle himself was Plato&apos;s prize schoolboy at first.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; We hope he is so still, John Eglinton said maliciously. I
can see him quite proud of it too. With his diploma under his arm.</p>
<p> He laughed again towards the now smiling bearded face. Formless spiritual essences. Father,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 3}</font>

<p> Mr Best entered, tall, young, mild, light. He bore in his hand with grace two books, new, bright, large, clean.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That model schoolboy, Stephen said, would
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">no doubt</span></span> find
Hamlet&apos;s thoughts on the immortality of his soul as shallow as Plato&apos;s.</p>
<p> John Eglinton said
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">sharply:</span></span>
frowning<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">:</span></span>, waxing wroth:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I confess it makes my blood boil to hear anyone compare Plato and Aristotle.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Which of the two would have banished the creator of
<u>Hamlet</u> from his commonwealth<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">?</span></span>, Stephen asked. </p>
<p> Mr Best came forward simply and said towards his colleague.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Haines is gone, he said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is he? John Eglinton said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I was showing him Jubainville&apos;s book. He&apos;s
quite interested, don&apos;t you know, about Hyde&apos;s lovesongs. I
couldn&apos;t bring him in. He&apos;s gone to Gill&apos;s to buy a copy.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The peatsmoke works wonders, John Eglinton said.</p>
<p> We feel in England that we have.
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">An Ir</span></span> The penitent thief. An Irishman must
<br><font color="green">{ms, 4}</font>
<br> think<a target="foot" id="fkz0006">&ordm;</a> like that I daresay.</p>
<p> Gone. I smoked his cigarette.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; People do not know how dangerous lovesongs can be,
Russell said darkly. The movements which work revolutions in the world are born
out of the dreams in a peasant&apos;s heart on the hillside. For them the earth
is not an exploitable ground but a living mother. The rarefied air of the
academy and of the political arena produces only the sixshilling novel, the
musichall songs. France produces the finest flower of corruption in
Mallarm&eacute; but the desirable life is made known only to the poor of heart, the life of Homer&apos;s Phaecians.</p>
<p> Mr Best turned his inoffensive face from these words to Stephen</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Mallarm&eacute;, don&apos;t you know, he said, has
written those wonderful poems. There&apos;s one about <u>Hamlet</u>. He says he
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">walks reading in the</span></span>
il se prom&egrave;ne, lisant au livre de lui-m&ecirc;me, don&apos;t you know,
&mdash; &mdash;. He says a performance of <u>Hamlet</u> in a French provincial town. They advertised it.</p>
<p> His gracious hand wrote tiny signs in the air:</p>
<p class="center">Hamlet</p>
<p class="center">ou</p>
<p class="center">Le Distrait</p>
<p class="center">pi&egrave;ce de Shakespeare</p>
<p> He repeated to John Eglinton&apos;s new frown:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Hamlet,
don&apos;t you know, or the absentminded</span></span> <u>Pi&egrave;ce de Shakespeare</u>, don&apos;t
<br><font color="green">{ms, 5}</font>
<br> you<a target="foot" id="fkz0007">&ordm;</a> know. It&apos;s so French. The
French point of view. Hamlet or&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The absentminded beggar, Stephen said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, I suppose it would be, John Eglinton laughed.
Excellent people, no doubt, but distressingly shortsighted in some matters.
<br><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">&mdash; More than one Hamlet
has put off black for khaki, Stephen said.</span></span>
<br><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">&mdash; He changes his inky
cloak for khaki in act five, Stephen said.</span></span></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">A khaki
Hamlet, why not? Stephen said.</span></span> He kills nine lives for his
father&apos;s one, Stephen said. A khaki Hamlet, as Mr Balfour has it,
doesn&apos;t hesitate to shoot. And the stage in act five is a
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">model</span></span> concentration camp.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He insists that Hamlet is a ghoststory, John Eglinton said for Mr Best&apos;s behoof. Like</p>
<p> <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">I am thy father&apos;s spirit
doomed for a certain term to walk the night</span></span>
<br> the fat boy in Pickwick he wants to make our flesh creep.</p>
<p> Hear, hear, O hear!</p>
<p> My flesh hears, creeping, hears.
<br> <u>If thou didst ever</u>&nbsp;&hellip;.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What is a ghost? Stephen said with tingling energy. One
who has faded into impalpability through death, or through absence or through
change of manners, through that oblivion which death and absence bring.
Elizabethan London lay as far from Stratford as corrupt Paris lies from this city in our day. Who is this ghost,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 6}</font>
<br> a<a target="foot" id="fkz0009">&ordm;</a> sablesilvered man returning to
the world that <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">has</span></span>
has forgotten him? Who is King Hamlet?</p>
<p> John Eglinton shifted his spare body, leaning back to hear.</p>
<p> Lifted him.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It is this hour of the day, Stephen said, begging with a
swift glance their hearing, in Shakespeare&apos;s London.. We are in his Globe
theatre on the bankside. The flag is up. The bear Sackerson growls in the
bearpit hard by. Sailors who sailed with Drake chew their sausages and stand with the groundlings. The play begins.</p>
<p> An actor enters, clad in the cast-off mail of a buck of the court, a wellset
man with a deep voice. It is the ghost, King Hamlet. The actor is Shakespeare.
And Shakespeare speaks his words, calling the young man to whom he speaks, by name.</p>
<p class="set"><u>Hamlet, I am thy father&apos;s spirit</u></p>
<p class="flush">and bidding him
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">to</span></span> list. To his son
he speaks, to his son, the prince, young Hamlet and to his son, Hamlet
Shakespeare who has died in Stratford that his namesake may live for ever.</p>
<p> Is it possible that that actor, a ghost by absence, in the vesture of the
elder Hamlet, a ghost by death, speaking his own words to his own son, (for had
Hamlet Shakespeare lived he would have been then a young man of twenty)
<br><font color="green">{ms, 7}</font>
<br> is<a target="foot" id="fkz0011">&ordm;</a> it possible that he did not draw
the logical conclusion of those premises? I am the murdered father;
<a name="jn2007h" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2007h">you are the
dispossessed son</a>: your mother is the guilty queen.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But this prying into the family secrets of a man, Russell
said impatiently, is interesting only to the parish clerk. I mean we have the
plays. I mean when we read the poetry of <u>King Lear</u> what is it to us how
the poet lived? As for living, Villiers de l&apos;Isle said, our servants can do
that for us. This peeping and prying into
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">a</span></span> the greenroom
gossip of the day,
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">whe</span></span> the poet&apos;s
drinking habits, the poet&apos;s debts.</p>
<p> By the way that pound he lent you. You spent most of it in Georgina
Johnson&apos;s bed. Do you intend to pay it back? O, yes. When? Now? Well, no.
When then? I Paid my way. I paid my way. He doesn&apos;t want it. Said now. Hold
on: he comes from the north. Six months ago. Molecules
<a name="un5016ab" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5016ab">change completely. I
am another I</a> now. Other I got pound. But I,
<a name="jn1004b" href="../../ff/unbs/jn1all.htm#jn1004b">soul,, form of

<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do you mean to fly in the face of the tradition of three
centuries? John Eglinton asked. Her ghost at least has been laid for ever. She
died, for literature I mean before she was born.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 6v}</font> </p>
<p class="flush">
<br><font color="green">{ms, 8}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; She<a target="foot" id="fkz0013">&ordm;</a> died, Stephen
retorted, sixtyseven years after she was born. She saw him into and out of the
world. She suffered his first embraces. She bore and bred his children and she closed his eyes in death.</p>
<p> John Eglinton looked into the
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">glowing</span></span> tangled wires of his lamp.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The world believes that Shakespeare made a mistake, he
said, and got out of it as quickly as he could.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Bosh! Stephen said rudely. A man of genius makes no
mistakes. His errors are volitional and are the portals of discovery.</p>
<p> Portal of discovery opened. The quaker librarian came in softcreakfooted, assiduous, bald and eared.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A shrew, John Eglinton said shrewdly, is not a useful
portal of discovery, one should imagine. What useful discovery did Socrates owe to Xanthippe.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ask him, Stephen said. He called himself a midwife.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But Ann Hathaway? Mr Best&apos;s quiet accent said
forgetfully. Yes, we seem to forget her as Shakespeare himself forgot her.</p>
<p> His face went from the brooder&apos;s beard to the carper&apos;s skull, to
remind, to chide most kindly, then to the halted bald head of the quaker librarian, guiltless though maligned.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I suspect, Stephen said, he had as good a memory. He
brought a memory in the wallet <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">of
his mind</span></span> as he trudged to Romeville,
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">to London,</span></span> whistling
<u>The girl I left behind me</u>. The book in which he sang it lay in the
bedchamber of every light-of-love in London. A shrew! Is Katharine illfavoured? Had the
<br><font color="green">{ms, 9}</font>
<br> sensual poet who wrote <u>Venus and Adonis</u>, do you think, his eyes in
his back that he chose of all Warwickshire the ugliest doxy to lie with? He was
chosen more than a chooser. The goddess who bends over the boy is a young, ripe
and ardent woman who forces in a cornfield a lover, younger than herself.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ryefield, Mr Best said.</p>
<p> He murmured then with blond delight for all
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">who should</span></span> who would hear:</p>
<p class="pdiset">&mdash; <u>Between the acres of the rye</u>
<br> <u>These pretty countryfolk would lie</u></p>
<p> Paris: a wellpleased pleaser.</p>
<p> A tall figure in homespun rose from its shadow and pulled out a sensible watch.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I am afraid I must go</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Are you going? John Eglinton asked. Are you coming to
Moore&apos;s tomorrow night. Piper is coming.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is Piper back? Mr Best asked.</p>
<p> Peter Piper pecked a peck of peck of peck of pickled pepper.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I don&apos;t know if I can.
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Thursday</span></span> Thursday.
We have our meeting. If I can get away in time.

quaker librarian
said<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span> amiably and
earnestly. Mr Russell, rumour has it, has gathered together a sheaf of our
younger poets&apos; verses. We are all looking forward anxiously.</p>
<p> He glanced anxiously in the cone of lamplight where three faces,
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">variously</span></span> lighted, shone.</p>
<p> Stephen looked upon his black hat
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">and ashplant</span></span> hung on
the ashplant. <a name="gn1016d" href="../../ff/unbs/gn1all.htm#gn1016d">My casque and sword.</a> Listen.</p>
<p> Young Colum and Starkey. George Roberts is doing the commercial part.
Longworth promises to give a column in the <u>Express</u>. I liked Colum&apos;s

<a name="jn1034q" href="../../ff/unbs/jn1all.htm#jn1034q">that queer thing

he? I hope you&apos;ll be able to come tonight. Malachi Mulligan is coming too,
Moore says. Did you hear Miss Mitchell&apos;s joke about Moore and Martyn. She
says Moore is Martyn&apos;s wild oats. Awfully good, isn&apos;t it? Moore
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">doesn&apos;t seem to think

<p> Now your very best manners.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Thank you very much, Stephen said. You will give the letter to Mr Norman then&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, yes, Russell said. If he considers it important it will go in.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I understand, Stephen said. Thank you.</p>
<p> Synge has promised me an article for <u>Dana</u> too. Do you think we are
going to be read? They want you to have part of it in Irish. I hope you will come round tonight. Bring Starkey too.</p>
<p> Stephen sat down again.</p>
<p> The quaker librarian came away from the leavetakers. Blushing his
<br><font color="green">{ms, 11}</font>
<br> mask<a target="foot" id="fkz0018">&ordm;</a> said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Mr Dedalus, your views are most illuminating.</p>
<p> He creaked to and fro and, covered by the outgoing noises, said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Do</span></span> Is it your idea,
then, that she was not faithful to the poet?</p>
<p> Stephen gazed at the alarmed face before him. Inner light he too seeks. A
zealous lollard. Why did he come to me? Politeness or an inner light? His Christ
in leather hose, hiding in hollow treefork from persecutors, walking lonely in
the chase. Women he won, whores of Babylon, justices&apos; wives, wives of
innkeepers. And in New Place a dishonoured body, once sweet as cinnamon, now her
leaves falling all, bare, frighted of the grave.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; There is no reconciliation, Stephen said, unless there has been a sundering.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; So you think&nbsp;&hellip;.</p>
<p> The door closed behind the outgoer.</p>
<p> A sudden rest filled the discreet vaulted cell where a vestel&apos;s lamp
burned. Coffined thoughts lie around, in mummy cases, embalmed in languages.
Once quick in the live brains of men they lie still. The itch of death is in
them yet. To speak in my ear their maudlin story and urge me to their will.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Certainly, John Eglinton said, of all great men he is the
most enigmatic but that he lived and suffered. A shadow hangs over all the rest.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But <u>Hamlet</u> is so personal, isn&apos;t it, Mr Best said. I mean
<br><font color="green">{ms, 12}</font>
<br> a<a target="foot" id="fkz0019">&ordm;</a> kind of private paper, don&apos;t
you know, of his private life. I mean, I don&apos;t care about who is killed or&nbsp;&hellip;.</p>
<p> He rested his notebooks on the edge of the desk. Private papers. <u>Ta an bad ar an tir. Taim im mo sagart.</u></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He is still doomed for a certain term to walk the night of criticism, Stephen said.</p>
<p> John Eglinton horsed a knee impatiently, saying</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I was prepared for paradoxes from what Mulligan told me
but I must say if you want to
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">r</span></span> shake my belief
that Shakespeare is Hamlet you have a stern task before you. His glinting eyes
glanced sideways at Stephen from under stern wrinkled brows.
<a name="gn1015a" href="../../ff/unbs/gn1all.htm#gn1015a">Basilisk eyed. <u>E
quando vede l&apos;uomo l&apos;attosca.</u> Messer Brunetto, I thank thee for the word.</a></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;
<a name="un1032ec" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1032ec">As we weave and
unweave our bodies</a>, Stephen said, from day to day so does the artist
<a name="un1032ec" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1032ec">weave and
unweave</a> his image. And as the mole on my left shoulder is where it was when
I was born, though all my body has been woven of new stuff time after time so
for the ghost of unquiet father the image of the unliving son looks forth. At
his age I shall see myself as I sit here today but by reflection from that which then I shall be.</p>
<p> Got round that neatly.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But, I feel Hamlet quite young, Mr Best said youngly.
Even his bitterness might be the reflection of the father
<br><font color="green">{ms, 13}</font>
<br> but<a target="foot" id="fkz0020">&ordm;</a> the passages with Ophelia is surely the son.</p>
<p> Has the wrong sow by the ear. But what harm.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That is the last mole to disappear, Stephen said laughing.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; If that were the sole birthmark of genius, John Eglinton
said, it would be a drug in the market. The plays of Shakespeare&apos;s last
years which Renan admired so much breathe a different spirit.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The spirit of reconciliation, the quaker librarian said appeasingly.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; There is no reconciliation, Stephen said, without a
sundering. Tragic events darken the period of <u>Othello</u>, <u>Lear</u> and
<u>Hamlet</u> but that those events did not cast the deepest shadow is shown by
the way in which their shadow lifted
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">and a way to</span></span>. Who
and what is it that softens for awhile the heart of a man, of Pericles,
shipwrecked in the storms of a life&apos;s bitterness? A baby girl. Marina.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The affection of sophists for the apocrypha is a constant
quantity, John Eglinton said detectively. The highroads are dreary but they lead to the town.</p>
<p> Good Bacon, dry and musty. Cypher jugglers. Shakespeare is Bacon&apos;s wild
oats. What town are they bound for
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">or the yogi</span></span>,

<p class="pdi">&mdash; Mr<a target="foot" id="fkz0022">&ordm;</a> Brandes places
it as the first play of the closing period, Stephen said.
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Marina</span></span></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Does he? John Eglinton said. What does Mr Sidney Lee, or
Mr Simon Lazarus as I believe his name is, say of that play?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Marina, Stephen said,
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the</span></span> child of
seastorm, Imogen,
<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font>,
Miranda, a childish wonder, Perdita, that which was lost. That which was lost in
youth is reborn strangely in his wane of life: his daughter&apos;s child. But
who will love the daughter if he has not loved the mother? I don&apos;t know but
will he not see in her recreated and with the memory of his own youth added to
her the images which first awakened his love?</p>
<p> Do you know what you are talking about? Love, yes. <u>Amor vero aliquid
alicui bonum vult,</u>
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext"><u>undea</u></span></span> <u>unde
et ea quae concupiscimus</u>&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A man of genius above all whose own image is to him,
morally and materially, the Handmaid of all experience. He will be touched by
that appeal as he will be infallibly repelled by
<a name="gn1010b" href="../../ff/unbs/gn1all.htm#gn1010b">images of other males
of his brood in whom he will see grotesque attempts of nature to foretell</a> or to repeat himself.</p>
<p> The quaker librarian said, his forehead blushing:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I hope Mr Dedalus will develop his theory for the
instruction of the public. And we ought to mention another Irish commentator, Mr
Frank Harris. His articles on Shakespeare in the <u>Saturday</u>
<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font> were surely brilliant. Oddly
<br><font color="green">{ms, 15}</font>
<br> enough,<a target="foot" id="fkz0023">&ordm;</a> he too draws for us an
unhappy relation with the dark lady of the sonnets Mary Fitton. The favoured
rival is the young earl of Pembroke. I own that if the poet is to appear as
rejected such a rejection would seem &mdash; what shall I say? &mdash; our notions of what ought not to have been.</p>
<p> Having shaped the words felicitously he held his head meekly among them, an
auk&apos;s egg, prize of their strifes. A faint benign smile appeared on his
mask, echoing pleased his thought and
p<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps"><sub>unread</sub></span></font>&mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That may be too, Stephen said. There is a saying of
Goethe&apos;s which Mr Magee likes to quote. Beware of what you wish in youth
because in middle life it will be granted you. No wealth of words or richness of
experience will make
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the</span></span> him who was
overborne in a cornfield, excuse me, a ryefield a victor in his own eyes ever.
No later undoing will efface the first.
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">He may allow it to enflame and
darken his understanding of himself. In youth he thinks to put miles between
himself and it.</span></span> No assumed dongiovannism will save him. That goad
of the flesh will drive him into a new passion &mdash; its darker shadow &mdash;
darkening after a moment of flame his own understanding of himself. A like fate
awaits him and both rages like whirlpools commingle. But the later
<br><font color="green">{ms, 16}</font>
<br> rage<a target="foot" id="fkz0025">&ordm;</a> is a fever of the blood which
tortures but does not strike mortally the soul. Under the apparent dialogue and
diatribe the speech is always turned elsewhere, backward. He returns,
unsatisfied by his creations he has piled up between himself and himself, to
brood upon his wound. Imogen the ravished is Lucrece the undeflowered. There are
no mangods in our time. Shakespeare passes towards eternity, in undiminished
personality, unvisited by the eternal wisdom we heard about just now,
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">unscathed by</span></span>
untaught by the laws he has exemplified. His beaver is up
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">a</span></span> but he will not
speak or stay. A ghost, his words are
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">for the night of mourning on
which</span></span> heard only in the night
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">of despair</span></span>,
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">as</span></span> the wind around
Elsinore&apos;s rocks,

the son consubstantial with the father.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Amen!</p>
<p> <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Buck Mulligan&apos;s
ribald</span></span> Buck Mulligan responded from the doorway.</p>
<p> His ribald face, sullen
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">an</span></span> for an instant,
Buck Mulligan came forward blithely towards a greeting of
smiles<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span>, greeting
gaily with <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">t</span></span> his doffed Panama.</p>
<p> He has my telegram.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A most interesting discussion, the quaker librarian said.
Mr Mulligan, I am sure, has his theory too. All sides of life should be
<br><font color="green">{ms, 17}</font>
<br> represented.<a target="foot" id="fkz0027">&ordm;</a></p>
<p> Buck Mulligan thought, puzzled.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Shakespeare? he said.</p>
<p> A sudden sunny smile rayed into his relaxed features.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; To be sure, he said. The chap that writes like Synge.</p>
<p> Mr Best turned to him:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Haines was here, he said. He&apos;ll meet you after at
the D.B.C. He&apos;s gone to buy the <u>Lovesongs of Connacht</u>, don&apos;t you know. I was showing them to him.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Here? Buck Mulligan asked.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, Mr Best said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Shakespeare&apos;s fellowcountrymen, John Eglinton said,
are rather tired of our brilliancies of theorising.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The most brilliant of
all<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">, Mr Best</span></span> is that
story of Wilde&apos;s, don&apos;t you know, Mr Best said, lifting his brilliant
notebook. That picture of Mr W.H where he proves the sonnets were written by Mr William Hughes.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; For Mr William Hughes, is it not? the quaker librarian said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I mean, for Mr William Hughes, Mr Best said. Of course
it&apos;s all paradoxical, don&apos;t you know, Hughes and hews and hues, the
colours. But it&apos;s so typical the whole theory the way he works it out.
It&apos;s the essence of Wilde, don&apos;t you know. The light touch</p>
<p> His glance touched their faces lightly. as he smiled, a blond ephebe. Essence of Wilde. Tame essence of Wilde.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 18}</font> </p>
<p> You&apos;re<a target="foot" id="fkz0028">&ordm;</a> very witty today. The
three whiskies you drank with Dan Deasy&apos;s ducats? Brillianting before a
<a name="un1032dn" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1032dn">plump of</a>
pressmen. Beware. Irish humour wet and dry. Beware.</p>
<p> <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Buck Mulligan looked with
grave</span></span> <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Buck Mullig</span></span></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do you think it is only a paradox? the quaker librarian
asked. The scoffer is never taken seriously
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">even</span></span> when he is serious.</p>
<p> They talked.</p>
<p> Buck Mulligan&apos;s again heavy face eyed Stephen awhile. Then, shaking his
head, he came forward. He drew a folded telegram from his pocket, read it with
his mobile lips, smiling with new delight.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Telegram! he said. Wonderful inspiration! Telegram!</p>
<p> He sat on a corner of the unlit desk near Stephen, reading with delight.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without
incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done.
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Dedalus.</span></span> Where did
you send it from? College Green. Malachi Mulligan, the Ship, Middle Abbey
Street, Dublin. O, you lovely mummer! O,
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">you</span></span> priestified Kinchite! Signed: Dedalus.</p>
<p> Haines got the pip when Connery brought it in. And we waiting for pints
apiece <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the way we
could</span></span>, and you to be sending telegrams the way we to have our
tongues out a mile long like drouthy clerics do be lapping their pussful.</p>
<p> Stephen laughed.</p>
<p> Buck Mulligan, changing
<br><font color="green">{ms, 19}</font>
<br> tone, said in mock warning.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Synge is looking for you, he said. To murder you. He
heard you pissed over his halldoor in Glasthule. He&apos;s going to murder you.</p>
<p> <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">He laughed</span></span></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Me? Stephen
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">s</span></span> exclaimed. That
was your contribution to Irish literature.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Mr Lyster! an attendant said from the
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">do</span></span> opened door.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; &hellip;.. in which everyone can find his own. So Mr
Justice Madden in his <u>Diary of Master William Silence</u> finds the hunting terms&nbsp;&hellip;. Yes? What is it?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; There&apos;s a gentleman here, sir, the attendant said,
from the <u>Evening Telegraph</u>. He wants to see the files of the <u>Kilkenny People</u> for last year.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Certainly, certainly, certainly, the quaker librarian
said. Is the gentleman&nbsp;&hellip;...? I&apos;m coming directly.</p>
<p> <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">A</span></span> patient figure
from the daylight without looked darkly in. The librarian hurried on out dutifully.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; This gentleman? <u>Kilkenny People</u> to be sure. We
have the <u>Kilkenny People</u>, <u>Enniscorthy Guardian</u>, <u>Cork
Examiner</u>&nbsp;&hellip;. Good day, sir&nbsp;&hellip; Will you
please&nbsp;&hellip; Evans, conduct this gentleman&nbsp;&hellip; If you just
follow&nbsp;&hellip;. Or allow me I shall show you.</p>
<p> He pushed on out of the lighted span of doorway, volubly dutifully,
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">stumbling,</span></span> the
bowing figure <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">after</span></span> at his stumbling heels.</p>
<p> The door closed.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The sheeny! Buck Mulligan cried, jumping up and snatching
<br><font color="green">{ms, 20}</font>
<br> the<a target="foot" id="fkz0032">&ordm;</a> card. What&apos;s his name?
Ikey Moses? Bloom. I found him over in the museum admiring the Venus. Jehovah,
collector of prepuces, is no more. The sheeny bends low before the fundament of
Uranian Venus. Hellas, lamp of love. <u>Life of life, thy lips enkindle</u>.</p>
<p> He turned suddenly to Stephen, saying:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He knows you. He&apos;s after you. O, I fear me he is
more Greek than the Greeks. <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">I saw
him</span></span> His pale Galilean eyes were upon her back parts. O, they were
(O, the thunder of those loins. <u>The god pursuing, the maiden hid</u>.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; We want to hear more, John Eglinton said. We are
beginning to be interested in Mrs W. Till now we had thought of her, if at all,
as a patient Griselda or as Penelope stayathome.
<br><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">&mdash; While</span></span></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Twenty years he lived in London, Stephen said, and,
during a great part of that time he was drawing a salary equal to that of the
lord chancellor of Ireland. His life was rich. His art is the art of feudalism,
as good Walt accused him. It is the art of surfeit. Spicy herringpies, sack in
green mugs, pigeons stuffed with honeysauces,
<a name="un3021k" href="../../ff/unbs/un3all.htm#un3021k">ringocandies</a>. Sir
Walter Raleigh&apos;s apparel when he was arrested was worth half a million
francs. The virgin queen&apos;s underlinen was as great as that of the queen of
Sheba. While he consorted with Mary Fritton and lady Penelope Rich (I say
nothing of the punks on the Bankside) what do you imagine Poor Penelope
<br><font color="green">{ms, 21}</font>
<br> was<a target="foot" id="fkz0033">&ordm;</a> doing in Stratford?
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Something there must be</span></span></p>
<p> Buck Mulligan rose from the desk abruptly and asked judicially:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Whom do you suspect?</p>
<p> He sat down, talking to himself in audible rhymes.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Say that Shakespeare is the spurned lover in the sonnets.
Once spurned twice spurned. At least one, the court wanton, spurned him for a lord. Dear, my love.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; As an English liberal, you mean, he loved a lord, John Eglinton said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; For one younger and handsome. Nor did she betray a vow.
For these two offenses are as raw in the ghost&apos;s mind as is the carnal act
itself: the broken vow and the dullbrained yokel on whom her favour has
descended. Women who seduce men younger than themselves are, I daresay, hot in
the blood. And once a seducer, twice a seducer.</p>
<p> <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">The burden of proof lies with you not with me.</span></span></p>
<p> Stephen turned sharply in his chair.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The burden of proof is with you and not with me, he said
frowning. If you deny that in the third scene in <u>Hamlet</u> he has branded
her with infamy explain why there is no mention of her
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">for the</span></span> during the
thirtyfour years between the day he married her and the day she buried him. O
yes, one mention there is. In the years when he was living richly in royal London to pay a
<br><font color="green">{ms, 22}</font>
<br> debt<a target="foot" id="fkz0034">&ordm;</a> she had to borrow five
shillings from her father&apos;s shepherd. Explain you then. And explain the
dying message with which he has commended her to posterity.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You mean the will John Eglinton said. That has been
explained, I believe, by jurists.
<a name="un3007b" href="../../ff/unbs/un3all.htm#un3007b">She was entitled at
common law to her widow&apos;s dower</a>.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And therefore he omitted her name from the first draft,
Stephen said mockingly. But he did not omit the presents for his granddaughter,
for his daughters, for his sister, for his old cronies in Stratford and in
London and therefore when he was urged (as I believe) to name her he left her his secondbest bed. </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Countryfolk had little furniture in those times perhaps,
John Eglinton said, as they have still if our dramatists are true to type.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He was a rich country gentleman, Stephen said, with a
coat of arms and a fortune in landed estate.
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">To whom did he leave his best
bed</span></span> Why did he not leave her his best bed if he wished her to
snore away the rest of her life in peace?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It seems clear that there were two beds in the case, Mr Best said finely.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Separatio a mensa et a thalamo</u>, Buck Mulligan said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Perhaps if we could produce the bed,
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">John Eglinton</span></span> said.
Antiquity mentions several famous beds. Let me think.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But do you mean that he died
so<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">?</span></span>, Mr Best asked. I mean
<br><font color="green">{ms, 23}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He<a target="foot" id="fkz0035">&ordm;</a> died dead
drunk, Buck Mulligan said. <u>A quart of ale is a dish for a king.</u> Do you know what Dowden said?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What? John Eglinton and Mr Best asked united.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Lovely! Buck Mulligan said gaily. I asked him what he
thought of the charge of pederasty brought against the bard. He lifted his hands
and said: <u>All we say is that life ran very high in those days</u>. Lovely!</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A poet but an Englishman, Stephen said. He drew Shylock
out of his own long pocket. He was the son of a cornjobber and moneylender. He
was himself a jobber and moneylender. He had corn hoarded during the Stratford
famine. He sued a fellow actor for the price of a few bags of malt and exacted
every penny of interest on the money he had lent.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Prove that he was jew, John Eglinton said.
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">F</span></span> Your dean of
studies proves that
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">a</span></span> he was a good
Roman Catholic. We shall hear next that he was a Warwickshire Celt.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A myriadminded man, Mr Best put in, Coleridge calls him.</p>
<p> (quotation)</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Saint Thomas, Stephen began&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, Buck Mulligan moaned.
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">We are lost now. We
are</span></span> It&apos;s destroyed we are from this day. St Thomas has
come!<a target="foot" id="fkz0036">&ordm;</a> It&apos;s destroyed we are surely!</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Saint Thomas, Stephen went on smiling, writing of incest
from a standpoint different from that of the Viennese school Mr Magee spoke of
likens it to an avarice of the affections. He means that the love so given
<br><font color="green">{ms, 24}</font>
<br> to<a target="foot" id="fkz0037">&ordm;</a> one near in blood is covetously
withheld from some stranger who, it may be, hungers for it. The jews who are
accused by christians of avarice are also the most given to intermarriage.
Accusations are made in anger. The christian laws which built up the hoards of
the jews bound their affections too with hoops of steel. Whether these be sins
of virtues Old Nobodaddy will tell us at the general assizes. But a man who
holds so closely to what he calls his rights over what he calls his
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">goods</span></span> debts will
hold tight also to what he calls his rights over her whom he calls his wife. No
neighbour must covet his wife or his ox or his parlourmaid or his horse or his jackass.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Or his jennyass, Buck Mulligan said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Gentle Will is being roughly handled,
<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font> said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Which will? Mulligan asked sweetly. We are getting mixed.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; If others have their will, Stephen answered, Ann hath a
way. She will remain laid out for all posterity in puritanical stiffness in that
secondbest bed even though you prove that a bed was as rare in those days as a
motorcar is now and that its carvings were the wonder of seven parishes. In her
age she takes up with lollard prechers and hears about her soul. Venus has
turned bigot. It is the agenbite of inwit, the remorse of conscience: it is the
age of exhausted whoredom groping for its god.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That seems to me to be true, John Eglinton said. The ages
<br><font color="green">{ms, 25}</font>
<br> succeed<a target="foot" id="fkz0038">&ordm;</a> one another. But it has
been well said that a man&apos;s worst enemies shall be those of his own house
and family. I feel that A.E. is right. I should say that only family poets have
family lives. The author of
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the</span></span> Falstaff was not
a family man. I feel that the fat knight is his supreme creation.</p>
<p> Lean, rejoyced, he lay back. Shy denier of kindred, the unco guid. He sups
sparely, tasting blasphemies. A father in the planters&apos; Antrim. Visits him
here. Sir, there&apos;s a gentleman outside
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">says he&apos;s your
father</span></span> to see you. Me? Says he&apos;s your father. Enter Magee Mor: Japhet in search of a son.</p>
<p> And mine?</p>
<p> Hurrying to her squalid deathbed from gay Paris on the quayside I touched
his hand. Fine, brown and shrunken. A drunkard&apos;s hand. The voice, new
warmth, speaking new tones remembered. The eyes that wish me well. But do they know me?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A father is a necessary evil, Stephen said battling with
despair. He wrote the play in the months following his father&apos;s death. If
you hold that he <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">is</span></span>,
a greying man with thirty five years of life and fifty of experience, is the
beardless undergraduate then you must hold that his seventyyear old mother is
the lustful queen. The corpse of his father in Stratford does not walk the
night. He rests, disarmed of fatherhood, having devised that mystical estate
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">on</span></span> upon his son.
Boccaccio&apos;s Calandrino was the first and last man who felt himself with
child. Fatherhood, in the sense of conscious begetting, is unknown to man: it is
a mystical estate, an apostolic succession.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 24v}</font>
<br><font color="green">{ms, 25}</font>
<br> When<a target="foot" id="fkz0041">&ordm;</a> he wrote the play he was not
the father of his own children merely, but because no longer a son, he was and
felt himself the father of all his race, the father
<br><font color="green">{ms, 26}</font>
<br> of<a target="foot" id="fkz0042">&ordm;</a> his own grandfather, the father
of his unborn
grandson<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span> who, by
the same token, never was born for, as Mr Magee says, nature abhors perfection.</p>
<p> John Eglinton looked up, his eyes quick with pleasure.</p>
<p> Flatter. Rarely. But flatter.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Every man his own father, Buck Mulligan said. Wait, wait.
I am big with child. I have a child in my brain. A play! A play! Let me parturiate!</p>
<p> He clasped his high brow with aiding hands.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; As for his family,
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">his</span></span> Stephen said,
his mother&apos;s name he gave to the forest of Arden. Her death brought from
him the encounter of Volumnia
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">and</span></span> in
<u>Coriolanus</u>. His son&apos;s is the deathscene of prince Arthur in <u>King
John</u>. His father&apos;s death gave birth to <u>Hamlet</u>. But there is one
member of his family who is otherwise recorded.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Now I feel that we are reaching the climax, John Eglinton said.</p>
<p> The quaker librarian tiptoed in, presenting the same mask flushed with haste.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Shakespeare, Stephen said, had three brothers, Gilbert,
Edmund and Richard. Of the first I can find little except that in his old age he
told courtiers that he had seen brother Will carry a man on his back in a play.
The playhouse sausage said more to him that what he heard or saw. The names of
Edmund and Richard occur in the plays and as the names of two in the trinity of
stage villains &mdash; Richard III, Iago and Edmund in <u>King Lear</u>. And
note that this last play was written
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">while</span></span> about the time
that his brother Edmund was dying in London.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Names, John Eglinton said. What&apos;s in a name?
<br><font color="green">{ms, 27}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Much,<a target="foot" id="fkz0043">&ordm;</a> Stephen
said. Do you not think he knew how to hide his own name in his plays, giving it
only once to poor William in <u>As You Like It</u>? As a writer of the middle
age sometimes puts his own face in an obscure corner of his canvas? And did he
not reveal it in the sonnets where there is Will in overplus? Like John O&apos;
Gaunt his name is dear to him. His coat of arms with the shaken spear which he
intrigued for. It was more to him to have that patent in his name than to be the
greatest shakescene in the country. How often do we write as children the name
that we are told is ours? A star, a daystar rose at his birth. It shone by day
in the heavens over delta in Cassiopeia, the <u>strange</u> constellation which
is the signature of his name among the stars. He must have seen it from the
slumberous fields at night, returning from Shottery and from her arms.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What is
that<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">?</span></span>, Mr Dedalus?
the quaker librarian asked. Was it a celestial phenomenon really?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;
<a name="un3015i" href="../../ff/unbs/un3all.htm#un3015i">A star by night,
Stephen said. The pillar of the cloud by day</a>.</p>
<p> Names. The fabulous artificer, a hawklike man. You flew. What to find?
Paris. What did you find? Stephanos Dedalos. Your crown where is it? Here. Young
men, christian association hat.
Lapwing<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">, you sit
here</span></span>. <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">You sit with</span></span> Name yourself: Lapwing.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, Mr Best said. The brother theme we find also in the
old Irish epics, don&apos;t you know. Just what you say,
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">like</span></span> the three
brothers Shakespeare. It&apos;s always the third brother that marries the sleeping beauty and gets the crown.</p>
<p> <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Three brothers Best</span></span></p>
<p> Best of his brothers: good, better, best.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 28}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But<a target="foot" id="fkz0044">&ordm;</a> I should like
to know, the quaker librarian said, which brother it was. I understand it was
one of the brothers. But perhaps I am anticipating?</p>
<p> He caught himself in the act: looked at all: was silent.</p>
<p> An attendant from the door called him:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Mr Lyster, Father Dineen wants to&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, Father Dineen! Directly.</p>
<p> Swiftly creaking rectly rectly he was rectly gone.

<p> John Eglinton took up the foil.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Let us of Richard and Edmund, he said. Are these their names.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; If
<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font>
you to remember them, Stephen said,
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">it is because</span></span> I am
perhaps asking <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">too</span></span>
much for a brother is as easily forgotten as an umbrella. I ought to have mentioned them before. It is my fault.</p>
<p> Lapwing.</p>
<p> Where is your brother? In the Apothecaries&apos; hall. To him first, to
Davin, Cranly, Lynch, Mulligan: now to these. Cold
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">perfect</span></span> speech. Now
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the</span></span> speech is act.
Act as you speak. They mock and try you. Act.</p>
<p> Lapwing.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, Mr Best said. It is very interesting.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But those names were already in the chronicles from which
he took the plays, John Eglinton said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Why did he take them in preference to others? Stephen
said. Why is Richard Crookback, a halfbrother who makes love to a widowed Ann,
to a loving wife who feigns to repel him and yield why is he introduced into the
pageant of the histories? Why does the subplot of <u>King Lear</u> in
<br><font color="green">{ms, 29}</font>
<br> which<a target="foot" id="fkz0045">&ordm;</a> Edmund appears taken from
Sidney&apos;s <u>Arcadia</u> and grafted on to the Celtic legend of Lir and his
daughters, a legend older than history and, Mr Russell would say, older than humanity.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Gentle Will was wilful, John Eglinton said indulgently.
We should not now combine characters from a Norse saga with an episode from George Moore&apos;s latest novel.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Why? Stephen answered himself. Because the theme of the
false brother is to Shakespeare, what the poor are not, always with him. In glad
days and in sad. It is in <u>Much Ado about Nothing</u>, twice in <u>As You Like
It</u>, in <u>The Tempest</u>, in <u>Hamlet</u>, in <u>Measure for Measure</u>
&mdash; and in the other plays which I have not read.</p>
<p> He laughed to free his mind from its bondage.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The truth is probably midway, John Eglinton said. He is
the ghost and Hamlet too. He is all his characters</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, Stephen said. And so the beardless youth of the
first act becomes a mature man in act five. He acts and is acted on. his
unremitting intellect is the Iago which ceaselessly wills that the moor in him shall suffer.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And what a character is Iago! John Eglinton exclaimed.
After all Dumas (or is Victor Hugo?) is right. After God Shakespeare has created most.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; His world is conjured up about him, Stephen said, to
people his loneliness. He launches world after world on his orbit and in each is
his own image, one banished, Prospero Angelo, one betrayed, the elder
<br><font color="green">{ms, 30}</font>
<br> Hamlet.<a target="foot" id="fkz0046">&ordm;</a> He returns then to that
part of the earth where he was born, where he has always been, an invisible
witness, and, his journeys ended, plants a mulberry tree. Maeterlinck says: If
Socrates go forth today he will find the sage seated on the doorstep. If Judas
go forth tonight it is to Judas his steps will tend. Life is only many days, day
after day. We walk through one after another, encountering
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">what is ourselves</span></span>
robbers, giants, old men, ghosts, young men, wives. The dramatist who wrote this
world and wrote it badly is also, I suppose, in all his characters.
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">If he married young I
expect</span></span> In the heavenly city there is no giving in marriage.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Eureka! Buck Mulligan cried. I have it!</p>
<p> He jumped up and reached John Eglinton&apos;s desk at a stride.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; May I? he said</p>
<p> He began to scribble on a slip of paper</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Those who are married, Mr Best quoted, all but one, shall
live. The rest shall keep as they are.</p>
<p> He laughed unmarried at John Eglinton, bachelor.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You are a delusion, John Eglinton said to Stephen. You
have brought us all this way to show us a French triangle. Do you believe your own theory?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, Stephen said promptly.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Are you going to write it? Mr Best asked. You ought to make it a dialogue, don&apos;t
<br><font color="green">{ms, 31}</font>
<br> you<a target="foot" id="fkz0049">&ordm;</a> know, like the Platonic dialogues, like Wilde wrote.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well in that case, John Eglinton said, smiling doubly, I
don&apos;t see why you should expect payment for what you don&apos;t believe
yourself. You are the only contributor to <u>Dana</u> who asks for pieces of
silver. Then I don&apos;t know about the next number. Fred Ryan wants space and
I have an article from Standish O&apos;Grady.</p>
<p> Standing dish O&apos;Grady. Fred Ryan: two pieces of silver. Economists.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You have my permission to publish an interview, Stephen said, for one guinea.</p>
<p> Buck Mulligan stood up from his laughing scribbling, laughing:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I called upon the bard Kinch, he began, at his residence
in lower Mecklenburgh street and found him deep in the study of the <u>Summa
contra Gentiles</u> in the company of
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">two</span></span> a gonorrheal
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">ladies</span></span> lady, Rosalie, the coalquay whore.</p>
<p> He broke away.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Come, Kinch, he said. Come, wandering Aengus of the birds.</p>
<p> Stephen rose.</p>
<p> Life is many days. This day will end:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; We shall see you tonight, John Eglinton said. <u>Notre ami Moore</u> expects your jests.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Lecturer on French letters to the youth of Ireland, Buck
Mulligan said. I shall bring my trilogy.</p>
<p> Stephen followed the plump jester out of the vaulted cell into the
shattering daylight of no thoughts: and through the turnstile of the constant
readers&apos; room and by the curving sliding marble balustrade.</p>
<p> Buck Mulligan went down the steps in marbled iambs, trolling:
<br><font color="green">{ms, 32}</font> </p>
<p class="set"><a name="un3011a" href="../../ff/unbs/un3all.htm#un3011a">John</a><a target="foot" id="fkz0051">&ordm;</a>
<a name="un3011a" href="../../ff/unbs/un3all.htm#un3011a">Eglinton, my jo, John</a>
<br> Why won&apos;t you come to bed?
<br><font color="green">{ms, 31v}</font> </p>
<p>
<br><font color="green">{ms, 32}</font> </p>
<p> He<a target="foot" id="fkz0054">&ordm;</a> spluttered into the air:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, the chinless Chinaman! We went over to their playbox.
It must be called by a pagan name. Abbey! I smell the pubic secretions of the
monks. You gave them that idea, Kinch. Longworth and M&apos;Curdy Atkinson were there.</p>
<p> He raised his arms, chanting gracefully:</p>
<p class="set"><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">&mdash;</span></span> I hardly hear a purlieu cry
<br> Or a Tommy talk as I pass one by
<br> Before my thoughts begin to run
<br> On F. McCurdy Atkinson
<br> The same that had the wooden leg
<br> And that filibustering filibeg
<br> That never dared to slake his drouth
<br> Magee that had the chinless mouth</p>
<p> His rhymes had brought to the stairfoot.</p>
<p> Among the silent moorish pillars
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">he halted</span></span> Buck Mulligan halted.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Longworth is awfully sick about that Lady Gregory affair.
O, you inquisitional mummer! She gets you a job on the paper and then you go and
slate her book. Couldn&apos;t you do the Yeats touch.</p>
<p> He raised his arms again gracefully, walking on:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The most beautiful book that has come out of Ireland in my time.</p>
<p> He laughed, shaking his head to and fro, crying mirthfully to the soft shadows of the hall:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, the night the druidy damsels had to lift their skirts
to step over you as you lay in your mulberry coloured multicoloured multitudinous vomit.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I was the most innocent son of Erin, Stephen answered, for whom they ever lifted them.</p>
<p> About to pass through the doorway, feeling one behind him, he stood aside.</p>
<p> Part. The moment is coming
<br><font color="green">{ms, 33}</font>
<br> now.<a target="foot" id="fkz0056">&ordm;</a> My
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">soul</span></span> will, his will that fronts me, seas are between.</p>
<p> A man passed out between them, thanking, bowing, greeting.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Good day, again, Buck Mulligan said</p>
<p> Away again then. Here I watched the birds for augury. Aengus of the birds.
Yes, they go and come. I go and come. Or stay and be their helot.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The wandering jew, Buck Mulligan whispered
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">in</span></span> with clown&apos;s
awe. Did you see his eye? He looked upon you to
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">lo</span></span> lust after you. I
fear thee, ancient mariner. Look at him. O, Kinch, you are in danger. Get thee quick a breechpad.</p>
<p> Oxford. Where the gents come from.</p>
<p> A dark back, scanning the heavens, passed out under the gate portcullis.</p>
<p> They followed. Wait. Let him go his ways. Offend me. Offend me still.</p>
<p> Innocent air defined the gables of houses in Kildare street. No birds. Two
frail plumes of smoke ascended, pluming, and were blown. Peace after strife.
Peace of the priests of <u>Cymbeline</u>. Hierophantic: all earth an altar.</p>
<p class="deep">Laud we the gods</p>
<p class="flush">And let our crooked smokes climb</p>
<p class="deep">to their nostrils</p>
<p class="flush">From our blessed altars.
