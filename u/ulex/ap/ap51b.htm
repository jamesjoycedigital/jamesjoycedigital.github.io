<p> O, my dear little brothers in Christ, may it never be our lot to hear that
language! May it never be our lot, I say! In the last day of terrible reckoning
I pray fervently to God that not a single soul of those who are in this chapel
today may be found among those miserable beings whom the Great Judge shall command to depart
<br><font color="green">{ms, 65}</font>
<br> for ever from His sight, that not one of us may ever hear ringing in his
ears the awful sentence of rejection: Depart from me, ye cursed, into
everlasting fire which was prepared for the devils<a target="foot" id="fzz0066">&ordm;</a> and his angels! &mdash;</p>
<p> He came down the aisle of the chapel, his legs shaking and the scalp of his
head trembling as though it had been touched by ghostly fingers. He passed up
the staircase and into the corridor along the walls of which the overcoats and
waterproofs hung like gibbeted malefactors, headless and dripping and shapeless.
And at every step he feared that he had already died, that his soul had been
wrenched forth of the sheath of his body, that
<br><font color="green">{ms, 66}</font>
<br> he was plunging headlong through space.</p>
<p> He could not grip the floor with his feet and sat heavily at his desk,
opening one of his books at random and poring over it. Every word for him. It
was true. God was almighty. God could call him now, call him as he sat at his
desk, before he had time to be conscious of the summons. God had called him.
Yes? What? Yes? His flesh shrank together as it felt the approach of the
ravenous tongues of flames, dried up as it felt about it the swirl of stifling
air. He had died. Yes. He was judged. A wave of fire swept through his body: the
first. Again a wave. His brain began to glow. Another. His brain was simmering and bubbling within the
<br><font color="green">{ms, 67}</font>
<br> cracking tenement of the skull. Flames burst forth from his skull like a corolla, shrieking like voices:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Hell! Hell! Hell! Hell! Hell! &mdash;</p>
<p> Voices spoke near him:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; On hell. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I suppose he rubbed it into you well &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You bet he did. He put us all into a blue funk &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That&apos;s what you fellows want: and plenty of it to make you work &mdash;</p>
<p> He leaned back weakly in his desk. He had not died. God had spared him
still. He was still in the familiar world of the school. Mr Tate and Vincent
Heron stood at the window, talking, jesting, gazing out at the bleak rain, moving their heads.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I wish it would clear up. I had arranged to go for a spin
on the bike with some fellows out by Malahide. But the roads must be knee-deep &mdash;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 68}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It might clear up, sir &mdash;</p>
<p> The voices that he knew so well, the common words, the quiet of the
classroom when the voices paused and the silence was filled by the sound of
softly browsing cattle as the other boys munched their lunches tranquilly, lulled his aching soul.</p>
<p> There was still time. O Mary, refuge of sinners, intercede for him! O Virgin
Undefiled, save him from the gulf of death!</p>
<p> The English lesson began with the hearing of the history. Royal persons,
favourites, intriguers, bishops, passed like mute phantoms behind their veil of
names. All had died: all had been judged. What did it profit a man to gain the whole world if he lost
<br><font color="green">{ms, 69}</font>
<br> his soul? At last he had understood: and human life lay around him, a plain
of peace whereon ant-like men laboured in brotherhood, their dead sleeping under
quiet mounds. The elbow of his companion touched him and his heart was touched:
and when he spoke to answer a question of his master he heard his own voice full
of the quietude of humility and contrition.</p>
<p> His soul sank back deeper into depths of contrite peace, no longer able to
suffer the pain of dread, and sending forth, as he sank, a faint prayer. Ah yes,
he would still be spared; he would repent in his heart and be forgiven; and then those above, those in heaven,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 70}</font>
<br> would see what he would do to make up for the past: a whole life, every hour of life. Only wait.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; All, God! All, all!</p>
<p> A messenger came to the door to say that confessions were being heard in the
chapel. Four boys left the room; and he heard others passing down the corridor.
A tremulous chill blew round his heart, no stronger than a little wind, and yet,
listening and suffering silently, he seemed to have laid an ear against the
muscle of his own heart, feeling it close and quail, listening to the flutter of its ventricles.</p>
<p> No escape. He had to confess, to speak out in words what he had done and thought, sin after sin. How? How?
<br><font color="green">{ms, 71}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Father, I... &mdash;</p>
<p> The thought slid like a cold shining rapier into his tender flesh:
confession. But not there in the chapel of the college. He would confess all,
every sin of deed and thought, sincerely; but not there among his school
companions. Far away from there in some dark place he would murmur out his own
shame: and he besought God humbly not to be offended with him if he did not dare
to confess in the college chapel: and in utter abjection of spirit he craved
forgiveness mutely of the boyish hearts about him.</p>
<p> Time passed.</p>
<p> He sat again in the front bench of the chapel. The daylight without was already
<br><font color="green">{ms, 72}</font>
<br> failing and, as it fell slowly through the dull red blinds, it seemed that
the sun of the last day was going down and that all souls were being gathered for the judgement.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>I am cast away from the sight of thine eyes</u>: words
taken, my dear little brothers in Christ, from the Book of Psalms, thirtieth
chapter, twenty-third verse. In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. Amen &mdash;</p>
<p> The preacher began to speak in a quiet friendly tone. His face was kind and
he joined gently the fingers of each hand, forming a frail cage by the union of their tips.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; This morning we endeavoured, in our reflection upon hell, to make what our
<br><font color="green">{ms, 73}</font>
<br> holy founder calls in his book of spiritual exercises, the composition of
place. We endeavoured, that is, to imagine with the senses of the mind, in our
imagination, the material character of that awful place and of the physical
torments which all who are in hell endure. This evening we shall consider for a
few moments the nature of the spiritual torments of hell.</p>
<p> Sin, remember, is a twofold enormity. It is a base consent to the promptings
of our corrupt nature to the lower instincts, to that which is gross and
beast-like; and it is also a turning away from the counsel of our higher nature,
from all that is pure and holy, from the Holy God Himself. For this reason mortal
<br><font color="green">{ms, 74}</font>
<br> sin is punished in hell by two different forms of punishment, physical and spiritual.</p>
<p> Now of all these spiritual pains by far the greatest is the pain of loss, so
great, in fact, that in itself it is a torment greater than all the others.
Saint Thomas, the greatest doctor of the church, the angelic doctor, as he is
called, says that the worst damnation consists in this, that the understanding
of man is totally deprived of divine light and his affection obstinately turned
away from the goodness of God. God, remember, is a being infinitely good, and
therefore the loss of such a being must be a loss infinitely painful. In this
life we have not a very clear idea of what such a loss must be but the damned
<br><font color="green">{ms, 75}</font>
<br> in hell, for their greater torment, have a full understanding of that which
they have lost, and understand that they have lost it through their own sins and
have lost it for ever. At the very instant of death the bonds of the flesh are
broken asunder and the soul at once flies towards God as towards the centre of
her existence. Remember, my dear little boys, our souls long to be with God. We
come from God, we live by God, we belong to God: we are His, inalienably His.
God loves with a divine love every human soul, and every human soul lives in
that love. How could it be otherwise? Every breath that we draw, every thought of our brain, every
<br><font color="green">{ms, 76}</font>
<br> instant of life proceeds from God&apos;s inexhaustible goodness. And if it
be pain for a mother to be parted from her child, for a man to be exiled from
hearth and home, for friend to be sundered from friend, O think what pain, what
anguish it must be for the poor soul to be spurned from the presence of the
supremely good and loving Creator who has called that soul into existence from
nothingness and sustained it in life and loved it with an immeasurable love.
This, then, to be separated for ever from its greatest good, from God, and to
feel the anguish of that separation, knowing full well that it is unchangeable: this is the greatest torment
<br><font color="green">{ms, 77}</font>
<br> which the created soul is capable of bearing, <u>poena damni</u>, the pain of loss.</p>
<p> The second pain which will afflict the souls of the damned in hell is the
pain of conscience. Just as in dead bodies worms are engendered by putrefaction,
so in the souls of the lost there arises a perpetual remorse from the
putrefaction of sin, the sting of conscience, the worm, as Pope Innocent the
Third calls it, of the triple sting. The first sting inflicted by this cruel
worm will be the memory of past pleasures. O what a dreadful memory will that
be! In the lake of all-devouring flame the proud king will remember the pomps of
his court, the wise but wicked man his libraries and instruments of research, the lover
<br><font color="green">{ms, 78}</font>
<br> of artistic pleasures his marbles and pictures and other art treasures, he
who delighted in the pleasures of the table his gorgeous feasts, his dishes
prepared with such delicacy, his choice wines; the miser will remember his hoard
of gold, the robber his ill-gotten wealth, the angry and revengeful and
merciless murderers their deeds of blood and violence in which they revelled,
the impure and adulterous the unspeakable and filthy pleasures in which they
delighted. They will remember all this and loathe themselves and their sins. For
how miserable will all those pleasures seem to the soul condemned to suffer in hellfire for ages and ages.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 79}</font>
<br> How they will rage and fume to think that they have lost the bliss of
heaven for the dross of earth, for a few pieces of metal, for vain honours, for
bodily comforts, for a tingling of the nerves. They will repent indeed: and this
is the second sting of the worm of conscience, a late and fruitless sorrow for
sins committed. Divine justice insists that the understanding of those miserable
wretches be fixed continually on the sins of which they were guilty, and
moreover, as saint Augustine points out, God will impart to them his own
knowledge of sin, so that sin will appear to them in all its hideous malice as it appears to the eyes of God Himself.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 80}</font>
<br> They will behold their sins in all their foulness and repent but it will be
too late and then they will bewail the good occasions which they neglected. This
is the last and deepest and most cruel sting of the worm of conscience. The
conscience will say: You had time and opportunity to repent and would not. You
were brought up religiously by your parents. You had the sacraments and grace
and indulgences of the church to aid you. You had the minister of God to preach
to you, to call you back when you had strayed, to forgive you your sins, no
matter how many, how abominable, if only you had confessed and repented. No. You
would not. You flouted the ministers of holy religion, you turned your back
<br><font color="green">{ms, 81}</font>
<br> on the confessional, you wallowed deeper and deeper in the mire of sin. God
appealed to you, threatened you, entreated you to return to Him. O, what shame,
what misery! The Ruler of the universe entreated you, a creature of clay, to
love Him Who made you and to keep His law. No. You would not. And now, though
you were to flood all hell with your tears if you could still weep, all that sea
of repentance would not gain for you what a single tear of true repentance shed
during your mortal life would have gained for you. You implore now a moment of
earthly life wherein to repent: In vain. That time is gone: gone for ever.</p>
<p> Such is the
<br><font color="green">{ms, 82}</font>
<br> threefold sting of conscience, the viper which gnaws the very heart&apos;s
core of the wretches in hell, so that filled with hellish fury they curse
themselves for their folly and curse the evil companions who have brought them
to such ruin and curse the devils who tempted them in life and now mock them in
eternity and even revile and curse the Supreme Being whose goodness and patience
they scorned and slighted but Whose justice and power they cannot evade.</p>
<p> The next spiritual pain to which the damned are subjected is the pain of
extension. Man, in this earthly life, though he be capable of many evils, is not
capable of them all at once, inasmuch as one
<br><font color="green">{ms, 83}</font>
<br> evil corrects and counteracts another just as one poison frequently
corrects another. In hell, on the contrary, one torment, instead of
counteracting another, lends it still greater force: and, moreover, as the
internal faculties are more perfect than the external senses, so are they more
capable of suffering. Just as every sense is afflicted with a fitting torment,
so is every spiritual faculty; the fancy with horrible images, the sensitive
faculty with alternate longing and rage, the mind and understanding with an
interior darkness more terrible even than the exterior darkness which reigns in
that dreadful prison. The malice, impotent though it be, which possesses these
demon souls is an evil of boundless extension, of limitless duration,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 84}</font>
<br> a frightful state of wickedness which we can scarcely realise unless we
bear in mind the enormity of sin and the hatred God bears to it.</p>
<p> Opposed to this pain of extension and yet coexistent with it we have the
pain of intensity. Hell is the centre of evils and, as you know, things are more
intense at their centres than at their remotest points. There are no contraries
or admixtures of any kind to temper or soften in the least the pains of hell.
Nay, things which are good in themselves become evil in hell. Company, elsewhere
a source of comfort to the afflicted, will be there a continual torment:
knowledge, so much longed for as the chief good of the intellect, will there
<br><font color="green">{ms, 85}</font>
<br> be hated worse than ignorance: light, so much coveted by all creatures from
the lord of creation down to the humblest plant in the forest, will be loathed
intensely. In this life our sorrows are either not very long or not very great
because nature either overcomes them by habits or puts an end to them by sinking
under their weight. But in hell the torments cannot be overcome by habit, for
while they are of terrible intensity they are at the same time of continual
variety, each pain, so to speak, taking fire from another and re-endowing that
which has enkindled it with a still fiercer flame. Nor can nature escape from
these intense and various tortures by succumbing to
<br><font color="green">{ms, 86}</font>
<br> them for the soul is sustained in hell and maintained in evil so that its
suffering may be the greater. Boundless extension of torment, incredible
intensity of suffering, unceasing variety of torture &mdash; this is what the
divine majesty, so outraged by sinners, demands; this is what the holiness of
heaven, slighted and set aside for the lustful and low pleasures of the corrupt
flesh, requires; this is what the blood of the innocent Lamb of God, shed for
the redemption of sinners, trampled upon by the vilest of the vile, insists upon.</p>
<p> Last and crowning torture of all the tortures of that awful place is the
eternity of hell. Eternity! O, dread and dire word. Eternity!
<br><font color="green">{ms, 87}</font>
<br> What mind of man can understand it? And remember, it is an eternity of
pain. Even though the pains of hell were not so terrible as they are, yet they
would become infinite, as they are destined to last for ever. But while they are
everlasting they are at the same time, as you know, intolerably intense,
unbearably extensive. To bear even the sting of an insect for all eternity would
be a dreadful torment. What must it be, then, to bear the manifold tortures of
hell for ever? For ever! For all eternity! Not for a year or for an age but for
ever. Try to imagine the awful meaning of this. You have often seen the sand on
the seashore. How fine are its tiny grains! And how many of those tiny little grains go to make up the small
<br><font color="green">{ms, 88}</font>
<br> handful which a child grasps in its play. Now imagine a mountain of that
sand, a million miles high, reaching from the earth to the farthest heavens, and
a million miles broad, extending to remotest space, and a million miles in
thickness; and imagine such an enormous mass of countless particles of sand
multiplied as often as there are leaves in the forest, drops of
waters<a target="foot" id="fzz0067">&ordm;</a> in the mighty ocean, feathers on
birds, scales on fish, hairs on animals, atoms in the vast expanse of the air:
and imagine that at the end of every million years a little bird came to that mountain and carried away in its
<br><font color="green">{ms, 89}</font>
<br> beak a tiny grain of that sand. How many millions upon millions of
centuries would pass before that bird had carried away even a square foot of
that mountain, how many eons upon eons of ages before it had carried away all?
Yet at the end of that immense stretch of time not even one instant of eternity
could be said to have ended. At the end of all those billions and trillions of
years eternity would have scarcely begun. And if that mountain rose again after
it had been all carried away, and if the bird came again and carried it all away
again grain by grain, and if it so rose and sank as many times as there
<br><font color="green">{ms, 90}</font>
<br> are stars in the sky, atoms in the air, drops of water in the sea, leaves
on the trees, feathers upon birds, scales upon fish, hairs upon animals, at the
end of all those innumerable risings and sinkings of that immeasurably vast
mountain not one single instant of eternity could be said to have
ended<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span>:<a target="foot" id="fzz0068">&ordm;</a>
even then, at the end of such a period, after that eon of time the mere thought
of which makes our very brain reel dizzily, eternity would scarcely have begun.</p>
<p> A holy saint (one of our own fathers I believe it was) was once vouchsafed a vision of hell. It seemed to him that
<br><font color="green">{ms, 91}</font>
<br> he stood in the midst of a great hall, dark and silent save for the ticking
of a great clock. The ticking went on unceasingly; and it seemed to this saint
that the sound of the ticking was the ceaseless repetition of the words: ever,
never; ever, never. Ever to be in hell, never to be in heaven; ever to be shut
off from the presence of God, never to enjoy the beatific vision; ever to be
eaten with flames, gnawed by vermin, goaded with burning spikes, never to be
free from those pains; ever to have the conscience upbraid one, the memory
enrage, the mind filled with darkness and despair, never to escape; ever to curse and revile the foul demons who
<br><font color="green">{ms, 92}</font>
<br> gloat fiendishly over the misery of their dupes, never to behold the
shining raiment of the blessed spirits; ever to cry out of the abyss of fire to
God for an instant, a single instant, of respite from such awful agony, never to
receive, even for an instant, God&apos;s pardon; ever to suffer, never to enjoy;
ever to be damned, never to be saved; ever, never; ever, never. O, what a
dreadful punishment! An eternity of endless agony, of endless bodily and
spiritual torment, without one ray of hope, without one moment of cessation, of
agony limitless in intensity, of torment infinitely varied, of torture that sustains
<br><font color="green">{ms, 93}</font>
<br> eternally that which it eternally devours, of anguish that everlastingly
preys upon the spirit while it racks the flesh, an eternity, every instant of
which is itself an eternity of woe. Such is the terrible punishment decreed for
those who die in mortal sin by an almighty and a just God.</p>
<p> Yes, a just God! Men, reasoning always as men, are astonished that God
should mete out an everlasting and infinite punishment in the fires of hell for
a single grievous sin. They reason thus because, blinded by the gross illusion
of the flesh and the darkness of human understanding, they are unable to comprehend the
<br><font color="green">{ms, 94}</font>
<br> hideous malice of mortal sin. They reason thus because they are unable to
comprehend that even venial sin is of such a foul and hideous nature that even
if the omnipotent Creator could end all the evil and misery in the world, the
wars, the diseases, the robberies, the crimes, the deaths, the murders, on
condition that he allowed a single venial sin to pass unpunished, a single
venial sin, a lie, an angry look, a moment of wilful sloth, He, the great
omnipotent God could not do so because sin, be it in thought or deed, is a
transgression of His law and God would not be God if He did not punish the transgressor.</p>
<p> A sin, an instant of rebellious pride of the intellect, made
<br><font color="green">{ms, 95}</font>
<br> Lucifer and a third part of the cohort of angels fall from their glory. A
sin, an instant of folly and weakness, drove Adam and Eve out of Eden and
brought death and suffering into the world. To retrieve the consequences of that
sin the Only Begotten Son of God came down to earth, lived and suffered and died
a most painful death, hanging for three hours on the cross.</p>
<p> O, my dear little brethren in Christ Jesus, will we then offend that good
Redeemer and provoke His anger? Will we trample again upon that torn and mangled
corpse? Will we spit upon that face so full of sorrow and love? Will we too,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 96}</font>
<br> like the cruel jews and the brutal soldiers, mock that gentle and
compassionate Saviour who trod alone for our
sakes<a target="foot" id="fzz0069">&ordm;</a> the awful wine-press of sorrow?
Every word of sin is a wound in His tender side. Every sinful act is a thorn
piercing His head. Every impure thought, deliberately yielded to, is a keen
lance transfixing that sacred and loving heart. No, no. It is impossible for any
human being to do that which offends so deeply the divine majesty, that which is
punished by an eternity of agony, that which crucifies again the Son of God and makes a mockery of Him.</p>
<p> I pray to God that my poor words
<br><font color="green">{ms, 97}</font>
<br> may have availed today to confirm in holiness those who are in a state of
grace, to strengthen the wavering, to lead back to the state of grace the poor
soul that has strayed if any such be among you. I pray to God, and do you pray
with me, that we may repent of our sins. I will ask you now, all of you, to
repeat after me the act of contrition, kneeling here in this humble chapel in
the presence of God. He is there in the tabernacle burning with love for
mankind, ready to comfort the afflicted. Be not afraid. No matter how many or
how foul the sins if you only repent of them they will be forgiven you. Let no worldly shame hold you back. God is
<br><font color="green">{ms, 98}</font>
<br> still the merciful Lord who wishes not the eternal death of the sinner but
rather that he be converted and live.</p>
<p> He calls you to Him. You are His. He made you out of nothing. He loved you
as only a God can love. His arms are open to receive you even though you have
sinned against Him. Come to Him, poor sinner, poor vain and erring sinner. Now
is the acceptable time. Now is the hour &mdash;</p>
<p> The priest rose and, turning towards the altar, knelt upon the step before
the tabernacle in the fallen gloom. He waited till all in the chapel had knelt
and every least noise was still. Then, raising his
<br><font color="green">{ms, 99}</font>
<br> head, he repeated the act of contrition, phrase by phrase, with fervour.
The boys answered him phrase by phrase. Stephen, his tongue cleaving to his
palate, bowed his head, praying with his heart.</p>

<p> He went up to his room after dinner in order to be alone with his soul, and
at every step his soul seemed to sigh; at every step his soul mounted with his
feet, sighing in the ascent, through a region of viscid gloom.</p>
<p> He halted on the landing before the door and then, grasping the
<br><font color="green">{ms, 101}</font>
<br> porcelain knob, opened the door quickly. He waited in fear, his soul pining
within him, praying silently that death might not touch his brow as he passed
over the threshold, that the fiends that inhabit darkness might not be given
power over him. He waited still at the threshold as at the entrance to some dark
cave. Faces were there; eyes: they waited and watched.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; We knew perfectly well of course that
although<a target="foot" id="fzz0070">&ordm;</a> it was bound to come to the
light he would find considerable difficulty in endeavouring to try to induce
himself to try to endeavour to ascertain the spiritual plenipotentiary and so we
knew of course perfectly well &mdash;</p>
<p> Murmuring faces waited and watched; murmurous voices filled the dark shell
<br><font color="green">{ms, 102}</font>
<br> of the cave. He feared intensely in spirit and in flesh but, raising his
head bravely, he strode into the room firmly. A doorway, a room, the same room,
same window<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">:</span></span>. He
told himself calmly that those words had absolutely no sense which had seemed to
rise murmurously from the dark. He told himself that it was simply his room with the door open.</p>
<p> He closed the door and, walking swiftly to the bed, knelt beside it and
covered his face with his hands. His hands were cold and damp and his limbs
ached with chill. Bodily unrest and chill and weariness beset him, routing his
thoughts. Why was he kneeling there like a child saying his evening prayers? To be alone with his
<br><font color="green">{ms, 103}</font>
<br> soul, to examine his conscience, to meet his sins face to face, to recall
their times and manners and circumstances, to weep over them. He could not weep.
He could not summon them to his memory. He felt only an ache of soul and body,
his whole being, memory, will, understanding, flesh, benumbed and weary.</p>
<p> That was the work of devils, to scatter his thoughts and over-cloud his
conscience, assailing him at the gates of the cowardly and sin-corrupted flesh:
and, praying God timidly to forgive him his weakness, he crawled up on to the
bed and, wrapping the blankets closely about him, covered his face again with
his hands. He had sinned. He had sinned so deeply against heaven and before God
that he was not worthy to be called God&apos;s child.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 104}</font> </p>
<p> Could it be that he, Stephen Dedalus, had done those things? His conscience
sighed in answer. Yes, he had done them, secretly, filthily, time after
time,<a target="foot" id="fzz0071">&ordm;</a> and, hardened in sinful
impenitence, he had dared to wear the mask of holiness before the tabernacle
itself while his soul within was a living mass of corruption. How came it that
God had not struck him dead? The leprous company of his sins closed about him,
breathing upon him, bending over him from all sides. He strove to forget them in
an act of prayer, huddling his limbs closer together and binding down his
eyelids: but the senses of the<a target="foot" id="fzz0072">&ordm;</a> soul
would not be bound and, though his eyes were shut fast, he saw the places where
he had sinned and, though his eyes<a target="foot" id="fzz0073">&ordm;</a> were
<br><font color="green">{ms, 105}</font>
<br> tightly covered, he heard. He desired with all his will not to hear
nor<a target="foot" id="fzz0074">&ordm;</a> see. He desired till his frame shook
under the strain of his desire and until the senses of his soul closed. They
closed for an instant and then opened. He saw.</p>
<p> A field of stiff weeds and thistles and tufted nettle-bunches. Thick among
the tufts of rank stiff growth lay battered canisters and clots and coils of
solid excrement. A faint marsh-light struggled upwards from all the ordure
through the bristling grey-green weeds. An evil smell, faint and foul as the
light, curled upwards sluggishly out of the canisters and from the stale crusted dung.</p>
<p> Creatures were in the field: one, three, six: creatures were moving in the
field, hither and thither. Goatish creatures with
<br><font color="green">{ms, 106}</font>
<br> human faces, hornybrowed, lightly bearded and grey as india-rubber. The
malice of evil glittered in their hard eyes, as they moved hither and thither,
trailing their long tails behind them. A rictus of cruel malignity lit up greyly
their old bony faces. One was clasping about his ribs a torn flannel waistcoat,
another complained monotonously as his beard stuck in the tufted weeds. Soft
language issued from their spittleless lips as they swished in slow circles
round and round the field, winding hither and thither through the weeds,
dragging their long tails amid the rattling canisters. They moved in slow
circles, circling closer and closer to enclose, to enclose, soft language issuing
<br><font color="green">{ms, 107}</font>
<br> from their lips, their long swishing tails besmeared with stale shite,
thrusting upwards their terrific faces.....</p>
<p> Help!</p>
<p> He flung the blankets from him madly to free his face and neck. That was his
hell. God had allowed him to see the hell reserved for his sins: stinking,
bestial, malignant, a hell of lecherous goatish fiends. For him! For him!</p>
<p> He sprang from the bed, the reeking odour pouring down his throat, clogging
and revolting his entrails. Air! The air of heaven! He stumbled towards the
window, groaning and almost fainting with sickness. At the washstand a
convulsion seized him within; and, clasping his cold forehead wildly, he vomited profusely in agony.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 108}</font> </p>
<p> When the fit had spent itself he walked weakly to the window and, lifting
the sash, sat in a corner of the embrasure and leaned his elbow upon the sill.
The rain had drawn off; and amid the moving vapours from point to point of light
the city was spinning about herself a soft cocoon of yellowish haze. Heaven was
still and faintly luminous and the air sweet to breathe, as in a thicket
drenched with showers; and amid peace and shimmering lights and quiet fragrance he made a covenant with his heart.</p>
<p> He prayed:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>He once had meant to come on earth in heavenly glory
but we sinned: and then He could not safely visit us but with a shrouded majesty
and a bedimmed radiance for He was God. So He came Himself in weakness not in power
<br><font color="green">{ms, 109}</font>
<br> and He sent thee, a creature in His stead, with a creature&apos;s
comeliness and lustre suited to our state. And now thy very face and form, dear
mother, speak to us of the Eternal; not like earthly beauty, dangerous to look
upon, but like the morning star which is thy emblem, bright and musical,
breathing purity, telling of heaven and infusing peace. O harbringer of day! O
light of the pilgrim! Lead us still as thou hast led. In the dark night, across
the bleak wilderness guide us on to our Lord Jesus, guide us home.</u> &mdash;</p>
<p> His eyes were dimmed with tears and, looking humbly up to heaven, he wept for the innocence he had lost.</p>
<p> When evening had fallen he left the house, and the first touch of the damp dark air
<br><font color="green">{ms, 110}</font>
<br> and the noise of the door as it closed behind him made ache again his
conscience, lulled by prayer and tears. Confess! Confess! It was not enough to
lull the conscience with a tear and a prayer. He had to kneel before the
minister of the Holy Ghost and tell over his hidden sins truly and repentantly.
Before he heard again the footboard of the housedoor trail over the threshold as
it opened to let him in, before he saw again the table in the kitchen set for
supper he would have knelt and confessed. It was quite simple.</p>
<p> The ache of conscience ceased and he walked onward swiftly through the dark
streets. There were so many flagstones on the footpath of that street and so many streets in that city and so many
<br><font color="green">{ms, 111}</font>
<br> cities in the world. Yet eternity had no end. He was in mortal sin. Even
once was a mortal sin. It could happen in an instant. But how so quickly? By
seeing or by thinking of seeing. The eyes see the thing, without having wished
first to see. Then in an instant it happens. But does that part of the body
understand or what? The serpent, the most subtle beast of the field. It must
understand when it desires in one instant and then prolongs its own desire
instant after instant, sinfully. It feels and understands and desires. What a
horrible thing! Who made it to be like that, a bestial part of the body able to
understand bestially and desire bestially? Was that then he
<br><font color="green">{ms, 112}</font>
<br> or an inhuman thing moved by a lower soul? His soul sickened at the thought
of a torpid snaky life feeding itself out of the tender marrow of his life and
fattening upon the slime of lust. O why was that so? O why?</p>
<p> He cowered in the shadow of the thought, abasing himself in the awe of God
Who had made all things and all men. Madness. Who could think such a thought?
And, cowering in darkness and abject, he prayed mutely to his guardian angel to
drive away with his sword the demon that was whispering to his brain.</p>
<p> The whisper ceased and he knew then clearly that his own soul had sinned in
thought and word and deed wilfully through his own body. Confess! He had to confess every
<br><font color="green">{ms, 113}</font>
<br> sin. How could he utter in words to the priest what he had done? Must,
must. Or how could he explain without dying of shame? Or how could he have done
such things without shame? A madman! Confess! O he would indeed to be free and
sinless again! Perhaps the priest would know. O dear God!</p>
<p> He walked on and on through ill-lit streets, fearing to stand still for a
moment lest it might seem that he held back from what awaited him, fearing to
arrive at that towards which he still turned with longing. How beautiful must be
a soul in the state of grace when God looked upon it with love!</p>
<p> Frowsy girls sat along the curbstones before their baskets of herrings. Their dank
<br><font color="green">{ms, 114}</font>
<br> hair hung trailed over their brows. They were not beautiful to see as they
crouched in the mire. But their souls were seen by God; and if their souls were
in a state of grace they were radiant to see: and God loved them, seeing them.</p>
<p> A wasting breath of humiliation blew bleakly over his soul to think of how
he had fallen, to feel that those souls were dearer to God than his. The wind
blew over him and passed on to the myriads and myriads of other souls on whom
God&apos;s favour shone now more and now less, stars now brighter and now dimmer
sustained and failing. And the glimmering souls passed away, sustained and
failing, merged in a moving breath. One soul was lost; a tiny soul:
<br><font color="green">{ms, 115}</font>
<br> his. It flickered once and went out, forgotten, lost. The end: black, cold, void waste.</p>
<p> Consciousness of place came ebbing back to him slowly over a vast tract of
time unlit, unfelt, unlived. The squalid scene composed itself around him; the
common accents, the burning gas-jets in the shops, odours of fish and spirits
and wet sawdust, moving men and women. An old woman was about to cross the
street, an oilcan in her hand. He bent down and asked her was there a chapel near.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A chapel, sir? Yes, sir. Church Street chapel &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Church? &mdash;</p>
<p> She shifted the can to her other hand and directed him; and, as she held out
her reeking withered right hand under its fringe of shawl, he bent lower towards
<br><font color="green">{ms, 116}</font>
<br> her, saddened and soothed by her voice.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Thank you &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You are quite welcome, sir &mdash;</p>
<p> The candles on the high altar had been extinguished but the fragrance of
incense still floated down the dim nave. Bearded workmen with pious faces were
guiding a canopy out through a side door, the sacristan aiding them with quiet
gestures and words. A few of the faithful still lingered praying before one of
the side-altars or kneeling in the benches near the confessionals. He approached
timidly and knelt at the last bench in the body, thankful for the peace and
silence and fragrant shadow of the church. The board on which he knelt was
narrow and worn and those who knelt near him were humble followers
<br><font color="green">{ms, 117}</font>
<br> of Jesus. Jesus too had been born in poverty and had worked in the shop of
a carpenter, cutting boards and planing them, and had first spoken of the
kingdom of God to poor fishermen, teaching all men to be meek and humble of heart.</p>
<p> He bowed his head upon his hands, bidding his heart be meek and humble that
he might be like those who knelt beside him and his prayer as acceptable as
theirs. He prayed beside them but it was hard. His soul was foul with sin and he
dared not ask forgiveness with the simple trust of those whom Jesus, in the
mysterious ways of God, had called first to His side, the carpenters, the
fishermen, poor and simple people following a lowly
<br><font color="green">{ms, 118}</font>
<br> trade, handling and shaping the wood of trees, mending their nets with patience.</p>
<p> A tall figure came down the aisle and the penitents stirred; and at the last
moment, glancing up swiftly, he saw a long grey beard and the brown habit of a
capuchin. The priest entered the box and was hidden. Two penitents rose and
entered the confessional at either side. The wooden slide was drawn back and the
faint murmur of a voice troubled the silence.</p>
<p> His blood began to murmur in his veins, murmuring like a sinful city
summoned from its sleep to hear its doom. Little flakes of fire fell and powdery
ashes fell softly, alighting on the houses of men. They stirred, waking from sleep, troubled
<br><font color="green">{ms, 119}</font>
<br> by the heated air.</p>
<p> The slide was shot back. The penitent emerged from the side of the box. The
farther side was drawn. A woman entered quietly and deftly where the first
penitent had knelt. The faint murmur began again.</p>
<p> He could still leave the chapel. He could stand up, put one foot before the
other and walk out softly and then run, run, run swiftly through the dark
streets. He could still escape from the shame. O what shame! Had it been any
terrible crime but that one sin! Had it been murder! Little fiery flakes fell
and touched him at all points, shameful thoughts, shameful words, shameful acts.
Shame covered him wholly like fine glowing ashes falling continually.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 120}</font>
<br> To say it in words! His soul, stifling and helpless, would cease to be.</p>
<p> The slide was shot back. A penitent emerged from the farther side of the
box. The near slide was drawn. A penitent entered where the other penitent had
come out. A soft whispering noise floated in vaporous cloudlets out of the box.
It was the woman: soft whispering cloudlets, soft whispering vapour, whispering and vanishing.</p>
<p> He beat his breast with his fist humbly, secretly under cover of the wooden
armrest. He would be at one with others and with God. He would love his
neighbour. He would love God who had made and loved him. He would kneel and pray
with others and be happy. God would look down on him and on them and would love them all.</p>
<p> It was easy to be good. God&apos;s yoke was sweet and light.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 121}</font>
<br> It was better never to have sinned, to have remained always a child, for
God loved little children and suffered them to come to Him. It was a terrible
and a sad thing to sin. But God was merciful to poor sinners who were truly
sorry. How true that was! That was indeed goodness.</p>
<p> The slide was shot to suddenly. The penitent came out. He was next. He stood
up in terror and walked blindly into the box.</p>
<p> At last it had come. He knelt in the silent gloom and raised his eyes to the
white crucifix suspended above him. God could see that he was sorry. He would
tell all his sins. His confession would be long, long. Everybody in the chapel
would know then what a sinner he had been. Let them know. It was true. But God
had promised to forgive him if he was sorry. He was sorry. He clasped
<br><font color="green">{ms, 122}</font>
<br> his hands and raised them towards the white form, praying with his darkened
eyes, praying with all his trembling body, swaying his head to and fro like a
lost creature, praying with whimpering lips.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Sorry! Sorry! O sorry! &mdash;</p>
<p> The slide clicked back and his heart bounded in his breast. The face of an
old priest was at the grating, averted from him, leaning upon a hand. He made
the sign of the cross and prayed of the priest to bless him for he had sinned.
Then, bowing his head, he repeated the <u>Confiteor</u> in fright. At the words
<u>my most grievous fault</u> he ceased, breathless.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; How long is it since your last confession, my child? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A long time, father &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A month, my child? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Longer, father &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Three months, my child? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Longer, father &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Six months? &mdash;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 123}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Eight months, father &mdash;</p>
<p> He had begun. The priest asked:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And what do you remember since that time? &mdash;</p>
<p> He began to confess his sins: masses missed, prayers not said, lies.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Anything else, my child? &mdash;</p>
<p> Sins of anger, envy of others, gluttony, vanity, disobedience.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Anything else, my child? &mdash;</p>
<p> Sloth.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Anything else, my child? &mdash;</p>
<p> There was no help. He murmured:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I.... committed sins of impurity, father &mdash;</p>
<p> The priest did not turn his head.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; With yourself, my child? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And... with others. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; With women, my child? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, father &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Were they married women, my child? &mdash;</p>
