<p class="center">II</p>
<p class="flush">Uncle Charles smoked such black twist that at last his
outspoken nephew suggested to him to enjoy his morning smoke in a little outhouse at the end of the garden.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Very good, Simon. All serene, Simon &mdash; said the old
man tranquilly. &mdash;<a target="foot" id="fzz0016">&ordm;</a> Anywhere you
like. The outhouse will do me nicely: it will be more salubrious &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Damn me &mdash; said Mr Dedalus frankly &mdash; if I know
how you can smoke such villainous awful tobacco. It&apos;s like gunpowder, by God &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It&apos;s very nice, Simon &mdash; replied the old man
&mdash; Very cool and mollifying &mdash;</p>
<p> Every morning, therefore, uncle Charles repaired to his outhouse but not
before he had greased and brushed scrupulously his back hair and brushed and put
on his tall hat. While he smoked the brim of his tall hat and the bowl of his
pipe were just visible beyond the jambs of the outhouse door. His arbour, as he called the reeking outhouse
<br><font color="green">{ms, 2}</font>
<br> which he shared with the cat and the garden tools, served him also as a
sounding-box: and every morning he hummed contentedly one of his favourite
songs: O, twine me a bower or Blue eyes and goldern hair or The Groves of
Blarney<a target="foot" id="fzz0017">&ordm;</a> while the grey and blue coils of
smoke rose slowly from his pipe and vanished in the pure air.</p>
<p> During the first part of the summer in Blackrock uncle Charles was
Stephen&apos;s constant companion. Uncle Charles was a hale old man with a well
tanned skin, rugged features and white side whiskers. On week days he did
messages between the house in Carysfort Avenue and those shops in the main
street of the town with which the family dealt. Stephen was glad to go with him
on these errands for uncle Charles helped him very liberally to handfuls of
whatever was exposed in open boxes and barrels outside the counter. He would
seize a handful of grapes and sawdust or three or four American apples and
thrust them generously into his grandnephew&apos;s hand while the shopman smiled
<br><font color="green">{ms, 3}</font>
<br> uneasily; and, on Stephen&apos;s feigning reluctance to take them, he would frown and say:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Take them, sir. Do you hear me, sir? They&apos;re good for your bowels &mdash;</p>
<p> When the order list had been booked the two would go on to the park where an
old friend of Stephen&apos;s father, Mike Flynn, would be found seated on a
bench, waiting for them. Then would begin Stephen&apos;s run round the park.
Mike Flynn would stand at the gate near the railway station, watch in hand,
while Stephen ran round the track in the style Mike Flynn favoured, his head
high lifted, his knees well lifted and his hands held straight down by his
sides. When the morning practice was over the trainer would make his comments
and sometimes illustrate them by shuffling along for a yard or so comically in
old<a target="foot" id="fzz0018">&ordm;</a> pair of blue canvas shoes. A small
ring of wonderstruck children and nursemaids would gather to watch him and
linger even when he and uncle Charles had sat down again and were talking athletics and
<br><font color="green">{ms, 4}</font>
<br> politics. Though he had heard his father say that Mike Flynn had put some
of the best runners of modern times through his hands Stephen often glanced at
his trainer&apos;s flabby stubble-covered face, as it bent over the long stained
fingers through which he rolled his cigarette, and with pity at the mild
lustreless blue eyes which would look up suddenly from the task and gaze vaguely
into the bluer distance while the long swollen fingers ceased their rolling and
grains and fibres of tobacco fell back into the pouch.</p>
<p> On the way home uncle Charles would often pay a visit to the chapel and, as
the font was above Stephen&apos;s reach, the old man would dip his hand and then
sprinkle the water briskly about Stephen&apos;s clothes and on the floor of the
porch. While he prayed he knelt on his red handkerchief and read above his
breath from a thumb blackened prayer book wherein catchwords were printed at the
foot of every page. Stephen knelt at his side respecting, though he did not share, his piety. He often wondered what his
<br><font color="green">{ms, 5}</font>
<br> grand-uncle prayed for so seriously. Perhaps he prayed for the souls in
purgatory or for the grace of a happy death or perhaps he prayed that God might
send him back a part of the big fortune he had squandered in Cork.</p>
<p> On Sundays Stephen with his father and his grand-uncle took their
constitutional. The old man was a nimble walker in spite of his corns and often
ten or twelve miles of the road were covered. The little village of Stillorgan
was the parting of the ways. Either they went to the left towards the Dublin
mountains or along the Goatstown road and thence into Dundrum, coming home by
Sandyford. Trudging along the road or standing in some grimy wayside public
house his elders spoke constantly of the subjects nearer their hearts, of Irish
politics, of Munster and of the legends of their own family, to all of which
Stephen lent an avid ear. Words which he did not understand he said over and
over to himself till he had learnt them by heart: and through them he had
glimpses of the real world about them. The hour when he too would take his part in the life of that
<br><font color="green">{ms, 6}</font>
<br> world seemed drawing near and in secret he began to make ready for the
great part which he felt awaited him the nature of which he only dimly apprehended.</p>
<p> His evenings were his own; and he pored over a ragged translation of The
Count of Monte Cristo. The figure of that dark avenger stood forth in his mind
for whatever he had heard or divined in childhood of the strange and terrible.
At night he built up on the parlour table an image of the wonderful island cave
out of transfers and paper flowers and coloured tissue paper and strips of the
silver and golden paper in which chocolate is wrapped. When he had broken up
this scenery, weary of its tinsel, there would come to his mind the bright
picture of Marseille, of sunny trellises, and of Mercedes. Outside Blackrock, on
the road that led to the mountains, stood a small whitewashed house in the
garden of which grew many rosebushes: and in this house, he told himself,
another Mercedes lived. Both on the outward and on the homeward journey he
measured distance by this landmark: and in his imagination he lived through a long train of
<br><font color="green">{ms, 7}</font>
<br> adventures, marvellous as those in the book itself, towards the close of
which there appeared an image of himself, grown older and sadder, standing in a
moonlit garden with Mercedes who had so many years before slighted his love, and
with a sadly proud gesture of refusal, saying:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Madam, I never eat muscatel grapes &mdash;</p>
<p> He became the ally of a boy named Aubrey Mills and founded with him a gang
of adventurers in the avenue. Aubrey carried a whistle dangling from his
buttonhole and a bicycle lamp attached to his belt while the others had short
sticks thrust daggerwise through theirs. Stephen, who had read of
Napoleon&apos;s plain style of dress, chose to remain unadorned and thereby
heightened for himself the pleasure of taking counsel with his lieutenant before
giving orders. The gang made forays into the gardens of old maids or went down
to the castle and fought a battle on the shaggy weed-grown rocks, coming home
after it weary stragglers with the stale odours of the foreshore in their
nostrils and the rank oils of the seawrack upon
<br><font color="green">{ms, 8}</font>
<br> their hands and in their hair.</p>
<p> Aubrey and Stephen had a common milkman and often they drove out in the
milk-car to Carrickmines where the cows were at grass. While the men were
milking the boys would take turns in riding the tractable
horse<a target="foot" id="fzz0019">&ordm;</a> round the field. But when autumn
came the cows were driven home from the grass: and the first sight of the filthy
cowyard at Stradbrook with its foul green puddles and clots of liquid dung and
steaming bran troughs, sickened Stephen&apos;s heart. The cattle which had
seemed so beautiful in the country on sunny days revolted him and he could not even look at the milk they yielded.</p>
<p> The coming of September did not trouble him this year for he knew he was not
to be sent back to Clongowes. The practice in the park came to an end when Mike
Flynn went into hospital. Aubrey was at school and had only an hour or two free
in the evening. The gang fell asunder and there were no more nightly forays or
battles on the rocks. Stephen sometimes went round with the car which delivered the evening milk and these chilly drives
<br><font color="green">{ms, 9}</font>
<br> blew away his memory of the filth of the cowyard and he felt no repugnance
at seeing the cow hairs and hayseeds on the milkman&apos;s coat. Whenever the
car drew up before a house he waited to catch a glimpse of a well scrubbed
kitchen or of a softly lighted hall and to see how the servant would hold the
jug and how she would close the door. He thought it should be a pleasant life
enough, driving along the roads every evening to deliver milk, if he had warm
gloves and a fat bag of gingernuts in his pocket to eat from. But the same
foreknowledge which had sickened his heart and made his limbs sag suddenly as he
raced round the park, the same intuition which had made him glance with mistrust
at his trainer&apos;s flabby stubble-covered face as it bent heavily over his
long stained fingers, dissipated any vision of the future. In a vague way he
understood that his father was in trouble and that this was the reason why he
himself had not been sent back to Clongowes. For some time he had felt the
slight change in his house; and those changes in what he had deemed unchangeable were so many slight shocks to his
<br><font color="green">{ms, 10}</font>
<br> boyish conception of the world. The ambition which he felt astir at times
in the darkness of his soul sought no outlet. A dusk like that of the outer
world obscured his mind as he heard the mare&apos;s hoofs clattering along the
tramtrack on the Rock Road and the great can swaying and rattling behind him.</p>
<p> He returned to Mercedes and, as he brooded upon her image, a strange unrest
crept into his blood. Sometimes a fever gathered within him and led him to rove
alone in the evening along the quiet avenue. The peace of the gardens and the
kindly lights in the windows poured a tender influence into his restless heart.
The noise of children at play annoyed him and their silly voices made him feel,
even more keenly than he had felt at Clongowes
tha<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">n</span></span>t he was
different from others. He did not want to play. He wanted to meet in the real
world the unsubstantial image which his soul so constantly beheld. He did not
know where to seek it or how, but a premonition which led him on told him that this image would, without
<br><font color="green">{ms, 11}</font>
<br> any overt act of his, encounter him. They would meet quietly as if they had
known each other and had made their tryst, perhaps at one of the gates or in
some more secret place. They would be alone, surrounded by darkness and silence:
and in that <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">in</span></span>
moment of supreme tenderness he would be transfigured. He would fade into
something
impal<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">b</span></span>pable under
her eyes and then, in a moment, he would be transfigured. Weakness and timidity
and inexperience would fall from him in that magic moment.</p>
<p class="center">&starf; &starf; &starf;</p>
<p> Two great yellow caravans had halted one morning before the door and men had
come tramping into the house to dismantle it. The furniture had been hustled out through the front garden which was
<br><font color="green">{ms, 12}</font>
<br> strewn with wisps of straw and rope ends and into the huge vans at the
gate. When all had been safely stowed the vans had set off noisily down the
avenue: and from the window of the railway carriage, in which he had sat with
his red-eyed mother, Stephen had seen them lumbering along the Merrion Road.</p>
<p> The parlour fire would not draw that evening and Mr Dedalus rested the poker
against the bars of the grate to attract the flame. Uncle Charles dozed in a
corner of the half furnished uncarpeted room and near him the family portraits
leaned against the wall. The lamp on the table shed a weak light over the
boarded floor, muddied by the feet of the van-men. Stephen sat on a footstool
beside his father listening to a long and incoherent monologue. He understood
little or nothing of it at first but he became slowly aware that his father had
enemies and that some fight was going to take place. He felt, too, that he was
being enlisted for the fight, that some duty was being laid upon his shoulders. The sudden flight
<br><font color="green">{ms, 13}</font>
<br> from the comfort and revery of Blackrock, the passage through the gloomy
foggy city, the thought of the bare cheerless house in which they were now to
live made his heart heavy, and again an intuition, a foreknowledge of the future
came to him. He understood also why the servants had often whispered together in
the hall and why his father had often stood on the hearthrug with his back to
the fire, talking loudly to uncle Charles who urged him to sit down and eat his dinner.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; There&apos;s a crack of the whip left in me yet, Stephen,
old chap &mdash; said Mr Dedalus, poking at the dull fire with fierce energy
&mdash; We&apos;re not dead yet, sonny. No, by the Lord Jesus (God forgive me) not half dead &mdash;</p>
<p> Dublin was a new and complex sensation. Uncle Charles had grown so witless
that he could no longer be sent out on errands and the disorder in settling in
the new house left Stephen freer than he had been in Blackrock. In the beginning
he contented himself with circling timidly round the neighbouring square or, at
<br><font color="green">{ms, 14}</font>
<br> most, going half way down one of the side streets but when he had made a
skeleton map of the city in his mind he followed boldly one of its central lines
until he reached the customhouse. He passed unchallenged among the docks and
along the quays<a target="foot" id="fzz0020">&ordm;</a> at the multitude of
corks that lay bobbing on the surface of the water in a thick yellow
scum<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span>, at the crowds
of quay porters and the rumbling carts and the ill-dressed bearded policeman.
The vastness and strangeness of the life suggested to him by the bales of
merchandise stocked along the walls or swung aloft out of the holds of steamers
wakened again in him the unrest which had sent him wandering in the evening from
garden to garden in search of Mercedes. And amid this new bustling life he might
have fancied himself in another Marseille but that he missed the bright sky and
the sum-warmed trellises of the wineshops. A vague dissatisfaction grew up
within him as he looked on the quays and on the river and on the lowering skies and yet he continued
<br><font color="green">{ms, 15}</font>
<br> to wander up and down day after day as if he really sought someone that eluded him.</p>
<p> He went once or twice with his mother to visit their relatives: and though
they passed a jovial array of shops lit up and adorned for Christmas his mood of
embittered silence did not leave him. The causes of his embitterment were many,
remote and near. He was angry with himself for being young and the prey of
restless foolish impulses, angry also with the change of fortune which was
reshaping the world about him into a vision of squalor and insincerity. Yet his
anger lent nothing to the vision. He chronicled with patience what he saw,
detaching himself from it and tasting its mortifying flavour in secret.</p>
<p> He was sitting on the backless chair in his aunt&apos;s kitchen. A lamp with
a reflector hung on the japanned wall of the fireplace and by its light his aunt
was reading the evening paper that lay on her knees. She looked a long time at a
smiling picture that was set in it and said musingly:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The beautiful Mabel Hunter! &mdash;</p>
<p> A ringletted girl
<br><font color="green">{ms, 16}</font>
<br> stood on tiptoe to peer at the picture and said softly:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What is she in, mud? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; In a pantomime, love &mdash;</p>
<p> The child leaned her ringletted head against her mother&apos;s sleeve,
gazing on the picture, and murmured as if fascinated:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The beautiful Mabel Hunter! &mdash;</p>
<p> As if fascinated, her eyes rested long upon those demurely taunting eyes and she murmured devotedly:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Isn&apos;t she an exquisite creature? &mdash;</p>
<p> And the boy who came in from the street, stamping crookedly under his stone
of coal, heard her words. He dropped his load promptly on the floor and hurried
to her side to see. He mauled the edges of the paper with his reddened and
blackened hands, shouldering her aside and complaining that he could not see.</p>
<p> He was sitting in the narrow breakfast room high up in the old dark-windowed
house. The firelight flickered on the wall and beyond the window a spectral
<br><font color="green">{ms, 17}</font>
<br> dusk was gathering upon the river. Before the fire an old woman was busy
making tea and, as she bustled at the task, she told in a low voice of what the
priest and the doctor had said. She told too of certain changes that she had
seen in her of late and of her odd ways and sayings. He sat listening to the
words and following the ways of adventure that lay open in the coals, arches and
vaults and winding galleries and jagged caverns.</p>
<p> Suddenly he became aware of something in the doorway. A skull appeared
suspended in the gloom of the doorway. A feeble creature like a monkey was
there, drawn thither by the sound of voices at the fire. A whining voice came from the door asking:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is that Josephine? &mdash;</p>
<p> The old bustling woman answered cheerily from the fireplace:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, Ellen, it&apos;s Stephen &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O.... O, good evening, Stephen &mdash;</p>
<p> He answered the greeting and saw a silly smile break out over the face in the doorway.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 18}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do you want anything, Ellen? &mdash; asked the old woman at the fire.</p>
<p> But she did not answer the question and said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I thought it was Josephine. I thought you were Josephine, Stephen &mdash;</p>
<p> And, repeating this several times, she fell to laughing feebly.</p>
<p> He was sitting in the midst of a children&apos;s party at Harold&apos;s
Cross. His silent watchful manner had grown upon him and he took little part in
the games. The children, wearing the spoils of their crackers, danced and romped
noisily and, though he tried to share their merriment, he felt himself a gloomy
figure amid the gay cocked hats and sunbonnets.</p>
<p> But when he had sung his song and withdrawn into a snug corner of the room
he began to taste the joy of his loneliness. The mirth, which in the beginning
of the evening had seemed to him false and trivial, was like a soothing air to
him, passing gaily by his senses, hiding from other eyes the feverish agitation
of his blood while through the circling of the dancers and amid the music and laughter her glances
<br><font color="green">{ms, 19}</font>
<br> travelled to his corner, flattering, taunting, searching, exciting his heart.</p>
<p> In the hall the children who had stayed latest were putting on their things:
the party was over. She had thrown a shawl about her and, as they went together
towards the tram, sprays of her fresh warm breath flew gaily above her cowled
head and her shoes tapped blithely on the glassy road.</p>
<p> It was the last tram. The lank brown horses knew it and shook their bells to
the clear night in admonition. The conductor talked with the driver, both
nodding often in the green light of the lamp. On the empty seats of the tram
were scattered a few coloured tickets. No sound of footsteps came up or down the
road. No sound broke the peace of the night save when the lank brown horses
rubbed their noses together and shook their bells.</p>
<p> They seemed to listen, he on the upper step and she on the lower. She came
up to his step many times and went down to hers again between their phrases and
once or twice stood close beside him for some moments on the upper step, forgetting
<br><font color="green">{ms, 20}</font>
<br> to go down, and then went down. His heart danced upon her movements like a
cork upon a tide. He heard what her eyes said to him from beneath their cowl and
knew that in some dim past, whether in life or revery, he had heard their tale
before. He saw her urge her vanities, her fine dress and sash and long black
stockings, and knew that he had yielded to them a thousand times. Yet a voice
within him spoke<a target="foot" id="fzz0021">&ordm;</a> the noise of his
dancing heart, asking him would he take her gift to which he had only to stretch
out his hand. And he remembered the day when he and Eileen had stood looking
into the hotel grounds, watching the waiters running up a trail of bunting on
the flagstaff and the fox terrier scampering to and fro on the sunny lawn and
how, all of a sudden, she had broken out into a peal of laughter and had run
down the sloping curve of the path. Now, as then, he stood listlessly in his
place, seemingly a tranquil watcher of the scene before him.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; She too wants me to
<br><font color="green">{ms, 21}</font>
<br> catch hold of her &mdash; he thought &mdash; That&apos;s why she came with
me to the tram. I could easily catch hold of her when she comes up to my step:
nobody is looking. I could hold her and kiss her &mdash;</p>
<p> But he did neither: and, when he was sitting alone in the deserted tram, he
tore his ticket into shreds and stared gloomily at the corrugated footboard.</p>
<p> The next day he sat at his table in the bare upper room for many hours.
Before him lay a new pen, a new bottle of ink and a new emerald exercise. From
force of habit he had written at the top of the first page the initial letters
of the jesuit motto: A. M. D. G. On the first line of the page appeared the
title of the verses he was trying to write: To E&mdash; C&mdash;. He knew it was
right to begin so for he had seen similar titles in the collected poems of Lord
Byron. When he had written this title and drawn an ornamental line underneath he fell into a daydream and began to draw
<br><font color="green">{ms, 22}</font>
<br> diagrams on the cover of the book. He saw himself sitting at his table in
Bray the morning after the discussion at the Christmas dinnertable, trying to
write a poem about Parnell on the back of one of his father&apos;s second moiety
notices. But his brain had then refused to grapple with the theme and,
desisting, he had covered the page with the names and addresses of certain of his classmates:</p>
<p class="set">Roderick Greets<a target="foot" id="fzz0022">&ordm;</a>
<br> John Lawton
<br> Anthony MacSwiney
<br> Simon Mangan<a target="foot" id="fzz0023">&ordm;</a></p>
<p> Now it seemed as if he would fail again but, by dint of brooding on the
incident, he thought himself into confidence. During this process all those
elements which he deemed common and insignificant fell out of the scene. There
remained no trace of the tram itself nor of the tram-men nor of the horses: nor
did he and she appear vividly. The verses told only of the night and the balmy
breeze and the maiden lustre of the moon. Some undefined sorrow was hidden in
the hearts of the protagonists as they stood in silence beneath the leafless trees
<br><font color="green">{ms, 23}</font>
<br> and when the moment of farewell had come the kiss, which had been withheld
by one, was given by both. After this the letters: L. D. S. were written at the
foot of the page, and, having hidden the book, he went into his mother&apos;s
bedroom and gazed at his face for a long time in the mirror of her dressingtable.</p>
<p> But his long spell of leisure and liberty was drawing to its end. One
evening his father came home full of news which kept his tongue busy all through
dinner. Stephen had been awaiting his father&apos;s return for there had been
mutton hash that day and he knew that his father would make him dip his bread in
the gravy. But he did not relish the hash for the mention of Clongowes had coated his palate with a scum of disgust.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I walked bang into him &mdash; said Mr Dedalus for the
fourth time &mdash; just at the corner of the square &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Then I suppose &mdash; said Mrs Dedalus &mdash; he will
be able to arrange it. I mean about Belvedere &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Of course he will &mdash; said Mr
<br><font color="green">{ms, 24}</font>
<br> Dedalus &mdash; Don&apos;t I tell you he&apos;s provincial of the order now &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I never liked the idea of sending him to the Christian
Brothers myself &mdash; said Mrs Dedalus.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Christian Brothers be damned! said Mr Dedalus &mdash; Is
it with Paddy Stink and Micky Mud? No, let him stick to the jesuits in
God&apos;s name since he began with them. They&apos;ll be of service to him in
after years. Those are the fellows that can get you a position &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And they&apos;re a very rich order, aren&apos;t they, Simon? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Rather. They live well, I tell you. You saw their table
at Clongowes. Fed up, by God, like gamecocks &mdash;</p>
<p> Mr Dedalus pushed his plate over to Stephen and bade him finish what was on it.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Now then, Stephen &mdash; he said &mdash; you must put
your shoulder to the wheel, old chap. You&apos;ve had a fine long holiday &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, I&apos;m sure he&apos;ll work very hard now &mdash;
said Mrs Dedalus &mdash; especially when he has Maurice with him &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, Holy Paul, I forgot about Maurice &mdash; said Mr Dedalus &mdash;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 25}</font>
<br> Here, Maurice! Come here, you thick-headed ruffian! Do you know I&apos;m
going to send you to a college where they&apos;ll teach you to spell c. a. t.
cat. And I&apos;ll buy you a nice little penny handkerchief to keep your nose
dry. Won&apos;t that be grand fun? &mdash;</p>
<p> Maurice grinned at his father and then at his brother. Mr Dedalus screwed
his glass into his eye and stared hard at both of his sons. Stephen mumbled his
bread without answering his father&apos;s gaze.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; By the bye &mdash; said Mr Dedalus at length &mdash; the
rector &mdash; or provincial rather &mdash; was telling me that story about you
and Father Dolan. You&apos;re an impudent thief, he said &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, he didn&apos;t, Simon! &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Not he! &mdash; said Mr Dedalus &mdash; But he gave me a
great account of the whole affair. We were chatting, you know, and one word
borrowed another. And, by the way, who do you think he told me will get that job
in the corporation? But I&apos;ll tell you that after.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 26}</font>
<br> Well, as I was saying, we were chatting away quite friendly and he asked me
did our friend here wear glasses still, and then he told me the whole story &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And was he annoyed, Simon? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Annoyed? Not he! <u>Manly little chap!</u> he said &mdash;</p>
<p> Mr Dedalus imitated the mincing nasal tone of the provincial.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Father Dolan and I, when I told them all at dinner about
it, Father Dolan and I had a great laugh over it. <u>You better mind yourself
Father Dolan</u>, said I <u>or young Fedalus will send you up for twicw
nine</u>. We had a famous laugh together over it. Ha! Ha! Ha! &mdash;</p>
<p> Mr Dedalus turned to his wife and interjected in his natural voice:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Shows you the spirit in which they take the boys there.
O, a jesuit for your life, for diplomacy! &mdash;</p>
<p> He reassumed the provincial&apos;s voice and repeated:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I told them all at dinner about it and Father Dolan
<br><font color="green">{ms, 27}</font>
<br> and I and all of us we had a hearty laugh together over it. Ha! Ha! Ha! &mdash;</p>
<p class="set">xxx</p>
<p> The night of the Whitsuntide play had come and Stephen from the window of
the dressingroom looked out on the small grassplot across which lines of Chinese
lanterns were stretched. He watched the visitors come down the steps from the
house and pass into the theatre. Stewards in evening dress, old Belvedereans,
loitered in groups about the entrance to the theatre and ushered in the visitors
with ceremony. Under the sudden glow of a lantern he could recognize the smiling face of a priest.</p>
<p> The Blessed Sacrament had been removed from the tabernacle and the first
benches had been driven back so as to leave the dais of the altar and the space
<br><font color="green">{ms, 28}</font>
<br> before it free. Against the walls stood companies of barbells and Indian
clubs; the dumbbells were piled in one corner: and in the midst of countless
hillocks of gymnasium shoes and sweaters and singlets in untidy brown parcels
there stood the stout leather- jacketed vaulting horse waiting its turn to be
carried up on the stage and set in the middle of the winning team at the end of the gymnastic display.</p>
<p> Stephen, though in deference to his reputation for essay-writing he had been
elected secretary to the gymnasium, had no part in the first section of the
programme but in the play which formed the second section he had the chief part,
that of a farcical pedagogue. He had been cast for it on account of his stature
and grave manners for he was now at the end of his second year at Belvedere and in number two.</p>
<p> A score of the younger
<br><font color="green">{ms, 29}</font>
<br> boys in white knickers and singlets came pattering down from the stage,
through the vestry and to the chapel. The vestry and chapel were peopled with
eager masters and boys. The plump bald sergeant major was testing with his foot
the springboard of the vaulting horse. The lean young man in a long overcoat,
who was<a target="foot" id="fzz0024">&ordm;</a> give a special display of
intricate club swinging, stood near watching with interest, his silver-coated
clubs peeping out of his deep side-pockets. The hollow rattle of the wooden
dumbbells was heard as another team made ready to go up on the stage: and in
another moment the excited prefect was hustling the boys through the vestry like
a flock of geese, flapping the wings of his soutane nervously and crying to the
laggards to make haste. A little troop of Neapolitan peasants were practising
their steps at the end of the chapel, some arching their arms above their heads,
some swaying their baskets of paper violets and curtsying. In a dark corner of
the chapel at the gospel side of the altar
<br><font color="green">{ms, 30}</font>
<br> a stout old lady knelt amid her copious black skirts. When she stood up a
pink-dressed figure, wearing a curly golden wig and an old-fashioned straw
sunbonnet, with black pencilled eyebrows and cheeks delicately rouged and
powdered, was discovered. A low murmur of curiosity ran round the chapel at the
discovery of this girlish figure. One of the prefects, smiling and nodding his
head, approached the dark corner and, having bowed to the stout old lady, said pleasantly:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is this a beautiful young lady or a doll that you have here, Mrs Tallon? &mdash;</p>
<p> Then, bending down to peer at the smiling painted face under the leaf of the bonnet, he exclaimed:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;
No<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span>! Upon my word I
believe it&apos;s little Bertie Tallon after all! &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen at his post by the window heard the old lady and the priest laugh
together and heard the boys&apos; murmurs of admiration behind him as they
pressed forward to see the little boy who had to dance the sunbonnet
<br><font color="green">{ms, 31}</font>
<br> dance by himself. A movement of impatience escaped him. He let the edge of
the blind fall and, stepping down from the bench on which he had been standing, walked out of the chapel.</p>
<p> He passed out of the schoolhouse and halted under the shed that flanked the
garden. From the theatre opposite came the muffled noise of the audience and
sudden brazen clashes of the soldiers&apos; band. The light spread upwards from
the glass roof making the theatre seem a festive ark, anchored amid the hulks of
houses, her frail cables of lanterns looping her to her moorings. A side door of
the theatre opened suddenly and a shaft of light flew across the grass plots. A
sudden burst of music issued from the ark, the prelude of a waltz: and when the
side door closed again the listener could hear the faint rhythm of the music.
The sentiment of the opening bars, their languor and supple movement, evoked the
incommunicable emotion which had been the cause of all his day&apos;s unrest and of his impatient
<br><font color="green">{ms, 32}</font>
<br> movement of a moment before. His unrest issued from him like a wave of
sound: and on the tide of flowing music the ark was journeying, trailing her
cables of lanterns in her wake. Then a noise like dwarf artillery broke the
movement. It was the clapping that greeted the entry of the dumbbell team on the stage.</p>
<p> At the far end of the shed near the street a speck of pink light showed in
the darkness and as he walked towards it he became aware of a faint aromatic
odour. Two boys were standing in the shelter of the doorway, smoking, and before
he reached them he had recognised Heron by his voice.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Here comes the noble Dedalus! &mdash; cried a high
throaty voice &mdash; Welcome to our trusty friend! &mdash;</p>
<p> This welcome ended in a soft peal of mirthless laughter as Heron salaamed
and then began to poke the ground with his cane.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Here I am &mdash; said Stephen, halting and glancing from Heron to his friend.</p>
<p> The latter was a stranger to him but in the darkness, by the aid of the
glowing cigarette tips, he could make out a pale dandyish face over which
<br><font color="green">{ms, 33}</font>
<br> a smile was travelling slowly, a tall overcoated figure and a hard hat.
Heron did not trouble himself about an introduction but said instead:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I was just telling my friend Wallis what a lark it would
be tonight if you took off the rector in the part of the schoolmaster. It would be a ripping good joke &mdash;</p>
<p> Heron made a poor attempt to imitate for his friend Wallis the rector&apos;s
pedantic bass and then, laughing at his failure, asked Stephen to do it.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Go on, Dedalus, he urged, you can take him off rippingly.
<u>He that will not hear the church let him be to theea as the heathena and the publicana</u> &mdash;</p>
<p> The imitation was prevented by a mild expression of anger from Wallis in
whose mouthpiece the cigarette had become too tightly wedged.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Damn this blankety blank holder &mdash; he said, taking
it from his mouth and smiling and frowning upon it tolerantly &mdash; It&apos;s
always getting stuck like that. Do you use a holder? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I don&apos;t
smoke<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span> &mdash; answered Stephen.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 34}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No &mdash; said Heron &mdash; Dedalus is a model youth.
He doesn&apos;t smoke and he doesn&apos;t go to bazaars and he doesn&apos;t
flirt and he doesn&apos;t damn anything or damn all &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen shook his head and smiled in his rival&apos;s flushed and mobile
face, beaked like a bird&apos;s. He had often thought it strange that Vincent
Heron had a bird&apos;s face as well as a bird&apos;s name. A shock of pale hair
lay on the forehead like a ruffled crest: the forehead was narrow and bony and a
thin hooked nose stood out between the close set prominent eyes which were light
and inexpressive. The rivals were school friends. They sat together in class,
knelt together in the chapel, talked together after beads over their lunches. As
the fellows in number one were undistinguished dullards Stephen and Heron had
been during the year the virtual heads of the school. It was they who went up to
the rector together to ask for a free day or to get a fellow off.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O by the way &mdash; said Heron suddenly &mdash; I saw your
<br><font color="green">{ms, 35}</font>
<br> governor going in &mdash;</p>
<p> The smile waned on Stephen&apos;s face. Any allusion made to his father by a
fellow or by a master put his calm to rout in a moment. He waited in timorous
silence to hear what Heron might say next. Heron, however, nudged him expressively with his elbow and said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You&apos;re a sly dog, Dedalus &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Why so? &mdash; said Stephen.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You&apos;d think butter wouldn&apos;t melt in your mouth
&mdash; said Heron &mdash; But I&apos;m afraid you&apos;re a sly
dog<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span> &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Might I ask you what you are talking about? &mdash; said Stephen urbanely.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Indeed you might &mdash; answered Heron &mdash; We saw
her, Heron<a target="foot" id="fzz0025">&ordm;</a>, didn&apos;t we? And deucedly
pretty she is too. And inquisitive! <u>And what part does Stephen take, Mr
Dedalus? And will Stephen not sing, Mr Dedalus?</u> Your governor was staring at
her through that eyeglass of his for all he was worth so that I think the old
man has found you out too. I wouldn&apos;t care a bit, by Jove. She&apos;s ripping, isn&apos;t she, Wallis? &mdash;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 36}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Not<a target="foot" id="fzz0026">&ordm;</a> half bad
&mdash; answered Wallis quietly as he placed his holder once more in a corner of his mouth.</p>
<p> A shaft of momentary anger flew through Stephen&apos;s mind at these
indelicate allusions in the hearing of a stranger. For him there was nothing
amusing in a girl&apos;s interest and regard. All day he had thought of nothing
but their leave-taking on the steps of the tram at Harold&apos;s Cross, the
stream of moody emotions it had made to course through him and the poem he had
written about it. All day he had imagined a new meeting with her for he knew
that she was to come to the play. The old restless moodiness had again filled
his heart<a target="foot" id="fzz0027">&ordm;</a> as it had done on the night of
the party, but had not found an outlet in verse. The growth and knowledge of two
years of boyhood stood between then and now, forbidding such an outlet: and all
day the stream of gloomy tenderness within him had started forth and returned upon itself in dark courses and eddies,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 37}</font>
<br> wearying him in the end until the pleasantry of the prefect and the painted
little boy had drawn from him a movement of impatience.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; So you may as well admit &mdash; Heron went on &mdash;
that we&apos;ve fairly found you out this time. You can&apos;t play the saint on
me any more, that&apos;s one sure five &mdash;</p>
<p> A soft peal of mirthless laughter escaped from his lips and, bending down as
before, he struck Stephen lightly across the calf of the leg with his cane, as if in jesting reproof.</p>
<p> Stephen&apos;s movement<a target="foot" id="fzz0028">&ordm;</a> of anger had
already passed. He was neither flattered nor confused, but simply wished the
banter to end. He scarcely resented what had seemed to him a silly
indelicateness for he knew that the adventure in his mind stood in no danger
from these words: and his face mirrored his rival&apos;s false smile.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Admit! &mdash; repeated Heron, striking him again with his cane across the calf of the leg.</p>
<p> The stroke was playful but
<br><font color="green">{ms, 38}</font>
<br> not so lightly given as the first one had been. Stephen felt the skin
tingle and glow slightly and almost painlessly; and, bowing submissively, as if
to meet his companion&apos;s jesting mood, began to recite the <u>confiteor</u>.
The episode ended well, for both Heron and Wallis laughed indulgently at the irreverence.</p>
<p> The confession came only from Stephen&apos;s lips and, while they spoke the
words, a sudden memory had carried him to another scene called up, as if by
magic, at the moment when he had noted the faint cruel dimples at the corners of
Heron&apos;s smiling lips and had felt the familiar stroke of the cane against
his calf and had heard the familiar word of admonition:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Admit! &mdash;</p>
<p> It was towards the close of his first term in the college when he was in
number six. His sensitive nature was still smarting under the lashes of an undivined and squalid way of life. His soul
<br><font color="green">{ms, 39}</font>
<br> was still disquieted and cast down by the dull phenomenon of Dublin. He had
emerged from a two years&apos; spell of revery to find himself in the midst of a
new scene, every event and figure of which affected him intimately, disheartened
him or allured him and, whether alluring or disheartening, filled him always
with unrest and bitter thoughts. All the leisure
that<a target="foot" id="fzz0029">&ordm;</a> his school life left him was passed
in the company of subversive writers whose jibes and violence of speech set up a
ferment in his brain before they passed out of it into his crude writings.</p>
<p> The essay was for him the chief labour of his week and every Tuesday, as he
marched from home to the school, he read his fate in the incidents of the way,
pitting himself against some figure ahead of him and quickening his pace to
outstrip it before a certain goal was reached or planting his steps scrupulously in the spaces of the patchwork
<br><font color="green">{ms, 40}</font>
<br> of the pathway and telling himself that he would be first and not first in the weekly essay.</p>
<p> On a certain Tuesday the course of his triumphs was rudely broken. Mr Tate,
the English master, pointed his finger at him and said bluntly:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; This fellow has heresy in his essay &mdash;</p>
<p> A hush fell on the class. Mr Tate did not break it but dug with his hand
between his thighs while his heavily starched linen creaked about his neck and
wrists. Stephen did not look up. It was a raw spring morning and his eyes were
still smarting and weak. He was conscious of failure and of detection, of the
squalor of his own mind and home, and felt against his neck the raw edge of his turned and jagged collar.</p>
<p> A short loud laugh from Mr Tate set the class more at ease.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 41}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Perhaps you didn&apos;t know that &mdash; he said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Where? &mdash; asked Stephen.</p>
<p> Mr Tate withdrew his delving hand and spread out the essay.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Here. It&apos;s about the Creator and the soul.
Rrm...rrm...rrm...Ah! <u>without a possibility of
every<a target="foot" id="fzz0030">&ordm;</a> approaching nearer</u>. That&apos;s heresy &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen murmured:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I meant <u>without a possibility of ever reaching</u>. &mdash;</p>
<p> It was a submission and Mr Tate, appeased, folded up the essay and passed it across to him, saying:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O... Ah! <u>ever reaching</u>. That&apos;s another story &mdash;</p>
<p> But the class was not so soon appeased. Though nobody spoke to him of the
affair after class he could feel about him a vague general malignant joy.</p>
<p> A few nights after this public chiding he was walking with a letter along the Drumcondra Road
<br><font color="green">{ms, 42}</font>
<br> when he heard a voice cry:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Halt! &mdash;</p>
<p> He turned and saw three boys of his own class coming towards him in the
dusk. It was Heron who had called out and, as he marched forward between his two
attendants, he cleft the air before him with a thin cane in time to their steps.
Boland, his friend, marched beside him, a large grin on his face, while Nash
came on a few steps behind, blowing from the pace and wagging his great red head.</p>
<p> As soon as the boys had turned into Clonliffe Road together they began to
speak about books and writers, saying what books they were reading and how many
books there were in their fathers&apos; bookcases at home. Stephen listened to
them in some wonderment for Boland was the dunce and Nash the idler of the
class. In fact, after some talk about their favourite
<br><font color="green">{ms, 43}</font>
<br> writers, Nash declared for Captain Marryat who, he said, was the greatest writer.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Fudge! &mdash; said Heron &mdash; Ask Dedalus. Who is the greatest writer, Dedalus? &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen noted the mockery in the question and said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Of prose do you mean? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Newman, I think &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is it Cardinal Newman? asked Boland &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes &mdash; answered Stephen.</p>
<p> The grin broadened on Nash&apos;s freckled face as he turned to Stephen and said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And do you like Cardinal Newman, Dedalus? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, many people say that Newman has the best prose style
&mdash; Heron said to the other two in explanation &mdash; Of course he&apos;s not a poet &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And who is the best poet, Heron? &mdash; asked Boland.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Lord Tennyson, of course &mdash; answered Heron.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, yes, Lord Tennyson &mdash; said Nash &mdash; We have all his
<br><font color="green">{ms, 44}</font>
<br> poetry at home in a book &mdash;</p>
<p> At this Stephen forgot the silent vows he had been making and burst out:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Tennyson a poet! Why, he&apos;s only a rhymester! &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, get out! &mdash; said Heron &mdash; Everyone knows
that Tennyson is the greatest poet &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And who do you think is the greatest poet? &mdash; asked Boland, nudging his neighbour.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Byron, of course &mdash; answered Stephen.</p>
<p> Heron gave the lead and all three joined in a scornful laugh.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What are you laughing at? &mdash; asked Stephen.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You &mdash; said Heron &mdash; Byron the greatest poet!
He&apos;s only a poet for uneducated people &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He must be a fine poet! &mdash; said Boland.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You may keep your mouth shut &mdash; said Stephen,
turning on him boldly &mdash; All you know about poetry is what you wrote up on
the slates in the yard and were going to be sent to the loft for &mdash;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 45}</font> </p>
<p> Boland, in fact, was said to have written on the slates in the yard a
couplet about a classmate of his who often rode home from the college on a pony:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>As Tyson was riding into Jerusalem
<br> He fell and hurt his Alec Kafoozelum</u> &mdash;</p>
<p> This thrust put the two lieutenants to silence but Heron went on:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; In any case Byron was a heretic and immoral too &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I don&apos;t care what he was &mdash; cried Stephen.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You care<a target="foot" id="fzz0032">&ordm;</a> whether
he was a heretic or not? &mdash; said Nash.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What do you know about it? &mdash; shouted Stephen
&mdash; You never read a line of anything in your life except a trans, or Boland either &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I know that Byron was a bad man &mdash; said Boland.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Here, catch hold of this heretic &mdash; Heron called
out. In a moment Stephen was a prisoner.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Tate made you buck up the other day &mdash; Heron went on
&mdash; about the heresy in your essay &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I&apos;ll tell him tomorrow &mdash;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 46}</font>
<br> said Boland.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Will you? &mdash; said Stephen &mdash; You&apos;d be afraid to open your lips &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Afraid? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ay. Afraid of your life &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Behave yourself! &mdash; cried Heron, cutting at Stephen&apos;s legs with his cane.</p>
<p> It was the signal for their onset. Nash pinioned his arms behind while
Boland seized a long cabbage stump which was lying in the gutter. Struggling and
kicking under the cuts of the cane and the blows of the knotty stump Stephen was
borne back against a barbed wire fence.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Admit that Byron was no good &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Admit &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Admit &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No. No. &mdash;</p>
