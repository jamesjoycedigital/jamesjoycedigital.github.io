<p class="center">II</p>
<p class="flush">Uncle Charles smoked such black twist that at last his
outspoken nephew suggested to him to enjoy his morning smoke in a little outhouse at the end of the garden.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Very good, Simon. All serene, Simon &mdash; said the old
man tranquilly. &mdash;<a target="foot" id="fzz0021">&ordm;</a> Anywhere you
like. The outhouse will do me nicely: it will be more salubrious &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Damn me &mdash; said Mr Dedalus frankly &mdash; if I know
how you can smoke such villainous awful tobacco. It&apos;s like gunpowder, by God &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It&apos;s very nice, Simon &mdash; replied the old man
&mdash; Very cool and mollifying &mdash;</p>
<p> Every morning, therefore, uncle Charles repaired to his outhouse but not
before he had greased and brushed scrupulously his back hair and brushed and put
on his tall hat. While he smoked the brim of his tall hat and the bowl of his
pipe were just visible beyond the jambs of the outhouse door. His arbour, as he
called the reeking outhouse  which he shared with the cat and the garden tools,
served him also as a sounding-box: and every morning he hummed contentedly one
of his favourite songs: O, twine me a bower or Blue eyes and goldern hair or The
Groves of Blarney<a target="foot" id="fzz0022">&ordm;</a> while the grey and
blue coils of smoke rose slowly from his pipe and vanished in the pure air.</p>
<p> During the first part of the summer in Blackrock uncle Charles was
Stephen&apos;s constant companion. Uncle Charles was a hale old man with a well
tanned skin, rugged features and white side whiskers. On week days he did
messages between the house in Carysfort Avenue and those shops in the main
street of the town with which the family dealt. Stephen was glad to go with him
on these errands for uncle Charles helped him very liberally to handfuls of
whatever was exposed in open boxes and barrels outside the counter. He would
seize a handful of grapes and sawdust or three or four American apples and
thrust them generously into his grandnephew&apos;s hand while the shopman smiled
 uneasily; and, on Stephen&apos;s feigning reluctance to take them, he would frown and say:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Take them, sir. Do you hear me, sir? They&apos;re good for your bowels &mdash;</p>
<p> When the order list had been booked the two would go on to the park where an
old friend of Stephen&apos;s father, Mike Flynn, would be found seated on a
bench, waiting for them. Then would begin Stephen&apos;s run round the park.
Mike Flynn would stand at the gate near the railway station, watch in hand,
while Stephen ran round the track in the style Mike Flynn favoured, his head
high lifted, his knees well lifted and his hands held straight down by his
sides. When the morning practice was over the trainer would make his comments
and sometimes illustrate them by shuffling along for a yard or so comically in
old<a target="foot" id="fzz0023">&ordm;</a> pair of blue canvas shoes. A small
ring of wonderstruck children and nursemaids would gather to watch him and
linger even when he and uncle Charles had sat down again and were talking
athletics and  politics. Though he had heard his father say that Mike Flynn had
put some of the best runners of modern times through his hands Stephen often
glanced at his trainer&apos;s flabby stubble-covered face, as it bent over the
long stained fingers through which he rolled his cigarette, and with pity at the
mild lustreless blue eyes which would look up suddenly from the task and gaze
vaguely into the bluer distance while the long swollen fingers ceased their
rolling and grains and fibres of tobacco fell back into the pouch.</p>
<p> On the way home uncle Charles would often pay a visit to the chapel and, as
the font was above Stephen&apos;s reach, the old man would dip his hand and then
sprinkle the water briskly about Stephen&apos;s clothes and on the floor of the
porch. While he prayed he knelt on his red handkerchief and read above his
breath from a thumb blackened prayer book wherein catchwords were printed at the
foot of every page. Stephen knelt at his side respecting, though he did not
share, his piety. He often wondered what his  grand-uncle prayed for so
seriously. Perhaps he prayed for the souls in purgatory or for the grace of a
happy death or perhaps he prayed that God might send him back a part of the big fortune he had squandered in Cork.</p>
<p> On Sundays Stephen with his father and his grand-uncle took their
constitutional. The old man was a nimble walker in spite of his corns and often
ten or twelve miles of the road were covered. The little village of Stillorgan
was the parting of the ways. Either they went to the left towards the Dublin
mountains or along the Goatstown road and thence into Dundrum, coming home by
Sandyford. Trudging along the road or standing in some grimy wayside public
house his elders spoke constantly of the subjects nearer their hearts, of Irish
politics, of Munster and of the legends of their own family, to all of which
Stephen lent an avid ear. Words which he did not understand he said over and
over to himself till he had learnt them by heart: and through them he had
glimpses of the real world about them. The hour when he too would take his part
in the life of that  world seemed drawing near and in secret he began to make
ready for the great part which he felt awaited him the nature of which he only dimly apprehended.</p>
<p> His evenings were his own; and he pored over a ragged translation of The
Count of Monte Cristo. The figure of that dark avenger stood forth in his mind
for whatever he had heard or divined in childhood of the strange and terrible.
At night he built up on the parlour table an image of the wonderful island cave
out of transfers and paper flowers and coloured tissue paper and strips of the
silver and golden paper in which chocolate is wrapped. When he had broken up
this scenery, weary of its tinsel, there would come to his mind the bright
picture of Marseille, of sunny trellises, and of Mercedes. Outside Blackrock, on
the road that led to the mountains, stood a small whitewashed house in the
garden of which grew many rosebushes: and in this house, he told himself,
another Mercedes lived. Both on the outward and on the homeward journey he
measured distance by this landmark: and in his imagination he lived through a
long train of  adventures, marvellous as those in the book itself, towards the
close of which there appeared an image of himself, grown older and sadder,
standing in a moonlit garden with Mercedes who had so many years before slighted
his love, and with a sadly proud gesture of refusal, saying:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Madam, I never eat muscatel grapes &mdash;</p>
<p> He became the ally of a boy named Aubrey Mills and founded with him a gang
of adventurers in the avenue. Aubrey carried a whistle dangling from his
buttonhole and a bicycle lamp attached to his belt while the others had short
sticks thrust daggerwise through theirs. Stephen, who had read of
Napoleon&apos;s plain style of dress, chose to remain unadorned and thereby
heightened for himself the pleasure of taking counsel with his lieutenant before
giving orders. The gang made forays into the gardens of old maids or went down
to the castle and fought a battle on the shaggy weed-grown rocks, coming home
after it weary stragglers with the stale odours of the foreshore in their
nostrils and the rank oils of the seawrack upon  their hands and in their hair.</p>
<p> Aubrey and Stephen had a common milkman and often they drove out in the
milk-car to Carrickmines where the cows were at grass. While the men were
milking the boys would take turns in riding the tractable
horse<a target="foot" id="fzz0024">&ordm;</a> round the field. But when autumn
came the cows were driven home from the grass: and the first sight of the filthy
cowyard at Stradbrook with its foul green puddles and clots of liquid dung and
steaming bran troughs, sickened Stephen&apos;s heart. The cattle which had
seemed so beautiful in the country on sunny days revolted him and he could not even look at the milk they yielded.</p>
<p> The coming of September did not trouble him this year for he knew he was not
to be sent back to Clongowes. The practice in the park came to an end when Mike
Flynn went into hospital. Aubrey was at school and had only an hour or two free
in the evening. The gang fell asunder and there were no more nightly forays or
battles on the rocks. Stephen sometimes went round with the car which delivered
the evening milk and these chilly drives  blew away his memory of the filth of
the cowyard and he felt no repugnance at seeing the cow hairs and hayseeds on
the milkman&apos;s coat. Whenever the car drew up before a house he waited to
catch a glimpse of a well scrubbed kitchen or of a softly lighted hall and to
see how the servant would hold the jug and how she would close the door. He
thought it should be a pleasant life enough, driving along the roads every
evening to deliver milk, if he had warm gloves and a fat bag of gingernuts in
his pocket to eat from. But the same foreknowledge which had sickened his heart
and made his limbs sag suddenly as he raced round the park, the same intuition
which had made him glance with mistrust at his trainer&apos;s flabby
stubble-covered face as it bent heavily over his long stained fingers,
dissipated any vision of the future. In a vague way he understood that his
father was in trouble and that this was the reason why he himself had not been
sent back to Clongowes. For some time he had felt the slight change in his
house; and those changes in what he had deemed unchangeable were so many slight
shocks to his  boyish conception of the world. The ambition which he felt astir
at times in the darkness of his soul sought no outlet. A dusk like that of the
outer world obscured his mind as he heard the mare&apos;s hoofs clattering along
the tramtrack on the Rock Road and the great can swaying and rattling behind him.</p>
<p> He returned to Mercedes and, as he brooded upon her image, a strange unrest
crept into his blood. Sometimes a fever gathered within him and led him to rove
alone in the evening along the quiet avenue. The peace of the gardens and the
kindly lights in the windows poured a tender influence into his restless heart.
The noise of children at play annoyed him and their silly voices made him feel,
even more keenly than he had felt at Clongowes
tha<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">n</span></span>t he was
different from others. He did not want to play. He wanted to meet in the real
world the unsubstantial image which his soul so constantly beheld. He did not
know where to seek it or how, but a premonition which led him on told him that
this image would, without  any overt act of his, encounter him. They would meet
quietly as if they had known each other and had made their tryst, perhaps at one
of the gates or in some more secret place. They would be alone, surrounded by
darkness and silence: and in that
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">in</span></span> moment of supreme
tenderness he would be transfigured. He would fade into something
impal<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">b</span></span>pable under
her eyes and then, in a moment, he would be transfigured. Weakness and timidity
and inexperience would fall from him in that magic moment.</p>
<p class="center">&starf; &starf; &starf;</p>
<p> Two great yellow caravans had halted one morning before the door and men had
come tramping into the house to dismantle it. The furniture had been hustled out
through the front garden which was  strewn with wisps of straw and rope ends and
into the huge vans at the gate. When all had been safely stowed the vans had set
off noisily down the avenue: and from the window of the railway carriage, in
which he had sat with his red-eyed mother, Stephen had seen them lumbering along the Merrion Road.</p>
<p> The parlour fire would not draw that evening and Mr Dedalus rested the poker
against the bars of the grate to attract the flame. Uncle Charles dozed in a
corner of the half furnished uncarpeted room and near him the family portraits
leaned against the wall. The lamp on the table shed a weak light over the
boarded floor, muddied by the feet of the van-men. Stephen sat on a footstool
beside his father listening to a long and incoherent monologue. He understood
little or nothing of it at first but he became slowly aware that his father had
enemies and that some fight was going to take place. He felt, too, that he was
being enlisted for the fight, that some duty was being laid upon his shoulders.
The sudden flight  from the comfort and revery of Blackrock, the passage through
the gloomy foggy city, the thought of the bare cheerless house in which they
were now to live made his heart heavy, and again an intuition, a foreknowledge
of the future came to him. He understood also why the servants had often
whispered together in the hall and why his father had often stood on the
hearthrug with his back to the fire, talking loudly to uncle Charles who urged him to sit down and eat his dinner.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; There&apos;s a crack of the whip left in me yet, Stephen,
old chap &mdash; said Mr Dedalus, poking at the dull fire with fierce energy
&mdash; We&apos;re not dead yet, sonny. No, by the Lord Jesus (God forgive me) not half dead &mdash;</p>
<p> Dublin was a new and complex sensation. Uncle Charles had grown so witless
that he could no longer be sent out on errands and the disorder in settling in
the new house left Stephen freer than he had been in Blackrock. In the beginning
he contented himself with circling timidly round the neighbouring square or, at
 most, going half way down one of the side streets but when he had made a
skeleton map of the city in his mind he followed boldly one of its central lines
until he reached the customhouse. He passed unchallenged among the docks and
along the quays<a target="foot" id="fzz0025">&ordm;</a> at the multitude of
corks that lay bobbing on the surface of the water in a thick yellow
scum<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span>, at the crowds
of quay porters and the rumbling carts and the ill-dressed bearded policeman.
The vastness and strangeness of the life suggested to him by the bales of
merchandise stocked along the walls or swung aloft out of the holds of steamers
wakened again in him the unrest which had sent him wandering in the evening from
garden to garden in search of Mercedes. And amid this new bustling life he might
have fancied himself in another Marseille but that he missed the bright sky and
the sum-warmed trellises of the wineshops. A vague dissatisfaction grew up
within him as he looked on the quays and on the river and on the lowering skies
and yet he continued  to wander up and down day after day as if he really sought someone that eluded him.</p>
<p> He went once or twice with his mother to visit their relatives: and though
they passed a jovial array of shops lit up and adorned for Christmas his mood of
embittered silence did not leave him. The causes of his embitterment were many,
remote and near. He was angry with himself for being young and the prey of
restless foolish impulses, angry also with the change of fortune which was
reshaping the world about him into a vision of squalor and insincerity. Yet his
anger lent nothing to the vision. He chronicled with patience what he saw,
detaching himself from it and tasting its mortifying flavour in secret.</p>
<p> He was sitting on the backless chair in his aunt&apos;s kitchen. A lamp with
a reflector hung on the japanned wall of the fireplace and by its light his aunt
was reading the evening paper that lay on her knees. She looked a long time at a
smiling picture that was set in it and said musingly:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The beautiful Mabel Hunter! &mdash;</p>
<p> A ringletted girl stood on tiptoe to peer at the picture and said softly:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What is she in, mud? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; In a pantomime, love &mdash;</p>
<p> The child leaned her ringletted head against her mother&apos;s sleeve,
gazing on the picture, and murmured as if fascinated:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The beautiful Mabel Hunter! &mdash;</p>
<p> As if fascinated, her eyes rested long upon those demurely taunting eyes and she murmured devotedly:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Isn&apos;t she an exquisite creature? &mdash;</p>
<p> And the boy who came in from the street, stamping crookedly under his stone
of coal, heard her words. He dropped his load promptly on the floor and hurried
to her side to see. He mauled the edges of the paper with his reddened and
blackened hands, shouldering her aside and complaining that he could not see.</p>
<p> He was sitting in the narrow breakfast room high up in the old dark-windowed
house. The firelight flickered on the wall and beyond the window a spectral
 dusk was gathering upon the river. Before the fire an old woman was busy making
tea and, as she bustled at the task, she told in a low voice of what the priest
and the doctor had said. She told too of certain changes that she had seen in
her of late and of her odd ways and sayings. He sat listening to the words and
following the ways of adventure that lay open in the coals, arches and vaults
and winding galleries and jagged caverns.</p>
<p> <a name="jn0a14a" href="../../ff/unbs/jn0all.htm#jn0a14a">Suddenly he became
aware of something in the doorway. A skull appeared suspended in the gloom of
the doorway. A feeble creature like a monkey was there, drawn thither by the
sound of voices at the fire. A whining voice came from the door asking:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is that Josephine? &mdash;</p>
<p> The old bustling woman answered cheerily from the fireplace:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, Ellen, it&apos;s Stephen &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O.... O, good evening, Stephen &mdash;</p>
<p> He answered the greeting and saw a silly smile break out over the face in the doorway. </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do you want anything, Ellen? &mdash; asked the old woman at the fire.</p>
<p> But she did not answer the question and said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I thought it was Josephine. I thought you were Josephine, Stephen &mdash;</p>
<p> And, repeating this several times, she fell to laughing feebly.</a></p>
<p> He was sitting in the midst of a children&apos;s party at Harold&apos;s
Cross. His silent watchful manner had grown upon him and he took little part in
the games. The children, wearing the spoils of their crackers, danced and romped
noisily and, though he tried to share their merriment, he felt himself a gloomy
figure amid the gay cocked hats and sunbonnets.</p>
<p> But when he had sung his song and withdrawn into a snug corner of the room
he began to taste the joy of his loneliness. The mirth, which in the beginning
of the evening had seemed to him false and trivial, was like a soothing air to
him, passing gaily by his senses, hiding from other eyes the feverish agitation
of his blood while through the circling of the dancers and amid the music and
laughter her glances travelled  to his corner, flattering, taunting, searching, exciting his heart.</p>
<p> <a name="jn0a06a" href="../../ff/unbs/jn0all.htm#jn0a06a">In the hall the
children who had stayed latest were putting on their things: the party was over.
She had thrown a shawl about her and, as they went together towards the tram,
sprays of her fresh warm breath flew gaily above her cowled head and her shoes tapped blithely on the glassy road.</p>
<p> It was the last tram. The lank brown horses knew it and shook their bells to
the clear night in admonition. The conductor talked with the driver, both
nodding often in the green light of the lamp. On the empty seats of the tram
were scattered a few coloured tickets. No sound of footsteps came up or down the
road. No sound broke the peace of the night save when the lank brown horses
rubbed their noses together and shook their bells.</p>
<p> They seemed to listen, he on the upper step and she on the lower. She came
up to his step many times and went down to hers again between their phrases and
once or twice stood close beside him for some moments on the upper step,
forgetting  to go down, and then went down. His heart danced upon her movements
like a cork upon a tide. He heard what her eyes said to him from beneath their
cowl and knew that in some dim past, whether in life or revery, he had heard
their tale before. He saw her urge her vanities, her fine dress and sash and
long black stockings, and knew that he had yielded to them a thousand times.</a>
Yet a voice within him spoke<a target="foot" id="fzz0026">&ordm;</a> the noise
of his dancing heart, asking him would he take her gift to which he had only to
stretch out his hand. And he remembered the day when he and Eileen had stood
looking into the hotel grounds, watching the waiters running up a trail of
bunting on the flagstaff and the fox terrier scampering to and fro on the sunny
lawn and how, all of a sudden, she had broken out into a peal of laughter and
had run down the sloping curve of the path. Now, as then, he stood listlessly in
his place, seemingly a tranquil watcher of the scene before him.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; She too wants me to  catch hold of her &mdash; he thought
&mdash; That&apos;s why she came with me to the tram. I could easily catch hold
of her when she comes up to my step: nobody is looking. I could hold her and kiss her &mdash;</p>
<p> But he did neither: and, when he was sitting alone in the deserted tram, he
tore his ticket into shreds and stared gloomily at the corrugated footboard.</p>
<p> The next day he sat at his table in the bare upper room for many hours.
Before him lay a new pen, a new bottle of ink and a new emerald exercise. From
force of habit he had written at the top of the first page the initial letters
of the jesuit motto: A. M. D. G. On the first line of the page appeared the
title of the verses he was trying to write: To E&mdash; C&mdash;. He knew it was
right to begin so for he had seen similar titles in the collected poems of Lord
Byron. When he had written this title and drawn an ornamental line underneath he
fell into a daydream and began to draw  diagrams on the cover of the book. He
saw himself sitting at his table in Bray the morning after the discussion at the
Christmas dinnertable, trying to write a poem about Parnell on the back of one
of his father&apos;s second moiety notices. But his brain had then refused to
grapple with the theme and, desisting, he had covered the page with the names
and addresses of certain of his classmates:</p>
<p class="set">Roderick Greets<a target="foot" id="fzz0027">&ordm;</a>
<br> John Lawton
<br> Anthony MacSwiney
<br> Simon Mangan<a target="foot" id="fzz0028">&ordm;</a></p>
<p> Now it seemed as if he would fail again but, by dint of brooding on the
incident, he thought himself into confidence. During this process all those
elements which he deemed common and insignificant fell out of the scene. There
remained no trace of the tram itself nor of the tram-men nor of the horses: nor
did he and she appear vividly. The verses told only of the night and the balmy
breeze and the maiden lustre of the moon. Some undefined sorrow was hidden in
the hearts of the protagonists as they stood in silence beneath the leafless
trees  and when the moment of farewell had come the kiss, which had been
withheld by one, was given by both. After this the letters: L. D. S. were
written at the foot of the page, and, having hidden the book, he went into his
mother&apos;s bedroom and gazed at his face for a long time in the mirror of her dressingtable.</p>
<p> But his long spell of leisure and liberty was drawing to its end. One
evening his father came home full of news which kept his tongue busy all through
dinner. Stephen had been awaiting his father&apos;s return for there had been
mutton hash that day and he knew that his father would make him dip his bread in
the gravy. But he did not relish the hash for the mention of Clongowes had coated his palate with a scum of disgust.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I walked bang into him &mdash; said Mr Dedalus for the
fourth time &mdash; just at the corner of the square &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Then I suppose &mdash; said Mrs Dedalus &mdash; he will
be able to arrange it. I mean about Belvedere &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Of course he will &mdash; said Mr  Dedalus &mdash;
Don&apos;t I tell you he&apos;s provincial of the order now &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I never liked the idea of sending him to the Christian
Brothers myself &mdash; said Mrs Dedalus.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Christian Brothers be damned! &mdash; said Mr Dedalus
&mdash; Is it with Paddy Stink and Micky Mud? No, let him stick to the jesuits
in God&apos;s name since he began with them. They&apos;ll be of service to him
in after years. Those are the fellows that can get you a position &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And they&apos;re a very rich order, aren&apos;t they, Simon? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Rather. They live well, I tell you. You saw their table
at Clongowes. Fed up, by God, like gamecocks &mdash;</p>
<p> Mr Dedalus pushed his plate over to Stephen and bade him finish what was on it.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Now then, Stephen &mdash; he said &mdash; you must put
your shoulder to the wheel, old chap. You&apos;ve had a fine long holiday &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, I&apos;m sure he&apos;ll work very hard now &mdash;
said Mrs Dedalus &mdash; especially when he has Maurice with him &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, Holy Paul, I forgot about Maurice &mdash; said Mr
Dedalus &mdash;  Here, Maurice! Come here, you thick-headed ruffian! Do you know
I&apos;m going to send you to a college where they&apos;ll teach you to spell c.
a. t. cat. And I&apos;ll buy you a nice little penny handkerchief to keep your
nose dry. Won&apos;t that be grand fun? &mdash;</p>
<p> Maurice grinned at his father and then at his brother. Mr Dedalus screwed
his glass into his eye and stared hard at both of his sons. Stephen mumbled his
bread without answering his father&apos;s gaze.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; By the bye &mdash; said Mr Dedalus at length &mdash; the
rector &mdash; or provincial rather &mdash; was telling me that story about you
and Father Dolan. You&apos;re an impudent thief, he said &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, he didn&apos;t, Simon! &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Not he! &mdash; said Mr Dedalus &mdash; But he gave me a
great account of the whole affair. We were chatting, you know, and one word
borrowed another. And, by the way, who do you think he told me will get that job
in the corporation? But I&apos;ll tell you that after.  Well, as I was saying,
we were chatting away quite friendly and he asked me did our friend here wear
glasses still, and then he told me the whole story &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And was he annoyed, Simon? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Annoyed? Not he! <u>Manly little chap!</u> he said &mdash;</p>
<p> Mr Dedalus imitated the mincing nasal tone of the provincial.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Father Dolan and I, when I told them all at dinner about
it, Father Dolan and I had a great laugh over it. <u>You better mind yourself
Father Dolan</u>, said I <u>or young Dedalus will send you up for twice
nine</u>. We had a famous laugh together over it. Ha! Ha! Ha! &mdash;</p>
<p> Mr Dedalus turned to his wife and interjected in his natural voice:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Shows you the spirit in which they take the boys there.
O, a jesuit for your life, for diplomacy! &mdash;</p>
<p> He reassumed the provincial&apos;s voice and repeated:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I told them all at dinner about it and Father Dolan  and
I and all of us we had a hearty laugh together over it. Ha! Ha! Ha! &mdash;</p>
<p class="center">&starf; &starf; &starf;</p>
<p> The night of the Whitsuntide play had come and Stephen from the window of
the dressingroom looked out on the small grassplot across which lines of Chinese
lanterns were stretched. He watched the visitors come down the steps from the
house and pass into the theatre. Stewards in evening dress, old Belvedereans,
loitered in groups about the entrance to the theatre and ushered in the visitors
with ceremony. Under the sudden glow of a lantern he could recognize the smiling face of a priest.</p>
<p> The Blessed Sacrament had been removed from the tabernacle and the first
benches had been driven back so as to leave the dais of the altar and the space
 before it free. Against the walls stood companies of barbells and Indian clubs;
the dumbbells were piled in one corner: and in the midst of countless hillocks
of gymnasium shoes and sweaters and singlets in untidy brown parcels there stood
the stout leather- jacketed vaulting horse waiting its turn to be carried up on
the stage and set in the middle of the winning team at the end of the gymnastic display.</p>
<p> Stephen, though in deference to his reputation for essay-writing he had been
elected secretary to the gymnasium, had no part in the first section of the
programme but in the play which formed the second section he had the chief part,
that of a farcical pedagogue. He had been cast for it on account of his stature
and grave manners for he was now at the end of his second year at Belvedere and in number two.</p>
<p> A score of the younger  boys in white knickers and singlets came pattering
down from the stage, through the vestry and to the chapel. The vestry and chapel
were peopled with eager masters and boys. The plump bald sergeant major was
testing with his foot the springboard of the vaulting horse. The lean young man
in a long overcoat, who was<a target="foot" id="fzz0029">&ordm;</a> give a
special display of intricate club swinging, stood near watching with interest,
his silver-coated clubs peeping out of his deep side-pockets. The hollow rattle
of the wooden dumbbells was heard as another team made ready to go up on the
stage: and in another moment the excited prefect was hustling the boys through
the vestry like a flock of geese, flapping the wings of his soutane nervously
and crying to the laggards to make haste. A little troop of Neapolitan peasants
were practising their steps at the end of the chapel, some arching their arms
above their heads, some swaying their baskets of paper violets and curtsying. In
a dark corner of the chapel at the gospel side of the altar  a stout old lady
knelt amid her copious black skirts. When she stood up a pink-dressed figure,
wearing a curly golden wig and an old-fashioned straw sunbonnet, with black
pencilled eyebrows and cheeks delicately rouged and powdered, was discovered. A
low murmur of curiosity ran round the chapel at the discovery of this girlish
figure. One of the prefects, smiling and nodding his head, approached the dark
corner and, having bowed to the stout old lady, said pleasantly:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is this a beautiful young lady or a doll that you have here, Mrs Tallon? &mdash;</p>
<p> Then, bending down to peer at the smiling painted face under the leaf of the bonnet, he exclaimed:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;
No<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span>! Upon my word I
believe it&apos;s little Bertie Tallon after all! &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen at his post by the window heard the old lady and the priest laugh
together and heard the boys&apos; murmurs of admiration behind him as they
pressed forward to see the little boy who had to dance the sunbonnet  dance by
himself. A movement of impatience escaped him. He let the edge of the blind fall
and, stepping down from the bench on which he had been standing, walked out of the chapel.</p>
<p> He passed out of the schoolhouse and halted under the shed that flanked the
garden. From the theatre opposite came the muffled noise of the audience and
sudden brazen clashes of the soldiers&apos; band. The light spread upwards from
the glass roof making the theatre seem a festive ark, anchored amid the hulks of
houses, her frail cables of lanterns looping her to her moorings. A side door of
the theatre opened suddenly and a shaft of light flew across the grass plots. A
sudden burst of music issued from the ark, the prelude of a waltz: and when the
side door closed again the listener could hear the faint rhythm of the music.
The sentiment of the opening bars, their languor and supple movement, evoked the
incommunicable emotion which had been the cause of all his day&apos;s unrest and
of his impatient  movement of a moment before. His unrest issued from him like a
wave of sound: and on the tide of flowing music the ark was journeying, trailing
her cables of lanterns in her wake. Then a noise like dwarf artillery broke the
movement. It was the clapping that greeted the entry of the dumbbell team on the stage.</p>
<p> At the far end of the shed near the street a speck of pink light showed in
the darkness and as he walked towards it he became aware of a faint aromatic
odour. Two boys were standing in the shelter of the doorway, smoking, and before
he reached them he had recognised Heron by his voice.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Here comes the noble Dedalus! &mdash; cried a high
throaty voice &mdash; Welcome to our trusty friend! &mdash;</p>
<p> This welcome ended in a soft peal of mirthless laughter as Heron salaamed
and then began to poke the ground with his cane.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Here I am &mdash; said Stephen, halting and glancing from Heron to his friend.</p>
<p> The latter was a stranger to him but in the darkness, by the aid of the
glowing cigarette tips, he could make out a pale dandyish face over which  a
smile was travelling slowly, a tall overcoated figure and a hard hat. Heron did
not trouble himself about an introduction but said instead:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I was just telling my friend Wallis what a lark it would
be tonight if you took off the rector in the part of the schoolmaster. It would be a ripping good joke &mdash;</p>
<p> Heron made a poor attempt to imitate for his friend Wallis the rector&apos;s
pedantic bass and then, laughing at his failure, asked Stephen to do it.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Go on, Dedalus, he urged, you can take him off rippingly.
<u>He that will not hear the church let him be to thee as the heathens and the publicans</u> &mdash;</p>
<p> The imitation was prevented by a mild expression of anger from Wallis in
whose mouthpiece the cigarette had become too tightly wedged.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Damn this blankety blank holder &mdash; he said, taking
it from his mouth and smiling and frowning upon it tolerantly &mdash; It&apos;s
always getting stuck like that. Do you use a holder? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I don&apos;t
smoke<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span> &mdash; answered Stephen. </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No &mdash; said Heron &mdash; Dedalus is a model youth.
He doesn&apos;t smoke and he doesn&apos;t go to bazaars and he doesn&apos;t
flirt and he doesn&apos;t damn anything or damn all &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen shook his head and smiled in his rival&apos;s flushed and mobile
face, beaked like a bird&apos;s. He had often thought it strange that Vincent
Heron had a bird&apos;s face as well as a bird&apos;s name. A shock of pale hair
lay on the forehead like a ruffled crest: the forehead was narrow and bony and a
thin hooked nose stood out between the close set prominent eyes which were light
and inexpressive. The rivals were school friends. They sat together in class,
knelt together in the chapel, talked together after beads over their lunches. As
the fellows in number one were undistinguished dullards Stephen and Heron had
been during the year the virtual heads of the school. It was they who went up to
the rector together to ask for a free day or to get a fellow off.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O by the way &mdash; said Heron suddenly &mdash; I saw your  governor going in &mdash;</p>
<p> The smile waned on Stephen&apos;s face. Any allusion made to his father by a
fellow or by a master put his calm to rout in a moment. He waited in timorous
silence to hear what Heron might say next. Heron, however, nudged him expressively with his elbow and said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You&apos;re a sly dog, Dedalus &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Why so? &mdash; said Stephen.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You&apos;d think butter wouldn&apos;t melt in your mouth
&mdash; said Heron &mdash; But I&apos;m afraid you&apos;re a sly
dog<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span> &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Might I ask you what you are talking about? &mdash; said Stephen urbanely.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Indeed you might &mdash; answered Heron &mdash; We saw
her, Heron<a target="foot" id="fzz0030">&ordm;</a>, didn&apos;t we? And deucedly
pretty she is too. And inquisitive! <u>And what part does Stephen take, Mr
Dedalus? And will Stephen not sing, Mr Dedalus?</u> Your governor was staring at
her through that eyeglass of his for all he was worth so that I think the old
man has found you out too. I wouldn&apos;t care a bit, by Jove. She&apos;s ripping, isn&apos;t she, Wallis? &mdash; </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Not<a target="foot" id="fzz0031">&ordm;</a> half bad
&mdash; answered Wallis quietly as he placed his holder once more in a corner of his mouth.</p>
<p> A shaft of momentary anger flew through Stephen&apos;s mind at these
indelicate allusions in the hearing of a stranger. For him there was nothing
amusing in a girl&apos;s interest and regard. All day he had thought of nothing
but their leave-taking on the steps of the tram at Harold&apos;s Cross, the
stream of moody emotions it had made to course through him and the poem he had
written about it. All day he had imagined a new meeting with her for he knew
that she was to come to the play. The old restless moodiness had again filled
his heart<a target="foot" id="fzz0032">&ordm;</a> as it had done on the night of
the party, but had not found an outlet in verse. The growth and knowledge of two
years of boyhood stood between then and now, forbidding such an outlet: and all
day the stream of gloomy tenderness within him had started forth and returned
upon itself in dark courses and eddies,  wearying him in the end until the
pleasantry of the prefect and the painted little boy had drawn from him a movement of impatience.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; So you may as well admit &mdash; Heron went on &mdash;
that we&apos;ve fairly found you out this time. You can&apos;t play the saint on
me any more, that&apos;s one sure five &mdash;</p>
<p> A soft peal of mirthless laughter escaped from his lips and, bending down as
before, he struck Stephen lightly across the calf of the leg with his cane, as if in jesting reproof.</p>
<p> Stephen&apos;s movement<a target="foot" id="fzz0033">&ordm;</a> of anger had
already passed. He was neither flattered nor confused, but simply wished the
banter to end. He scarcely resented what had seemed to him a silly
indelicateness for he knew that the adventure in his mind stood in no danger
from these words: and his face mirrored his rival&apos;s false smile.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Admit! &mdash; repeated Heron, striking him again with his cane across the calf of the leg.</p>
<p> The stroke was playful but  not so lightly given as the first one had been.
Stephen felt the skin tingle and glow slightly and almost painlessly; and,
bowing submissively, as if to meet his companion&apos;s jesting mood, began to
recite the <u>confiteor</u>. The episode ended well, for both Heron and Wallis
laughed indulgently at the irreverence.</p>
<p> The confession came only from Stephen&apos;s lips and, while they spoke the
words, a sudden memory had carried him to another scene called up, as if by
magic, at the moment when he had noted the faint cruel dimples at the corners of
Heron&apos;s smiling lips and had felt the familiar stroke of the cane against
his calf and had heard the familiar word of admonition:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Admit! &mdash;</p>
<p> It was towards the close of his first term in the college when he was in
number six. His sensitive nature was still smarting under the lashes of an
undivined and squalid way of life. His soul  was still disquieted and cast down
by the dull phenomenon of Dublin. He had emerged from a two years&apos; spell of
revery to find himself in the midst of a new scene, every event and figure of
which affected him intimately, disheartened him or allured him and, whether
alluring or disheartening, filled him always with unrest and bitter thoughts.
All the leisure that<a target="foot" id="fzz0034">&ordm;</a> his school life
left him was passed in the company of subversive writers whose jibes and
violence of speech set up a ferment in his brain before they passed out of it into his crude writings.</p>
<p> The essay was for him the chief labour of his week and every Tuesday, as he
marched from home to the school, he read his fate in the incidents of the way,
pitting himself against some figure ahead of him and quickening his pace to
outstrip it before a certain goal was reached or planting his steps scrupulously
in the spaces of the patchwork  of the pathway and telling himself that he would
be first and not first in the weekly essay.</p>
<p> On a certain Tuesday the course of his triumphs was rudely broken. Mr Tate,
the English master, pointed his finger at him and said bluntly:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; This fellow has heresy in his essay &mdash;</p>
<p> A hush fell on the class. Mr Tate did not break it but dug with his hand
between his thighs while his heavily starched linen creaked about his neck and
wrists. Stephen did not look up. It was a raw spring morning and his eyes were
still smarting and weak. He was conscious of failure and of detection, of the
squalor of his own mind and home, and felt against his neck the raw edge of his turned and jagged collar.</p>
<p> A short loud laugh from Mr Tate set the class more at ease. </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Perhaps you didn&apos;t know that &mdash; he said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Where? &mdash; asked Stephen.</p>
<p> Mr Tate withdrew his delving hand and spread out the essay.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Here. It&apos;s about the Creator and the soul.
Rrm...rrm...rrm...Ah! <u>without a possibility of
every<a target="foot" id="fzz0035">&ordm;</a> approaching nearer</u>. That&apos;s heresy &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen murmured:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I meant <u>without a possibility of ever reaching</u>. &mdash;</p>
<p> It was a submission and Mr Tate, appeased, folded up the essay and passed it across to him, saying:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Ah! <u>ever reaching</u>. That&apos;s another story &mdash;</p>
<p> But the class was not so soon appeased. Though nobody spoke to him of the
affair after class he could feel about him a vague general malignant joy.</p>
<p> A few nights after this public chiding he was walking with a letter along
the Drumcondra Road  when he heard a voice cry:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Halt! &mdash;</p>
<p> He turned and saw three boys of his own class coming towards him in the
dusk. It was Heron who had called out and, as he marched forward between his two
attendants, he cleft the air before him with a thin cane in time to their steps.
Boland, his friend, marched beside him, a large grin on his face, while Nash
came on a few steps behind, blowing from the pace and wagging his great red head.</p>
<p> As soon as the boys had turned into Clonliffe Road together they began to
speak about books and writers, saying what books they were reading and how many
books there were in their fathers&apos; bookcases at home. Stephen listened to
them in some wonderment for Boland was the dunce and Nash the idler of the
class. In fact, after some talk about their favourite  writers, Nash declared
for Captain Marryat who, he said, was the greatest writer.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Fudge! &mdash; said Heron &mdash; Ask Dedalus. Who is the greatest writer, Dedalus? &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen noted the mockery in the question and said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Of prose do you mean? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Newman, I think &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is it Cardinal Newman? asked Boland &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes &mdash; answered Stephen.</p>
<p> The grin broadened on Nash&apos;s freckled face as he turned to Stephen and said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And do you like Cardinal Newman, Dedalus? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, many people say that Newman has the best prose style
&mdash; Heron said to the other two in explanation &mdash; Of course he&apos;s not a poet &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And who is the best poet, Heron? &mdash; asked Boland.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Lord Tennyson, of course &mdash; answered Heron.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, yes, Lord Tennyson &mdash; said Nash &mdash; We have
all his  poetry at home in a book &mdash;</p>
<p> At this Stephen forgot the silent vows he had been making and burst out:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Tennyson a poet! Why, he&apos;s only a rhymester! &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, get out! &mdash; said Heron &mdash; Everyone knows
that Tennyson is the greatest poet &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And who do you think is the greatest poet? &mdash; asked Boland, nudging his neighbour.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Byron, of course &mdash; answered Stephen.</p>
<p> Heron gave the lead and all three joined in a scornful laugh.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What are you laughing at? &mdash; asked Stephen.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You &mdash; said Heron &mdash; Byron the greatest poet!
He&apos;s only a poet for uneducated people &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He must be a fine poet! &mdash; said Boland.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You may keep your mouth shut &mdash; said Stephen,
turning on him boldly &mdash; All you know about poetry is what you wrote up on
the slates in the yard and were going to be sent to the loft for &mdash; </p>
<p> Boland, in fact, was said to have written on the slates in the yard a
couplet about a classmate of his who often rode home from the college on a pony:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>As Tyson was riding into Jerusalem
<br> He fell and hurt his Alec Kafoozelum</u> &mdash;</p>
<p> This thrust put the two lieutenants to silence but Heron went on:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; In any case Byron was a heretic and immoral too &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I don&apos;t care what he was &mdash; cried Stephen
Hotly<a target="foot" id="fzz0036">&ordm;</a>.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You care<a target="foot" id="fzz0037">&ordm;</a> whether
he was a heretic or not? &mdash; said Nash.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What do you know about it? &mdash; shouted Stephen
&mdash; You never read a line of anything in your life except a trans, or Boland either &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I know that Byron was a bad man &mdash; said Boland.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Here, catch hold of this heretic &mdash; Heron called
out. In a moment Stephen was a prisoner.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Tate made you buck up the other day &mdash; Heron went on
&mdash; about the heresy in your essay &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I&apos;ll tell him tomorrow &mdash;  said Boland.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Will you? &mdash; said Stephen &mdash; You&apos;d be afraid to open your lips &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Afraid? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ay. Afraid of your life &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Behave yourself! &mdash; cried Heron, cutting at Stephen&apos;s legs with his cane.</p>
<p> It was the signal for their onset. Nash pinioned his arms behind while
Boland seized a long cabbage stump which was lying in the gutter. Struggling and
kicking under the cuts of the cane and the blows of the knotty stump Stephen was
borne back against a barbed wire fence.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Admit that Byron was no good &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Admit &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Admit &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No. No. &mdash;</p>
<p> At last after a fury of plunges he wrenched himself free. His tormentors set
off towards Jones&apos;s Road, laughing and jeering at him, while he, torn and
flushed and panting, stumbled after
then,<a target="foot" id="fzz0038">&ordm;</a> half blinded with
 tears,<a target="foot" id="fzz0039">&ordm;</a> clenching his fists madly and sobbing.</p>
<p> While he was still repeating the CONFITEOR amid the indulgent laughter of
his hearers and while the scenes of that malignant episode were still passing
sharply and swiftly before his mind he wondered why he bore no malice now to
those who had tormented him. He had not forgotten a whit of their cowardice and
cruelty but the memory of it called forth no anger from him. All the
descriptions of fierce love and hatred which he had met in books had seemed to
him therefore unreal. Even that night as he stumbled homewards along
Jones&apos;s Road he had felt that some power was divesting him of that
sudden-woven anger as easily as a fruit is divested of her<a target="foot" id="fzz0040">&ordm;</a> soft ripe peel.</p>
<p> He remained standing with his two companions at the end of the shed,
 listening idly to their talk or to the bursts of applause in the theatre. She
was sitting there among the others, perhaps waiting for him to appear. He tried
to recall her appearance but could not. He could remember only that she had worn
a shawl about her head like a cowl and that her dark eyes had invited and
unnerved him. He wondered had he been in her thoughts as she had been in his.
Then in the dark and unseen by the other two he rested the tips of the fingers
of one hand upon the palm of the other hand, scarcely touching it lightly. But
the pressure of her fingers had been lighter and steadier: and suddenly the
memory of their touch traversed his brain and body like an invisible warm wave.</p>
<p> A boy came towards them, running along under the shed. He was excited  and breathless.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, Dedalus &mdash; he cried &mdash; Doyle is in a great
bake about you. You&apos;re to go in at once and get dressed for the play. Hurry up, you better &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He&apos;s coming now &mdash; said Heron to the messenger
with a haughty drawl &mdash; when he wants to &mdash;</p>
<p> The boy turned to Heron and repeated:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But Doyle is in an awful bake &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Will you tell Doyle with my best compliments that I damned his eyes? &mdash; answered Heron.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, I must go now &mdash; said Stephen, who cared little for such points of honour.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I wouldn&apos;t &mdash; said Heron &mdash; damn me if I
would. That&apos;s no way to send for one of the senior boys. In a bake, indeed!
I think it&apos;s quite enough that you&apos;re taking a part in his bally old play &mdash;</p>
<p> This spirit of quarrelsome  comradeship which he had observed lately in his
rival had not seduced Stephen from his habits of quiet obedience. He mistrusted
the turbulence and doubted the sincerity of such comradeship which seemed to him
a sorry anticipation of manhood. The question of honour here raised was, like
all such questions, trivial to him. While his mind had been pursuing its
intangible phantoms and turning back in
irresoluteness<a target="foot" id="fzz0041">&ordm;</a> from such pursuit he had
heard about him the constant voices of his father and of his masters, urging him
to be a gentleman above all things and urging him to be a good catholic above
all things. These voices had now come to be hollow-sounding in his ears. When
the gymnasium had been opened he had heard another voice urging him to be strong
and manly and healthy and when the movement towards national revival had begun
to be felt in the college yet  another voice had bidden him be true to his
country and help to raise up her language and tradition. In the profane world,
as he foresaw, a worldly voice would bid him raise up his father&apos;s fallen
state by his labours and, meanwhile, the voice of his school comrades urged him
to be a decent fellow, to shield others from blame or to beg them off and to do
his best to get free days for the school. And it was the din of all these
hollow-sounding voices that made him halt irresolutely in the pursuit of
phantoms. He gave them ear only for a time but he was happy only when he was far
from them, beyond their call, alone or in the company of phantasmal comrades.</p>
<p> In the vestry a plump fresh-faced jesuit and an elderly man, in shabby blue
clothes, were dabbling in a case of paints and chalks. The boys who had been
painted walked about or stood still awkwardly, touching their faces in a
gingerly fashion  with their furtive fingertips. In the middle of the vestry a
young jesuit, who was then on a visit to the college, stood rocking himself
rhythmically from the tips of his toes to his heels and back again, his hands
thrust well forward into his side-pockets. His small head set off with glossy
red curls and his newly shaven face agreed well with the spotless decency of his
soutane and with his spotless shoes.</p>
<p> As he watched this swaying form and tried to read for himself the legend of
the priest&apos;s mocking smile there came into Stephen&apos;s memory a saying
which he had heard from his father before he had been sent to Clongowes, that
you could always tell a jesuit by the style of his clothes. At the same moment
he thought he saw a likeness between his father&apos;s mind and that of this
smiling well-dressed priest: and he was aware of some desecration of the
priest&apos;s office or of the vestry  itself whose silence was now routed by
loud talk and joking and its air pungent with the smells of the gas-jets and the grease.</p>
<p> While his forehead was being wrinkled and his jaws painted black and blue by
the elderly man, he listened distractedly to the voice of the plump young jesuit
which bade him speak up and make his points clearly. He could hear the band
playing <u>The Lily of Killarney</u> and knew that in a few moments the curtain
would go up. He felt no stage fright but the thought of the part he had to play
humiliated him. A remembrance of some of his lines made a sudden flush rise to
his painted cheeks. He saw her serious alluring eyes watching him from among the
audience and their image at once swept away his scruples, leaving his will
compact. Another nature seemed to have been lent him: the infection of the
excitement and youth about him entered into and transformed his moody
 mistrustfulness. For one rare moment he seemed to be clothed in the real
apparel of boyhood: and, as he stood in the wings among the other players, he
shared the common mirth amid which the drop scene was hauled upwards by two
able-bodied priests with violent jerks and all awry.</p>
<p> A few moments after he found himself on the stage amid the garish gas and
the dim scenery, acting before the innumerable faces of the void. It surprised
him to see that the play which he had known at rehearsals for a disjointed
lifeless thing had suddenly assumed a life of its own. It seemed now to play
itself, he and his fellow actors aiding it with their parts. When the curtain
fell on the last scene he heard the void filled with applause and, through a
rift in a side scene, saw the simple body before which he had acted magically
deformed, the  void of faces breaking at all points and falling asunder into busy groups.</p>
<p> He left the stage quickly and rid himself of his mummery and passed out
through the chapel into the college garden. Now that the play was over his
nerves cried for some further adventure. He hurried onwards as if to overtake
it. The doors of the theatre were all open and the audience had emptied out. On
the lines which he had fancied the moorings of an ark a few lanterns swung in
the night breeze, flickering cheerlessly. He mounted the steps from the garden
in haste, eager that some prey should not elude him, and forced his way through
the crowd in the hall and past the two jesuits who stood watching the exodus and
bowing and shaking hands with the visitors. He pushed onward nervously, feigning
a still greater haste and faintly conscious of the smiles and  stares and nudges
which his powdered head left in its wake.</p>
<p> When he came out on the steps he saw his family waiting for him at the first
lamp. In a glance he noted that every figure of the group was familiar and ran down the steps angrily.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I have to leave a message down in George&apos;s Street
&mdash;, he said to his father quickly &mdash; I&apos;ll be home after you &mdash;</p>
<p> Without waiting for his father&apos;s questions he ran across the road and
began to walk at breakneck speed down the hill. He hardly knew where he was
walking. Pride and hope and desire like crushed herbs in his heart sent up
vapours of maddening incense before the eyes of his mind. He strode down the
hill amid the tumult of sudden-risen vapours of wounded pride and fallen hope
and baffled desire. They streamed upwards before his anguished eyes in  dense
and maddening fumes and passed away above him till at last the air was clear and cold again.</p>
<p> A film still veiled his eyes but they burned no longer. A power, akin to
that which had often made anger or resentment fall from him, brought his steps
to rest. He stood still and gazed up at the sombre porch of the morgue and from
that to the dark cobbled laneway at its side. He saw the word <u>Lotts</u> on
the wall of the lane and breathed slowly the rank heavy air.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That is horse piss and rotted straw &mdash; he thought
&mdash; It is a good odour to breathe. It will calm my heart. My heart is quite calm now. I will go back &mdash;</p>
<p class="center">&starf; &starf; &starf;</p>
<p> Stephen was once again seated beside his father in  the corner of a railway
carriage at Kingsbridge. He was travelling with his father by the night mail to
Cork. As the train steamed out of the station he recalled his childish wonder of
years before and every event of his first day at Clongowes. But he felt no
wonder now. He saw the darkening lands slipping away past him, the silent
telegraph-poles passing his window swiftly every four seconds, the little
glimmering stations, manned by a few silent sentries, flung by the mail behind
her and twinkling for a moment in the darkness like fiery grains flung backwards by a runner.</p>
<p> He listened without sympathy to his father&apos;s evocation of Cork and of
scenes of his youth, a tale broken by sighs or draughts from his pocket flask
whenever the image of some dead friend appeared in it or whenever the
evoker<a target="foot" id="fzz0042">&ordm;</a> remembered suddenly the purpose
of his actual visit. Stephen heard but could feel no pity. The images of the
dead were  all strangers to him save that of uncle Charles, an image which had
lately been fading out of memory. He knew, however, that his father&apos;s
property was going to be sold by auction, and in the manner of his own
dispossession he felt the world give the lie rudely to his phantasy.</p>
<p> At Maryborough he fell asleep. When he awoke the train had passed out of
Mallow and his father was stretched asleep on the other seat. The cold light of
the dawn lay over the country, over the unpeopled fields and the closed
cottages. The terror of sleep fascinated his mind as he watched the silent
country or heard from time to time his father&apos;s deep breath or sudden
sleepy movement. The neighbourhood of unseen sleepers filled him with strange
dread, as though they could harm him, and he prayed that the day might come
quickly. His prayer, addressed neither to God nor saint, began with  a shiver,
as the chilly morning breeze crept through the chink of the carriage door to his
feet, and ended in a trail of foolish words which he made to fit the insistent
rhythm of the train; and silently, at intervals of four seconds, the
telegraph-poles held the galloping notes of the music between punctual bars.
This furious music allayed his dread and, leaning against the windowledge, he let his eyelids close again.</p>
<p> They drove in a jingle across Cork while it was still early morning and
Stephen finished his sleep in a bedroom of the Victoria Hotel. The bright warm
sunlight was streaming through the window and he could hear the din of traffic.
His father was standing before the dressingtable, examining his hair and face
and moustache with great care, craning his neck across the water-jug and drawing
it back sideways to see the better.  While he did so he sang softly to himself with quaint accent and phrasing:</p>
<p class="set">&apos;Tis youth and folly
<br> Makes young men marry,
<br> So here, my love, I&apos;ll
<br> No longer stay.
<br> What can&apos;t be cured, sure,
<br> Must be injured, sure,
<br> So I&apos;ll go to
<br> Amerikay.</p>
<p class="set">My love she&apos;s handsome,
<br> My love she&apos;s boney:
<br> She&apos;s like good whisky
<br> When it is new;
<br> But when &apos;tis old
<br> And growing cold
<br> It fades and dies like
<br> The mountain dew.</p>
<p> The consciousness of the warm sunny city outside his window and the tender
tremors with which his father&apos;s voice festooned the strange sad happy air,
drove off all the mists of the night&apos;s ill humour from Stephen&apos;s
brain. He got up quickly to dress and, when the song had ended, said: </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That&apos;s much prettier than any of your other <u>come-all-you</u>s &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do you think so? &mdash; asked Mr Dedalus.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I like it &mdash; said Stephen.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It&apos;s a pretty old air &mdash; said Mr Dedalus,
twirling the points of his moustache &mdash; Ah, but you should have heard Mick
Lacy sing it! Poor Mick Lacy! He had little turns for it, grace notes that he
used to put in that I haven&apos;t got. That was the
boy<a target="foot" id="fzz0043">&ordm;</a> could sing a <u>come-all-you</u>, if you like. &mdash;</p>
<p> Mr Dedalus had ordered drisheens for breakfast and during the meal he
cross-examined the waiter for local news. For the most part they spoke at cross
purposes when a name was mentioned, the waiter having in mind the present holder
and Mr Dedalus his father or perhaps his grandfather.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, I hope they haven&apos;t moved the Queen&apos;s
College anyhow &mdash; said Mr Dedalus &mdash; for I want to show it to  this youngster of mine &mdash;</p>
<p> Along the Mardyke the trees were in bloom. They entered the grounds of the
college and were led by the garrulous porter across the quadrangle. But their
progress across the gravel was brought to a halt after every dozen or so paces by some reply of the porter&apos;s:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ah, do you tell me so? And is poor Pottlebelly dead? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, sir. Dead, sir &mdash;</p>
<p> During these halts Stephen stood awkwardly behind the two men, weary of the
subject and waiting restlessly for the slow march to begin again. By the time
they had crossed the quadrangle his restlessness had risen to fever. He wondered
how his father, whom he knew for a shrewd suspicious man, could be duped by the
servile manners of the porter; and the lively southern speech which had
entertained him all the  morning now irritated his ears.</p>
<p> They passed into the anatomy theatre where Mr Dedalus, the porter aiding
him, searched the desks for his initials. Stephen remained in the background,
depressed more than ever by the darkness and silence of the theatre and by the
air it wore of jaded and formal study. On the desk he read the word
<u>Foetus</u> cut several times in the dark stained wood. The sudden legend
startled his blood: he seemed to feel the absent students of the college about
him and to shrink from their company. A vision of their life, which his
father&apos;s words had been powerless to evoke, sprang up before him out of the
word cut in the desk. A broad-shouldered student with a moustache was cutting in
the letters with a jack-knife, seriously. Other  students stood or sat near him
laughing at his handiwork. One jogged his elbow. The big student turned on him,
frowning. He was dressed in loose grey clothes and had tan boots.</p>
<p> Stephen&apos;s name was called. He hurried down the steps of the theatre so
as to be as far away from the vision as he could be and, peering closely at his
father&apos;s initials, hid his flushed face.</p>
<p> But the word and the vision capered before his eyes as he walked back across
the quadrangle and towards the college gate. It shocked him to find in the outer
world a trace of what he had deemed till then a brutish and individual malady of
his own mind. His monstrous reveries came thronging into his memory. They too
had sprung up before him, suddenly and furiously, out  of mere words. He had
soon given in to them and allowed them to sweep across and abase his intellect,
wondering always where they came from, from what den of monstrous images, and
always weak and humble towards others, restless and sickened of himself when they had swept over him.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ay, bedad! And there&apos;s the Groceries sure enough
&mdash; cried Mr Dedalus &mdash; You often heard me speak of the Groceries,
didn&apos;t you, Stephen. Many&apos;s the time we went down there when our names
had been marked, <a name="jn2037g" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2037g">a
crowd of us, Harry Peard and little Jack Mountain and Bob Dyas and Maurice
Moriarty, the Frenchman, and Tom O&apos;Grady and Mick Lacey that I told you of
this morning and Joey Corbet and poor little good-hearted Johnny Keevers of the Tantiles</a> &mdash;</p>
<p> The leaves of the trees along the Mardyke were astir and whispering in the
sunlight. A team of  cricketers passed, agile young men in flannels and blazers,
one of them carrying the long green wicket-bag. In a quiet bystreet a German
band of five players in faded uniforms and with battered brass instruments was
playing to an audience of street arabs and leisurely messenger boys. A maid in a
white cap and apron was watering a box of plants on a sill which shone like a
slab of limestone in the warm glare. From another window open to the air came
the sound of a piano, scale after scale rising into the treble.</p>
<p> Stephen walked on at his father&apos;s side, listening to stories he had
heard before, hearing again the names of the scattered and dead revellers who
had been the companions of his father&apos;s youth. And a faint sickness sighed
in his heart. He recalled his own equivocal position in Belvedere, a free boy, a
leader afraid of his own authority, proud  and sensitive and suspicious,
battling against the squalor of his life and against the riot of his mind. The
letters cut in the stained wood of the desk stared upon him, mocking his bodily
weakness and futile enthusiasms and making him loathe himself for his own mad
and filthy orgies. The spittle in his throat grew bitter and foul to swallow and
the faint sickness climbed to his brain so that for a moment he closed his eyes and walked on in darkness.</p>
<p> He could still hear his father&apos;s voice.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; When you kick out for yourself, Stephen, (as I daresay
you will one of those days) remember, whatever you do, to mix with gentlemen.
When I was a young fellow I tell you I enjoyed myself. I mixed with fine decent
fellows. Everyone of us could do something. One fellow had a good voice, another
 fellow was a good actor, another could sing a good comic song, another was a
good oarsman or a good racket-player, another could tell a good story and so on.
We kept the ball rolling anyhow and enjoyed ourselves and saw a bit of life and
we were none the worse of it either. But we were all gentlemen, Stephen (at
least I hope we were) and bloody good honest Irishmen too. That&apos;s the kind
of fellows I want you to associate with, fellows of the right kidney. I&apos;m
talking to you as a friend, Stephen. I don&apos;t believe a son should be afraid
of his father. No, I treat you as your grandfather treated me when I was a young
chap. We were more like brothers than father and son. I&apos;ll never forget the
first day he caught me smoking. I was standing at the end of the South Terrace
one day  with some maneens like myself and sure we thought we were grand fellows
because we had pipes stuck in the corners of our mouths. Suddenly the governor
passed. He didn&apos;t say a word, or stop even. But the next day, Sunday, we
were out for a walk together and when we were coming home he took out his cigar
case and said: By the by, Simon, I didn&apos;t know you smoked: or something
like that. Of course I tried to carry it off as best I could: If you want a good
smoke<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">:</span></span> &mdash; he
said &mdash; try one of these cigars. An American captain made me a present of them last night in Queenstown &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen heard his father&apos;s voice break into a laugh which was almost a sob.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He was the handsomest man in Cork at that time, by God he
was! The women used to stand to look after him  in the street &mdash;</p>
<p> He heard the sob passing loudly down his father&apos;s throat and opened his
eyes with a nervous impulse. The sunlight breaking suddenly on his sight turned
the sky and clouds into a fantastic world of sombre masses with lakelike spaces
of dark rosy light. His very brain was sick and powerless. He could scarcely
interpret the letters of the signboards of the shops. By his monstrous way of
life he seemed to have put himself beyond the limits of reality. Nothing moved
him or spoke to him from the real world unless he heard in it an echo of the
infuriated cries within him. He could respond to no earthly or human appeal,
dumb and insensible to the call of summer and gladness and companionship,
wearied and dejected by his father&apos;s voice. He could scarcely recognize as
his own thoughts: and  repeated slowly to himself:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I am Stephen Dedalus. I am walking beside my father whose
name is Simon Dedalus. We are in Cork, in Ireland. Cork is a city. Our room is
in the Victoria Hotel. Victoria and Stephen and Simon. Simon and Stephen and Victoria. Names &mdash;</p>
<p> The memory of his childhood suddenly grew dim. He tried to call forth some
of its vivid moments but could not. He recalled only names. Dante, Parnell,
Clane, Clongowes. A little boy had been taught geography by an old woman who
kept two brushes in her wardrobe. Then he had been sent away from home to a
college, he had made his first communion and eaten slim jim out of his cricket
cap and watched the firelight leaping and dancing on the wall of a little
bedroom in the infirmary and dreamed of being  dead, of mass being said for him
by the rector in a black and gold cope, of being buried then in the little
graveyard of the community off the main avenue of
chestnuts<a target="foot" id="fzz0044">&ordm;</a>. But he had not died then.
Parnell had died. There had been no mass for the dead in the chapel and no
procession. He had not died but he had faded out like a film in the sun. He had
been lost or had wandered out of existence for he no longer existed. How strange
to think of him passing out of existence in such a way, not by death but by
fading out in the sun or by being lost and forgotten somewhere in the universe!
It was strange to see his small body appear again for a moment: a little boy in
a grey belted suit. His hands were in his side-pockets and his trousers were
tucked in at the knees by elastic  bands.</p>
<p> On the evening of the day on which the property was sold Stephen followed
his father meekly about the city from bar to bar. To the sellers in the market,
to the barmen and barmaids, to the beggars who importuned him for a lob Mr
Dedalus told the same tale, that he was an old Corkonian, that he had been
trying for thirty years to get rid of his Cork accent up in Dublin and that
Peter Pickackafox<a target="foot" id="fzz0045">&ordm;</a> beside him was his
eldest son but that he was only a Dublin jackeen.</p>
<p> They had set out early in the morning from Newcombe&apos;s coffee-house,
where Mr Dedalus&apos;s cup had rattled noisily against its saucer, and Stephen
had tried to cover that shameful sign of his father&apos;s drinking bout of the
night before by moving his chair and coughing. One humiliation had succeeded
another:  the false smiles of the market sellers, the curvetings and oglings of
the barmaids with whom his father flirted, the compliments and encouraging words
of his father&apos;s friends. They had told him that he had a great look of his
grandfather and Mr Dedalus had agreed that he was an ugly likeness. They had
unearthed traces of a Cork accent in his speech and made him admit that the Lee
was a much finer river than the Liffey. One of them, in order to put his Latin
to the proof, had made him translate short passages from Dilectus and asked him
whether it was correct to say: Tempora mutantur et nos cum illis
mutamur<a target="foot" id="fzz0046">&ordm;</a> or Tempora mutantur et nos
mutamur cum<a target="foot" id="fzz0047">&ordm;</a> illis. Another, a brisk old
man, whom Mr Dedalus called Johnny Cashman, had covered him with confusion by
asking him to say which were prettier, the  Dublin girls or the Cork girls.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He&apos;s not that way built &mdash; said Mr Dedalus
&mdash; Leave him alone. He&apos;s a level-headed thinking boy who doesn&apos;t
bother his head about that kind of nonsense &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Then he&apos;s not his father&apos;s son &mdash; said the little old man.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I don&apos;t know, I&apos;m sure &mdash; said Mr Dedalus, smiling complacently.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Your father &mdash; said the little old man to Stephen
&mdash; was the boldest flirt in the City of Cork in his day. Do you know that? &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen looked down and studied the tiled floor of the bar into which they had drifted.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Now don&apos;t be putting ideas into his head &mdash;
said Mr Dedalus &mdash; Leave him to his Maker &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yerra, sure I wouldn&apos;t put any ideas into his head.
I&apos;m old enough to be his grandfather. And I am a grandfather &mdash; said
the little old man to Stephen &mdash; Do  you know that?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Are you? &mdash; asked Stephen.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Bedad I am &mdash; said the little old man &mdash; I have
two bouncing grandchildren out at Sunday&apos;s Well. Now, then! What age do you
think I am? And I remember seeing your grandfather in his red coat riding out to
hounds. That was before you were born &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ay, or thought of &mdash; said Mr Dedalus.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Bedad I did &mdash; repeated the little old man &mdash;
And, more than that, I can remember even your great-grandfather, old John
Stephen Dedalus, and a fierce old
fireeater<a target="foot" id="fzz0048">&ordm;</a> he was. Now, then! There&apos;s a memory for you! &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That&apos;s three generations, four generations &mdash;
said another of the company &mdash; Why, Johnny Cashman, you must be nearing the century &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, I&apos;ll tell you the truth &mdash; said the
little  old man &mdash; I&apos;m just twentyseven<a target="foot" id="fzz0049">&ordm;</a> years of age.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; We&apos;re as old as we feel, Johnny &mdash; said Mr
Dedalus &mdash; and just finish what you have there and we&apos;ll have another.
Here, Tim or Tom or whatever your name is, give us the same again here. By God,
I don&apos;t feel more than eighteen myself. There&apos;s that son of mine there
not half my age and I&apos;m a better man than he is any day of the week &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Draw it mild now, Dedalus. I think it&apos;s about time
for you to take a back seat &mdash; said the gentleman who had spoken before.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, by God! &mdash; asserted Mr Dedalus &mdash; I&apos;ll
sing a tenor song against him or I&apos;ll vault a five-barred gate against him
or I&apos;ll run with him after the hounds across the country as I did thirty
years ago along with the Kerry Boy and the best man for  it &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But he&apos;ll beat you here &mdash;, said the little old
man &mdash; tapping his forehead and raising his glass to drain it &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, I hope he&apos;ll be as good a man as his father.
That&apos;s all I can say &mdash; said Mr Dedalus.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; If he is, he&apos;ll do &mdash; said the little old man.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And thanks be to God, Johnny &mdash; said Mr Dedalus
&mdash; that we lived so long and did so little harm &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But did so much good, Simon &mdash; said the little old
man gravely &mdash; Thanks be to God we lived so long and did so much good &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen watched the three glasses being raised from the counter as his
father and his two cronies drank to the memory of their past. An abyss of
fortune or of temperament sundered him from them. His  mind seemed older than
theirs: it shone coldly on their strifes and happiness and regrets like a moon
upon a younger earth. No life or youth stirred in him as it had stirred in them.
He had <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">n</span></span> known
neither the pleasure of companionship with others nor the vigour of rude male
health nor filial piety. Nothing stirred within his soul but a cold and cruel
and loveless lust. His childhood was dead or lost and with it his soul capable
of simple joys and he was drifting amid life like the barren shell of the moon.</p>
<p class="set"><u>Art thou pale for weariness
<br> Of climbing heaven and gazing on the earth,
<br> Wandering companionless</u>.....?</p>
<p> He repeated to himself the lines of Shelley&apos;s fragment. Its alternation
of sad human ineffectualness<a target="foot" id="fzz0050">&ordm;</a> with  vast
inhuman cycles of activity chilled him and he forgot his own human and ineffectual grieving.</p>
<p class="center">&starf; &starf; &starf;</p>
<p> Stephen&apos;s mother and his brother and one of his cousins waited at the
corner of quiet Foster Place while he and his father went up the steps and along
the colonnade where the highland sentry was parading. When they had passed into
the great hall and stood at the counter Stephen drew forth his orders on the
governor of the bank of Ireland for thirty and three pounds; and these sums, the
moneys of his exhibition and essay prize, were paid over to him rapidly by the
teller in  notes and in coin respectively. He bestowed them in his pockets with
feigned composure and suffered the friendly teller, to whom his father chatted,
to take his hand across the broad counter and wish him a brilliant career in
after life. He was impatient of their voices and could not keep his feet at
rest. But the teller still deferred the serving of others to say that he was
living in changed times and that there was nothing like giving a boy the best
education that money could buy. Mr Dedalus lingered in the hall gazing about him
and up at the roof and telling Stephen, who urged him to come out, that they
were standing in the house of commons of the old Irish parliament</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; God help us! &mdash; he said piously &mdash; to think of
the men of those times, Stephen, Hely Hutchinson and Flood and Henry Grattan
 and Charles Kendal Bushe, and the noblemen we have now, leaders of the Irish
people at home and abroad. Why, by God, they wouldn&apos;t be seen dead in a ten
acre field with them. No, Stephen, old chap, I&apos;m sorry to say that they are
only as I roved out one fine May morning in the merry month of sweet July &mdash;</p>
<p> A keen October wind was blowing round the bank. The three figures standing
at the edge of the muddy path had pinched cheeks and watery eyes. Stephen looked
at his thinly clad mother and remembered that a few days before he had seen a
mantle priced at twenty guineas in the windows of Barnardo&apos;s.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well that&apos;s done. &mdash; said Mr Dedalus.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; We had better go to dinner &mdash; said Stephen &mdash; Where? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Dinner? &mdash; said Mr Dedalus &mdash; Well, I suppose we had better, what? &mdash; </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Some place that&apos;s not too dear &mdash; said Mrs Dedalus.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Underdone&apos;s? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes. Some quiet place &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Come along &mdash; said Stephen quickly &mdash; It doesn&apos;t matter about the dearness.</p>
<p> He walked on before them with short nervous steps, smiling. They tried to
keep up with him, smiling also at his eagerness.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Take it easy like a good young fellow &mdash; said his
father &mdash; We&apos;re not out for the half mile, are we? &mdash;</p>
<p> For a swift season of merrymaking the money of his prizes ran through
Stephen&apos;s fingers. Great parcels of groceries and delicacies and dried
fruits arrived from the city. Every day he drew up a bill of fare for the family
and every night led a party of three or four to the theatre to see
<u>Ingomar</u> or <u>The Lady of Lyons</u>. In his coat pockets he carried
squares of Vienna  chocolate for his guests while his trousers&apos; pocket
bulged with masses of silver and copper coins. He bought presents for everyone,
overhauled his room, wrote out resolutions, marshalled his books up and down
their shelves, pored upon all kinds of price lists, drew up a form of
commonwealth for the household by which every member of it held some office,
opened a loans<a target="foot" id="fzz0051">&ordm;</a> bank for his family and
pressed loans on willing borrowers so that he might have the pleasure of making
out receipts and reckoning the interests on the sums lent. When he could do no
more he drove up and down the city in trams. Then the season of pleasure came to
an end. The pot of pink enamel paint gave out and the wainscot of his bedroom
remained with its unfinished and ill-plastered coat.</p>
<p> His household returned to its usual way of life. His mother had no further
occasion to upbraid him for squandering his money.  He too returned to his old
life at school and all his novel enterprises fell to pieces. The commonwealth
fell, the loans<a target="foot" id="fzz0052">&ordm;</a> bank closed its coffers
and its books on a sensible loss, the rules of life which he had drawn about himself fell into desuetude.</p>
<p> How foolish his aim had been! He had tried to build a break-water of order
and elegance against the sordid tide of life without him and to dam up, by rules
of conduct and active interest and new filial relations, the powerful recurrence
of the tides within him. Useless. From without as from within the waters had
flowed over his barriers: their tides began once more to jostle fiercely above the crumbled mole.</p>
<p> He saw clearly too his own futile isolation. He had not gone one step nearer
the lives he had sought to approach nor bridged the restless  shame and rancour
that had divided him from mother and brother and sister. He felt that he was
hardly of the one blood with them but stood to them rather in the mystical
kinship of fosterage, foster child and foster brother.</p>
<p> He turned to appease the fierce longings of his heart before which
everything else was idle and alien. He cared little that he was in mortal sin,
that his life had grown to be a tissue of subterfuge and falsehood. Beside the
savage desire within him to realize the enormities which he brooded on nothing
was sacred. He bore cynically with the shameful details of his secret riots in
which he exulted to defile with patience whatever image had attracted his eyes.
By day and by night he moved among distorted images of the outer world. A figure
that had seemed to him by day demure and  innocent came towards him by night
through the winding darkness of sleep, her face transfigured by a lecherous
cunning, her eyes bright with brutish joy. Only the morning pained him with its
dim memory of dark orgiastic riot, its keen and humiliating sense of transgression.</p>
<p> He returned to his wanderings. The veiled autumnal evenings led him from
street to street as they had led him years before along the quiet avenues of
Blackrock. But no vision of trim front gardens or of kindly lights in the
windows poured a tender influence upon him now. Only at times, in the pauses of
his desire, when the luxury that was
wasting<a target="foot" id="fzz0053">&ordm;</a> gave room to a softer languor,
the image of Mercedes traversed the background of his memory. He saw again the
small white house and the garden  of rosebushes on the road that led to the
mountains and he remembered the sadly proud gesture of refusal which he was to
make there, standing with her in the moonlit garden after years of estrangement
and adventure. At those moments the soft speeches of Claude Melnotte rose to his
lips and eased his unrest. A tender premonition touched him of the tryst he had
then looked forward to and, in spite of the horrible reality which lay between
his hope of then and now, of the holy encounter he had then imagined at which
weakness and timidity and inexperience were to fall from him.</p>
<p> Such moments passed and the wasting fires of lust sprang up again. The
verses passed from his lips and the inarticulate cries and the unspoken brutal
words rushed forth  from his brain to force a passage. His blood was in revolt.
He wandered up and down the dark slimy streets peering into the gloom of lanes
and doorways, listening eagerly for any sound. He moaned to himself like some
baffled prowling beast. He wanted to sin with another of his kind, to force
another being to sin with him and to exult with her in sin. He felt some dark
presence moving irresistibly upon him from the darkness, a presence subtle and
murmurous as a flood filling him wholly with itself. Its murmur besieged his
ears like the murmur of some multitude in sleep; its subtle streams penetrated
his being. His hands clenched convulsively and his teeth set together as he
suffered the agony of its penetration. He stretched out his arms in the street
to hold fast  the frail swooning form that eluded him and incited him: and the
cry that he had strangled for so long in his throat issued from his lips. It
broke from him like a wail of despair from a hell of sufferers and died in a
wail of furious entreaty, a cry for an iniquitous abandonment, a cry which was
but the echo of an obscene scrawl which he had read on the oozing wall of a urinal.</p>
<p> He had wandered into a maze of narrow and dirty streets. From the foul
laneways he heard bursts of hoarse riot and wrangling and the drawling of
drunken singers. He walked onward, dismayed, wondering whether he had strayed
into the quarter of the Jews. Women and girls dressed in long vivid gowns
traversed the street from house to house. They were leisurely and perfumed. A
trembling  seized him and his eyes grew dim.
<a name="pn1010e" href="../../ff/unbs/pn1all.htm#pn1010e">The yellow gas-flames
arose before his troubled vision against the vapoury sky, burning as if before
an altar.</a> Before the doors and in the lighted halls groups were gathered
arrayed as for some rite. He was in another world: he had awakened from a slumber of centuries.</p>
<p> He stood still in the middle of the roadway, his heart clamouring against
his bosom in a tumult. A young woman dressed in a long pink gown laid her hand
on his arm to detain him and gazed into his face. She said gaily:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Good night, Willie dear! &mdash;</p>
<p> Her room was warm and lightsome. A huge doll sat with her legs apart in the
copious easy-chair beside the bed. He tried to bid his tongue speak that he
might seem at ease, watching  her as he<a target="foot" id="fzz0054">&ordm;</a>
undid her gown, noting the proud conscious movements of her perfumed head.</p>
<p> As he stood silent in the middle of the room she came over to him and
embraced him gaily and gravely. Her round arms held him firmly to her and he,
seeing her face lifted to him in serious calm and feeling the warm calm rise and
fall of her breast, all but burst into hysterical weeping. Tears of joy and
relief shone in his delighted eyes and his lips parted though they would not speak.</p>
<p> She passed her tinkling hand through his hair, calling him a little rascal.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Give me a kiss &mdash; she said.</p>
<p> His lips would not bend to kiss her. He wanted to be held firmly in her
arms,  to be caressed slowly, slowly, slowly. In her arms he felt that he had
suddenly become strong and fearless and sure of himself. But his lips would not bend to kiss her.</p>
<p> With a sudden movement she bowed his head and joined her lips to his and he
read the meaning of her movements in her frank uplifted eyes. It was too much
for him. He closed his eyes, surrendering himself to her, body and mind,
conscious of nothing in the world but the dark pressure of her softly parting
lips. They pressed upon his brain as upon his lips as though they were the
vehicles<a target="foot" id="fzz0055">&ordm;</a> of a vague speech; and between
them he felt an unknown and timid pressure, darker
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">then</span></span> than the swoon
of sin, softer than sound or odour.</p> </p>  </main>
