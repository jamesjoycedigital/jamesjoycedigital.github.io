<p class="flush">He drained his third cup of watery tea to the dregs and set to
chewing the crusts of fried bread that were scattered near him, staring into the
dark pool of the jar. The yellow dripping had been scooped out like a boghole
and the pool under it brought back to his memory the dark turf-coloured water of
the bath in Clongowes. The box of pawn tickets at his elbow had just been rifled
and he took up idly one after another in his greasy fingers the blue and white
dockets, scrawled and sanded and creased and bearing the name of the pledger as Daly or MacEvoy.</p>
<p class="set">&mdash; 1 Pair Buskins.
<br> 1 D. Coat.
<br> 3 Articles and White.
<br> 1 Man&apos;s Pants.</p>
<p> Then he put them aside and gazed thoughtfully at the lid of the box,
speckled with louse marks, and asked vaguely:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; How much is the clock fast now? &mdash; </p>
<p> His mother straightened the battered alarm clock that was lying on its side
in the middle of the mantelpiece until its dial showed a quarter to twelve and then laid it once more on its side.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; An hour and twenty-five minutes, she said. The right time
now is twenty past ten. The dear knows you might try to be in time for your lectures &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Fill out the place for me to wash, said Stephen &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Katey, fill out the place for Stephen to wash &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Boody, fill out the place for Stephen to wash &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I can&apos;t, I&apos;m going for blue. Fill it out, you, Maggy. &mdash;</p>
<p> When the enamelled basin had been fitted into the well of the sink and the
old washing glove flung on the side of it he allowed his mother to scrub his
neck and root into the folds of his ears and into the
in<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">s</span></span>terstices at the wings of his nose.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, it&apos;s a poor case, she said, when a University
 student is so dirty that his mother has to wash him &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But it gives you pleasure, said Stephen calmly &mdash;</p>
<p> An ear-splitting whistle was heard from upstairs and his mother thrust a damp overall into his hands, saying:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Dry yourself and hurry out for the love of goodness &mdash;</p>
<p> A second shrill whistle, prolonged angrily, brought one of the girls to the foot of the staircase:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, father? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is your lazy bitch of a brother gone out yet? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, father &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Sure? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, father &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Hm! &mdash;</p>
<p> The girl came back, making signs to him to be quick and go out quietly by the back. Stephen laughed and said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He has a curious idea of genders if he thinks a bitch is masculine &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ah, it&apos;s a scandalous  shame for you, Stephen, said
his mother, and you&apos;ll live to rue the day you set your foot in that place.
I know how it has changed you &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Good morning, everybody, said Stephen, smiling and
kissing the tips of his fingers in adieu &mdash;</p>
<p> The lane behind the terrace was waterlogged and as he went down it slowly,
choosing his steps amid heaps of wet rubbish, he heard a mad nun screeching in
the nuns&apos; madhouse beyond the wall:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Jesus! O Jesus! Jesus! &mdash;</p>
<p> He shook the sound out of his ears by an angry toss of his head and hurried
on, stumbling through the mouldering offal, his heart already bitten by an ache
of loathing and bitterness. His father&apos;s whistle, his mother&apos;s
mutterings, the screech of an unseen maniac were to him now so many voices
offending and threatening  to humble the pride of his youth. He drove their
echoes even out of his heart with an execration; but, as he walked down the
avenue and felt the grey morning light falling about him through the dripping
trees and smelt the strange wild smell of the wet leaves and bark, his soul was loosed of her miseries.</p>
<p> The rain-laden trees of the avenue evoked in him, as always, memories of the
girls and women in the plays of Gerhart Hauptmann; and the memory of their pale
sorrows and the fragrance falling from the wet branches mingled in a mood of
quiet joy. His morning walk across the city had begun, and he foreknew that as
he passed the sloblands of Fairview he would think of the cloistral
silver-veined prose of Newman; that as he walked along the North Strand Road,
glancing idly at the windows of the provision shops, he would recall the dark
humour of Guido Cavalcanti and smile, that as he went by Baird&apos;s
stonecutting works in  Talbot Place the spirit of Ibsen would blow through him
like a keen wind, a spirit of wayward boyish beauty; and that passing a grimy
marine dealer&apos;s shop beyond the Liffey he would repeat the song by Ben Jonson which begins:</p>
<p class="set"><u>I was not wearier where I lay</u></p>
<p> His mind, when wearied of its search for the essence of beauty amid the
spectral words of Aristotle or Aquinas turned often for its pleasure to the
dainty songs of the Elizabethans. His mind, in the vesture of a doubting monk,
stood often in shadow under the windows of that age, to hear the grave and
mocking music of the lutenists or the frank laughter of waist-coateers until a
laugh too low, a phrase, tarnished by time, of chambering and false honour stung
his monkish pride and drove him on from his lurking-place.</p>
<p> The lore which he was believed to pass his days brooding upon so that it had
rapt him from the companionship of youth was only a garner of slender sentences
from Aristotle&apos;s Poetics and Psychology and a Synopsis Philosophiae
Scholasticae ad mentem divi Thomae. His thinking was a dusk of doubt and
self-mistrust, lit up at moments by the lightnings of intuition, but lightnings
of so clear a splendour that in those moments the world perished about his feet
as if it had been fire-consumed; and thereafter his tongue grew heavy and he met
the eyes of others with unanswering eyes, for he felt that the spirit of beauty
had folded him round like a mantle and that in revery at least he had been
acquainted with nobility. But when this brief pride of silence upheld him no
longer he was glad to find himself still in the midst of common lives, passing
on his way amid the squalor and noise and sloth of the city fearlessly and with a light heart.</p>
<p> Near the hoardings on the canal he met the consumptive man with the
doll&apos;s face and the brimless hat coming towards him down the slope of the
bridge with little steps, tightly buttoned into his chocolate overcoat, and
holding his furled umbrella a span or two from him like a divining rod. It must
be eleven, he thought, and peered into a dairy to see  the time. The clock in
the dairy told him that it was five minutes to five but, as he turned away, he
heard a clock somewhere near him, but unseen, beating eleven strokes in swift
precision. He laughed as he heard it for it made him think of McCann; and he saw
him a squat figure in a shooting jacket and breeches and with a fair goatee,
standing in the wind at Hopkins&apos; corner, and heard him say:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Dedalus, you&apos;re an antisocial being, wrapped up in
yourself. I&apos;m not. I&apos;m a democrat and I&apos;ll work and act for
social liberty and equality among all classes and sexes in the United States of the Europe of the future &mdash;</p>
<p> Eleven! Then he was late for that lecture too. What day of the week was it?
He stopped at a newsagent&apos;s to read the headline of a placard. Thursday.
Ten to eleven, English; eleven to twelve, French; twelve to one, physics. He
fancied to himself the English lecture and felt, even at that distance, restless
and helpless. He saw the heads of his classmates meekly bent as they wrote in
their notebooks the points they were bidden to note,  nominal definitions,
essential definitions and examples or dates of birth or death, chief works, a
favourable and an unfavourable criticism side by side. His own head was unbent
for his thoughts wandered abroad and whether he looked around the little class
of students or out of the window across the desolate gardens of the green an
odour assailed him of cheerless cellar-damp and decay. Another head than his,
right before him in the first benches, was poised squarely above its bending
fellows like the head of a priest appealing without humility to the tabernacle
for the humble worshippers about him. Why was it that when he thought of Cranly
he could never raise before his mind the entire image of his body but only the
image of the head and face? Even now against the grey curtain of the morning he
saw it before him like the phantom of a dream, the face of a severed head or
death-mask, crowned on the brows by its stiff black upright hair as by an iron
crown. It was a priestlike  face, priestlike in its pallor, in the wide winged
nose, in the shadowings below the eyes and along the jaws, priest-like in the
lips that were long and bloodless and faintly smiling; and Stephen, remembering
swiftly how he had told Cranly of all the tumults and unrest and longings in his
soul, day after day and night by night, only to be answered by his friend&apos;s
listening silence, would have told himself that it was the face of
<a name="jn2001b" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2001b">a guilty priest who
heard confessions</a><a target="foot" id="fzz0096">&ordm;</a>
<a name="jn2001b" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2001b">he had not power to
absolve</a> but that he felt again in memory the gaze of its dark womanish eyes.</p>
<p> Through this image he had a glimpse of a strange dark cavern of speculation
but at once turned away from it, feeling that it was not yet the hour to enter
it. But the nightshade of his friend&apos;s listlessness seemed to be diffusing
in the air around him a tenuous and deadly exhalation and He found himself
glancing from one casual word to another on his right or left in stolid wonder
that they had been so silently emptied of instantaneous sense until every mean
shop legend bound his mind like the words of a spell and his soul shrivelled up
sighing with age as he walked on in a lane among heaps of dead language. His own
consciousness of language was ebbing from his brain and trickling into the very
words themselves which set to band and disband themselves in wayward rhythms:</p>
<p class="set"><u>The ivy whines upon the wall
<br> And whines and twines upon the wall
<br> The yellow ivy upon the wall
<br> Ivy, ivy up the wall.</u></p>
<p> Did anyone ever hear such drivel? Lord Almighty! Who ever heard of ivy
whining on a wall? Yellow ivy; that was all right. Yellow ivory also. And what about ivory ivy?</p>
<p> The word now shone in his brain, clearer and brighter than any ivory sawn
from the mottled tusks of elephants. <u>Ivory, ivoire, avorio, ebur</u>. One of
the first examples that he had learnt in Latin  had run:
<a name="jn2022c" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2022c"><u>India mittit
ebur</u></a>; and he recalled the shrewd northern face of
<a name="jn2022b" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2022b">the rector who had
taught him to construe the Metamorphoses of Ovid in a courtly English, made
whimsical by the mention of porkers and potsherds and chines of bacon</a>.
<a name="jn2030c" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2030c">He had learnt what
little he knew of the laws of Latin verse from a ragged book written by a Portuguese priest</a>.</p>
<p> <u>Contrahit orator, variant in carmine vates</u>.</p>
<p> The crises and victories and secessions in Roman history were handed on to
him in the trite words
<a name="jn2022c" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2022c"><u>in tanto
discrimine</u></a> and he had tried to peer into the social life of the city of
cities through the words
<a name="jn2022c" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2022c"><u>implere ollam
denariorum</u></a> which the rector had rendered sonorously as the filling of a
pot with denaries. The pages of  his timeworn Horace never felt cold to the
touch even when his own fingers were cold; they were human pages and fifty years
before they had been turned by the human fingers of John Duncan Inverarity and
by his brother, William Malcolm Inverarity. Yes, those were noble names on the
dusky flyleaf and, even for so poor a Latinist as he, the dusky verses were as
fragrant as though they had lain all those years in myrtle and lavender and
vervain; but yet it wounded him to think that he would never be but a shy guest
at the feast of the world&apos;s culture and that the
<a name="jn2030d" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2030d">monkish learning, in
terms of which he was striving to forge out an esthetic philosophy, was held no
higher by the age he lived in than the subtle and curious jargons of heraldry and falconry</a>.</p>
<p> The grey block of Trinity on his left, set heavily in the city&apos;s
ignorance like a dull stone set in a cumbrous ring, pulled his mind downward and
while he was striving this way and that to free his feet from the fetters of the
reformed conscience he came upon the droll statue of the national poet of Ireland.</p>
<p> He looked at it without anger; for, though sloth of the body and of the soul
crept over it like unseen vermin, over the shuffling feet and up the folds of
the cloak and around the servile head, it seemed humbly conscious of its
indignity. It was a Firbolg in the borrowed cloak of a Milesian; and he thought
of his friend <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Madd</span></span>
Davin, the peasant student. It was a jesting name between them, but the young peasant bore with it lightly:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Go on, Stevie, I have a hard head, you tell me. Call me what you will &mdash; </p>
<p> The homely version of his Christian name on the lips of his friend had
touched Stephen pleasantly when first heard for he was as formal in speech with
others as they were with him. Often, as he sat in Davin&apos;s rooms in Grantham
Street, wondering at his friend&apos;s well made boots that flanked the wall
pair by pair and repeating for his friend&apos;s simple ear the verses and
cadences of others which were the veils of his own longing and dejection, the
rude Firbolg mind of his listener had drawn his mind towards it and flung it
back again, drawing it by a quiet inbred courtesy of attention or by a quaint
turn of old English speech or by the force of its delight in rude bodily skill
(for <a name="jn2004c" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2004c">Davin had sat at
the feet of Michael Cusack, the Gael</a> repelling swiftly and suddenly by a
grossness of intelligence or by a bluntness of feeling  or by a dull
<a name="jn2004b" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2004b">stare of terror in the
eyes</a>, the terror of soul of a starving Irish village in which the curfew was still a nightly fear.</p>
<p> Side by side with his memory of the deeds of prowess of his uncle Mat Davin,
the athlete, the young peasant worshipped the sorrowful legend of Ireland. The
gossip of his fellow-students which strove to render the flat life of the
college significant at any cost loved to think of him as a young fenian. His
nurse had taught him Irish and shaped the rude imagination by the broken lights
of Irish myth. He stood towards the myth upon which no individual mind had ever
drawn out a line of beauty and to its unwieldy tales that divided against
themselves as they moved down the cycles in the same attitude as towards the
Roman Catholic religion, the attitude of a dullwitted loyal serf. Whatsoever of
thought or of feeling came to him  from England or by way of English culture his
mind stood armed against in obedience to a password; and of the world that lay
beyond England he knew only the foreign legion of France in which he spoke of serving.</p>
<p> Coupling this ambition with the young man&apos;s diffident humour Stephen
had often called him one of the tame geese and there was even a point of
irritation in the name pointed against that very reluctance of speech and deed
in his friend which seemed so often to stand between Stephen&apos;s mind, eager
of speculation, and the hidden ways of Irish life.</p>
<p> One night the young peasant, his spirit stung by the violent or luxurious
language in which Stephen escaped from the cold silence  of intellectual revolt,
had called up before Stephen&apos;s mind a strange vision. The two were walking
slowly towards Davin&apos;s rooms through the dark narrow streets of the poorer jews.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A thing happened to myself, Stevie, last autumn, coming
on winter, and I never told it to a living soul and you are the first person now
I ever told it to. I disremember if it was October or November. It was October
because it was before I came up here to join the matriculation class. &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen had turned his smiling eyes towards his friend&apos;s face,
flattered by his confidence and won over to sympathy by the speaker&apos;s simple accent.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I was away all that day from my own place over in
Buttevant. (I don&apos;t know if you know where that is) at a hurling match
between the Croke&apos;s Own Boys and the Fearless Thurles and by God, Stevie,
that was the hard fight. My first cousin, Fonsy Davin, was stripped to  his buff
that day minding cool for the Limericks but he was up with the forwards half the
time and shouting like mad. I never will forget that day. One of the Crokes made
a woeful wipe at him one time with his caman and I declare to God he was within
an aim&apos;s ace of getting it at the side of his temple. O, honest to God, if
the crook of it caught him that time he was done for &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I am glad he escaped &mdash; Stephen had said with a
laugh &mdash; but surely that&apos;s not the strange thing that happened you? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, I suppose that doesn&apos;t interest you, but
leastways there was such noise after the match that I missed the train home and
I couldn&apos;t get any kind of a yoke to give me a lift for, as luck would have
it, there was a mass meeting that same day over in Castletownroche and all the
cars in the country were there. So there was nothing for it only to stay the
night or to foot it out. Well, I started to walk and on I went and  it was
coming on night when I got into the Ballyhoura Hills, that&apos;s better than
ten miles from Kilmallock and there&apos;s a long lonely road after that. You
wouldn&apos;t see the sign of a Christian house along the road or hear a sound.
It was pitch dark almost. Once or twice I stopped by the way under a bush to
redden my pipe and only for the dew was thick I&apos;d have stretched out there
and slept. At last, after a bend of the road, I spied a little cottage with a
light in the window. I went up and knocked at the door. A voice asked who was
there and I answered I was over at the match in Buttevant and was walking back
and that I&apos;d be thankful for a glass of water. After a while a young woman
opened the door and brought me out a big mug of milk. She was half undressed as
if she was going to bed when I knocked and she had her hair hanging: and I
thought  by her figure and by something in the look of her eyes that she must be
carrying a child. She kept me in talk a long while at the door, and I thought it
strange because her breast and her shoulders were bare. She asked me was I tired
and would I like to stop the night there. She said she was all alone in the
house and that her husband had gone that morning to Queenstown with his sister
to see her off. And all the time she was talking, Stevie, she had her eyes fixed
on my face and she stood so close to me I could hear her breathing. When I
handed her back the mug at last she took my hand to draw me in over the
threshold and said: <u>Come in and stay the night here. You&apos;ve no call to
be frightened. There&apos;s no-one in it but
ourselves</u>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I
didn&apos;t go in, Stevie. I thanked her and went on my way again, all in a
fever. At the first bend of the road I looked back and she was standing in the door &mdash;</p>
<p> The last words of Davin&apos;s story sang in his memory  and the figure of
the woman in the story stood forth reflected in other figures of the peasant
women whom he had seen standing in the doorways at Clane as the college cars
drove by, as a type of her race and of his own, a bat-like soul waking to the
consciousness of itself in darkness and secrecy and loneliness and, through the
eyes and voice and gesture of a woman without guile, calling the stranger to her bed.</p>
<p> A hand was laid on his arm and a young voice cried:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;
<a name="jn2007e" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2007e">Ah, gentleman, your
own girl, sir! The first handsel today, gentleman. Buy that lovely bunch. Will you, gentleman?</a> &mdash;</p>
<p> The blue flowers which she lifted towards him and her young blue eyes seemed
to him at that instant images of guilelessness: and he halted till the image had
vanished and he saw only her ragged dress and damp coarse hair and hoydenish face.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do, gentleman! Don&apos;t forget your own girl, sir! &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I have no money &mdash; said Stephen.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Buy them lovely ones, will you,  sir? Only a penny. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Did you hear what I said? &mdash; asked Stephen, bending
towards her &mdash; I told you I had no money. I tell you again now &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, sure, you will some day, sir, please God &mdash; the girl answered after an instant.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Possibly &mdash; said Stephen &mdash; but I don&apos;t think it likely &mdash;</p>
<p> He left her quickly, fearing that her intimacy might turn to jibing and
wishing to be out of the way before she offered her ware to another, a tourist
from England or a student of Trinity. Grafton Street, along which he walked,
prolonged that moment of discouraged poverty. In the roadway at the head of the
street a slab was set to the memory of Wolfe Tone and he remembered having been
present with his father at its laying. He remembered with bitterness that scene
of tawdry tribute. There were four French delegates in a brake and one, a plump
smiling young man, held, wedged on a stick, a card on which were printed the words: <u>Vivel&apos;Irlande!</u> </p>
<p> But the trees in Stephen&apos;s Green were fragrant of rain and the
rain-sodden earth gave forth its mortal odour, a faint incense rising upward
through the mould from many hearts. The soul of the gallant venal city which his
elders had told him of had shrunk with time to a faint mortal odour rising from
the earth and he knew that in a moment when he entered the sombre college he
would be conscious of a corruption other than that of Buck Egan and Burnchapel Whaley.</p>
<p> It was too late to go upstairs to the French class. He crossed the hall and
took the corridor to the left which led to the physics theatre. The corridor was
dark and silent but not unwatchful. Why did he feel that it was not unwatchful?
Was it because he had heard that in Buck Whaley&apos;s time there was a secret
staircase there? Or was
<a name="jn2030g" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2030g">the jesuit house</a>
<a name="jn2030g" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2030g">extraterritorial</a>
and was he walking among aliens? The Ireland of Tone and of Parnell seemed  to have receded in space.</p>
<p> He opened the door of the theatre and halted in the chilly grey light that
struggled through the dusty windows. A figure was crouching before the large
grate and by its leanness and greyness he knew that it was the dean of studies
lighting the fire. Stephen closed the door quietly and approached the fireplace.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Good morning, sir! Can I help you? &mdash;</p>
<p> The priest looked up quickly and said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; One moment now, Mr Dedalus, and you will see. There is an
art in lighting a fire. We have the liberal arts and we have the useful arts. This is one of the useful arts &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I will try to learn it &mdash; said Stephen.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Not too much coal &mdash; said the dean, working briskly
at his task &mdash; that is one of the secrets.</p>
<p> He produced four candle-butts from the side pockets of his soutane and
placed them deftly among  the coals and twisted papers. Stephen watched him in
silence. Kneeling thus on the flagstone to kindle the fire and busied with the
disposition of his wisps of paper and candle-butts he seemed more than ever a
humble server making ready the place of sacrifice in an empty temple, a
<a name="jn2030e" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2030e">levite of the
Lord</a>. Like a levite&apos;s robe of plain linen the faded worn soutane draped
the kneeling figure of one whom the canonicals or the bell-bordered ephod would
irk and trouble. His very body had waxed old in lowly service of the Lord</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; in tending the fire upon the altar, in bearing tidings
secretly, in waiting upon worldlings, in striking swiftly when bidden &mdash;
and yet had remained ungraced by aught of saintly or of prelatic beauty. Nay,
his very soul had waxed old in that service without growing towards light and
beauty or spreading abroad a sweet odour of her  sanctity &mdash; a mortified
will no more responsive to the thrill of its obedience than was to the thrill of
love or combat his ageing body, spare and sinewy, greyed with a silver-pointed down.</p>
<p> The dean rested back on his hunkers and watched the sticks catch. Stephen, to fill the silence, said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I am sure I could not light a fire &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You are an artist, are you not, Mr Dedalus &mdash; said
the dean, glancing up and blinking his pale eyes &mdash; The object of the
artist is the creation of the beautiful. What the beautiful is is another question &mdash;</p>
<p> He rubbed his hands slowly and drily over the difficulty.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Can you solve that question now? he asked &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Aquinas, answered Stephen, says <u>pulcra sunt quae visa placent</u> &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; This fire before us &mdash; said the dean &mdash; will be
pleasing to the eye. Will it therefore be beautiful? &mdash; </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; In so far as it is apprehended by the sight, which I
suppose means here esthetic intellection, it will be beautiful. But Aquinas also
says <u>Bonum est in quod tendit appetitus</u>. In so far as it satisfies the
animal craving for warmth fire is a good. In hell, however, it is an evil &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Quite so &mdash; said the dean &mdash; you have certainly hit the nail on the head &mdash;</p>
<p> He rose nimbly and went towards the door, set it ajar and said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A draught is said to be a help in these matters &mdash;</p>
<p> As he came back to the hearth, limping slightly but with a brisk step,
Stephen saw the silent soul of a jesuit look out at him from the pale loveless
eyes. Like Ignatius he was lame but in his eyes burned no spark of
Ignatius&apos;s enthusiasm. Even the legendary craft of the company, a craft
subtler and more secret than its fabled books of secret subtle wisdom, had not
fired his soul with the  energy of apostleship. It seemed as if he used the
shifts and lore and cunning of the world, as bidden to do, for the greater glory
of God, without joy in their handling or hatred of that in them which was evil
but turning them, with a firm gesture of obedience back upon themselves and for
all this silent service it seemed as if he loved not at all the master and
little, if at all, the ends he served. <u>Similiter atque senis baculus</u>, he
was, as the founder would have had him, like a staff in an old man&apos;s hand,
to be leaned on in the road at nightfall or in stress of weather, to lie with a
lady&apos;s nosegay on a garden seat, to be raised in menace.</p>
<p> The dean returned to the hearth and began to stroke his chin.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; When may we expect to have something from you on the esthetic question? &mdash; he asked.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; From me! &mdash; said Stephen  in astonishment &mdash; I
stumble on an idea once a fortnight if I am lucky &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; These questions are very profound &mdash; Mr Dedalus,
said the dean &mdash; It is like looking down from the cliffs of Moher into the
depths. Many go down into the depths and never come up. Only the trained diver
can go down into those depths and explore them and come to the surface again &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; If you mean speculation, sir &mdash; said Stephen &mdash;
I also am sure that there is no such thing as free thinking inasmuch as all
thinking must be bound by its own laws &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ha! &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; For my purpose I can work on at present by the light of
one or two ideas of Aristotle and Aquinas &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I see. I quite see your point &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I need them only for my own use and guidance until I have
done something for myself by their light. If the lamp smokes or smells I shall
try to trim it. If it does not give light enough I shall sell it and buy or borrow another &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Epictetus also had a lamp &mdash; said the dean &mdash;
which was  sold for a fancy price after his death. It was the lamp he wrote his
philosophical dissertations by. You know Epictetus? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; An old gentleman &mdash; said Stephen coarsely &mdash;
who said that the soul is very like a bucketful of water &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He tells us in his homely way &mdash; the dean went on,
&mdash; that he put an iron lamp before a statue
of<a target="foot" id="fzz0097">&ordm;</a> of the gods and that a thief stole
the lamp. What did the philosopher do? He reflected that it
was<a target="foot" id="fzz0098">&ordm;</a> the character of a thief to steal
and determined to buy an earthen lamp next day instead of the iron lamp &mdash;</p>
<p> A smell of molten tallow came up from the dean&apos;s candle-butts and fused
itself in Stephen&apos;s consciousness with the jingle of the words, bucket and
lamp and lamp and bucket. The priest&apos;s voice, too, had a hard jingling
tone. Stephen&apos;s mind halted by instinct, checked by the strange tone and
the imagery and by the priest&apos;s face which seemed like an unlit lamp or a
reflector hung  in a false focus. What lay behind it or within it? A dull torpor
of the soul or the dullness of the thundercloud, charged with intellection and capable of the gloom of God?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I meant a different kind of lamp, sir &mdash; said Stephen.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Undoubtedly &mdash; said the dean.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; One difficulty &mdash; said Stephen &mdash; in esthetic
discussion is to know whether words are being used according to the literary
tradition or according to the tradition of the marketplace. I remember a
sentence of Newman&apos;s in which he says of the Blessed Virgin that she was
detained in the full company of the saints. The use of the word in the
marketplace is quite different. <u>I hopw I am not detaining you</u>. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Not in the least &mdash; said the dean politely.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, no &mdash; said Stephen, smiling, I mean&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, yes: I see &mdash; said the dean quickly &mdash; I
quite catch the point: <u>detain</u> &mdash;</p>
<p> He thrust forward his under jaw and uttered a dry short cough. </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; To return to the lamp, &mdash; he said &mdash; the
feeding of it is also a nice problem. You must choose the pure oil and you must
be careful when you pour it in not to overflow it, not to pour in more than the funnel can hold &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What funnel? &mdash; asked Stephen.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The funnel through which you pour the oil into your lamp &mdash;.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That? &mdash; said Stephen &mdash; Is that called a funnel? Is it not a tundish? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What is a tundish? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That. The&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. funnel &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is that called a tundish in Ireland? &mdash; asked the
dean &mdash; I never heard the word in my life &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It is called a tundish in
Drumcondra<a target="foot" id="fzz0099">&ordm;</a> &mdash; said Stephen,
laughing &mdash; where they speak the best English &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A tundish &mdash; said the dean reflectively &mdash; That
is a most interesting word. I must look that word up. Upon my word I must &mdash;</p>
<p> His courtesy of manner rang a little false and  Stephen looked at the
English convert with the same eyes as the elder brother in the parable may have
turned on the prodigal. A humble follower in the wake of clamorous conversions,
a poor Englishman in Ireland, he seemed to have entered on the stage of jesuit
history when that strange play of intrigue and suffering and envy and struggle
and indignity had been all but given through &mdash; a latecomer, a tardy
spirit. From what had he set out? Perhaps he had been born and bred among
serious dissenters, seeing salvation in Jesus only and abhorring the vain pomps
of the establishment. Had
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">t</span></span>he felt the need of
an implicit faith amid the welter of sectarianism and the jargon of its
turbulent schisms, Six Principle Men, Peculiar People, Seed and Snake Baptists,
Supralapsarian Dogmatists? Had he found the true church all of a sudden in
winding up to the end like a reel of cotton some fine-spun  line of reasoning
upon insufflation on the imposition of hands or the procession of the Holy
Ghost? Or had Lord Christ touched him and bidden him follow, like that disciple
who had sat at the receipt of custom, as he sat by the door of some zinc-roofed
chapel, yawning and telling over his church pence?</p>
<p> The dean repeated the word yet again.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Tundish! Well now, that is interesting! &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The question you asked me a moment ago seems to me more
interesting. What is that beauty which the artist struggles to express from
lumps of earth &mdash; said Stephen coldly.</p>
<p> The little word seemed to have turned a rapier point of his sensitiveness
against this courteous and vigilant foe. He felt with a smart of dejection that
the man to whom he was speaking was a countryman of Ben Jonson. He thought:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The language in which we are speaking is his before it is
mine. How different are the words <u>home</u>, <u>Christ</u>,  <u>ale</u>,
<u>master</u>, on his lips and on mine! I cannot speak or write these words
without unrest of spirit. His language, so familiar and so foreign, will always
be for me an acquired speech. I have not made or accepted its words. My voice
holds them at bay. My soul frets in the shadow of his language &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And to distinguish between the beautiful and the sublime
&mdash; the dean added &mdash; to distinguish between moral beauty and material
beauty. And to inquire what kind of beauty is proper to each of the various
arts. These are some interesting points we might take up &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen, disheartened suddenly by the dean&apos;s firm, dry tone, was
silent: and through the silence a distant noise of many boots and confused voices came up the staircase.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; In pursuing these speculations &mdash; said the dean
conclusively &mdash; there is, however, the danger of perishing of inanition.
First you must take your degree. Set that before you as your  first aim. Then,
little by little, you will see your way. I mean in every sense, your way in life
and in thinking. It may be uphill pedalling at first. Take Mr Moonan. He was a
long time before he got to the top. But he got there &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I may not have his talent &mdash; said Stephen quietly.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You never know &mdash; said the dean brightly &mdash; We
never can say what is in us. I most certainly should not be despondent. Per aspera ad astra &mdash;</p>
<p> He left the hearth quickly and went towards the landing to oversee the arrival of the first arts&apos; class.</p>
<p> Leaning against the fireplace Stephen heard him greet briskly and
impartially every Student of the class and could almost see the frank smiles of
the coarser students. A desolating pity began to fall like dew upon his easily
embittered heart for this faithful
<a name="jn2030h" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2030h">serving-man of the
knightly Loyola, for this half-brother of the clergy</a>, more
<a name="jn2030k" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2030k">venal  than they in
speech</a>, more steadfast of soul than they, one whom he would never call his
ghostly father: and he thought how this man and his companions had earned the
name of worldlings at the hands not of the unworldly only but of the worldly
also for having pleaded, during all their history, at the bar of God&apos;s
justice for the souls of the lax and the lukewarm and the prudent.</p>
<p> The entry of the professor was signalled by a few rounds of Kentish fire
from the heavy boots of those students who sat on the highest tier of the gloomy
theatre under the grey cobwebbed windows. The calling of the roll began and the
responses to the names were given out in all tones until the name of Peter Byrne was reached.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Here! &mdash;</p>
<p> A deep bass note in response came from the upper tier, followed by coughs of protest along the other benches.</p>
<p> The professor paused in his reading and  called the next name:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Cranly! &mdash;</p>
<p> No answer</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Mr Cranly! &mdash;</p>
<p> A smile flew across Stephen&apos;s face as he thought of his friend&apos;s studies.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Try Leopardstown! &mdash; said a voice from the bench behind.</p>
<p> Stephen glanced up quickly but Moynihan&apos;s snoutish face, outlined on
the grey light, was impassive. A formula was given out. Amid the rustling of the
notebooks Stephen turned back again and said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Give me some paper for God&apos; sake &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Are you as bad as that? &mdash; asked Moynihan with a broad grin.</p>
<p> He tore a sheet from his scribbler and passed it down, whispering:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; In case of necessity any layman or woman can do it &mdash;</p>
<p> The formula which he wrote obediently on the sheet of paper, the coiling and
uncoiling calculations of the professor, the spectre-like symbols of force and
velocity  fascinated and jaded Stephen&apos;s mind. He had heard some say that
the old professor was an atheist freemason. O the grey dull day! It seemed a
limbo of painless patient consciousness through which souls of mathematicians
might wander, projecting long slender fabrics from plane to plane of ever rarer
and paler twilight, radiating swift eddies to the last verges of a universe ever
vaster, farther and more impalpable.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; So we must distinguish between elliptical and
ellipsoidal. Perhaps some of you gentlemen may be familiar with the works of Mr
W. S. Gilbert. In one of his songs he speaks of the billiard sharp who is condemned to play:</p>
<p class="set"><u>On a cloth</u> <u>untrue</u>
<br> <u>With a twisted cue
<br> And elliptical billiard balls</u></p>
<p class="flush">He means a ball having the form of the ellipsoid of the
principal axes of which I spoke a moment ago. &mdash;</p>
<p> Moynihan leaned down towards Stephen&apos;s ear and murmured: </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What price ellipsoidal balls! chase me, ladies, I&apos;m in the cavalry! &mdash;</p>
<p> His fellow student&apos;s rude humour ran like a gust through the cloister
of Stephen&apos;s mind, shaking into gay life limp priestly vestments that hung
upon the walls, setting them to sway and caper in a sabbath of misrule. The
forms of the community emerged from the gustblown vestments, the dean of
studies, the portly florid bursar with his cap of grey hair, the president, the
little priest with feathery hair who wrote devout verses, the squat peasant form
of the professor of economics, the tall form of the young professor of mental
science discussing on the landing a case of conscience with his class like a
giraffe cropping high leafage among a herd of antelopes, the grave troubled
prefect of the sodality, the plump round-headed professor of Italian with his
rogue&apos;s eyes. They came ambling and stumbling, tumbling and capering,
kilting their gowns for leap frog, holding one another back, shaken with deep
 false laughter, smacking one another behind and laughing at their rude malice,
calling to one another by familiar nicknames, protesting with sudden dignity at
some rough usage, whispering two and two behind their hands.</p>
<p> The professor had gone to the glass cases on the side wall, from a shelf of
which he took down a set of coils, blew away the dust from many points and,
bearing it carefully to the table, held a finger on it while he proceeded with
his lecture. He explained that the wires in modern coils were of a compound
called platinoid lately discovered by F. W. Martino.</p>
<p> He spoke clearly the initials and surname of the discoverer. Moynihan whispered from behind:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Good old Fresh Water Martin! &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ask him &mdash; Stephen whispered back with weary humour
&mdash; if he wants a subject for electrocution. He can have me &mdash;</p>
<p> Moynihan, seeing the professor bend over the coils, rose in his bench and,
clacking noiselessly the  fingers of his right hand, began to call with the voice of a slobbering urchin:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Please, teacher! Please, teacher. This boy is after saying a bad word, teacher.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Platinoid &mdash; the professor said solemnly &mdash; is
preferred to German silver because it has a lower co-efficient of resistance by
changes of temperature. The platinoid wire is insulated and the covering of silk
that insulates it is wound double on the ebonite bobbins just where my finger
is. If it were wound single an extra current would be induced in the coils.
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">&mdash;</span></span> The bobbins
are saturated in hot paraffin wax&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p> A sharp Ulster voice said from the bench below Stephen:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Are we likely to be asked questions on applied science? &mdash;</p>
<p> The professor began to juggle gravely with the terms pure science and
applied science. A heavy-built student, wearing gold spectacles, stared with
some wonder at the questioner. Moynihan murmured from behind in his natural voice: </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Isn&apos;t MacAlister a devil for his pound of flesh?</p>
<p> Stephen looked coldly on the oblong skull beneath him overgrown with tangled
twine-coloured hair. The voice, the accent, the mind of the questioner offended
him and he allowed the offence to carry him towards wilful unkindness, bidding
his mind think that the student&apos;s father would have done better had he sent
his son to Belfast to study and have saved something on the train fare by so doing.</p>
<p> The oblong skull beneath did not turn to meet this shaft of thought and yet
the shaft came back to its bowstring: for he saw in a moment the student&apos;s whey-pale face.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That thought is not mine &mdash; he said to himself
quickly &mdash; It came from the comic Irishman in the bench behind. Patience.
Can you say with certitude by whom the soul of your race  was bartered and its
elect betrayed &mdash; by the questioner or by the mocker? Patience. Remember
Epictetus. It is probably in his character to ask such a question at such a
moment in such a tone and to pronounce the word <u>science</u> as a monosyllable.</p>
<p> The droning voice of the professor continued to wind itself slowly round and
round the coils it spoke of, doubling, trebling, quadrupling its somnolent
energy as the coil multiplied its ohms of resistance.</p>
<p> Moynihan&apos;s voice called from behind in echo to a distant bell:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Closing time, gents! &mdash;</p>
<p> The entrance hall was crowded and loud with talk. On a table near the door
were two photographs in frames and between them a long roll of paper bearing an
irregular tail of signatures. MacCann went briskly to and fro among the
students, talking rapidly, answering rebuffs and leading one after another to
the table. In the inner hall the dean of studies stood talking to a young
professor, stroking his chin gravely and nodding his head.</p>
<p> Stephen, checked by the crowd at the door, halted irresolutely. From under
the wide falling leaf of a soft hat Cranly&apos;s dark eyes were watching him.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Have you signed? &mdash; Stephen asked.</p>
<p> Cranly closed his long thin-lipped mouth, communed with himself an instant and answered:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Ego habeo</u> &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What is it for? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Quod</u>? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What is it for? &mdash;</p>
<p> Cranly turned his pale face to Stephen and said blandly and bitterly:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Per pax universalis</u> &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen pointed to the Tsar&apos;s photograph and said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He has the face of a besotted Christ &mdash;.</p>
<p> The scorn and anger in his voice brought Cranly&apos;s eyes back from a calm survey of the walls of the hall. </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Are you annoyed? &mdash; he asked.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No &mdash; answered Stephen.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Are you in bad humour? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Credo ut vos sanguinarius mendax estis</u> &mdash;
said Cranly &mdash; <u>quia facies vostra monstrat ut vos in damno malo humore estis</u> &mdash;</p>
<p> Moynihan, on his way to the table, said in Stephen&apos;s ear:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; MacCann is in tiptop form. Ready to shed the last drop.
Brand-new world. No stimulants and votes for the bitches &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen smiled at the manner of this confidence and, when Moynihan had
passed, turned again to meet Cranly&apos;s eyes.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Perhaps you can tell me &mdash; he said &mdash; why he
pours his soul so freely into my ear. Can you? &mdash;</p>
<p> A dull scowl appeared on Cranly&apos;s forehead. He stared at the table
where Moynihan had bent to write his name on the
roll<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">:</span></span>; and then said flatly:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <a name="jn2002a" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2002a">A sugar!</a> &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Quis est in malo humore</u> &mdash; said Stephen &mdash; <u>ego aut vos</u>? &mdash;</p>
<p> Cranly did not  take up the taunt. He brooded sourly on his judgment and repeated with the same flat force:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A flaming bloody sugar, that&apos;s what he is! &mdash;</p>
<p> It was his epitaph for all dead friendships and Stephen wondered whether it
would ever be spoken in the same tone over his memory.
<a name="gn1013a" href="../../ff/unbs/gn1all.htm#gn1013a">The heavy lumpish
phrase sank slowly out of hearing like a stone through a quagmire.</a> Stephen
saw it sink as he had seen many another, feeling its heaviness depress his
heart. <a name="jn2001d" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2001d">Cranly&apos;s
speech, unlike that of Davin, had neither rare phrases of Elizabethan English
nor quaintly turned versions of Irish idioms. Its drawl was an echo of the quays
of Dublin given back by a bleak decaying seaport, its energy an echo of the
sacred eloquence of Dublin given back flatly by a Wicklow pulpit.</a></p>
<p> The heavy scowl faded from Cranly&apos;s face as MacCann marched briskly
towards them from the  other side of the hall.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Here you are! &mdash; said MacCann cheerily.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Here I am! &mdash; said Stephen.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Late as usual. Can you not combine the progressive
tendency with a respect for punctuality? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That question is out of order &mdash; said Stephen &mdash; Next business &mdash;</p>
<p> His smiling eyes were fixed on a silver-wrapped tablet of milk chocolate
which peeped out of the propagandist&apos;s breast-pocket. A little ring of
listeners closed round to hear the war of wits. A lean student with olive skin
and lank black hair thrust his face between the two, glancing from one to the
other at each phrase and seeming to try to catch each flying phrase in his open
moist mouth. Cranly took a small grey handball from his pocket and began to
examine it closely, turning it over and over.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Next business? &mdash; said MacCann &mdash; Hom! &mdash;</p>
<p> He gave a loud cough of laughter, smiled broadly and tugged twice at the
straw coloured goatee which hung from his blunt chin.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The next business is to sign  the testimonial.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Will you pay me anything if I sign? &mdash; asked Stephen.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I thought you were an idealist &mdash; said MacCann.</p>
<p> The gipsy-like student looked about him and addressed the onlookers in an indistinct bleating voice.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; By hell, that&apos;s a queer notion. I consider that notion to be a mercenary notion &mdash;</p>
<p> His voice faded into silence. No heed was paid to his words. He turned his
olive face, equine in expression, towards Stephen, inviting him to speak again.</p>
<p> MacCann began to speak with fluent energy of the Czar&apos;s rescript, of
Stead, of general disarmament arbitration in cases of international disputes, of
the signs of the times, of the new humanity and the new gospel of life which
would make it the business of the community to secure as cheaply as possible the
greatest possible happiness of the greatest possible number.</p>
<p> The gipsy student responded to the close of the period by crying:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Three cheers for universal brotherhood! &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Go on, Temple &mdash; said a stout ruddy student near him
&mdash; I&apos;ll stand you a pint after &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I&apos;m a believer in universal brotherhood &mdash; said
Temple, glancing about him out of his dark oval eyes &mdash; Marx is only a bloody cod &mdash;</p>
<p> Cranly gripped his arm tightly to check his tongue, smiling uneasily, and repeated:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Easy, easy, easy! &mdash;</p>
<p> Temple struggled to free his arm but continued, his mouth flecked by a thin foam:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Socialism was founded by an Irishman and the first man in
Europe who preached the freedom of thought was Collins. Two hundred years ago.
He denounced priestcraft. The philosopher of Middlesex. Three cheers for John Anthony Collins! &mdash;</p>
<p> A thin voice from the verge of the ring replied:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Pip! pip!</p>
<p> Moynihan murmured beside Stephen&apos;s ear:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And what about John Anthony&apos;s poor little sister:</p>
<p class="set"><u>Lottie Collins lost her drawers</u></p>
<p class="flush"></p>
<p class="set"><u>Won&apos;t you kindly lend her yours?</u></p>
<p> Stephen laughed and Moynihan, pleased with the result, murmured again:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; We&apos;ll have five bob each way on John Anthony Collins &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I am waiting for your answer &mdash; said MacCann briefly.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The affair doesn&apos;t interest me in the least &mdash;
said Stephen wearily &mdash; You knew that well. Why do you make a scene about it? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Good! &mdash; said MacCann, smacking his lips &mdash; You are a reactionary, then? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do you think you impress me &mdash; Stephen asked &mdash;
when <a name="jn2044b" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2044b">you flourish your wooden sword</a>? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Metaphors! &mdash; said MacCann bluntly &mdash; Come to facts. &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen blushed and turned aside. MacCann stood his ground and said with hostile humour:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Minor poets, I suppose, are above such trivial questions
as the question of universal peace &mdash;</p>
<p> Cranly raised his head and held the handball between the two students by way of a peace-offering, saying:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Pax super totum sanguinarium  globum</u></p>
<p> Stephen, moving away the bystanders, jerked his shoulder angrily in the
direction of the Czar&apos;s image, saying:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Keep your icon. If we must have a Jesus let us have a legitimate Jesus &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; By hell, that&apos;s a good one! &mdash; said the gipsy
student to those about him &mdash; that&apos;s a fine expression. I like that expression immensely &mdash;</p>
<p> He gulped down the spittle in his throat as if he were gulping down the
phrase and, fumbling at the peak of his tweed cap, turned to Stephen, saying:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Excuse me, sir, what do you mean by that expression you uttered just now? &mdash;</p>
<p> Feeling himself jostled by the students near him, he said to them:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I am curious to know now what he meant by that expression &mdash;</p>
<p> He turned again to Stephen and said in a whisper:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do you believe in Jesus? I believe in man. Of course, I
don&apos;t know if you  believe in man. I admire you, sir. I admire the mind of
man independent of all religions. Is that your opinion about the mind of Jesus? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Go on, Temple &mdash; said the stout ruddy student,
returning, as was his wont, to his first idea &mdash; that pint is waiting for you.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He thinks I&apos;m an imbecile &mdash; Temple explained
to Stephen &mdash; because I&apos;m a believer in the power of mind &mdash;</p>
<p> Cranly linked his arms into those of Stephen and his admirer and said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Nos ad manum ballam jocabimus</u>. &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen, in the act of being led away, caught sight of MacCann&apos;s flushed blunt-featured face.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; My signature is of no account &mdash; he said politely
&mdash; You are right to go your own way. Leave me to go mine &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Dedalus &mdash; said MacCann crisply &mdash; I believe
you&apos;re a good fellow but you have yet to learn the dignity of altruism and
the responsibility of the  human individual &mdash;</p>
<p> A voice said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Intellectual crankery is better out of this movement than in it &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen, recognizing the harsh tone of MacAlister&apos;s voice, did not turn
in the direction of the voice. Cranly pushed solemnly through the throng of
students, linking Stephen and Temple like a celebrant attended by his ministers on his way to the altar.</p>
<p> Temple bent eagerly across Cranly&apos;s breast and said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Did you hear MacAlister what he said? That youth is
jealous of you. Did you see that? I bet Cranly didn&apos;t see that. By hell, I saw that at once &mdash;</p>
<p> As they crossed the inner hall, the dean of studies was in the act of
escaping from the student with whom he had been conversing. He stood at the foot
of the  staircase, a foot on the lowest step, his threadbare soutane gathered
about him for the ascent with womanish care, nodding his head often and repeating:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Not a doubt of it, Mr Hackett! Very true! Not a doubt of it! &mdash;</p>
<p> In the middle of the hall the prefect of the college sodality was speaking
earnestly, in a soft querulous voice, with a boarder. As he spoke he wrinkled a
little his freckled brow and bit, between his phrases, at a tiny bone pencil.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I hope the matric men will all come. The first arts men
are pretty sure. Second arts too. We must make sure of the newcomers &mdash;</p>
<p> Temple bent again across Cranly, as they were passing through the doorway, and said in a swift whisper:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do you know that he is  a married man? He was a married
man before they converted him. He has a wife and children somewhere. By hell, I
think that&apos;s the queerest notion I ever heard! Eh? &mdash;</p>
<p> His whisper trailed off into sly cackling laughter. The moment they were
through the doorway Cranly seized him rudely by the neck and shook him, saying:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You flaming floundering fool! I&apos;ll take my dying
bible there isn&apos;t a bigger bloody ape, do you know, than you in the whole flaming bloody world! &mdash;</p>
<p> Temple wriggled in his grip, laughing still with sly content, while Cranly repeated flatly at every rude shake:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A flaming flaring bloody idiot! &mdash;</p>
<p> They crossed the weedy garden together. The president, wrapped in a heavy
loose cloak, was coming towards them along one of the walks, reading  his
office. At the end of the walk he halted before turning and raised his eyes. The
students saluted, Temple fumbling as before at the peak of his cap. They walked
forward in silence. As they neared the alley Stephen could hear the thuds of the
players&apos; hands and the wet smacks of the ball and Davin&apos;s voice crying out excitedly at each stroke.</p>
<p> The three students halted round the box on which Davin sat to follow the
game. Temple, after a few moments, sidled across to Stephen and said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Excuse me, I wanted to ask you, do you believe that
Jean-Jacques Rousseau was a sincere man? &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen laughed outright. Cranly, picking up the broken stave of a cask from
the grass at his feet, turned swiftly and said sternly:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Temple, I declare to the living God if you say another
word, do you know, to anybody on  any subject, I&apos;ll kill you <u>super spottum</u>. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He was like you, I fancy &mdash; said Stephen &mdash; an emotional man &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Blast him, curse him! &mdash; said Cranly broadly &mdash;
Don&apos;t talk to him at all. Sure, you might as well be talking, do you know,
to a flaming chamber-pot as talking to Temple. Go home, Temple. For God&apos; sake, go home &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I don&apos;t care a damn about you, Cranly &mdash;
answered Temple, moving out of reach of the uplifted stave and pointing at
Stephen &mdash; He&apos;s the only man I see in this institution that has an individual mind &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Institution! Individual! &mdash; cried Cranly &mdash; Go
home, blast you, for you&apos;re a hopeless bloody man &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I&apos;m an emotional man &mdash; said Temple &mdash;.
That&apos;s quite rightly expressed. And I&apos;m proud that I&apos;m an emotionalist &mdash;</p>
<p> He sidled out of the alley, smiling slyly. Cranly watched him with a blank expressionless face. </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Look at him! &mdash;
<a name="jn2002g" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2002g">he said &mdash; Did
you ever see such a go-by-the-wall</a>? &mdash;</p>
<p> His phrase was greeted by a strange laugh from a student who lounged against
the wall, his peaked cap down on his eyes.
<a name="jn2003b" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2003b">The laugh, pitched in
a high key and coming from a so muscular frame, seemed like the whinny of an
elephant. The student&apos;s trunk</a><a target="foot" id="fzz0100">&ordm;</a>
<a name="jn2003b" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2003b">shook all over and, to
ease his mirth, he rubbed both his hands delightedly over his groins.</a></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Lynch</a> is awake &mdash; said Cranly.</p>
<p> Lynch, for answer, straightened himself and thrust forward his chest.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Lynch puts out his chest &mdash; said Stephen &mdash; as a criticism of life &mdash;</p>
<p> Lynch smote himself sonorously on the chest and said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Who has anything to say about my girth? &mdash;</p>
<p> Cranly took him at the word and the two began to tussle. When their faces
had flushed with the struggle they  drew apart, panting. Stephen bent down
towards Davin who, intent on the game, had paid no heed to the talk of the others.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And how is my little tame goose? &mdash; he asked &mdash; Did he sign, too? &mdash;</p>
<p> David nodded and said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And you, Stevie? &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen shook his head.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You&apos;re a terrible man, Stevie &mdash; said Davin,
taking the short pipe from his mouth &mdash; always alone.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Now that you have signed the petition for universal
peace<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span> &mdash; said
Stephen &mdash; I suppose you will burn that little copybook I saw in your room &mdash;</p>
<p> As Davin did not answer, Stephen began to quote:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Long pace, fianna! Right incline, fianna! Fianna, by numbers, salute, one, two! &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That&apos;s a different question &mdash; said Davin
&mdash; I&apos;m an Irish nationalist, first and foremost. But that&apos;s you
all out. You&apos;re a born sneerer, Stevie &mdash; </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; When you make the next rebellion with hurley-sticks
&mdash; said Stephen &mdash; and want the indispensable informer, tell me. I can
find you a few in this college &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I can&apos;t understand you &mdash; said Davin &mdash;
One time I hear you talk against English literature. Now you talk against the
Irish informers. What with your name and your ideas&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Are you Irish at all? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Come with me now to the office of arms and I will show
you the tree of my family &mdash; said Stephen.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Then be one of us &mdash; said Davin &mdash; Why
don&apos;t you learn Irish? Why did you drop out of the league class after the first lesson? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You know one reason why &mdash; answered Stephen.</p>
<p> Davin tossed his head and laughed.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, come now &mdash; he said &mdash; Is it on account of
that certain young lady and Father Moran? But that&apos;s all in your own mind,
Stevie. They were only talking and laughing. &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen paused  and laid a friendly hand upon Davin&apos;s shoulder.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do you remember &mdash; he said &mdash; when we knew each
other first? The first morning we met you asked me to show you the way to the
matriculation class, putting a very strong stress on the first syllable. You
remember? Then you used to address the jesuits as Father, you remember? I ask
myself about you: Is he as innocent as his speech? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I&apos;m a simple person &mdash; said Davin &mdash; You
know that. When you told me that night in Harcourt Street those things about
your private life, honest to God, Stevie, I was not able to eat my dinner. I was
quite bad. I was awake a long time that night. Why did you tell me those things?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Thanks &mdash; said Stephen &mdash; You mean I am a monster &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No &mdash; said Davin &mdash; but I wish you had not told me &mdash;</p>
<p> A tide began to surge beneath the calm surface of Stephen&apos;s friendliness</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; This race and this country  and this life produced me
&mdash; he said &mdash; I shall express myself as I am &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Try to be one of us &mdash; repeated Davin &mdash; In
your heart you are an Irishman but your pride is too powerful &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; My ancestors threw off their language and took on another
&mdash; Stephen said &mdash; They allowed a handful of foreigners to subject
them. Do you fancy I am going to pay in my own life and person debts they made? What for? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; For our freedom &mdash; said Davin.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No honourable and sincere man &mdash; said Stephen
&mdash; has given up to you his life and his youth and his affections from the
days of Tone to those of Parnell but you sold him to the enemy or failed him in
need or reviled him and left him for another. And you invite me to be one of
you. I&apos;d see you damned first. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; They died for their ideals, Stevie &mdash; said Davin
&mdash; Our day will come yet, believe me &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen, following his own thought, was silent  for an instant.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The soul is born &mdash; he said vaguely &mdash; first in
those moments I told you of. It has a slow and dark birth, more mysterious than
the birth of the body. When the soul of a man is born in this country there are
nets flung at it to hold it back from flight. You talk to me of nationality,
language, religion. I shall try to fly by those nets &mdash;</p>
<p> Davin knocked the ashes from his pipe.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Too deep for me, Stevie &mdash; he said &mdash; But a
man&apos;s country comes first. Ireland first, Stevie. You can be a poet
or<a target="foot" id="fzz0101">&ordm;</a> mystic after &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do you know what Ireland is? &mdash; asked Stephen with
cold violence &mdash;.
<a name="jn2025d" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2025d">Ireland is the old sow that eats her farrow</a>. &mdash;</p>
<p> Davin rose from his box and went towards the players, shaking his head
sadly. But in a moment his sadness left him and he was hotly disputing with
Cranly and the two players who had finished their game. A match of  four was
arranged, Cranly insisting, however, that his ball should be used. He let it
rebound twice or thrice to his hand and then struck it strongly and swiftly
towards the base of the alley, exclaiming in answer to its thud:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Your soul! &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen stood with Lynch till the score began to rise. Then he plucked him
by the sleeve to come away. Lynch obeyed, saying:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;
<a name="jn1040h" href="../../ff/unbs/jn1all.htm#jn1040h">Let us eke go, as Cranly has it</a> &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen smiled at this side-thrust. They passed back through the garden and
out through the hall where the doddering porter was pinning up a hall notice in
the frame. At the foot of the steps they halted and Stephen took a packet of
cigarettes from his pocket and offered it to his companion.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I know you are poor &mdash; he said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Damn your yellow insolence &mdash; answered Lynch.</p>
<p> This second proof of Lynch&apos;s culture made Stephen smile again. </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It was a great day for European culture &mdash; he said
&mdash; when you made up your mind to swear in yellow &mdash;</p>
<p> They lit their cigarettes and turned to the right. After a pause Stephen began:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Aristotle has not defined pity and terror. I have. I say&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p> Lynch halted and said bluntly:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Stop! I won&apos;t listen! I am sick. I was out last
night on a yellow drunk with Horan and Goggins &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen went on:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Pity is the feeling which arrests the mind in the
presence of whatsoever is grave and constant in human sufferings and unites it
with the human sufferer. Terror is the feeling which arrests the mind in the
presence of whatsoever is grave and constant in human sufferings and unites it with the secret cause &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Repeat &mdash; said Lynch</p>
<p> Stephen repeated the definitions slowly.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A girl got into a hansom a few days ago &mdash; he went
on &mdash; in London. She was  on her way to meet her mother whom she had not
seen for many years. At the corner of a street the shaft of a lorry shivered the
window of the hansom in the shape of a star. A long fine needle of the shivered
glass pierced her heart. She died on the instant. The reporter called it a
tragic death. It is not. It is remote from terror and pity according to the terms of my definitions.</p>
<p> The tragic emotion, in fact, is a face looking two ways, towards terror and
towards pity, both of which are phases of it. You see I use the word
<u>arrest</u>. I mean that the tragic emotion is static. Or rather the dramatic
emotion is. The feelings excited by improper art are kinetic, desire or
loathing. Desire urges us to possess, to go to something, loathing urges us to
abandon, to go from something.
<a name="jn2013c" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2013c">The arts which excite
them, pornographical or didactic, are therefore improper  arts. The esthetic
emotion (I use the general term) is therefore static.</a> The mind is arrested
and raised above desire and loathing &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You say that art must not excite desire &mdash; said
Lynch &mdash; I told you that one day I wrote my name in pencil on the backside
of the Venus of Praxiteles in the Museum. Was that not desire? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I speak of normal natures &mdash; said Stephen &mdash;
You also told me that when you were a boy in that charming Carmelite school you ate pieces of dried cowdung &mdash;</p>
<p> <a name="jn2003b" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2003b">Lynch broke again
into a whinny of laughter and again rubbed both his hands over his groins</a>
but <a name="jn2003c" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2003c">without taking them from his pockets</a>.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, I did! I did! &mdash; he cried.</p>
<p> Stephen turned towards his companion and looked at him for a moment boldly
in the eyes. Lynch, recovering from his laughter, answered his look from his
humbled eyes. <a name="jn2003d" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2003d">The long
slender flattened  skull beneath the long pointed cap brought before
Stephen&apos;s mind the image of a hooded reptile. The eyes, too, were
reptile-like in glint and gaze. Yet at that instant, humbled and alert in their
look, they were lit by one tiny human point, the window of a shrivelled soul, poignant and self-embittered.</a></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; As for that &mdash; Stephen said in polite parenthesis
&mdash; we are all animals. I also am an animal &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You are &mdash; said Lynch.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But we are just now in a mental world &mdash; Stephen
continued &mdash; The desire and loathing excited by improper esthetic means are
really unesthetic emotions not only because they are kinetic in character but
also because they are not more than physical. Our flesh shrinks from what it
dreads and responds to the stimulus of what it desires by
<a name="jn2013c" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2013c">a purely reflex action
of the nervous system</a>. Our eyelid closes before we  are aware that the fly is about to enter our eye.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Not always &mdash; said Lynch critically.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; In the same way &mdash; said Stephen &mdash; your flesh
responded to the stimulus of a naked statue, but it
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">is</span></span> was, I say,
simply a reflex action of the nerves. Beauty expressed by the artist cannot
awaken in us an emotion which is kinetic or a sensation which is purely
physical. It awakens, or ought to awaken, or induces, or ought to induce, an
esthetic stasis, an ideal pity or an ideal terror, a stasis called forth,
prolonged and at last<a target="foot" id="fzz0102">&ordm;</a> by what I call the rhythm of beauty &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What is that exactly? &mdash; asked Lynch.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Rhythm &mdash; said Stephen &mdash; is the first formal
esthetic relation of part to part in any esthetic whole or of an esthetic whole
to its part or parts or of any part to the esthetic whole  of which it is a part.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; If that is rhythm &mdash; said Lynch &mdash; let me hear
what you call beauty: and, please remember, though
<a name="jn2003f" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2003f">I did eat a cake of
cowdung</a> once, that I admire only beauty &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen raised his cap as if in greeting. Then, blushing slightly, he laid
his hand on Lynch&apos;s thick tweed sleeve.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; We are right &mdash; he said &mdash; and the others are
wrong. To speak of these things and to try to understand their nature and,
having understood it, to try slowly and humbly and constantly to express, to
press out again, from the gross earth or what it brings forth, from sound and
shape and colour which are the prison gates of our soul, an image of the beauty
we have come to understand &mdash; that is art &mdash;</p>
<p> They had reached the canal bridge and, turning from their course, went on by
the trees. A crude  grey light, mirrored in the sluggish water and a smell of
wet branches over their heads seemed to war against the course of Stephen&apos;s thought.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But you have not answered my question &mdash; said Lynch
&mdash; What is art? What is the beauty it expresses? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That was the first definition I gave you, you
sleepy-headed wretch &mdash; said Stephen &mdash; when I began to try to think
out the matter for myself. Do you remember the night? Cranly lost his temper and
began to talk about Wicklow bacon &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I remember &mdash; said Lynch &mdash; He told us about
them flaming fat devils of pigs &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Art &mdash; said Stephen &mdash; is the human disposition
of sensible or intelligible matter for an esthetic end. You remember the pigs
and forget that. You are a distressing pair, you and Cranly &mdash;</p>
<p> Lynch made a grimace at the raw grey sky and said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; If I am to listen to your  esthetic philosophy give me at
least another cigarette. I don&apos;t care about it. I don&apos;t even care
about women. Damn you and damn everything. I want a job of five hundred a year. You can&apos;t get me one &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen handed him the packet of cigarettes. Lynch took the last one that remained, saying simply:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Proceed! &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Aquinas &mdash; said Stephen &mdash; says that is
beautiful the apprehension of which pleases &mdash;</p>
<p> Lynch nodded.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I remember that &mdash; he said &mdash; <u>Pulcra sunt quae visa placent</u> &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He uses the word <u>visa</u> &mdash; said Stephen &mdash;
to cover esthetic apprehensions of all kinds, whether through sight or hearing
or through any other avenue of apprehension. This word, though it is vague, is
clear enough to keep away good and evil which excite desire and loathing. It
means certainly a stasis and not a kinesis. How about the true? It produces also
a stasis of the mind. You would not write your name in pencil across the hypotenuse  of a right-angled triangle.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No &mdash; said Lynch &mdash; give me the hypotenuse of the Venus of Praxiteles &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Static therefore &mdash; said Stephen &mdash; Plato, I
believe, said that beauty is the splendour of truth. I don&apos;t think that it
has a meaning but the true and the beautiful are akin. Truth is beheld by the
intellect which is appeased by the most satisfying relations of the
intelligible: beauty is beheld by the imagination which is appeased by the most
satisfying relations of the sensible. The first step in the direction of truth
is to understand the frame and scope of the intellect itself, to comprehend the
act itself of intellection. Aristotle&apos;s entire system of philosophy rests
upon his book of psychology and that, I think, rests on his statement that
<a name="jn1012d" href="../../ff/unbs/jn1all.htm#jn1012d">the same attribute
cannot at the same time and in the same connection belong to and not belong to
the same subject</a>. The first  step in the direction of beauty is to
understand the frame and scope of the imagination, to comprehend the act itself
of esthetic apprehension. Is that clear? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But what is beauty? &mdash; asked Lynch impatiently
&mdash; Out with another definition. Something we see and like! Is that the best you and Aquinas can do? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Let us take woman &mdash; said Stephen.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Let us take her &mdash; said Lynch fervently.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The Greek, the Turk, the Chinese, the Copt, the Hottentot
&mdash; said Stephen &mdash; all admire a different type of female beauty. That
seems to be a maze out of which we cannot escape. I see, however, two ways out.
One is this hypothesis: that every physical quality admired by men in women is
in direct connection with the manifold functions of women for the propagation of
the species. It may be so. The world, it seems, is drearier than even you,
Lynch, imagined. For my part I dislike that way  out. It leads to eugenics
rather than to esthetic. It leads you out of the maze into a new gaudy
lecture-room where MacCann, with one hand on <u>The Origin of Species</u> and
the other hand on the <u>New Testament</u>, tells you that you admired the great
flanks of Venus because you felt that she would bear you burly offspring and
admired her great breasts because you felt that she would give good milk to her children and yours &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Then MacCann is a sulphur-yellow liar &mdash; said Lynch energetically.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; There remains another way out &mdash; said Stephen, laughing.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; To wit? &mdash; said Lynch.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; This hypothesis &mdash; Stephen began.</p>
<p> A long dray laden with old iron came round the corner of Sir Patrick
Dun&apos;s Hospital covering the end of Stephen&apos;s speech with the harsh
roar of jangled and rattling metal. Lynch closed his ears and gave out oath
after oath till the dray had passed. Then  he turned on his heel rudely. Stephen
turned also and waited for a few moments till his companion&apos;s ill-humour had had its vent.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; This hypothesis &mdash; Stephen repeated &mdash; is the
other way out: that, though the same object may not seem beautiful to all
people, all people who admire a beautiful object find in it certain relations
which satisfy and coincide with the stages themselves of all esthetic
apprehension. These relations of the sensible, visible to you through one form
and to me through another, must be therefore the necessary qualities of beauty.
Now, we can return to our old friend Saint Thomas for another pennyworth of wisdom &mdash;</p>
<p> Lynch laughed.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It amuses me vastly &mdash; he said &mdash; to hear you
quoting him time after time like a jolly round friar. Are you laughing in your sleeve? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; MacAlister &mdash; answered Stephen &mdash; would call my
esthetic theory applied Aquinas. So far as this side of esthetic  philosophy
extends, Aquinas will carry me all along the line. When we come to the
phenomenon of artistic conception, artistic gestation, and artistic reproduction
I require a new terminology and a new personal experience &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Of course &mdash; said Lynch &mdash; After all Aquinas,
in spite of his intellect, was exactly a good round friar. But you will tell me
about the new personal experience and new terminology some
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext"><font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">unread</span></font></span></span>
other day. Hurry up and finish the first part &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Who knows? &mdash; said Stephen, smiling &mdash; Perhaps
Aquinas would understand me better than you. He was a poet himself. He wrote a
hymn for Maundy Thursday. It begins with the words <u>Pange lingua gloriosi</u>.
They say it is the highest glory of the hymnal. It is an intricate and soothing
hymn. I like it: but there is no hymn that can be put beside that mournful and
majestic processional song, the <u>Vexilla Regis</u> of Venantius Fortunatus.</p>
<p> Lynch began to sing  softly and solemnly in a deep bass voice:</p>
<p class="set"><u>Imnpleta sunt qu&aelig; concinit
<br> David fideli carmine
<br> Dicendo nationibus
<br> Regnavi<a target="foot" id="fzz0103">&ordm;</a> a ligno Deus</u>.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That&apos;s great! &mdash; he said, well pleased &mdash; Great music! &mdash;</p>
<p> They turned into Lower Mount Street. A few steps from the corner a fat young
man, wearing a silk neckcloth, saluted them and stopped.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Did you hear the results of the exams? &mdash; he asked
&mdash; Griffin was plucked. Halpin and O&apos;Flynn are through the Home Civil.
Moonan got fifth place in the Indian. O&apos;Shaughenessy got fourteenth. The
Irish fellows in Clarke&apos;s gave them a feed last night. They all ate curry &mdash;</p>
<p> His pallid bloated face expressed benevolent
mirth<a target="foot" id="fzz0104">&ordm;</a> and, as he had advanced through
his tidings of success, his small fat-encircled eyes vanished out of sight and
his weak wheezing voice out of hearing.</p>
<p> In reply to a question  of Stephen&apos;s his eyes and his voice came forth again from their lurking-places.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, MacCullagh and I &mdash; he said &mdash; He&apos;s
taking pure mathematics and I&apos;m taking constitutional history. There are
twenty subjects. I&apos;m taking botany too. You know I&apos;m a member of the Field Club &mdash;</p>
<p> He drew back from the other two in a stately fashion and placed a plump
woollen-gloved hand on his breast from which muttered wheezing laughter at once broke forth.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Bring us a few turnips and onions the next time you go
out &mdash; said Stephen drily &mdash; to make a stew &mdash;</p>
<p> The fat student laughed indulgently and said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; We are all highly respectable people in the Field Club.
Last Saturday we went out to Glenmalure, seven of us &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; With women, Donovan? &mdash; said Lynch.</p>
<p> Donovan again laid his hand on his chest and said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Our end is the acquisition of knowledge &mdash; </p>
<p> Then he said quickly:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I hear you are writing some essays about esthetics &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen made a vague gesture of denial.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Goethe and Lessing &mdash; said Donovan &mdash; have
written a lot on that subject, the classical school and the romantic school and
all that. The <u>Laocoon</u> interested me very much when I read it. Of course
it is idealistic, German, ultra-profound &mdash;</p>
<p> Neither of the others spoke. Donovan took leave of them urbanely.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I must go &mdash; he said softly and benevolently &mdash;
I have a strong suspicion, amounting almost to a conviction, that my sister
intended to make pancakes today for the dinner of the Donovan family &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Goodbye &mdash; Stephen said in his wake. Don&apos;t
forget the turnips for me and my mate &mdash;</p>
<p> Lynch gazed after him, his lip curling in slow scorn till his face resembled a devil&apos;s mask:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; To think that that yellow  pancake-eating excrement can
get a good job &mdash; he said at length &mdash; and I have to smoke cheap cigarettes! &mdash;</p>
<p> They turned their faces towards Merrion Square and went for a little in silence.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; To finish what I was saying about beauty, said Stephen,
the most satisfying relations of the sensible must therefore correspond to the
necessary phases of artistic apprehension. Find these and you find the qualities
of universal beauty. Aquinas says: <u>ad pulcritudinem tria requiruntur
integritas, consonantia, claritas</u>. I translate it so: <u>Three things are
needed for beauty, wholeness, harmony and radiance</u>. Do these correspond to
the phases of apprehension? Are you following? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Of course, I am &mdash; said Lynch &mdash; If you think I
have an excrementitious intelligence run after Donovan and ask him to listen to you &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen pointed to a basket which a butcher&apos;s boy had slung inverted on his head. </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Look at that basket &mdash; he said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I see it &mdash; said Lynch &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; In order to see that basket &mdash; said Stephen &mdash;
your mind first of all separates the basket from the rest of the visible
universe which is not the basket. The first phase of apprehension is a bounding
line drawn about the object to be apprehended. An esthetic image is presented to
us either in space or in time. What is audible is presented in time, what is
visible is presented in space. But, temporal or spatial, the esthetic image is
first luminously apprehended as self-bounded and self-contained upon the
immeasurable background of space or time which is not it. You apprehended it as
<u>one</u> thing. You see it as one whole. You apprehend its wholeness. That is <u>integritas</u> &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Bull&apos;s eye! &mdash; said Lynch laughing &mdash; Go on.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Then &mdash; said Stephen &mdash; you  pass from point to
point, led by its formal lines; you apprehend it as balanced part against part
within its limits; you feel the rhythm of its structure. In other words, the
synthesis of immediate perception is followed by the analysis of apprehension.
Having first felt that it is <u>one</u> thing you feel now that it is a
<u>thing</u>. You apprehend it as complex, multiple, divisible, separable, made
up of its parts, the result of its parts and their sum, harmonious. That is <u>consonatia</u>. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Bull&apos;s eye again! &mdash; said Lynch wittily &mdash;
Tell me now what is <u>claritas</u> and you win the cigar &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The connotation of the word &mdash; Stephen said &mdash;
is rather vague. Aquinas uses a term which seems to be inexact. It baffled me
for a long time. It would lead you to believe that he had in mind symbolism or
idealism, the supreme quality of beauty being  a light from some other world,
the idea of which the matter was<a target="foot" id="fzz0105">&ordm;</a> but the
shadow, the reality of which it was<a target="foot" id="fzz0106">&ordm;</a> but
the symbol. I thought he might mean that <u>claritas</u> is the artistic
discovery and representation of the divine purpose in anything or a force of
generalisation which would make the esthetic image a universal one, make it
outshine its proper conditions. But that is literary talk. I understand it so.
When you have apprehended that basket as one thing and have then analysed it
according to its form and apprehended it as a thing you make the only synthesis
which is logically and esthetically permissible. You see that it is that thing
which it is and no other thing. The radiance of which he speaks in the
scholastic <u>quidditas</u>, the <u>whatness</u> of a thing. This supreme
quality is felt by the artist when the  esthetic image is first conceived in his
imagination. The mind in that mysterious instant Shelley likened beautifully to
a fading coal. The instant wherein that supreme quality of beauty, the clear
radiance of the esthetic image, is apprehended luminously by the mind which has
been arrested by its wholeness and fascinated by its harmony is the luminous
silent stasis of esthetic pleasure, a spiritual state very like to that cardiac
condition which the
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext"><font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">unread</span></font></span></span>
Italian physiologist Luigi Galvani, using a phrase almost as beautiful as
Shelley&apos;s, called the
<a name="jn2013b" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2013b">enchantment of the heart</a> &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen paused and, though his companion did not speak, felt that his words
had called up around them a thought-enchanted silence.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What I have said &mdash; he began again &mdash; refers to
beauty in the wider sense of the word, in the sense which the  word has in the
literary tradition. In the marketplace it has another sense. When we speak of
beauty in the second sense of the term our judgement is influenced in the first
place by the art itself and by the form of that art. The image, it is clear,
must be set between the mind or senses of the artist himself and the mind or
senses of others. If you bear this in memory you will see that art necessarily
divides itself into three forms progressing from one to the next. These forms
are: the lyrical form, the form wherein the artist presents his image in
immediate relation to himself; the epical form, the form wherein he presents his
image in mediate relation to himself and to others; the dramatic form, the form
wherein he presents his image in immediate relation to others. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That you told me a few nights ago &mdash; said Lynch
&mdash; and we began the famous  discussion.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I have a book at home, said Stephen, in which I have
written down questions which are more amusing than yours were. In finding the
answers to them I found the theory of esthetic which I am trying to explain.
Here are some questions I set myself: <u>Is a chair finely made tragic or comic?
Is the portrait of Mona Lisa good if I desire to see it? Is the bust of Sir
Philip Crampton lyrical, epical or dramatic. If not, why not?</u> &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Why not, indeed? &mdash; said Lynch laughing.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>If a man hacking in fury at a block of wood</u>
&mdash; Stephen continued, <u>make there an image of a cow, is that image a work
of art? If not, why not?</u> &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That&apos;s a lovely one &mdash; said Lynch laughing
again &mdash; That has the true scholastic stink. &mdash; </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Lessing &mdash; said Stephen &mdash; should not have
taken a group of statues to write of. The art, being inferior, does not present
the forms I spoke of distinguished clearly one from another. Even in literature,
the highest and most spiritual art, the forms are often confused. The lyrical
form is in fact the simplest verbal vesture of an instant of emotion, a
rhythmical cry such as ages ago cheered on the man who pulled at the oar or
dragged stones up a slope. He who utters it is more conscious of the instant of
emotion than of himself as feeling emotion. The simplest epical form is seen
emerging out of lyrical literature when the artist prolongs and broods upon
himself as the centre of an epical event and this form progresses till the
centre of emotional gravity is equidistant from the artist himself and from
others. The narrative is no longer purely personal.  The personality of the
artist passes into the narration itself, flowing round and round the persons and
the action like a vital sea. This progress you will see easily in that old
English ballad <u>Turpin Hero</u> which begins in the first person and ends in
the third person. The dramatic form is reached when the vitality which has
flowed and eddied round each person fills every person with such vital force
that he or she assumes a proper and intangible esthetic life. The personality of
the artist, at first a cry or a cadence or a mood and then a fluid and lambent
narrative, finally refines itself out of existence, impersonalises itself, so to
speak. The esthetic image in the dramatic form is life purified in and
reprojected from the human imagination. The mystery of esthetic like that of
material creation is accomplished. The artist, like the God of creation, remains
within or behind or beyond or  above his handiwork, invisible, refined out of
existence, indifferent, paring his fingernails &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Trying to refine them also out of existence &mdash; said Lynch.</p>
<p> A fine rain began to fall from the high veiled sky and they turned into the
Duke&apos;s lawn, to reach the National Library before the shower came.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What do you mean &mdash; Lynch asked surlily &mdash; by
prating about beauty and the imagination in this miserable Godforsaken island?
No wonder the artist retired within or behind his handiwork after having perpetrated this country &mdash;</p>
<p> The rain fell faster. When they passed through the passage beside the Royal
Irish Academy<a target="foot" id="fzz0107">&ordm;</a> they found many students
sheltering under the arcade of the library. Cranly leaning against a pillar was
picking his teeth with a sharpened match, listening to some  companions. Some
girls stood near the entrance door. Lynch whispered to Stephen:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Your beloved is here &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen took his place silently on the step below the group of students,
heedless of the rain which fell fast, turning his eyes towards her from time to
time. She too stood silently among her companions. She has no priest to flirt
with, he thought with conscious bitterness, remembering how he had seen her
last. Lynch was right. His mind, emptied of theory and courage, lapsed back into a listless peace.</p>
<p> He heard the students talking among themselves. They spoke of two friends
who had passed the final medical examination, of the chances of getting places
on Ocean liners, of poor and rich practices.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That&apos;s all a bubble. An Irish country practice is better &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Hynes was two years in Liverpool and he says the same. A
frightful hole he said it was. Nothing but  midwifery cases.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do you mean to say it is better to have a job here in the
country than in a rich city like that? I know a fellow&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Hynes has no brains. He got through by stewing, pure stewing &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Don&apos;t mind him. There&apos;s plenty of money to be made in a big commercial city &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Depends on the practice &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Ego credo ut vita pauperum est
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">simpleciter</span></span>
simpliciter atrox, simpliciter sanguinarius atrox, in Liverpoolio</u> &mdash;</p>
<p> Their voices reached his ears as if from a distance, in interrupted
pulsation. She was preparing to go away with her companions.</p>
<p> <a name="jn0a18a" href="../../ff/unbs/jn0all.htm#jn0a18a">The quick light
shower had drawn off, tarrying in clusters of diamonds among the shrubs of the
quadrangle where an exhalation was breathed forth by the blackened earth. Their
trim boots prattled as they stood on the steps of the colonnade  talking quietly
and gaily, glancing at the clouds, holding their umbrellas at cunning angles
against the few last raindrops, closing them again, holding their skirts demurely.</a></p>
<p> And if he had judged her harshly? If her life were a simple rosary of hours,
her life simple and strange as a bird&apos;s life, gay in the morning, restless
all day, tired at sundown? Her heart simple and wilful as a bird&apos;s heart?</p>
<p class="center">&starf; &starf; &starf;</p>
<p> Towards dawn he awoke. O what sweet music! His soul was all dewy wet. Over
his limbs in sleep pale cool waves of light had passed. He lay still, as if his
soul lay amid cool waters, conscious of faint sweet music. His mind was waking
slowly to a  tremulous morning
knowledge<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span>, a
morning inspiration. A spirit filled him, pure as the purest water, sweet as
dew, moving as music. But how faintly it was inbreathed, how passionlessly, as
if the seraphim themselves were breathing upon him! His soul was waking slowly,
fearing to awake wholly. It was that windless hour of dawn when madness wakes
and strange plants open to the light and the moth flies forth silently.</p>
<p> <a name="jn2013b" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2013b">An enchantment of
the heart!</a> The night had been enchanted. In a dream or vision he had known
the ecstasy of seraphic life. Was it an instant of enchantment only or long hours and years and ages?</p>
<p> <a name="jn2013e" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2013e">The instant of
inspiration seemed now to be reflected from all sides at once from a multitude
of cloudy circumstances of what had happened or of what might have happened. The
instant flashed forth like a  point of light and now from cloud on cloud of
vague circumstance confused form was veiling softly its afterglow.</a> O! In the
virgin womb of the imagination
<a name="jn2014a" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2014a">the word was made
flesh</a>. Gabriel the seraph had come to the virgin&apos;s chamber. An
afterglow deepened within his spirit, whence the white flame had passed,
deepening to a rose and ardent light. That rose and ardent light was her strange
wilful heart, strange that no man had known or would know, wilful from before
the beginning of the world: and lured by that ardent rose-like glow the choirs
of the seraphim were falling from heaven.</p>
<p class="set"><u>Are you not weary of ardent ways,
<br> Lure of the fallen seraphim?
<br> Tell no more of enchanted days.</u> </p>
<p> The verses passed from his mind to his lips and, murmuring them over, he
felt the rhythmic movement of a villanelle pass through them. The rose-like glow
sent forth its rays of rhyme; ways, days, blaze, praise, raise. Its rays burned
up the world, consumed the hearts of men and angels: the rays from the rose that was her wilful heart.</p>
<p class="set"><u>Your eyes have set man&apos;s heart ablaze
<br> And you have had your will of him.
<br> Are you not weary of ardent ways?</u></p>
<p> And then? The rhythm died away, ceased, began again to move and beat. And
then? Smoke, incense ascending from the altar of the world.</p>
<p class="set"><u>Above the flame the smoke of praise
<br> Goes up from ocean rim to rim
<br> Tell no more of enchanted days</u></p>
<p> Smoke went up from the whole earth, from the vapoury oceans, smoke of her
praise. The earth was  like a swinging, swaying smoking censer, a ball of
incense, an ellipsoidal fall. The rhythm died out at once; the cry of his heart
was broken. His lips began to murmur the first verses over and over; then went
on stumbling through half verses, stammering and baffled; then stopped. The heart&apos;s cry was broken.</p>
<p> <a name="jn2014b" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2014b">The veiled
windless hour</a> had passed and behind the panes of the naked window the
morning light was gathering. A bell beat faintly very far away. A bird
twittered; two birds, three. The bell and the birds ceased: and the dull white
light spread itself east and west, covering the world, covering the roselight in his heart.</p>
<p> Fearing to lose all, he raised himself suddenly on his elbow to look for
paper and pencil. There was neither on the table;  only the soup-plate he had
eaten the rice from for supper and the candlestick with its tendrils of tallow
and its paper socket, singed by the last flame. He stretched his arm wearily
towards the foot of the bed, groping with his hand in the pockets of the coat
that hung there. His fingers found a pencil and then a cigarette packet. He lay
back and, tearing open the packet, placed the last cigarette on the window ledge
and began to write out the stanzas of the villanelle in small neat letters on the rough cardboard surface.</p>
<p> Having written them out he lay back on the lumpy pillow, murmuring them
again. The lumps of knotted flock under his head reminded him of the lumps of
knotted horsehair in the sofa of her parlour on which he used to sit, smiling
 or serious, asking himself why he had come, displeased with her and with
himself, confounded by the print of the Sacred Heart above the untenanted
sideboard. He saw her approach him in a lull of the talk and beg him to sing one
of his curious songs. Then he saw himself sitting at the old piano, striking
chords softly from its speckled keys and singing, amid the talk which had risen
again in the room, to her who leaned beside the mantelpiece a dainty song of the
Elizabethans, a sad and sweet loth to depart, the victory chant of Agincourt,
the happy air of Greensleeves. While he sang and she listened, or feigned to
listen, his heart was at rest but when the quaint old songs had ended and he
heard again the voices in the room he remembered his own sarcasm: the house
where young men are called by their christian names a little too soon.</p>
<p> At certain instants  her eyes seemed about to trust him but he had waited in
vain. <a name="jn0a07a" href="../../ff/unbs/jn0all.htm#jn0a07a">She passed now
dancing lightly across his memory as she had been that night at the carnival
ball. Her white dress a little lifted, a white spray nodding in her hair, she
danced lightly in the round. She was dancing towards him and, as she came, her
eyes were a little averted and a faint glow was on her cheek. At the pause in
the chain of hands her hand had lain in his an instant, a soft merchandise.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You are a great stranger now &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes. I was born to be a monk &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I am afraid you are a heretic &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Are you much afraid? &mdash;</p>
<p> For answer she had danced away from<a target="foot" id="fzz0108">&ordm;</a>
along the chain of hands, dancing lightly and discreetly, giving herself to
none. The white spray nodded to her dancing and when she was in shadow the glow was deeper on her cheek.</a></p>
<p> A monk! His own image started forth  a profaner of the cloister, a heretic
Franciscan, willing and willing not to serve, spinning like Gherardino da Borgo
San Donnino, a lithe web of sophistry and whispering in her ear.</p>
<p> No, it was not his image. It was the image of the young priest in whose
company he had seen her last, looking at him out of dove&apos;s eyes, toying
with the pages of her Irish phrase-book.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, yes, the ladies are coming round to us. I can see it
every day. The ladies are with us. The best helpers the language has &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And the church, Father Moran? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The church too. Coming round too. The work is going ahead
there too. Don&apos;t fret about the church. &mdash;</p>
<p> Bah! he had done well to leave the room in disdain. He had done well not to
salute her on the steps of the library. He had
done<a target="foot" id="fzz0109">&ordm;</a> leave her to flirt  with her
priest, to toy with a church which was the scullery-maid of christendom.</p>
<p> Rude brutal anger routed the last lingering instant of ecstasy from his
soul. It broke up violently her fair image and flung the fragments on all sides.
On all sides distorted reflections of her image started from his memory:
<a name="jn2007e" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2007e">the flowergirl in the
ragged dress with damp coarse hair and a hoyden&apos;s face who had called
herself his own girl and begged his handsel</a>, the kitchengirl in the next
house who sang over the clatter of her plates, with the drawl of a country
singer, the first bars of <u>By Killarney&apos;s Lakes and Fells</u>,
<a name="jn2007c" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2007c">a girl who had laughed
gaily to see him stumble</a> when
<a name="jn2007f" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2007f">the iron grating in
the footpath near Cork Hill had caught the broken sole of his shoe</a>, a girl
he had  glanced at, attracted by her small ripe mouth, as she passed out of
Jacob&apos;s Biscuit Factory, who had cried to him over her shoulder:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do you like what you
saw<a target="foot" id="fzz0110">&ordm;</a> of me,
<a name="jn2009h" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2009h">straight hair and curly eyebrows</a>? &mdash;</p>
<p> And yet he felt that, however he might revile and mock her image, his anger
was also a form of homage. He had left the classroom in disdain that was not
wholly sincere, feeling that perhaps the secret of her race lay behind those
dark eyes upon which her long lashes flung a quick shadow. He had told himself
bitterly as he walked through the streets that she was a figure of the womanhood
of her country, a bat-like soul waking to the consciousness of itself in
darkness and secrecy and loneliness, tarrying a while, loveless and sinless,
with her mild lover and leaving him to whisper of innocent transgressions  in
the latticed ear of a priest. His anger against her found vent in coarse railing
at her paramour, whose name and voice and features offended his baffled pride: a
priested peasant, with a brother a policeman in Dublin and a brother a potboy in
Athenry<a target="foot" id="fzz0111">&ordm;</a>. To him she would unveil her
soul&apos;s shy nakedness, to one who was but schooled
to<a target="foot" id="fzz0112">&ordm;</a> the discharging of a formal rite
rather than to him, a priest of the eternal imagination, transmuting the daily
bread of experience into the radiant body of ever-living life.</p>
<p> The radiant image of the eucharist united again in an instant his bitter and
despairing thoughts, their cries arising unbroken in a hymn of thanksgiving.</p>
<p class="set"><u>Our broken cries and mournful lays
<br> Rise in one eucharistic hymn
<br> Are you not weary of ardent ways?</p>
<p class="set">While sacrificing hands upraise
<br> The chalice flowing to the brim
<br> Tell no more of enchanted days.</u></p>
<p> He spoke the verses  aloud from the first lines till the music and rhythm
suffused his mind, turning it to quiet indulgence; then copied them painfully to
feel them the better by seeing them; then lay back on his bolster.</p>
<p> The full morning light had come. No sound was to be heard: but he knew that
all around him life was about to awaken in common
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">v</span></span> noises, hoarse
voices, sleepy prayers. Shrinking from that life he turned towards the wall,
making a cowl of the blanket and staring at the great overblown scarlet flowers
of the tattered wallpaper. He tried to warm his perishing joy in their scarlet
glow, imagining a roseway from where he lay upwards to heaven all strewn with
scarlet flowers. Weary! Weary! He too was weary of ardent ways.</p>
<p> A gradual warmth, a languorous weariness passed over him descending along
his spine from his closely cowled head. He felt it descend and, seeing himself
as he lay, smiled. Soon he would sleep. </p>
<p> He had written verses for her again after ten years. Ten years before she
had worn her shawl cowlwise about her head, sending sprays of her warm breath
into the night air, tapping her foot upon the glassy road. It was the last tram;
the lank brown horses knew it and shook their bells to the clear night in
admonition. The conductor talked with the driver, both nodding often in the
green light of the lamp. They stood on the steps of the tram, he on the upper,
she on the lower. She came up to his step many times between their phrases and
went down again and once or twice remained beside him forgetting to go down and then went down. Let be! Let be!</p>
<p> Ten years from that wisdom of children to his folly. If he sent her the
verses? They would be read out at breakfast amid the tapping of egg-shells.
Folly indeed! Her brothers would laugh and try to wrest the page from each other
with their strong hard fingers. The suave priest,  her uncle, seated in his
armchair, would hold the page at arm&apos;s length, read it smiling and approve of the literary form.</p>
<p> No, no: that was folly. Even if he sent her the verses she would not show them to others. No, no: she could not.</p>
<p> He began to feel that he had wronged her. A sense of her innocence moved him
almost to pity her, <a name="jn2008c" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2008c">an
innocence he had never understood till he had come to the knowledge of it
through sin</a>, an innocence which she too had not understood while she was
innocent or before the strange humiliation of her nature had first come upon
her. Then first her soul had begun to live as his soul had when he had first
sinned: and <a name="jn2008d" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2008d">a tender
compassion filled his heart as he remembered her frail pallor and  her eyes,
humbled and saddened by the dark shame of womanhood.</a></p>
<p> While his soul had passed from ecstasy to languor where had she been? Might
it be, in the mysterious ways of spiritual life, that her soul at those same
moments had been conscious of his homage? It might be.</p>
<p> A glow of desire kindled again his soul and fired and fulfilled all his
body. Conscious of his desire she was waking from odorous sleep, the temptress
of his villanelle. Her eyes, dark and with a look of languor, were opening to
his eyes. Her nakedness yielded to him, radiant, warm, odorous and
lavish-limbed, enfolded him like a shining cloud, enfolded him like water with a
liquid life: and like a cloud of vapour or like waters circumfluent in space the
liquid letters of speech, symbols of  the element of mystery, flowed forth over his brain.</p>

<p class="center">&starf; &starf; &starf; </p>
<p> What birds were they?</p>
<p> He stood on the steps of the library to look at them, leaning wearily on his
ashplant. They flew round and round the jutting shoulder of a house in
Molesworth Street. The air of the late March evening made clear their flight,
their dark quivering bodies flying clearly against the sky as against a limp hung cloth of smoky tenuous blue.</p>
<p> He watched their flight; bird after bird: a dark flash, a swerve, a flutter
of wings. He tried to count them before all their darting quivering bodies
passed: six, ten, eleven: and wondered were they odd or even in number. Twelve,
thirteen: for two came wheeling down from  the upper sky. They were flying high
and low but ever round and round in straight and curving lines and ever flying
from left to right, circling about a temple of air.</p>
<p> He listened to their cries: like the squeak of mice behind the wainscot: a
shrill twofold note. But the notes were long and shrill and whirring, unlike the
cry of vermin, falling a third or a fourth and trilled as the flying beaks clove
the air. Their cry was shrill and clear and fine and falling like threads of
silken light unwound from whirring spools.</p>
<p> The inhuman clamour soothed his ears in which his mother&apos;s sobs and
reproaches murmured  insistently and the dark frail quivering bodies wheeling
and fluttering and swerving round an airy temple of the tenuous sky soothed his
eyes which still saw the image of his mother&apos;s face.</p>
<p> Why was he gazing upwards from the steps of the porch, hearing their shrill
twofold cry, watching their flight? For an augury of good or evil? A phrase of
Cornelius Agrippa flew through his mind and then there flew hither and thither
shapeless thoughts from Swedenborg on the correspondence of birds to things of
the intellect and of how the creatures of the air have their knowledge and know
their times and seasons because they, unlike man, are in the order of their life
and have not perverted that order  by reason.</p>
<p> And for ages men had gazed upward as he was gazing at birds in flight. The
colonnade above him made him think vaguely of an ancient temple and the ashplant
on which he leaned wearily of the curved stick of an augur. A sense of fear of
the unknown moved in the heart of his weariness, a fear of symbols and portents,
of the hawklike man whose name he bore soaring out of his captivity on
osier-woven wings, of Thoth, the god of writers, writing with a reed upon a
tablet and bearing <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">n</span></span>
his<a target="foot" id="fzz0113">&ordm;</a> narrow ibis head the cusped moon.</p>
<p> He smiled as he thought of the god&apos;s image for it made him think of a
bottle-nosed judge in a wig, putting commas into a document which he held at
arm&apos;s length, and he knew that he would not have remembered the god&apos;s
name but that it was like an Irish oath. It was folly. But was it for this folly
that he was about to leave for ever the house of prayer and prudence into which
he had been born and the order of life out of which he had come?</p>
<p> They came back with shrill cries over the jutting shoulder of the house,
flying darkly against the fading air. What birds were they? He thought that they
must be swallows  who had come back from the south. Then he was to go away? for
they were birds ever going and coming, building ever an unlasting home under the
eaves of men&apos;s houses and ever leaving the homes they had built to wander.</p>
<p class="set"><u>Bend down your faces, Oona and Aleel,
<br> I gaze upon them as the swallow gazes
<br> Upon the nest under the eave before
<br> He wander the loud waters</u></p>
<p> A soft liquid joy like the noise of many waters flowed over his memory and
he felt in his heart the soft peace of silent spaces of fading  tenuous sky
above the waters, of oceanic silence, of swallows flying through the seadusk over the flowing waters.</p>
<p> A soft liquid joy flowed through the words where the soft long vowels
hurtled noiselessly<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span>
and fell away, lapping and flowing back and ever shaking the white bells of
their waves in mute chime and mute peal and soft low swooning cry: and he felt
that the augury he had sought in the wheeling darting birds and in the pale
space of sky above him had come forth from his heart like a bird from a turret, quietly and swiftly.</p>
<p> Symbol of departure or of loneliness? The  verses crooned in the ear of his
memory composed slowly before his remembering eyes the scene of the hall on the
night of the opening of the national theatre. He was alone at the side of the
balcony, looking out of jaded eyes at the culture of Dublin in the stalls and at
the tawdry scenecloths and human dolls framed by the garish lamps of the stage.
A burly policeman sweated behind him and seemed at every moment about to act.
The catcalls and hisses and mocking cries ran in rude gusts round the hall from his scattered fellow-students.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A libel on Ireland! &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Made in Germany! &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Blasphemy! &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; We never sold our faith! &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No Irish woman ever did it &mdash; </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; We want no amateur atheists &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; We want no budding buddhists &mdash;</p>
<p> A sudden brief<a target="foot" id="fzz0114">&ordm;</a> hiss fell from the
windows above him and he knew that the electric lamps had been switched on in
the reader&apos;s room. He turned into the pillared hall, now calmly lit, went
up the staircase and passed in through the clicking turnstile.</p>
<p> Cranly was sitting over near the dictionaries. A thick book, opened at the
frontispiece, lay before him on the wooden rest. He leaned back in his chair,
inclining his ear like that of a confessor to the face of the medical student
who was reading to him a problem from the chess page of a journal. Stephen sat
down at his right and the priest at the other side of the table closed his copy
of <u>The Tablet</u> with an angry snap and stood up.</p>
<p> Cranly gazed after him blandly and vaguely. The medical student went on in a softer  voice:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Pawn to king&apos;s fourth &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; We had better go, Dixon &mdash; said Stephen in warning
&mdash; He has gone to complain &mdash;</p>
<p> Dixon folded the journal and rose with dignity, saying:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Our men retired in good order &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; With guns and cattle, added Stephen, pointing to the
titlepage of Cranly&apos;s book on which was
written<a target="foot" id="fzz0115">&ordm;</a> <u>Diseases of the Ox</u>.</p>
<p> As they passed through a lane of the tables Stephen said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Cranly, I want to speak to you &mdash;</p>
<p> Cranly did not answer or turn. He laid his book on the counter and passed
out, his well-shod feet sounding flatly on the floor. On the staircase he paused
and gazing absently at Dixon repeated:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Pawn to king&apos;s bloody fourth &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Put it that way if you like &mdash; Dixon said.</p>
<p> He had a quiet ringless<a target="foot" id="fzz0116">&ordm;</a> voice and
urbane manners and on a finger of his plump clean hand he displayed at moments a signet ring.</p>
<p> As they crossed the hall a man of dwarfish stature came towards them. Under
the dome of his tiny hat his unshaven face began to  smile with pleasure and he
was heard to murmur. The eyes were melancholy as those of a monkey.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Good evening, captain &mdash; said Cranly, halting.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Good evening, gentlemen, said the stubble-grown monkeyish face.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Warm weather for March &mdash; said Cranly &mdash; They
have the windows open upstairs &mdash;</p>
<p> Dixon smiled and turned his ring. The blackish, monkey-puckered face pursed
its human mouth with gentle pleasure and its voice purred:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Delightful weather for March. Simply delightful &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; There are two nice young ladies upstairs, captain,
tired<a target="foot" id="fzz0117">&ordm;</a> waiting &mdash; Dixon said.</p>
<p> Cranly smiled and said kindly:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The captain has only one love: Sir Walter Scott. Isn&apos;t that so, captain? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What are you reading now, captain? &mdash; Dixon asked
&mdash; <u>The Bride of Lammermoor</u>? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I love old Scott &mdash; the flexible lips said &mdash; I
think he writes something lovely. There is no writer can touch sir Walter Scott &mdash; </p>
<p> He moved a thin shrunken brown hand gently in the air in time to his praise
and his thin quick eyelids beat often over his sad eyes.</p>
<p> Sadder to Stephen&apos;s ear was his speech: a genteel accent, low and
moist, marred by errors: and, listening to it, he wondered was the story true
and was the thin blood that flowed in his shrunken frame noble and come of an incestuous love.</p>
<p> The park trees were heavy with rain and rain fell still and ever in the
lake, lying grey like a shield. Old<a target="foot" id="fzz0118">&ordm;</a>
swans flew there and the water and the shore beneath were fouled with their
greenwhite slime. They embraced softly impelled by the grey rainy light, the wet
silent trees, the shield-like witnessing lake, the swans. They embraced without
joy or passion, his arm about his sister&apos;s neck. A grey woollen cloak was
wrapped athwart her from her shoulder to her waist: and her fair head was bent
in willing shame. He had loose redbrown hair and tender shapely strong freckled
hands. Face? There was no face seen. The brother&apos;s face was bent upon her
fair rain-fragrant hair. The hand freckled and strong and shapely and caressing was Davin&apos;s hand. </p>
<p> He frowned angrily upon his thought and on the shrivelled mannikin who had
called it forth. His father&apos;s jibes at the Bantry gang leaped out of his
memory. He held them at a distance and brooded uneasily on his own thought
again. Why were they not Cranly&apos;s hands? Had Davin&apos;s simplicity and innocence stung him more secretly?</p>
<p> He walked on across the hall with Dixon, leaving Cranly to take leave elaborately of the dwarf.</p>
<p> Under the colonnade Temple was standing in the midst of a little group of students. One of them cried:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Dixon, come over till you hear. Temple is in grand form &mdash;</p>
<p> Temple turned on him his dark gipsy eyes.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You&apos;re a hypocrite, O&apos;Keeffe &mdash; he said
&mdash; And Dixon is a smiler. By hell, I think that&apos;s a good literary expression &mdash;</p>
<p> He laughed slyly, looking in Stephen&apos;s face, repeating:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; By hell, I&apos;m delighted with that name. A smiler. &mdash;</p>
<p> A stout student who stood below them on the steps said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Come back to the mistress, Temple. We want to hear about that &mdash; </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He had, faith &mdash; Temple said &mdash; And he was a
married man too. And all the priests used to be dining there. By hell, I think they all had a touch &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; We shall call it riding a hack to spare the hunter &mdash; said Dixon.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Tell us, Temple &mdash; O&apos;Keeffe said &mdash; How
many quarts of porter have you in you? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; All your intellectual soul is in that phrase,
O&apos;Keeffe &mdash; said Temple with open scorn.</p>
<p> He moved with a shambling gait round the group and spoke to Stephen.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Did you know that the Forsters are the kings of Belgium? &mdash; he asked.</p>
<p> Cranly came out through the door of the entrance hall, his hat thrust back
on the nape of his neck and picking his teeth with care.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And here&apos;s the wiseacre &mdash; said Temple &mdash;
Do you know that about the Forsters? &mdash;</p>
<p> He paused for an answer.
<a name="jn2002c" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2002c">Cranly dislodged a
figseed from
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext"><font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">unread</span></font></span></span>
his teeth</a> on the point of his rude toothpick and gazed at it intently.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The Forster family &mdash; Temple said &mdash; is
descended from Baldwin the First, king of Flanders. He was called the  Forester.
Forester and Forster are the same name. A descendant of Baldwin the First,
captain Francis Forster, settled in Ireland and married the daughter of the last
chieftain of Clanbrassil. Then there are the Blake Forsters. That&apos;s a different branch &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; From Baldhead, king of Flanders &mdash; Cranly repeated,
rooting again deliberately at his gleaming uncovered teeth.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Where did you pick up all that history? &mdash; O&apos;Keeffe asked.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I know all the history of your family too &mdash; Temple
said, turning to Stephen. Do you know what Giraldus Cambrensis says about your family? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is he descended from Baldwin too? &mdash; asked a tall consumptive student with dark eyes.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Baldhead &mdash; Cranly
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">s</span></span> repeated, sucking at a crevice in his teeth.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Pernobilus et pervetustra familia</u> &mdash; Temple said to Stephen.</p>
<p> The stout student who stood below them on the steps farted briefly. Dixon
turned towards him, saying in a soft voice:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Did an angel speak? &mdash;</p>
<p> Cranly turned also  and said vehemently but without anger:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Goggins, you&apos;re the flamingest dirty devil I ever met, do you know &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I had it on my mind to say that &mdash; Goggins answered
firmly &mdash; It did no-one any harm, did it? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; We hope &mdash; Dixon said suavely &mdash; that it was
not of the kind known to science as a <u>paulo post futurum</u> &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Didn&apos;t I tell you he was a smiler? &mdash; said
Temple, turning right and left &mdash; Didn&apos;t I give him that name? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You did. We&apos;re not deaf &mdash; said the tall consumptive.</p>
<p> Cranly still frowned at the stout student below him. Then, with a snort of
disgust, he shoved him violently down the steps.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Go away from here &mdash; he said rudely &mdash; Go away,
you stinkpot. And you are a stinkpot. &mdash;</p>
<p> Goggins skipped down on to the gravel and at once returned to his place with
good humour. Temple turned back to Stephen and asked:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do you believe in the  law of heredity?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Are you drunk or what are you or what are you trying to
say? &mdash; asked Cranly, facing round on him with an expression of wonder.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The most profound sentence ever written &mdash; Temple
said with enthusiasm &mdash; is the sentence at the end of the Zoology.
Reproduction is the beginning of death &mdash;</p>
<p> He touched Stephen timidly at the elbow and said eagerly:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do you feel how profound that is because you are a poet? &mdash;</p>
<p> Cranly pointed his long forefinger.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Look at him! &mdash; he said with scorn to the others
&mdash; Look at Ireland&apos;s hope! &mdash;</p>
<p> They laughed at his words and gesture. Temple turned on him bravely, saying:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Cranly, you&apos;re always sneering at me. I can see
that. But I am as good as you are any day. Do you know what I think about you now as compared with myself? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;
<a name="jn2002b" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2002b">My dear man &mdash;
said Cranly</a> urbanely &mdash; you are incapable, do you know, absolutely  incapable of thinking &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But do you know &mdash; Temple went on &mdash; what I
think of you and of myself compared together &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Out with it, Temple! &mdash; the stout student cried from
the steps. Get it out in bits! &mdash;</p>
<p> Temple turned right and left, making sudden feeble gestures as he spoke.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I&apos;m a ballocks &mdash; he said, shaking his head in
despair &mdash; I am and I know I am. And I admit it that I am &mdash;</p>
<p> Dixon patted him lightly on the shoulder and said mildly:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And it does you every credit, Temple &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But he &mdash; Temple said, pointing to Cranly &mdash; he
is a ballocks too like me. Only he doesn&apos;t know it. And that&apos;s the only difference I see &mdash;</p>
<p> A burst of laughter covered his words. But he turned again to Stephen and said with a sudden eagerness:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That word is a most interesting word. That&apos;s the
only English dual number. Did you know? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is it? &mdash; Stephen said vaguely.</p>
<p> He was watching  Cranly&apos;s firm-featured suffering face, lit up now by a
smile of false patience. The gross name had passed over it like foul water
poured over an old stone image, patient of injuries; and, as he watched him, he
saw him raise his hat in salute and uncover the black hair that stood up stiffly
from his forehead like an iron crown.</p>
<p> She passed out from the porch of the library and bowed across Stephen in
reply to Cranly&apos;s greeting. He also? Was there not a slight flush on
Cranly&apos;s cheek? Or had it come forth at Temple&apos;s words? The light had waned. He could not see.</p>
<p> Did that explain his friend&apos;s listless silence, his harsh comments, the
sudden intrusions of rude speech with which he had shattered so often
Stephen&apos;s ardent wayward confessions? Stephen had forgiven freely for he
had found this rudeness also in
himself<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span> toward
himself. And he remembered an evening when he had dismounted from a borrowed
creaking  bicycle <a name="pn1002b" href="../../ff/unbs/pn1all.htm#pn1002b">to
pray to God in a wood near Malahide. He had lifted up his arms and spoken in
ecstasy</a> to the sombre nave of the trees, knowing that he stood on holy
ground and in a holy hour. And when two constabularymen had come into sight
round a bend in the gloomy road, he had broken off his prayer to whistle loudly an air from the last pantomime.</p>
<p> He began to beat the frayed end of his ashplant against the base of a
pillar. Had Cranly not heard him? Yet he could wait. The talk about him ceased
for a moment: and a soft hiss fell again from a window above. But no other sound
was in the air and the swallows whose flight he had followed with idle eyes were sleeping.</p>
<p> She had passed through the dusk. And therefore the air was silent save for
one brief<a target="foot" id="fzz0119">&ordm;</a> hiss that fell. And therefore
 the tongues about him had ceased their babble. Darkness was falling.</p>
<p class="set"><u>Darkness falls from the air</u></p>
<p> A trembling joy, lambent as a faint light, played like a fairy host around
him. But why? Her passage through the darkening air or the verse with its black
vowels and its opening sound, rich and lutelike?</p>
<p> He walked away slowly towards the deeper shadows at the end of the
colonnade, beating the stone softly with his stick to hide his revery from the
students whom he had left: and allowed his mind to summon back to itself the age of Dowland and Byrd and Nash.</p>
<p> <a name="gn1009d" href="../../ff/unbs/gn1all.htm#gn1009d">Eyes, opening from
the darkness of desire, eyes that dimmed the breaking East. What was their
languid</a><a target="foot" id="fzz0120">&ordm;</a>
<a name="gn1009d" href="../../ff/unbs/gn1all.htm#gn1009d">but the softness of
chambering? And what was their shimmer but the shimmer of the scum that mantled
the cesspool of the court of a slobbering Stuart. And he tasted in the language
of memory ambered wines, dying fallings of sweet airs, the proud pavan: and saw
with the eyes of memory kind gentlewomen in Covent Garden wooing from their
balconies with sucking mouths and the pox-fouled wenchers of the taverns and
young wives that, gaily yielding to their ravishers, clipped and clipped again.</a></p>
<p> The images he had summoned gave him no pleasure. They were secret and
inflaming but her image was not entangled by them. That was not the way to think
of her. It was not even the way in which he thought of her. Could his mind then
not trust itself? Old phrases, sweet only with a disinterred sweetness like the
figseeds Cranly rooted out of his gleaming teeth.</p>
<p> It was not thought nor vision though he knew vaguely that her figure was
passing homeward through the city. Vaguely first and then more sharply he smelt
her body. A  conscious unrest seethed in his blood. Yes, it was her body that he
smelt: a wild and languid smell: the tepid limbs over which his music had flowed
desirously and the secret soft linen upon which her flesh distilled odour and a dew.</p>
<p> A louse crawled over the nape of his neck and, putting his thumb and
forefinger deftly beneath his loose collar, he caught it. He rolled its body,
tender yet brittle as a grain of rice, between thumb and finger for an instant
before he let it fall from him and wondered would it live or die. There came to
his mind a curious phrase from Cornelius a Lapide which said that the lice born
of human sweat were not created by God with the other animals on the sixth day.
But the tickling of the skin of his neck made his mind raw and red. The life of
his body, ill clad, ill fed, louse-eaten, made him close his eyelids in a sudden
spasm of despair: and in the darkness he saw the brittle bright  bodies of lice
falling from the air and turning often as they fell. Yes: and it was not
darkness that fell from the air. It was brightness.</p>
<p class="set"><u>Brightness falls from the air</u></p>
<p> He had not even remembered rightly Nash&apos;s line. All the images it had
awakened were false. His mind bred vermin. His thoughts were lice born of the sweat of sloth.</p>
<p> He came back quickly along the colonnade towards the group of students. Well
then let her go and be damned to her! She could love some clean athlete who
washed himself every morning to the waist and had black hair on his chest. Let her.</p>
<p> Cranly had taken another dried fig from the supply in his pocket and was
eating it slowly and noisily. Temple sat on the pediment of a pillar, leaning
back, his cap pulled down on his sleepy eyes. A squat young man came out of the
porch, a leather portfolio tucked under his armpit. He marched towards the group
 striking the flags with the heels of his boots and with the ferule of his heavy
umbrella. Then, raising the umbrella in salute, he said to all:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Good evening, sirs &mdash;</p>
<p> He struck the flags again and tittered, while his head trembled with a
slight nervous movement. The tall consumptive student and Dixon and
O&apos;Keeffe were speaking in Irish and did not answer him. Then, turning to Cranly, he said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Good evening, particularly to you &mdash;</p>
<p> He moved the umbrella in indication and tittered again. Cranly, who was
still chewing the fig, answered with loud movements of his jaws.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Good? Yes. It is a good evening. &mdash;</p>
<p> The squat student looked at him seriously and shook his umbrella gently and reprovingly.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I can see &mdash; he said &mdash; that you are about to make obvious remarks &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Um &mdash; Cranly answered, holding out what remained of
the half chewed fig and  jerking it towards the squat student&apos;s mouth in sign that he should eat.</p>
<p> The squat student did not eat it but, indulging his special humour, said
gravely, still tittering and prodding his phrase with his umbrella:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do you intend that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p> He broke off, pointed bluntly to the munched pulp of the fig and said loudly:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I allude to that &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Um &mdash; Cranly said as before.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do you intend that now &mdash; the squat student said
&mdash; as <u>ipso facto</u> or, let us say, as so to speak? &mdash;</p>
<p> Dixon turned aside from his group, saying:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Goggins was waiting for you, Glynn. He has gone round to
the Adelphi: to look for you and Moynihan. What have you there? &mdash; he
asked, tapping the portfolio under Glynn&apos;s arm.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Examination papers &mdash; Glynn answered &mdash; I give
them monthly examinations to see that they are  profiting by my tuition.</p>
<p> He also tapped the portfolio and coughed gently and smiled.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Tuition! &mdash; said Cranly rudely &mdash; I suppose you
mean the barefooted children that are taught by a bloody ape like you. God help them! &mdash;</p>
<p> He bit off the rest of the fig and flung away the butt.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I suffer little children to come unto me &mdash; Glynn said amiably.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A bloody ape &mdash; Cranly repeated with emphasis
&mdash; and a blasphemous bloody ape! &mdash;</p>
<p> Temple stood up and, pushing past Cranly, addressed Glynn:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That phrase you said now &mdash; he said &mdash; is from
the New Testament about suffer the children to come to me &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Go to sleep again, Temple &mdash; said O&apos;Keeffe.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Very well, then &mdash; Temple continued, still
addressing Glynn &mdash; and if Jesus suffered the children to come why does the
Church send them all to hell if they die  unbaptized? Why is that?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Were you baptized yourself, Temple? &mdash; the consumptive student asked.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But why are they sent to hell if Jesus said they were all
to come? &mdash; Temple said, his eyes searching in Glynn&apos;s eyes.</p>
<p> Glynn coughed and said gently, holding back with difficulty the nervous
titter in his voice and moving his umbrella at every word:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And, as you remark, if it is thus, I ask emphatically whence comes this thusness &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Because the Church is cruel like all old sinners &mdash; Temple said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Are you quite orthodox on that point, Temple? &mdash; Dixon said suavely.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Saint Augustine says that about unbaptized children going
to hell &mdash; Temple answered &mdash; because he was a cruel old sinner too.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I bow to you &mdash; Dixon said &mdash; but I had the
impression that limbo existed for such cases &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Don&apos;t argue with him, Dixon &mdash; Cranly said
brutally &mdash; Don&apos;t talk  to him or look at him. Lead him home with a
sugan the way you&apos;d lead a bleating goat &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Limbo! &mdash; Temple cried &mdash; That&apos;s a fine invention too. Like hell &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But with the unpleasantness left out &mdash; Dixon said.</p>
<p> He turned smiling to the others and said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I think I am voicing the opinions of all present in saying so much &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You are &mdash; Glynn said in a firm tone &mdash; On that point Ireland is united &mdash;</p>
<p> He struck the ferule of his umbrella on the stone floor of the colonnade.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Hell &mdash; Temple said &mdash; I can respect that
invention of the grey spouse of Satan. Hell is Roman, like the walls of the
Romans, strong and ugly. But what is limbo? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Put him back into the perambulator, Cranly &mdash; O&apos;Keeffe called out.</p>
<p> Cranly made a swift step towards Temple,  halted, stamping his foot and crying as if to a fowl:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Hoosh! &mdash;</p>
<p> Temple moved away nimbly.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do you know what limbo is? &mdash; he cried &mdash; Do
you know what we call a notion like that in Roscommon? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Hoosh! Blast you! &mdash; Cranly cried, clapping his hands.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Neither my arse nor my elbow! &mdash; Temple cried out
scornfully &mdash; And that&apos;s what I call limbo. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Give us that stick here &mdash; Cranly said.</p>
<p> He snatched the ashplant roughly from Stephen&apos;s hand and sprang down
the steps: but Temple, hearing him move in pursuit, fled through the dusk like a
wild creature, nimble and fleet-footed. Cranly&apos;s heavy boots were heard
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">in</span></span> loudly charging
across the quadrangle and then returning heavily, foiled and spurning the gravel at each step.</p>
<p> His step was angry  and with an angry abrupt gesture he thrust the stick
back into Stephen&apos;s hand. Stephen felt that his anger had another cause
but, feigning patience, touched his arm slightly and said quietly:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Cranly, I told you I wanted to speak to you. Come away. &mdash;</p>
<p> Cranly looked at him for a few moments and asked:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Now? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, now &mdash; Stephen said &mdash; We can&apos;t speak here. Come away &mdash;</p>
<p> They crossed the quadrangle together without speaking. The birdcall from
Siegfried whistled softly followed them from the steps of the porch. Cranly
turned: and Dixon, who had whistled, called out:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Where are you fellows off to? What about that game, Cranly? &mdash;</p>
<p> They parleyed in shouts across the still air about a game of billiards to be
played in the Adelphi Hotel.  Stephen walked on alone and out into the quiet of
Kildare Street. Opposite Maple&apos;s Hotel he stood to wait, patient again. The
name of the hotel, a colourless polished wood, and its colourless quiet front
stung him like a glance of polite disdain. He stared angrily back at the softly
lit drawingroom of the hotel in which he imagined the sleek lives of the
patricians of Ireland housed in calm. They thought of army commissions and land
agents: peasants greeted them along the roads in the country: they knew the
names of certain French dishes and gave orders to jarvies in high-pitched
provincial voices which pierced through their skintight accents.</p>
<p> How could he hit their conscience or how cast his shadow over the
imagination of their daughters, before their squires begat upon them, that they
might breed a race less ignoble than their own? And under the deepened dusk  he
felt the thoughts and desires of the race to which he belonged flitting like
bats, across the dark country lanes, under trees by the edges of streams and
near the pool-mottled bogs. A woman had waited in the doorway as Davin had
passed by at night and, offering him a cup of milk, had all but wooed him to her
bed: for Davin had the mild eyes of one that could be secret. But him no woman&apos;s eyes had wooed.</p>
<p> His arm was taken in a strong grip and Cranly&apos;s voice said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <a name="jn1040h" href="../../ff/unbs/jn1all.htm#jn1040h">Let us eke go</a> &mdash;</p>
<p> They walked northward<a target="foot" id="fzz0121">&ordm;</a> in silence. Then Cranly said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That blithering idiot, Temple! I swear to Moses, do you
know, that I&apos;ll be the death of that fellow one time &mdash;</p>
<p> But his voice was no longer angry and Stephen wondered was he thinking of her greeting to him under the porch. </p>
<p> They turned to the left and walked on as before. When they had gone on so for some time Stephen said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Cranly, I had an unpleasant quarrel this evening &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; With your people? &mdash; Cranly asked.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; With my mother &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; About religion? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes &mdash; Stephen answered</p>
<p> After a pause Cranly asked:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What age is your mother? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Not old &mdash; Stephen said &mdash; She wishes me to make my easter duty &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And will you? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I will not &mdash; Stephen said</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Why not? &mdash; Cranly said</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I will not serve &mdash; answered Stephen</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That remark was made before &mdash; Cranly said calmly</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It is made behind now &mdash; said Stephen hotly.</p>
<p> Cranly pressed Stephen&apos;s arm, saying:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Go easy,
<a name="jn2002b" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2002b">my dear man</a>.
You&apos;re an excitable bloody man, do you know &mdash;</p>
<p> He laughed nervously as he spoke and, looking up into Stephen&apos;s face with moved and friendly eyes, said: </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do you know that you are an excitable man? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I daresay I am &mdash; said Stephen, laughing also.</p>
<p> Their minds, lately estranged, seemed suddenly to have been drawn closer, one to the other.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do you believe in the eucharist? &mdash; Cranly asked</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I do not &mdash; Stephen said</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do you disbelieve then? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I neither believe in it nor disbelieve in it &mdash; Stephen answered.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Many persons have doubts &mdash; even religious persons.
Yet they overcome them or put them aside &mdash; Cranly said &mdash; Are your
doubts on that point too strong? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I do not wish to overcome them &mdash; Stephen answered.</p>
<p> Cranly, embarrassed for a moment, took another fig from his pocket and was about to eat it when Stephen said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Don&apos;t, please. You cannot discuss this question with
your mouth full of chewed fig &mdash; </p>
<p> Cranly examined the fig by the light of a lamp under which he halted. Then
he smelt it with both nostrils, bit a tiny piece, spat it out and threw the fig
rudely into the gutter. Addressing it as it lay, he said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire! &mdash;</p>
<p> Taking Stephen&apos;s arms, he went on again and said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do you not fear that those words may be spoken to you on the day of Judgement? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What is offered me on the other hand? &mdash; Stephen
asked &mdash; An eternity of bliss in the company of the dean of studies? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Remember &mdash; Cranly said &mdash; that he would be glorified. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ay &mdash; Stephen said somewhat bitterly &mdash; Bright,
agile, impassible and, above all, subtle &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It is a curious thing, do you know &mdash; Cranly said
dispassionately &mdash; how your mind is supersaturated  with the religion in
which you say you disbelieve. Did you believe in it when you were at school? I bet you did &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I did &mdash; Stephen answered</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And were you happier then? &mdash; Cranly asked softly
&mdash; happier than you are now, for instance? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Often happy &mdash; Stephen said &mdash; and often unhappy. I was someone else then &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; How someone else? What do you mean by that statement? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I mean &mdash; said Stephen &mdash; that I was not myself
as I am now, as I had to become &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Not as you are now, not as you had to become &mdash;
Cranly repeated &mdash; Let me ask you a question. Do you love your mother? &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen shook his head slowly.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I don&apos;t know what your words mean &mdash; he said simply.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Have you never loved anyone? &mdash; Cranly asked </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do you mean women? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I am not speaking of that &mdash; Cranly said in a colder
tone &mdash; I ask you if you ever felt love towards anyone or anything &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen walked on beside his friend, staring gloomily at the footpath.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I tried to love God &mdash; he said at length &mdash; It
seems now I failed. It is very difficult. I tried to unite my will with the will
of God instant by instant. In that I did not always fail. I could perhaps do
that still&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &mdash;</p>
<p> Cranly cut him short by asking:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Has your mother had a happy life? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; How do I know? &mdash; Stephen said</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; How many children had she? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Nine or ten &mdash; Stephen answered &mdash; Some died &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Was your father.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &mdash; Cranly
interrupted himself for an instant: and then said &mdash; I don&apos;t want to
pry into your family affairs.  But was your father what is called well-to-do? I
mean, when you were growing up &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes &mdash; Stephen said</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What was he? &mdash; Cranly asked after a pause.</p>
<p> Stephen began to enumerate glibly his father&apos;s attributes.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A medical student, an oarsman, a tenor, an amateur actor,
a shouting politician, a small landlord, a small investor, a drinker, a good
fellow, a storyteller, somebody&apos;s secretary, something in a distillery, a
tax-gatherer, a bankrupt, and at present a praiser of his own past &mdash;</p>
<p> Cranly laughed, tightening his grip on Stephen&apos;s arm, and said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The distillery is damn good &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is there anything else you want to know? &mdash; Stephen asked.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Are you in good  circumstances at present? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do I look it? &mdash; Stephen asked bluntly.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; So then &mdash;
<a name="jn2002d" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2002d">Cranly went on
musingly &mdash; you were born in the lap of luxury</a> &mdash;</p>
<p> He used the phrase broadly and loudly as he often used technical
expressions, as if he wished his hearer to understand that they were used by him without conviction.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Your mother must have gone through a good deal of
suffering. &mdash; he said then &mdash; Would you not try to save her from
suffering more even if&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or would you? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; If I could &mdash; Stephen said, that would cost me very little &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Then do so &mdash; Cranly said &mdash; Do as she wishes
you to do. What is it for you? You disbelieve in it. It is a form: nothing else.
And you will set her mind at rest &mdash;</p>
<p> He ceased and, as Stephen did not reply,  remained silent. Then, as if
giving utterance to the process of his own thought, he said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Whatever else is unsure in this stinking dunghill of a
world a mother&apos;s love is not. Your mother brings you into the world,
carries you first in her body. What do we know about what she feels? But
whatever she feels, it, at least, must be real. It must be. What are our ideas
or ambitions? Play. Ideas! Why, that bloody bleating goat Temple has ideas.
MacCann has ideas too. Every jackass going the roads thinks he has ideas &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen, who had been listening to the unspoken speech behind the words, said with assumed carelessness:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Pascal, if I remember rightly, would not suffer his
mother to kiss him as he feared the contact of her sex &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Pascal was a pig &mdash; said Cranly. </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Aloysius Gonzaga, I think, was of the same mind &mdash; Stephen said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And he was another pig then &mdash; said Cranly</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The Church calls him a saint &mdash; Stephen objected.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I don&apos;t care a flaming damn what anyone calls him
&mdash; Cranly said rudely and flatly &mdash; I call him a pig &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen, preparing the words neatly in his mind, continued:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;
<a name="jn2028d" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2028d">Jesus too seems to
have treated his mother with scant courtesy in public but Suarez, a Jesuit
theologian and Spanish gentleman, has apologized for him</a> &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Did the idea ever occur to you &mdash; Cranly asked
&mdash; that Jesus was not what he pretended to be? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The first person to whom that idea occurred &mdash;
Stephen answered &mdash; was Jesus himself &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I mean &mdash; Cranly said, hardening in his speech
&mdash;  did the idea ever occur to you that he was himself a conscious
hypocrite, what he called the jews of his time, a whited sepulchre? Or, to put
it more plainly, that he was a blackguard &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That idea never occurred to me &mdash; Stephen answered
&mdash; But I am curious to know are you trying to make a convert of me or a pervert of yourself &mdash;</p>
<p> He turned towards his friend&apos;s face and saw there a raw smile which
some force of will strove strove<a target="foot" id="fzz0122">&ordm;</a> to make finely significant.</p>
<p> Cranly asked suddenly in a plain sensible tone:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Tell me the truth. Were you at all shocked by what I said? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Somewhat &mdash; Stephen said</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And why were you shocked &mdash; Cranly pressed on in the
same tone &mdash; if you feel sure that our religion is false and that Jesus was not the son of God? &mdash; </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I am not at all sure of it &mdash; Stephen said &mdash;
He is more like a son of God than a son of Mary &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And is that why you will not communicate &mdash; Cranly
asked &mdash; because you are not sure of that too, because you feel that the
host, too, may be the body and blood of the son of God and not a wafer of bread?
And because you fear that it may be? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes &mdash; Stephen said quietly &mdash; I feel that and I also fear it &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I see &mdash; Cranly said.</p>
<p> Stephen, struck by his tone of closure, reopened the discussion at once by saying:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I fear many things. Dogs, horses, firearms, the sea,
thunderstorms, machinery, the country roads at night. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But why do you fear a bit of bread? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I imagine &mdash; Stephen said &mdash; that there is a
malevolent reality behind those things I say I fear. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do you fear then &mdash; Cranly asked &mdash; that the
God of the Roman Catholics  would strike you dead and damn you if you made a sacrilegious communion? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The God of the Roman Catholics could do that now &mdash;
Stephen said &mdash; I fear more than that the chemical action which would be
set up in my soul by a false homage to a symbol behind which are massed twenty
centuries of authority and veneration &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Would you &mdash; Cranly asked &mdash; in extreme danger
commit that particular sacrilege? For instance, if you lived in the penal days &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I cannot answer for the past &mdash; Stephen replied &mdash; Possibly not &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Then &mdash; said Cranly &mdash; you do not intend to become a protestant &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I said that I had lost the faith &mdash; Stephen answered
&mdash; but not that I had lost self-respect. What kind of liberation would that
be to forsake an absurdity which is logical and coherent and to embrace one
which is illogical and incoherent? &mdash;</p>
<p> They had walked on towards the township  of Pembroke and now as they went on
slowly along the avenues the trees and the scattered lights in the villas
soothed their minds. The air of wealth and repose diffused about them seemed to
comfort their neediness. Behind a hedge of laurel a light glimmered in the
window of a kitchen and the voice of a servant was heard singing as she
sharpened knives. She sang, in short broken bars Rosie O&apos;Grady.</p>
<p> Cranly stopped to listen, saying:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Mulier cantat</u>. &mdash;</p>
<p> The soft beauty of the Latin word touched with an enchanting touch the dark
of the evening, with a touch fainter and more persuading than the touch of music
or of a woman&apos;s hand. The strife of their minds was quelled. The figure of
a woman as she appears in the liturgy of the church passed silently through the
darkness: a white-  robed figure, small and slender as a boy, and with a falling
girdle. Her voice, frail and high as a boy&apos;s, was heard intoning from a
distant choir the first words of a woman which pierce the gloom and clamour of the first chanting of the passion:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Et tu cum Jesu Galil&aelig;o eras</u> &mdash;</p>
<p> And all hearts were touched and turned to her voice, shining like a young
star, shining clearer as the voice intoned the proparoxyton and more faintly as the cadence died.</p>
<p> The singing ceased. They went on together, Cranly repeating in strongly stressed rhythm the end of the refrain:</p>
<p class="set"><u>And when we are married,
<br> O, how happy we&apos;ll be
<br> For I love sweet Rosie O&apos;Grady
<br> And Rosie O&apos;Grady loves me.</u></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; There&apos;s real poetry for you &mdash; he said &mdash; There&apos;s real love &mdash; </p>
<p> He glanced sideways at Stephen with a strange smile and said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do you consider that poetry? Or do you know what the words mean? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I want to see Rosie first &mdash; said Stephen.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; She&apos;s easy to find &mdash; Cranly said.</p>
<p> His hat had come down on his forehead. He shoved it back: and in the shadow
of the trees Stephen saw his pale face, framed by the dark, and his large dark
eyes. Yes. His face was handsome and his
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">fr</span></span> body was strong
and hard. He had spoken of a mother&apos;s love. He felt then the sufferings of
women, the weaknesses of their bodies and souls: and would shield them with a
strong and resolute arm and bow his mind to them.</p>
<p> Away then: it is time to go. A voice spoke softly to Stephen&apos;s lonely
heart, bidding him go and telling him that his friendship was coming to an end.
Yes: he would go. He could not strive against another. He knew his part.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Probably I shall go away &mdash; he said. </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Where? &mdash; Cranly asked</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Where I can &mdash; Stephen said</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes &mdash; Cranly said &mdash; It might be difficult for
you to live here now. But is it that makes you go? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I have to go &mdash; Stephen answered</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Because &mdash; Cranly continued &mdash; you need not
look upon yourself as driven away if you do not wish to
go<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span>,<a target="foot" id="fzz0123">&ordm;</a>
or as a heretic or an outlaw. There are many good believers who think as you do.
Would that surprise you? The Church is not the stone building nor even the
clergy and their dogmas. It is the whole mass of those born into it. I
don&apos;t know what you wish to do in life. Is it what you told me the night we
were standing outside Harcourt Street Station? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes &mdash; Stephen said, smiling in spite of himself at
Cranly&apos;s way of remembering thoughts in connection with places &mdash; The
night you spent half an hour wrangling with Doherty about the shortest way from Sallygap to Larras &mdash; </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Pothead! &mdash; Cranly said with calm contempt &mdash;
What does he know about the way from Sallygap to Larras? Or what does he know
about anything for that matter? And the big slobbering washing-pot head of him! &mdash;</p>
<p> He broke into a loud long laugh.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well? &mdash; Stephen said &mdash; Do you remember the rest? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What you said, is it? &mdash; Cranly asked &mdash; Yes, I
remember it. To discover the mode of life or of art whereby your spirit could
express it<a target="foot" id="fzz0124">&ordm;</a> in unfettered freedom &mdash;</p>
<p> Stephen raised his hat in acknowledgement.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Freedom! &mdash; Cranly repeated &mdash; But you are not
free enough yet to commit a sacrilege. Tell me would you rob? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I would beg first &mdash; Stephen said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And if you got nothing would you rob? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You wish me to say &mdash; Stephen answered &mdash; that
the rights of property are provisional and that in certain circumstances it is
not unlawful to rob. Everyone  would act in that belief. So I will not make you
that answer. Apply to the jesuit theologian Juan Mariana de Talavera who will
also explain to you in what circumstances you may lawfully Kill your king and
whether you had better hand him his poison in a goblet or smear it for him upon
his robe or his saddlebow. Ask me rather would I suffer others to rob me or, if
they did, would I call down upon them what I believe is called the chastisement of the secular arm. &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And would you? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I think &mdash; Stephen said &mdash; it would pain me as
much to do so as to be robbed &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I see &mdash; Cranly said.</p>
<p> He produced his match and began to clean the crevice between two teeth. Then he said carelessly:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;
<a name="jn2001e" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2001e">Tell me, for example,
would you deflower a virgin?</a> &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Excuse me &mdash; Stephen said politely &mdash; is that
not the ambition of most young gentlemen? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What then is your point of view? &mdash; Cranly asked. </p>
<p> His last phrase, sour-smelling as the smoke of charcoal and disheartening,
excited Stephen&apos;s brain, over which its fumes seemed to brood.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Look here, Cranly &mdash; he said &mdash; You have asked
me what I would do and what I would not do. I will tell you what I will do and
what I will not do. I will not serve that in which I no longer believe whether
it call itself my home, my fatherland, or my church: and I will try to express
myself in some mode of life or art as freely as I can and as wholly as I can,
using for my defence the only arms I allow myself to use, silence, exile and cunning.</p>
<p> Cranly seized his arm and steered him round so as to
head<a target="foot" id="fzz0125">&ordm;</a> back towards Leeson Park. He
laughed almost slyly and pressed Stephen&apos;s arm with an elder&apos;s affection.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Cunning indeed! &mdash; he said &mdash; Is it you? You poor poet, you! &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And you made me confess  to you &mdash; Stephen said,
thrilled by his touch &mdash; as I have confessed to you so many other things, have I not? &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, my child &mdash; Cranly said, still gaily.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You made me confess the fears that I have. But I will
tell you also what I do not fear. I do not fear to be alone or to be spurned for
another or to leave whatever I have to leave. And I am not afraid to make a
mistake, even a great mistake, a lifelong mistake and perhaps as long as eternity too. &mdash;</p>
<p> Cranly, now grave again, slowed his pace and said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Alone, quite alone. You have no fear of that. And you
know what that words<a target="foot" id="fzz0126">&ordm;</a> means? Not only to
be separate from all others but to have not even one friend &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I will take the risk &mdash; said Stephen.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And not to have any one person &mdash; Cranly said
&mdash;  who would be more than a friend, more even than the noblest and truest friend a man ever had &mdash;</p>
<p> His words seemed to have struck some deep chord in his own nature. Had he
spoken of himself, of himself as he was or wished to be? Stephen watched his
face for some moments in silence. A cold sadness was there. He had spoken of
himself, of his own loneliness which he feared.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Of whom are you speaking? &mdash; Stephen asked at length.</p>
<p> Cranly did not answer.</p>
<p class="center">&starf; &starf; &starf; </p>
<p class="flush"><u>20 March</u>: Long talk with Cranly on the subject of my
revolt. He had his grand manner on. I supple and suave. Attacked me on the score
of love for one&apos;s mother. Tried to imagine his mother: cannot. Told me
once, in a moment of thoughtlessness, his father was sixty-one when he was born.
Can see him. Strong farmer type. Pepper and salt suit. Square feet. Unkempt
grizzled beard. Probably attends coursing-matches. Pays his dues regularly but
not plentifully to Father Dwyer of Larras. Sometimes talks to girls after
nightfall. But his mother? Very young or very old? Hardly the first. If so,
Cranly would not have spoken as he did. Old then. Probably: and neglected. Hence
<a name="jn2002f" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2002f">Cranly&apos;s despair
of soul: the child of exhausted loins</a>.</p>
<p class="flush"><u>21 March, morning</u>: Thought this in bed last night but
was too lazy and free to add to it. Free, yes. The exhausted loins are those of
Elizabeth and Zacchary. Then is he the precursor. Item: he eats chiefly belly
bacon and dried figs. Read locusts and wild honey. Also, when thinking of him,
saw always a stern  severed head or deathmask: as if outlined on a grey curtain
or veronica. Decollation they call it in the fold. Puzzled for the moment by
Saint John at the Latin gate. What do I see? A decollated precursor trying to pick the lock.</p>
<p class="flush"><u>21 March night</u>: Free. Soulfree and fancyfree. Let the
dead bury the dead. Ay. And let the dead marry the dead.</p>
<p class="flush"><u>22 March</u>: In company with Lynch followed a sizeable
hospital nurse. Lynch&apos;s idea. Dislike it. Two lean hungry greyhounds walking after a heifer.</p>
<p class="flush"><u>23 March</u>: Have not seen her since that night. Unwell?
Sits at the fire perhaps with mamma&apos;s shawl on her shoulders. But not
peevish. A nice bowl of gruel? Won&apos;t you now?</p>
<p class="flush"><u>24 March</u>: Began with a discussion with my mother.
Subject: B.V.M. Handicapped by my sex and youth. To escape held up relations
between Jesus and Papa against those between Mary and her son. Said religion is
not a lying-in hospital. Mother indulgent. Said I have a queer mind and have
read too much. Not true. Have read little and understood less. Then she said I
would come back to faith because I had a restless mind. This means  to
<a name="jn2010e" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2010e">leave church by
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">d</span></span> backdoor of sin
and reenter through the skylight of repentance. Cannot repent</a>. Told her so
and asked for sixpence. Got threepence.</p>
<p> Then went to college. Other wrangle with little roundhead rogue&apos;s-eye
Ghezzi. This time about Bruno the Nolan. Began in Italian and ended in pidgin
English. He said Bruno was a terrible heretic. I said he was terribly burned. He
agreed to this with some sorrow. Then gave me recipe for what he calls
<u>risotto alla bergamasca</u>. When he pronounces a soft o he protrudes his
full carnal lips as if he kissed the vowel. Has he? And could he repent? Yes, he
could: and cry two round rogue&apos;s tears, one from each eye.</p>
<p> Crossing Stephen&apos;s, that is, my green remembered that his countrymen
and not mine had invented what Cranly the other night called our religion. A
quartette of them, soldiers of the ninety-seventh infantry regiment, sat at the
foot of the cross and tossed up dice for the overcoat of the crucified.</p>
<p> Went to library. Tried to read three reviews. Useless. She is not out yet.
Am I  alarmed? About what? That she will never be out again. Blake wrote:</p>
<p class="set"><u>I wonder if William Bond will die
<br> For assuredly he is very ill</u>.</p>
<p class="flush">Alas, poor William!</p>
<p> I was once at a diorama in Rotunda. At the end were pictures of big nobs.
Among them William Ewart Gladstone, just then dead. Orchestra played <u>O, Willie, we have missed you</u>.</p>
<p> A race of clodhoppers!</p>
<p class="flush"><u>25 March, morning</u>: A troubled night of dreams. Want to get them off my chest.</p>
<p> <a name="jn0a15a" href="../../ff/unbs/jn0all.htm#jn0a15a">A long curving
gallery. From the floor ascend pillars of dark vapours. It is peopled by the
images of fabulous kings, set in stone. Their hands are folded upon their knees
in token of weariness, and their eyes are darkened for the errors of men go up
before them for ever as dark vapours.</a></p>
<p> Strange figures advance from a cave. They are not as tall as men. One does
not seem to stand quite apart from another. Their faces are phosphorescent, with
darker streaks. They peer at me and their eyes seem to ask me something. They do not speak. </p>
<p class="flush"><u>30 March</u>: This evening Cranly was in the porch of the
library, proposing a problem to Dixon and her brother. A mother let her child
fall into the Nile. Still harping on the mother. A crocodile seized the child.
Mother asked it back. Crocodile said all right if she told him what he was going
to do with the child, eat it or not eat It.</p>
<p> This mentality, Lepidus would say, is indeed bred out of your mud by the operation of your sun.</p>
<p> And mine? Is it not too? Then into Nilemud with it!</p>
<p class="flush"><u>1 April</u>: Disapprove of this last phrase.</p>
<p class="flush"><u>2 April</u>: Saw her drinking tea and eating cakes in
Johnston, Mooney and O&apos;Brien&apos;s. Rather lynx-eyed Lynch saw her as we
passed. He tells me Cranly was invited there by brother. Did he bring his
crocodile? Is he the shining light now? Well, I discovered him. I protest I did.
Shining quietly behind a bushel of Wicklow bran.</p>
<p class="flush"><u>3 April</u>: Met Davin at the cigar shop opposite
Findlater&apos;s Church. He was in a black sweater and had a hurley-stick. Asked
me was it true I was going away and why. Told him
<font color="red"><sup><small>|7</small></sup></font><a name="jn2026f" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2026f">the
shortest  way to Tara was via Holyhead</a>. Just then my father came up.
Introduction. Father, polite and observant. Asked Davin if he might offer him
some refreshment. Davin could not, was going to a meeting. When we came away
father told me he had a good honest eye. Asked me why I did not join a
rowing-club. I pretended to think it over. Told me then how he broke
Pennyfeather&apos;s heart. Wants me to read law. Says I was cut out for that. More mud, more crocodiles.</p>
<p class="flush"><u>5 April</u>: Wild spring. Scudding clouds. O life! Dark
stream of swirling bogwater on which appletrees have cast down their delicate
flowers. Eyes of girls among the leaves. Girls demure and romping. All fair or
auburn: no dark ones. They blush better. Houp-la!</p>
<p class="flush"><u>6 April</u>: Certainly she remembers the past. Lynch says
all women do. Then she remembers the time of her childhood &mdash; and mine if I
was ever a child. The past is consumed in the present and the present is living
only because it brings forth the future. Statues of women, if Lynch be right,
should always be fully draped, one hand of the woman feeling regretfully her own hinder parts.</p>
<p class="flush"><u>6 April: later</u>: Michael Robartes  remembers forgotten
beauty and, when his arms wrap her round, he presses in his arms the loveliness
which has long faded from the world. Not this. Not at all. I desire to press in
my arms the loveliness which has not yet come into the world.</p>
<p class="flush"><u>10 April</u>:
<a name="jn0a02c" href="../../ff/unbs/jn0all.htm#jn0a02c">Faintly, under the
heavy night, through the silence of the city which has turned from dreams to
dreamless sleep as a weary lover whom no caresses move, the sound of hoofs upon
the road. Not so faintly now as they come near the bridge; and in a moment as
they pass the darkened windows the silence is cloven by alarm as by an arrow.
They are heard now far away, hoofs that shine amid the heavy night as gems,
hurrying beyond the sleeping fields to what journey&apos;s end &mdash; what heart? &mdash; bearing what tidings?</a></p>
<p class="flush"><u>11 April</u>: Read what I wrote last night. Vague words for
a vague emotion. Would she like it? I think so. Then I should have to like it also.</p>
<p class="flush"><u>13 April</u>: That tundish has been on my mind for a long
time. I looked it up and find it is English and good old blunt English too. Damn
the dean of studies and his funnel! What did he come here for to teach us his
own language or to  learn it from us. Damn him one way or the other!</p>
<p class="flush"><u>14 April</u>: John Alphonsus Mulrennan has just returned
from the west of Ireland (European and Asiatic papers please copy). He told us
he met an old man there in a mountain cabin. Old man had red eyes and short
pipe. Old man spoke Irish. Mulrennan spoke Irish. Then old man and Mulrennan
spoke English. Mulrennan spoke to him about universe and stars. Old man sat,
listened, <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">sp</span></span> smoked, spat. Then said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ah, there must be terrible queer creatures at the latter end of the world &mdash;</p>
<p> I fear him. I fear his red-rimmed horny eyes. It is with him I must struggle
all through this night till day come, till he or I lie dead, gripping him by the
sinewy throat till&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Till what? Till he yield to me? No. I mean no harm.</p>
<p class="flush"><u>15 April</u>: Met her today pointblank in Grafton Street.
The crowd brought us together. We both stopped. She asked me why I never came,
said she had heard all sorts of stories about me. This was only to gain time.
Asked me was I writing poems? About whom? I asked her. This confused her more
and I felt sorry and mean. Turned off that  valve at once and opened the
spiritual-heroic refrigerating apparatus, invented and patented in all countries
by Dante Alighieri. Talked rapidly of myself and my plans. In the midst of it
unluckily I made a sudden gesture of a revolutionary nature. I must have looked
like a fellow throwing a handful of peas up into the air. People began to look
at us. She shook hands a moment after and, in going away, said she hoped I would do what I said.</p>
<p> Now I call that friendly, don&apos;t you?</p>
<p> Yes, I liked her today. A little or much? Don&apos;t know. I liked her and
it seems a new feeling to me. Then, in that case, all the rest, all that I
thought I thought and all that I felt I felt, all the rest before now, in
fact&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. O, give it up, old chap! Sleep it off!</p>
<p class="flush"><u>16 April</u>: Away! Away!</p>
<p> <a name="jn0a03a" href="../../ff/unbs/jn0all.htm#jn0a03a">The spell of arms
and voices: the white arms of roads, their promise of close embraces and the
black arms of tall ships that stand against the moon, their tale of distant
nations. They are held out to say: We are alone.  Come. And the voices say with
them: We are your kinsmen. And the air is thick with their company as they call
to me, their kinsman, making ready to go, shaking the wings of their exultant and terrible youth.</a></p>
<p class="flush"><u>26 April</u>: Mother is putting my new secondhand clothes in
order. She prays now, she says, that I may learn in my own life and away from
home and friends what the heart is and what it feels. Amen. So be it. Welcome, O
life! I go to encounter for the millionth time the reality of experience and to
forge in the smithy of my soul the uncreated conscience of my race.</p>
<p class="flush"><u>27 April</u>: Old father, old artificer, stand me now and ever in good stead.</p>
