<p> By lorries along sir John Rogerson&apos;s quay Mr Bloom walked soberly, past
Windmill lane, Leask&apos;s the linseed crusher&apos;s, the postal telegraph
office. Could have given that address too. And past the sailors&apos; home. He
turned from the morning noises of the quayside and walked through Lime street.
Slack hour: won&apos;t be many there. He crossed Townsend street, passed the
frowning face of Bethel. El, yes: house of: Aleph, Beth. And past Nichols&apos;
the undertaker&apos;s. At eleven it is. Time enough. Daresay Corny Kelleher
bagged that job for O&apos;Neill&apos;s.

<p> In Westland row he halted before the window of the Belfast and Oriental Tea
Company and read the legends of leadpapered packets: choice blend, finest
quality, family tea. Rather warm. Tea. Must get some from Tom Kernan.
Couldn&apos;t ask him at a funeral, though. While his eyes still read blandly he
took off his hat quietly

and sent his right hand with slow grace over his brow and hair. Very warm
morning. Under their dropped lids his eyes found the tiny bow
<br><font color="green">{u21, 80}</font>
<br> of the leather headband inside his high grade hat. Just there. His right
hand came down into the bowl of his hat. His fingers found quickly a card behind
the headband and transferred it to his waistcoat pocket.</p>
<p> So warm. His right hand once more more slowly went over his brow and hair.
Then he put on his hat again, relieved: and read again: choice

was the chap I saw in that picture somewhere? Ah, in the dead sea, floating on
his back, reading a book with a parasol open. Couldn&apos;t sink if you tried:
so thick with salt. Because the weight of the water, no, the weight of the body
in the water is equal to the weight of the what? Or is it the volume is equal to
the weight? It&apos;s a law something like that. What is weight really when you
say the weight? Thirtytwo feet per second per second. Law of falling bodies: per
second per second. They all fall to the ground. The earth. It&apos;s the force
of gravity of the earth is the weight.</p>
<p> He turned away and sauntered across the road. As he walked he took the
folded <i>Freeman</i> from his sidepocket, unfolded it, rolled it lengthwise in
a baton and tapped it at each sauntering step against his trouserleg. Careless
air: just drop in to see. Per second per second. Per second for every second it
means. From the curbstone he darted a keen glance through the door of the
postoffice.

<p> While the postmistress searched a pigeonhole he gazed at the
<br><font color="green">{u21, 81}</font>
<br> recruiting poster with soldiers of all arms on parade: and held the tip of
his baton against his nostrils, smelling freshprinted rag paper. No answer probably. Went too far last time.</p>
<p> The postmistress handed him back through the grill his card with a letter.
He thanked her and glanced rapidly at the typed envelope.</p>
<p class="deep">Henry Flower Esq,</p>
<p class="deep">c/o P.O. Westland Row,</p>
<p class="deep">City.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 70}</font> </p>
<p> Answered anyhow. He slipped card and letter into his sidepocket, reviewing
again the soldiers on parade. Where&apos;s old Tweedy&apos;s regiment? There:
bearskin cap and hackle plume. No, he&apos;s a grenadier. Pointed cuffs. There
he is: royal Dublin fusiliers. Redcoats. Too showy. That must be why the women
go after them. Maud Gonne&apos;s letter about taking them off O&apos;Connell
street at night: disgrace to our Irish capital. Griffith&apos;s paper is on the
same tack now: an army rotten with venereal disease: overseas or halfseasover
empire. Half baked they look: hypnotised like. Eyes front.

<p> He strolled out of the postoffice and turned to the right. Talk: as if that
would mend matters. His hand went into his pocket and a forefinger felt its way
under the flap of the envelope, ripping it open in jerks. Women will pay a lot
of heed, I don&apos;t think. His fingers drew forth the letter and crumpled the
envelope in his pocket. Something pinned on: photo perhaps. Hair? No.</p>

<p class="di">&mdash; Well. How are you?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Just keeping alive, M&apos;Coy said.</p>
<p> His eyes on the black tie and clothes he asked with low respect:
<br><font color="green">{u21, 82}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Is there any&nbsp;&hellip; no trouble I hope? I see you&apos;re&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O no, Mr Bloom said. Poor Dignam, you know. The funeral is today.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; To be sure, poor fellow. So it is. What time?</p>
<p> A photo it isn&apos;t. A badge maybe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; E&nbsp;&hellip; eleven, Mr Bloom answered.</p>

it? I only heard it last night. Who was telling me? Holohan. You know Hoppy?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I know.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom gazed across the road at the outsider drawn up before the door of
the Grosvenor. The porter hoisted the valise up on the well. She stood still,
waiting, while the man, husband, brother, like her, searched his pockets for
change. Stylish kind of coat with that roll collar, warm for a day like this,
looks like blanketcloth. Careless stand of her with her hands in those patch

Hoppy. Having a wet. Drawing back his head and gazing far from beneath his

<p class="di">&mdash; And he said: <i>Sad thing about our poor friend Paddy!

<p> He moved a little to the side of M&apos;Coy&apos;s talking head. Getting up in a minute.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>What&apos;s wrong with him?</i> he said. <i>He&apos;s

I couldn&apos;t believe it when I heard it. I was with him no later than Friday
last or Thursday was it in the Arch. <i>Yes</i>, he said. <i>He&apos;s gone. He died on Monday, poor fellow.</i></p>

<p class="di">&mdash; That so? M&apos;Coy said. Glad to hear that, old man. Who&apos;s getting it up?</p>
<p> Mrs Marion Bloom. Not up yet. No book. Blackened court cards laid along her

<p> M&apos;Coy nodded, picking at his moustache stubble.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O well, he said. That&apos;s good news.</p>
<p> He moved to go.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Well, glad to see you looking fit, he said. Meet you knocking around.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, Mr Bloom said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Tell you what, M&apos;Coy said. You might put down my name
at the funeral, will you? I&apos;d like to go but I mightn&apos;t be able, you
see. You just shove in my name if I&apos;m not there, will you?

Poor papa! How he used to talk about Kate Bateman in that! Outside the Adelphi
in London waited all the afternoon to get in. Year before I was born that was:
sixtyfive. And Ristori in Vienna. What is this the right name is? By Mosenthal
it is. <i>Rachel</i>, is it? No. The scene he was always talking about where the
old blind Abraham recognises the voice and puts his fingers on his face.</p>
<p> Nathan&apos;s voice! His son&apos;s voice! I hear the voice of Nathan who
left his father to die of grief and misery in my arms, who left the house of his
father and left the God of his father.</p>
<p> Every word is so deep, Leopold.</p>
<p> Poor papa! Poor man! I&apos;m glad I didn&apos;t go into the room to look at
his face. That day! O dear! O dear! Ffoo! Well, perhaps it was the best for him.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom went round the corner and passed the drooping horses of the hazard.
No use thinking of it any more. Nosebag time. Wish I hadn&apos;t met that M&apos;Coy fellow.

<br> He came nearer and heard a crunching of the oats, the gently

<br> champing teeth. Their full buck eyes regarded him as he went by. Poor
jugginses! Damn all they know or care about anything with their long noses stuck
in nosebags. Still they get their feed all right and their doss. Gelded too: a
stump of black guttapercha wagging limp between their haunches. Might be happy
all the same that way. Good poor brutes they look.</p>

carried. Might just walk into her here. The lane is safer.</p>

so much drawn to a man as you. I feel so bad about. Please write me a long

<p> He tore the flower gravely from its pinhold and placed it in his heart
pocket. Then, walking slowly forward, he read the letter again, murmuring here
and there a word. Having read it all he took it from the newspaper and put it back in his sidepocket.</p>
<p> Weak joy opened his lips. Changed since the first letter. Doing the

her: more and more: all. Then a sigh: silence. Long long long rest.</p>
<p> Going under the railway arch he took out the envelope, tore it swiftly in
shreds and scattered them towards the road. The shreds fluttered away, sank in
the dank air: a white flutter then all sank.</p>
<p> Henry Flower. You could tear up a cheque for a hundred pounds in the same

cheque for a million in the bank of Ireland. Shows you the money to be made out
of porter. A million pounds, wait a moment. Twopence a pint, fourpence a quart,
eightpence a gallon of porter, no, one and fourpence a gallon of porter. One and
four into twenty: fifteen about. Yes, exactly. Fifteen millions of barrels of porter.</p>
<p> What am I saying barrels? Gallons. About a million barrels all the same.</p>
<p> An incoming train clanked heavily above his head, coach after coach. Barrels
bumped in his head: dull porter slopped and churned inside. The bungholes sprang
open and a huge dull flood leaked out, flowing together, winding through
mudflats all over the level land, a lazy pooling swirl of liquor bearing along wideleaved flowers of its froth.

<p> The cold smell of sacred stone called him. He pushed the swingdoor and entered softly by the rere.

<p> Something going on: some sodality. Women knelt in the benches with crimson
halters round their necks, heads bowed. A batch knelt at the altar rails. The
priest went along by them, murmuring, holding the thing in his hands. He stopped
at each, took out a communion, shook a drop or two (are they in water?) off it
and put it neatly into her mouth. Her hat and head sank. Then the next one: a
small old woman. The priest bent down to put it into her mouth, murmuring all
the time. Latin. The next one.

<p> He stood aside watching their blind masks pass down the aisle, one by one,
and seek their places. He approached a bench and seated himself in its corner,
nursing his hat and newspaper. They were about him here and there, with heads
still bowed in their crimson halters, waiting for it to melt in their stomachs.
Something like those mazzoth: it&apos;s that sort of bread: unleavened bread.
Look at them. Now I bet it makes them feel happy. It does. Yes, bread of angels
it&apos;s called. There&apos;s a big idea behind it, kind of heavenly feel
inside.

before it, showing a large grey bootsole from under the lace affair he had on.

<br><font color="green">{u22, 79}</font> </p>
<p> Mr Bloom looked back towards the choir. Not going to be any music. Pity. Who
has the organ here I wonder? Old Glynn he knew how to make that instrument talk,
the <i>vibrato</i>: fifty pounds a year they say he had in Gardiner street.
Molly was in fine voice that day, the <i>Stabat Mater</i> of Rossini. I told her
to pitch her voice against that corner. I could feel the thrill in the air, the full, the people looking up:</p>
<p class="set"><i>Quis est homo.</i>
<br><font color="green">{u21, 92}</font> </p>
<p> Some of that old sacred music is splendid. Mercadante: seven last words.
Mozart&apos;s twelfth mass: the <i>Gloria</i> in that. Those old popes were keen
on music, on art and statues and pictures of all kinds. Palestrina for example
too. They had a gay old time while it lasted. Still, having eunuchs in their
choir that was coming it a bit thick. What kind of voice is it? Must be curious
to hear. Connoisseurs. Suppose they wouldn&apos;t feel anything after. Kind of a
placid. No worry. Fall into flesh don&apos;t they? Who knows? Eunuch. One way out of it.</p>
<p> He saw the priest bend down and kiss the altar and then face about and bless
all the people. All crossed themselves and stood up. Mr Bloom glanced about him
and then stood up, looking over the risen hats. Stand up at the gospel of
course. Then all settled down on their knees again and he sat back quietly in
his bench. The priest came down from the altar, holding the thing out from him,
and he and the massboy answered each other in Latin. Then the priest knelt down and began to read off a card:</p>
<p class="di"><font color="red"><sup><small>(5</small></sup></font><font color="black">&mdash;</font><font color="red"><sup><small>5)</small></sup></font>
O God, our refuge and our strength.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom put his face forward to catch the words.

<br> rake in the money too? Bequests also: to say so many masses. The priest in
the Fermanagh will case in the witnessbox. No browbeating him. He had his answer
pat for everything. Liberty and exaltation of our holy mother the church. The
doctors of the church: they mapped out the whole theology of it.</p>
<p> The priest prayed:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Blessed Michael, archangel, defend us in the hour of
conflict. Be our safeguard against the wickedness and snares of the devil (may
God restrain him we humbly pray): and do thou, O prince of the heavenly host, by
the power of God thrust Satan down to hell and with him those other wicked
spirits who wander through the world for the ruin of souls.</p>
<p> The priest and the massboy stood up and walked off. All over. The women remained behind: thanksgiving.</p>
<p> Better be shoving along.

He passed, discreetly buttoning, down the aisle and out through the main door
into the light. Trams: a car of Prescott&apos;s dyeworks: a widow in her weeds.

<p class="di">&mdash; No, Mr Bloom said. Make it up, please. I&apos;ll call
later in the day and I&apos;ll take one of those soaps. How much are they?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Fourpence, sir.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom raised a cake to his nostrils. Sweet lemony wax.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I&apos;ll take this one, he said. That makes three and a penny.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, sir, the chemist said. You can pay all together, sir, when you come back.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Good, Mr Bloom said.</p>
<p> He strolled out of the shop, the newspaper baton under his armpit, the cool wrappered soap in his left hand.</p>
<p> At his armpit Bantam Lyons&apos; voice and hand said:</p>

<p> Bantam Lyons raised his eyes suddenly and leered weakly.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What&apos;s that? his sharp voice said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I say you can keep it, Mr Bloom answered. I was going to throw it away that moment.</p>
<p> Bantam Lyons doubted an instant, leering: then thrust the outspread sheets back on Mr Bloom&apos;s arms.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I&apos;ll risk it, he said. Here, thanks.</p>
<p> He sped off towards Conway&apos;s corner.

<p> Mr Bloom folded the sheets again to a neat square and lodged the soap in it,
smiling. Silly lips of that chap. He walked cheerfully towards the mosque of the
baths. Remind you of a mosque, redbaked bricks, the minarets. College sports
today I see. He eyed the horseshoe poster over the gate of college park: cyclist
doubled up like a cod in a pot. Damn bad ad. Now if they had made it round like
a wheel. Then the spokes: sports, sports, sports: and the hub big: college. Something to catch the eye.</p>
<p> There&apos;s Hornblower standing at the porter&apos;s lodge. Keep him on
hands: might take a turn in there on the nod. How do you do, Mr Hornblower? How do you do, sir?</p>
<p> Heavenly weather really. If life was always like that. Won&apos;t last.
