took off his hat quietly inhaling his

his right hand with slow grace over his brow and hair. Very warm morning. Under
their dropped lids his eyes found the tiny bow of the leather headband inside
his high grade ha. Just there. His right hand came down into the bowl of his
hat. His fingers found quickly a card behind the headband and transferred it to his waistcoat pocket.</p>
<p> So warm. His right hand once more more slowly went over his brow and hair.

sausages? Like that something. As he walked he took the folded <i>Freeman</i>

at each sauntering step against his trouserleg. Careless air: just drop in to
see. Per second<a target="foot" id="fee0009">&ordm;</a> per second. Per second

poster with soldiers of all arms on parade: and held the tip of his baton
against his nostrils, smelling freshprinted rag paper. No answer probably. Went too far last time.</p>

would mend matters. His hand went into his pocket and a forefinger felt its way
under the flap of the envelope, ripping it open in jerks. Women will pay a lot

<p> Mr Bloom gazed across the road at the outsider drawn up before the door of
the Grosvenor. The porter hoisted the valise up on the well. She stood still,
waiting, while the man, husband, brother, like her, searched his pockets for
change. Stylish kind of coat with that roll collar, warm for a day like this,
looks like blanketcloth. Careless stand of her with her hands in those

something for you. Please tell me what you think of poor me. I often think of
the beautiful name you have. Dear Henry, when will we meet? I think of you so
often you have no idea. I have never felt myself so much drawn to a man as you.
I feel so bad about. Please write me a long letter and tell me more. Remember if
you do not I will punish you. So now you know what I will do to you, you naughty
boy, if you do not wrote. O how I long to meet you. Henry dear, do not deny my
request before my patience are exhausted. Then I will tell you all. Goodbye now,

<p> He saw the priest bend down and kiss the altar and then face about and bless
all the people. All crossed themselves and stood up. Mr Bloom glanced about him
and then stood up, looking over the risen hats. Stand up at the gospel of
course. Then all settled down on their knees again and he sat back quietly in
his bench. The priest came down from the altar, holding the thing out from him,
and he and the massboy answered each other in Latin. Then the priest knelt down and began to read off a card:</p>

<p class="di">&mdash; I want to see about that French horse that&apos;s running
today, Bantam Lyons<a target="foot" id="fee0070">&ordm;</a> said. Where the bugger is it?</p>
<p> He rustled the pleated pages, jerking his chin on his high collar.

itch</a>. <a name="un4002bp" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4002bp">Tight
collar he&apos;ll lose his hair</a>. Better leave him the paper and get shut of him.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You can keep it, Mr Bloom said.</p>

<a name="un2003c" href="../../ff/unbs/un2all.htm#un2003c">Gold cup.</a> Wait,
Bantam Lyons muttered. <a name="un4002u" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4002u">Half a mo.</a> Maximum the second.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I was just going to throw it away, Mr Bloom said.</p>
<p> Bantam Lyons raised his eyes suddenly and leered weakly.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What&apos;s that? his sharp voice said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I say you can keep it, Mr Bloom answered. I was going to
<a name="un2003f" href="../../ff/unbs/un2all.htm#un2003f">throw it away</a> that moment.</p>
<p> Bantam Lyons doubted an instant, leering: then thrust the outspread sheets back on Mr Bloom&apos;s arms.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I&apos;ll risk it, he said. Here, thanks.</p>
<p> He sped off towards Conway&apos;s corner.
<a name="un5008m" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5008m">God speed scut</a>.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom folded the sheets again to a neat square and lodged the soap in it,
smiling. Silly lips of that chap. Betting. Regular

<p> He walked cheerfully towards the mosque of the baths. Remind you of a
mosque,<a target="foot" id="fee0071">&ordm;</a> redbaked bricks, the minarets.
College sports today I see. He eyed the horseshoe poster over the gate of
college park: cyclist doubled up like a cod in a pot. Damn bad ad. Now if they
had made it round like a wheel. Then the spokes: sports, sports, sports: and the
hub big: college. Something to catch the eye.

<p> There&apos;s Hornblower standing at the porter&apos;s lodge. Keep him on
hands: might take a turn in there on the nod. How do you do, Mr Hornblower? How do you do, sir?</p>
<p> Heavenly weather really. If life was always like that. Cricket weather. Sit
around under sunshades. Over after over. Out. They can&apos;t play it here.

a window in the Kildare street club with a slog</a> to square leg. Donnybrook
fair more in their line. And the skulls we were acracking when M&apos;Carthy
took the floor. Heatwave. Won&apos;t last. Always passing, the stream of life,
which in the stream of life we trace is dearer thaaan<a target="foot" id="fee0072">&ordm;</a> them all.</p>
<p> Enjoy a bath now: clean trough of water, cool enamel, the gentle tepid
stream. <a name="un4002ar" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4002ar">This is my body.</a></p>
<p> He foresaw his pale body reclined in it at full, naked,
<a name="un4058aj" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4058aj">in a womb of
warmth</a>, oiled by scented melting soap, softly laved. He saw his trunk and
limbs riprippled over and sustained, buoyed lightly upward, lemonyellow:
<a name="un5008aj" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5008aj">his navel</a>, bud
of flesh: and saw the dark tangled curls of his bush floating, floating hair of
the stream around the

thousands</a>, a languid floating flower.</p>  </main>
