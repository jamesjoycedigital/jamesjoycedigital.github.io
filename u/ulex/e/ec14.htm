<p> By lorries along sir John Rogerson&apos;s quay Mr Bloom walked soberly, past
Windmill lane, Leask&apos;s the linseed crusher&apos;s, the postal telegraph
office. Could have given that address too. And past the sailors&apos; home. He
turned from the morning noises of the quayside and walked through Lime street.

He crossed Townsend street, passed the frowning face of Bethel. El, yes: house
of: Aleph, Beth. And past Nichols&apos; the undertaker&apos;s. At eleven it is.

<p> In Westland row he halted before the window of the Belfast and Oriental Tea
Company and read the legends of leadpapered packets: choice blend, finest
quality, family tea. Rather warm. Tea. Must get some from Tom Kernan.
Couldn&apos;t ask him at a funeral, though. While his eyes still read blandly he
took off his hat quietly inhaling his
<a name="un4002d" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4002d">hairoil</a> and sent
his right hand with slow grace over his brow and hair. Very warm morning. Under
their dropped lids his eyes found the tiny bow  of the leather headband inside
his high grade ha. Just there. His right hand came down into the bowl of his
hat. His fingers found quickly a card behind the headband and transferred it to his waistcoat pocket.</p>
<p> So warm. His right hand once more more slowly went over his brow and hair.
Then he put on his hat again, relieved: and read<a target="foot" id="fee0003">&ordm;</a> again: choice

<p> He turned away and sauntered across the road. How did she walk with her
sausages? Like that something. As he walked he took the folded <i>Freeman</i>
from his sidepocket, unfolded it, rolled it lengthwise in a baton and tapped it
at each sauntering step against his trouserleg. Careless air: just drop in to
see. Per second<a target="foot" id="fee0009">&ordm;</a> per second. Per second
for every second it means. From the curbstone he darted a keen glance through
the door of the postoffice.

<p> He handed the card through the brass grill.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Are there any letters for me? he asked.</p>
<p> While the postmistress searched a pigeonhole he gazed at the  recruiting
poster with soldiers of all arms on parade: and held the tip of his baton
against his nostrils, smelling freshprinted rag paper. No answer probably. Went too far last time.</p>
<p> The postmistress handed him back through the grill his card with a letter.
He thanked her<a target="foot" id="fee0010">&ordm;</a> and glanced rapidly at the typed envelope.</p>
<p class="deep">Henry Flower<a target="foot" id="fee0011">&ordm;</a> Esq,</p>

<p> Answered anyhow. He slipped card and letter into his sidepocket, reviewing
again the soldiers on parade. Where&apos;s old Tweedy&apos;s regiment?
<a name="un4037dh" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4037dh">Castoff soldier</a>.
There: bearskin cap and

<p> He strolled out of the postoffice and turned to the right. Talk: as if that
would mend matters. His hand went into his pocket and a forefinger felt its way
under the flap of the envelope, ripping it open in jerks. Women will pay a lot
of heed, I don&apos;t think. His fingers drew forth the letter and crumpled the
envelope in his pocket. Something pinned on: photo perhaps. Hair? No.</p>

<a name="un1032cu" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1032cu">Nowhere in particular.</a></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; How&apos;s the body?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Fine. How are you?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Just keeping alive, M&apos;Coy said.</p>
<p> His eyes on the black tie and clothes he asked with low respect: </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Is there any&nbsp;&hellip; no trouble I hope? I see you&apos;re&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O no, Mr Bloom said. Poor Dignam, you know. The funeral is today.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; To be sure, poor fellow. So it is. What time?</p>
<p> A photo it isn&apos;t. A badge maybe.<a target="foot" id="fee0012">&ordm;</a></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; E&nbsp;&hellip; eleven, Mr Bloom answered.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I must try to get out there, M&apos;Coy said. Eleven, is
it? I only heard it last night. Who was telling me? Holohan. You know Hoppy?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I know.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom gazed across the road at the outsider drawn up before the door of
the Grosvenor. The porter hoisted the valise up on the well. She stood still,
waiting, while the man, husband, brother, like her, searched his pockets for
change. Stylish kind of coat with that roll collar, warm for a day like this,
looks like blanketcloth. Careless stand of her with her hands in those

<p class="di">&mdash; And he said: <i>Sad thing about our poor friend Paddy!

<p> Proud: rich: silk stockings.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, Mr Bloom said.</p>
<p> He moved a little to the side of M&apos;Coy&apos;s talking head. Getting up in a minute.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>What&apos;s wrong with
him?</i><a target="foot" id="fee0014">&ordm;</a> he said. <i>He&apos;s dead</i>,
he said. And, faith, he filled up. <i>Is it Paddy Dignam?</i> I said. I
couldn&apos;t believe it when I heard it. I was with him no later than Friday
last or Thursday was it in the Arch. <i>Yes</i>, he said. <i>He&apos;s gone. He died on Monday, poor fellow.</i></p>
<p> Watch! Watch! Silk flash rich stockings white. Watch!</p>

<p> The tram passed. They drove off towards the Loop Line bridge, her rich
gloved hand on the steel grip. Flicker, flicker: the laceflare of her hat in the sun: flicker, flick.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 72}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Wife well, I suppose? M&apos;Coy&apos;s changed voice said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O yes, Mr Bloom said. Tiptop, thanks.</p>
<p> He unrolled the newspaper baton idly and read idly:</p>
<p class="set"><i>What is home without

<p class="di">&mdash; My wife too, he said. She&apos;s going to sing at a
swagger affair in the Ulster hall, Belfast, on the twentyfifth. </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That so? M&apos;Coy said. Glad to hear that, old man. Who&apos;s getting it up?</p>
<p> Mrs Marion Bloom. Not up yet. Queen was in her bedroom eating bread and. No
book. Blackened court cards laid along her thigh by sevens. Dark lady and fair

<p class="di">&mdash; O well, he said. That&apos;s good news.</p>
<p> He moved to go.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Well, glad to see you looking fit, he said. Meet you knocking around.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, Mr Bloom said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Tell you what, M&apos;Coy said. You might put down my name
at the funeral, will you? I&apos;d like to go but I mightn&apos;t be able, you

<p> Mr Bloom stood at the corner, his eyes wandering over the multicoloured
hoardings. Cantrell and Cochrane&apos;s Ginger Ale (Aromatic). Clery&apos;s
summer sale. No, he&apos;s going on straight. Hello. <i>Leah</i> tonight: Mrs

Ophelia committed suicide? Poor papa! How he used to talk about Kate Bateman in
that! Outside the Adelphi in London waited all the afternoon to get in. Year

right name is? By Mosenthal it is.
<i>Rachel</i><a target="foot" id="fee0020">&ordm;</a>, is it? No. The scene he
was always talking about where the old blind Abraham recognises the voice and puts his fingers on his face.</p>
<p><a target="foot" id="fee0021">&ordm;</a> Nathan&apos;s voice! His son&apos;s
voice! I hear the voice of Nathan who left his father to die of grief and misery
in my arms, who left the house of his father and left the God of his father.</p>

<p> Poor papa! Poor man! I&apos;m glad<a target="foot" id="fee0022">&ordm;</a> I

his face. That day! O dear! O dear! Ffoo! Well, perhaps it was the best for him.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom went round the corner and passed the drooping nags of the hazard.
No use thinking of it any more. Nosebag time. Wish I hadn&apos;t met that M&apos;Coy fellow.

<p> He came nearer and heard a crunching of
<a name="un6005s" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6005s">gilded</a> oats, the

<p> I got your last letter to me and thank you very much for it. I am sorry you
did not like my last letter. Why did you enclose the stamps? I am awfully angry
with you. I do wish I could punish you for that. I called you naughty boy
because I do not like that other world. Please  tell me what is the real

<br> meaning of that word. Are you not happy in your home you poor little
naughty boy? I do wish I could do something for you. Please tell me what you
think of poor me. I often think of the beautiful name you have. Dear Henry, when
will we meet? I think of you so often you have no idea. I have never felt myself
so much drawn to a man as you. I feel so bad about. Please write me a long
letter and tell me more. Remember if you do not I will punish you. So now you
know what I will do to you, you naughty boy, if you do not wrote. O how I long
to meet you. Henry dear, do not deny my request before my patience are
exhausted. Then I will tell you all. Goodbye now, naughty darling. I have such a
bad headache today and write <i>by return</i> to your longing</p>

<p> What am I saying barrels? Gallons. About a million barrels all the same.</p>
<p> An incoming train clanked heavily above his head, coach after coach. Barrels
bumped in his head: dull porter slopped and churned inside. The bungholes sprang
open and a huge dull flood leaked out, flowing together, winding through
mudflats all over the level land, a lazy pooling swirl of liquor bearing along wideleaved flowers of its froth.

and then stood up, looking over the risen hats. Stand up at the gospel of

his bench. The priest came down from the altar, holding the thing out from him,
and he and the massboy answered each other in Latin. Then the priest knelt down and began to read off a card:</p>

<p class="di">&mdash; Fourpence, sir.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom raised a cake to his nostrils. Sweet lemony wax.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I&apos;ll take this one, he said. That makes three and a penny.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, sir, the chemist said. You can pay all together, sir, when you come back.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Good, Mr Bloom said.</p>
<p> He strolled out of the shop, the newspaper baton under his armpit, the coolwrappered soap in his left hand.</p>
<p> At his armpit Bantam Lyons&apos; voice and hand said:</p>

<p class="di">&mdash; I was just going to throw it away, Mr Bloom said.</p>
<p> Bantam Lyons raised his eyes suddenly and leered weakly.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What&apos;s that? his sharp voice said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I say you can keep it, Mr Bloom answered. I was going to
<a name="un2003f" href="../../ff/unbs/un2all.htm#un2003f">throw it away</a> that moment.</p>
<p> Bantam Lyons doubted an instant, leering: then thrust the outspread sheets back on Mr Bloom&apos;s arms.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I&apos;ll risk it, he said. Here, thanks.</p>
<p> He sped off towards Conway&apos;s corner.
