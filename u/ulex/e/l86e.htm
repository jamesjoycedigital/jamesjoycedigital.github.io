<p> In Westland row he halted before the window of the Belfast and Oriental Tea
Company and read the legends of leadpapered packets: choice blend, finest
quality, family tea. Rather warm. Tea. Must get some from Tom Kernan.
Couldn&apos;t ask him at a funeral, though. While his eyes still read blandly he
took off his hat quietly inhaling his
<a name="un4002d" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4002d">hairoil</a> and sent
his right hand with slow grace over his brow and hair. Very warm morning. Under
their dropped lids his eyes found the tiny bow of the leather headband inside
his high grade ha. Just there. His right hand came down into the bowl of his
hat. His fingers found quickly a card behind the headband and transferred it to his waistcoat pocket.</p>
<p> So warm. His right hand once more more slowly went over his brow and hair.
Then he put on his hat again, relieved: and

at each sauntering step against his trouserleg. Careless air: just drop in to

against his nostrils, smelling freshprinted rag paper. No answer probably. Went too far last time.</p>

<p class="di">&mdash; I know.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom gazed across the road at the outsider drawn up before the door of
the Grosvenor. The porter hoisted the valise up on the well. She stood still,
waiting, while the man, husband, brother, like her, searched his pockets for
change. Stylish kind of coat with that roll collar, warm for a day like this,
looks like blanketcloth. Careless stand of her with her hands in those

he said. And, faith, he filled up. <i>Is it Paddy Dignam?</i> I said. I
couldn&apos;t believe it when I heard it. I was with him no later than Friday

<p class="di">&mdash; That so? M&apos;Coy said. Glad to hear that, old man. Who&apos;s getting it up?</p>
<p> Mrs Marion Bloom. Not up yet. Queen was in her bedroom eating bread and. No

<p> Mr Bloom went round the corner and passed the drooping nags of the hazard.
No use thinking of it any more. Nosebag time. Wish I hadn&apos;t met that M&apos;Coy fellow.</p>
<p> He came nearer and heard a crunching of
<a name="un6005s" href="../../FF/unbs/un6all.htm#un6005s">gilded</a> oats, the
gently champing teeth. Their full buck eyes regarded him as he went by, amid the

<p class="set">Dear Henry<a target="foot" id="fee0025">&ordm;</a></p>
<p> I got your last letter to me and thank you very much for it. I am sorry you
did not like my last letter. Why did you enclose the stamps? I am awfully angry
with you. I do wish I could punish you for that. I called you naughty boy
because I do not like that other world. Please tell me what is the real meaning
of that word? Are you not happy in your home you poor little naughty boy? I do
wish I could do something for you. Please tell me what you think of poor me. I
often think of the beautiful name you have. Dear Henry, when will we meet? I
think of you so often you have no idea. I have never felt myself so much drawn
to a man as you. I feel so bad about. Please write me a long letter and tell me
more. Remember if you do not I will punish you. So now you know what I will do
to you, you naughty boy, if you do not wrote. O how I long to meet you. Henry
dear, do not deny my request before my patience are exhausted. Then I will tell
you all. Goodbye now, naughty darling, I have such a bad headache. today. and write <i>by return</i> to your longing</p>

<p> Fingering still the letter in his pocket he drew the pin out of it. Common

<p> Going under the railway arch he took out the envelope, tore it swiftly in

<p> Henry Flower. You could tear up a cheque for a hundred pounds in the same

<p> What am I saying barrels? Gallons. About a million barrels all the same.</p>
<p> An incoming train clanked heavily above his head, coach after coach. Barrels
bumped in his head: dull porter slopped and churned inside. The bungholes sprang
open and a huge dull flood leaked out, flowing together, winding through
mudflats all over the level land, a lazy pooling swirl of liquor bearing along wideleaved flowers of its froth.</p>
<p> He had reached the open backdoor of All Hallows. Stepping into the porch he

<p> Something going on: some sodality. Pity so empty. Nice discreet place to be
next some girl. Who is my neighbour? Jammed by the hour to slow music. That
woman at midnight mass. Seventh heaven. Women knelt in the benches with crimson
halters round their necks, heads bowed. A batch knelt at the altarrails. The
priest went along by them, murmuring, holding the thing in his hands.

and then stood up, looking over the risen hats. Stand up at the gospel of

his bench. The priest came down from the altar, holding the thing out from him,
and he and the massboy answered each other in Latin. Then the priest knelt down and began to read off a card:</p>

<p class="di">&mdash; About a fortnight ago, sir?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, Mr Bloom said.</p>
<p> He waited by the counter, inhaling slowly the keen reek of drugs, the dusty
dry smell of sponges and
<a name="un5008ac" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5008ac">loofahs</a>.
<a name="un4002cf" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4002cf">Lot of time taken up telling your aches and pains.</a></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Sweet almond oil and tincture of benzoin, Mr Bloom said,
and then orangeflower water&nbsp;&hellip;.</p>
<p> It certainly did make her skin so delicate white like wax.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And white wax also, he said.</p>
<p> Brings out the darkness of her eyes. Looking at me, the sheet up to her

when I was fixing the links in my cuffs. Those homely recipes are often the

<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, sir, the chemist said. That was two and nine. Have you brought a bottle?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; No, Mr Bloom said. Make it up, please. I&apos;ll call
later in the day and I&apos;ll take one of these soaps. How much are they?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Fourpence, sir.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom raised a cake to his nostrils. Sweet lemony wax.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I&apos;ll take this one, he said. That makes three and a penny. </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, sir, the chemist said. You can pay all together, sir, when you come back.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Good, Mr Bloom said.</p>
<p> He strolled out of the shop, the newspaper baton under his armpit, the coolwrappered soap in his left hand.</p>
<p> At his armpit Bantam Lyons&apos; voice and hand said:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Hello, Bloom.<a target="foot" id="fee0068">&ordm;</a>
<a name="un4003j" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4003j">What&apos;s the best

younger. He does look balmy. <a name="un4002ci" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4002ci">Younger than I am.</a></p>
<p> Bantam Lyons&apos;s yellow blacknailed fingers unrolled the baton. Wants a

<p class="di">&mdash; I want to see about that French horse that&apos;s running
today, Bantam Lyons<a target="foot" id="fee0070">&ordm;</a> said. Where the bugger is it?</p>
<p> He rustled the pleated pages, jerking his chin on his high collar.
<a name="un5008c" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5008c">Barber&apos;s

<a name="un2003c" href="../../FF/unbs/un2all.htm#un2003c">Gold cup.</a> Wait,
Bantam Lyons muttered. <a name="un4002u" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4002u">Half a mo.</a> Maximum the second.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I was just going to throw it away, Mr Bloom said.</p>
<p> Bantam Lyons raised his eyes suddenly and leered weakly.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What&apos;s that? his sharp voice said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I say you can keep it, Mr Bloom answered. I was going to
<a name="un2003f" href="../../FF/unbs/un2all.htm#un2003f">throw it away</a> that moment.</p>
<p> Bantam Lyons doubted an instant, leering: then thrust the outspread sheets back on Mr Bloom&apos;s arms.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I&apos;ll risk it, he said. Here, thanks.</p>
<p> He sped off towards Conway&apos;s corner.
<a name="un5008m" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5008m">God speed scut</a>.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom folded the sheets again to a neat square and lodged the soap in it,
smiling. Silly lips of that chap. Betting. Regular

<p> He walked cheerfully towards the mosque of the baths. Remind you of a

College sports today I see. He eyed the horseshoe poster over the gate of
college park: cyclist doubled up like a cod in a pot. Damn bad ad. Now if they
had made it round like a wheel. Then the spokes: sports, sports, sports: and the
hub big: college. Something to catch the eye. </p>
<p> There&apos;s Hornblower standing at the porter&apos;s lodge. Keep him on

<p> He foresaw his pale body reclined in it at full, naked,
<a name="un4058aj" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4058aj">in a womb of
warmth</a>, oiled by scented melting soap, softly laved. He saw his trunk and
limbs riprippled over and sustained, buoyed lightly upward, lemonyellow:
<a name="un5008aj" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5008aj">his navel</a>, bud
of flesh: and saw the dark tangled curls of his bush floating, floating hair of
