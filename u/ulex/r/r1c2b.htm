course, as Bloom said to the

been <a name="s16021dl" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16021dl">to sound the lie of the land first</a>.</p>

clerk Henry Campbell remarked, and plenty of her. She

<p> This occasioned a fair amount of laughter among his
<a name="s16014ak" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16014ak">entourage</a>. As

<a name="s16001aa" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001aa">which had aroused

kind of dream. And then coming back was
<a name="un4030i" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030i">the worst thing you
ever did</a> because it went without saying you would feel out of place as
things always <a name="un4031ck" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031ck">moved

strand, <a name="un4031al" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031al">a locality

since, as it happened, he went to live on the

south, however, it was a case of hot passion, pure and simple,</a> and just bore
out what he was saying as she also was

so, types that wouldn&apos;t do things by halves,

of the south, casting every shred of decency to the winds.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Just bears out what I was saying, he, with glowing bosom
said to Stephen, about blood and the sun. And if I don&apos;t greatly mistake she was Spanish too.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The King of Spain&apos;s daughter, Stephen answered.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Was she? Bloom said, surprised though not astonished by any means, I never heard that rumour.</p>
<p> Possible, especially there, it was, as she lived there. So, Spain,

said, thoughtfully selecting a faded photo which he laid on the table, that a Spanish type.</p>
<p> Stephen, obviously addressed, looked down on the photo showing

lady</a> <a name="s16010l" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16010l">with her
charms on evidence in an open fashion</a> as she was in the
<a name="s16013bh" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16013bh">bloom of
womanhood</a> in evening dress cut low to give a
<a name="s16013bi" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16013bi">liberal display</a>
of bosom, with more than visions of breasts, her full lips parted and some
perfect teeth, standing near, ostensibly with gravity, a piano on the rest of
which was <a name="un4030ag" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030ag"><u>In Old
Madrid</u></a>, a ballad, pretty in its way, which was then all the vogue. Her
(the lady&apos;s) eyes, dark, large, looked at Stephen, about to smile about
something to be admired, Lafayette and Son, Dublin.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; My wife, Bloom indicated. Taken a few years since. In or
about ninety six. Very like her then.</p>
<p> Beside the young man he looked also of

lady now his wife</a>.
