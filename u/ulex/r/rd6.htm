shavings and handed Stephen the hat and ashplant and bucked him up generally in
good Samaritan fashion, which he very badly needed. His (Stephen&apos;s) mind
was not exactly what you would call wandering but a bit unsteady and on his
expressed desire for something to drink Mr Bloom, in view of the hour it was and
there being no pump of Vartry water available for their ablutions, let alone
drinking purposes, hit upon an expedient by suggesting the propriety of the
cabman&apos;s shelter, as it was called, near Butt Bridge

inasmuch as the duty devolved upon him he pondered ways and means during which
Stephen repeatedly yawned. So far as he could see he was rather pale in the face

answer</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font> in their
then condition, both of them being e.d. ed, particularly Stephen, always
assuming that there was such a thing to be found. Accordingly after a few such
preliminaries as brushing, in spite of his having forgotten to take up his
rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had done yeoman service in the shaving
line, they both walked together along Beaver street, or, more properly, lane, as
far as the farrier&apos;s and the distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery
stables at the corner of Montgomery street where they made tracks to the left,
from thence debouching into Amiens street round by
<br><font color="green">{u21, 678}</font>
<br> the corner of Dan Bergin&apos;s. But, as he confidently anticipated, there
was not a sign of a Jehu plying for hire anywhere to be seen except a
fourwheeler, probably engaged by some fellows inside on the spree, outside the
North Star
Hotel<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>
and there was no symptom of its budging an inch when Mr Bloom, who was anything
but a professional whistler, endeavoured to hail it by emitting a kind of a
whistle, holding his arms arched over his head, twice.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 570}</font> </p>
<p> This was a quandary but, bringing common sense to bear on it, evidently
there was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it which
they accordingly did. So, bevelling around by Mullett&apos;s and the Signal
House, which they shortly reached, they proceeded in the direction of Amiens
street railway terminus, Mr Bloom being handicapped by the circumstance that one
of the back buttons of his trousers had, to vary the adage, gone the way of all
buttons though, entering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing, he heroically
made light of the mischance. So as neither of them were particularly pressed for
time, as it happened, and the temperature refreshing
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">since
it <a name="un6015da" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6015da">cleared
up</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font> after the
recent visitation of Jupiter Pluvius, they dandered along past by where the
empty vehicle was waiting without a fare or a jarvey. As it so happened a Dublin
United Tramways Company&apos;s sandstrewer happening to be returning the elder
man recounted to his companion a propos of the incident his own truly miraculous
escape of some little while back. They passed the main entrance of the Great
Northern railway station, the starting point for Belfast, where of course all
traffic was suspended at that late hour, and passing the back door of the morgue
(a not very enticing locality, not to say gruesome, more especially at night),
ultimately gained the Dock Tavern and in due course turned into Store street,
famous for its C division police station. Between this point and the high, at
present unlit, warehouses of Beresford Place Stephen thought to think of Ibsen,
associated with Baird&apos;s, the stonecutter&apos;s in his mind somehow in
Talbot Place, first turning on the right, while the other, who was acting as his
<i>fidus Achates</i> inhaled with internal satisfaction the smell of James
Rourke&apos;s city bakery, situated quite close to where
<br><font color="green">{u21, 679}</font>
<br> they were, the very palatable odour indeed of our daily bread, of all
commodities of the public the primary and most indispensable. Bread, the staff
of life, earn your bread, O tell me where is fancy bread? At Rourke&apos;s the baker&apos;s, it is said.</p>

route</span></span> <font color="black"><i>En
route</i></font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>, to his
taciturn, and, not to put too fine a point on it, not yet perfectly sober
companion, Mr Bloom, who at all events was in complete possession of his
faculties, never more so, spoke a word of caution <i>re</i> the dangers of
nighttown, women of ill fame and swell mobsmen, which, barely permissible once
in a while, though not as a habitual practice, was of the nature of a regular
deathtrap for young fellows of his age particularly under the influence of
liquor. Highly providential was the appearance on the scene of Corny Kelleher when Stephen
<br><font color="green">{u22, 571}</font>
<br> was blissfully unconscious that, but for that man in the gap turning up at
the eleventh hour, the finis might have been that he might have been a candidate
for the accident ward or, failing that, the bridewell and an appearance in the
court next day before Mr Tobias, or, he being the solicitor rather, old Wall, he
meant to say, or Mahony. The reason he mentioned the fact was that a lot of
those policemen, whom he cordially disliked, were admittedly unscrupulous and,
as Mr Bloom put it, recalling a case or two in the A Division in Clanbrassil
street, prepared to swear a hole through a ten gallon pot. Never on the spot
when wanted but in quiet parts of the city, Pembroke road for example, the
guardians of the law were well in evidence, the obvious reason being they were
paid to protect the upper classes. Another thing he commented on was equipping
soldiers with firearms or sidearms of any description,
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">liable
to go off at any
time</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font> which was
tantamount to inciting them against civilians
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black"><a name="un5017aq" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5017aq">should

anything</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>. You
frittered away your time, he very sensibly remarked, and health and also

<br><font color="green">{u21, 680}</font>
<br> away with a lot of &pound;. s. d. into the bargain and the greatest danger
of all was who you got drunk with. Most of all he commented adversely on the
desertion of Stephen by all his pubhunting confr&egrave;res but one, a most
glaring piece of ratting on the part of his brother medicos under all the circs.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And that one was Judas, said Stephen, who up to then had said nothing whatsoever of any kind.</p>
<p> Discussing these and kindred topics they passed under the Loop Line bridge
where a brazier of coke burning in front of a sentrybox, or something like one,
attracted their rather lagging footsteps. Stephen stopped for no special reason
to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by the light emanating from the
brazier he could just make out the darker figure of the corporation watchman
inside the gloom of the sentrybox. He began to remember that this had happened,
or had been mentioned as having happened, before but it cost
<br><font color="green">{u22, 572}</font>
<br> him no small effort before he remembered that he recognised in the sentry a
<i>quondam</i> friend of his father&apos;s, Gumley. To avoid a meeting he drew
nearer to the pillars of the railway bridge.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Someone saluted you, Mr Bloom said.</p>
<p> A figure of middle height on the prowl, evidently, under the arches saluted
again, calling:
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Night.</span></span>
<font color="black"><i>Night!</i></font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>
Stephen, of course, started rather dizzily and stopped to return the compliment.
Mr Bloom, actuated by motives of inherent delicacy, moved off, but nevertheless
remained on the <i>qui vive</i> with just a shade of anxiety. Although unusual
in Dublin he knew that it was not by any means unknown for desperadoes who had
next to nothing to live on to be about waylaying and generally terrorising peaceable pedestrians by
<br><font color="green">{u21, 681}</font>
<br> placing a pistol at their head in some secluded spot outside the city
proper, famished loiterers they might be hanging about there or simply marauders
ready to decamp with whatever boodle they could at a moment&apos;s notice, your money or your life.</p>
<p> Stephen, that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters, though he
was not in an over sober state himself, recognised Corly&apos;s breath redolent
of rotten cornjuice. Lord John Corly, some called him, and his genealogy came
about in this wise. He was the eldest son of Inspector Corly of the G Division,
lately deceased, who had married a certain Katherine Brophy, the daughter of a
Louth farmer. His grandfather, Patrick Michael Corly, of New Ross, had married
the widow of a publican there whose maiden name had been Katherine (also)
Talbot. Rumour had it,though not proved, that she descended from the house of
the Lords Talbot de Malahide, in whose mansion, really an unquestionably fine
residence of its kind and well worth seeing, her mother or aunt or some relative
had enjoyed the distinction of being in service in the washkitchen. This,
therefore, was the reason why the still comparatively young though dissolute man
who now addressed Stephen was spoken of by some with facetious proclivities as Lord John Corly.</p>
<p> Taking Stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell. Not
as much as a farthing to purchase a night&apos;s lodgings. His friends had all
deserted him. Furthermore, he had a row with Lenehan and called him to Stephen a
mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of other uncalledfor expressions. He was out
of a job and implored of Stephen to tell him where on God&apos;s earth he could
get something, anything at all, to do. No, it was the daughter of the
<br><font color="green">{u22, 573}</font>
<br> mother in the washkitchen that was fostersister to the heir of the house,
both occurrences happening at the same time if the whole thing wasn&apos;t a
complete fabrication from start to finish. Anyhow, he was all in.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I wouldn&apos;t ask you, only, pursued he, on my solemn oath and
<br><font color="green">{u21, 682}</font>
<br> God knows I&apos;m on the rocks.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There&apos;ll be a job tomorrow or the next day, Stephen
told him, in a boys&apos; school at Dalkey for a gentleman usher. Mr Garrett Deasy. Try it. You may mention my name.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ah, God, Corly replied, sure I couldn&apos;t teach in a
school, man. I was never one of your bright ones, he added with a half laugh.
Got stuck twice in the junior at the Christian Brothers.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I have no place to sleep myself, Stephen informed him.</p>
<p> Corly, at the first go-off, was inclined to suspect it was something to do
with Stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody tart off the
street. There was a dosshouse in Marlborough street, Mrs Maloney&apos;s, but it
was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but M&apos;Conachie told him
you got a decent enough do in the Brazen Head over in Winetavern street for a
bob. He was starving too though he hadn&apos;t said a word about it.</p>
<p> Though this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it still
Stephen&apos;s feelings got the better of him in a sense though he knew that
Corly&apos;s brandnew rigmarole, on a par with the others, was hardly deserving
of much credence. However, <i>haud ignarus malorum miseris succurrere disco</i>,
etcetera, especially as luck would have it he got paid his screw after every
middle of the month on the sixteenth which was the date of the month as a matter
of fact though a good bit of the wherewithal was demolished. But the cream of
the joke was nothing would get it out of Corly&apos;s head that he was living in
affluence and hadn&apos;t a thing to do but hand out the needful &mdash;
whereas. He put his hand in a pocket anyhow, not with the idea of finding any
food there, but thinking he might lend him anything up to a bob or so in lieu so
that he might endeavour at all events and get sufficient to eat. But the result
was in the negative for, to his chagrin, he found his cash missing. A few broken
biscuits were all the result of his investigation. He tried his hardest to
recollect for the moment whether he had lost, as well he might have, or left,
because in that contingency it was not a pleasant lookout, very much the reverse, in fact. He was altogether too
<br><font color="green">{u21, 683}</font>
<br> fagged out to institute a thorough search though
<br><font color="green">{u22, 574}</font>
<br> he tried to recollect. About biscuits he dimly remembered. Who now exactly
gave them, or where was, or did he buy? However, in another pocket he came
across what he surmised in the dark were pennies, erroneously, however.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Those are halfcrowns, man, Corly corrected him.</p>
<p> And so in point of fact they turned out to be. Stephen lent him one of them.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Thanks, Corly answered. You&apos;re a gentleman. I&apos;ll
pay you back some time. Who&apos;s that with you? I saw him a few times with
Boylan the billsticker. You might put in a good word for us to get me taken on
there. I&apos;d carry a sandwichboard only the girl in the office told me
they&apos;re full up for the next three weeks, man. God, you&apos;ve to book
ahead, man, you&apos;d think it was for the Carl Rosa. I don&apos;t give a shite anyway so long as I get a job.</p>
<p> Subsequently, being not quite so down in the mouth after the two-and-six he
got, he informed Stephen about a fellow by the name of Bags Comisky that he said
Stephen knew well out of Fulham&apos;s, the shipchandler&apos;s, bookkeeper
there, that used to be often round in Nagle&apos;s back with O&apos;Mara and a
little chap with a stutter
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">called</span></span>
<font color="black">the name
of</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font> Tighe. Anyhow, he
was lagged the night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and disorderly and refusing to go with the constable.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the
cobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation
watchman&apos;s sentrybox, who, evidently a glutton for work, it struck him, was
having a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own private
account while Dublin slept. He threw an odd eye at the same time now and then at
Stephen&apos;s anything but immaculately attired interlocutor as if he had seen
that nobleman somewhere or other. Being a levelheaded person who could give
points to not a few in point of shrewd observation, he also remarked on his very
dilapidated hat and slouchy wearing apparel generally,
<br><font color="green">{u21, 684}</font>
<br> testifying to a chronic impecuniosity. Probably he was one of his hangerson
but for the matter of that it was merely a question of one preying on another
all round, in every deep, so to put it, a deeper depth. In any case he had a consummate amount of assurance
<br><font color="green">{u22, 575}</font>
<br> intercepting people at that hour of the night or morning. Pretty thick that was certainly.</p>
<p> The pair parted company and Stephen rejoined Mr Bloom, who, with his
practised eye, was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the
blandiloquence of the other parasite. Alluding to the encounter he said, laughing, Stephen, that is:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He&apos;s down on his luck. He asked me to ask you to ask
somebody named Boylan, a billsticker, to give him a job as a sandwichman.</p>
<p> At this intelligence, in which he seemingly evinced little interest, Mr
Bloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the direction
of a bucketdredger
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">rejoicing
in the farfamed name of
<a name="un7007cd" href="../../ff/unbs/un7all.htm#un7007cd">Eblana</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>
moored alongside Burgh Quay, whereupon he observed evasively:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Everybody gets their own ration of luck, they say. Now you
mention it his face was familiar to me. But leaving that for the moment, how
much did you part with, he queried, if I am not too inquisitive?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Half-a-crown, Stephen responded. I daresay he needs it to sleep somewhere.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Needs! Mr Bloom ejaculated, I guarantee he invariably
does. Everyone according to his needs and everyone according to his deeds. But,
talking about things in general, where, added he with a smile, will you sleep
yourself? Walking to Sandycove is out of the question, and even supposing you
did, you won&apos;t get in after what occurred at Westland Row station. Simply
fag out there for nothing. I don&apos;t mean to presume to dictate to you in the
slightest degree but why did you leave your father&apos;s house?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; To seek misfortune,
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Stephen
replied</span></span>
<font color="black"><a name="un6015at" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6015at">was
Stephen&apos;s answer</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 685}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I met your respected father on a recent occasion, Mr Bloom
remarked, today, in fact, or, to be strictly accurate, on yesterday. Where does
he live at present? I gathered in the course of conversation that he had moved.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I believe he is in Dublin somewhere, Stephen answered unconcernedly. Why?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A gifted man, Mr Bloom said of Mr Dedalus senior, in more
respects than one. He takes great pride, quite legitimately, out of you. You
could go back, perhaps, he hazarded, still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at Westland Row terminus when it
<br><font color="green">{u22, 576}</font>
<br> was perfectly evident that the other two, Mulligan, that is, and that
English tourist friend of his, who eventually euchred their third companion,
were patently trying, as if the whole station belonged to them, to give Stephen the slip in the confusion.</p>
<p> There was no response forthcoming to the suggestion, however, such as it
was, Stephen&apos;s mind&apos;s eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his
family hearth the last time he saw it, with his sister Dilly sitting by the
ingle, her hair hanging down, waiting for some weak Trinidad shell cocoa that
was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he could drink it with
the oatmeal water for milk after the Friday herrings they had eaten at two a
penny, with an egg apiece for Maggy Boody and Katey, the cat meanwhile under the
mangle devouring a mess of eggshells and charred fish heads and bones on a
square of brown paper, in accordance with the third precept of the church to
fast and abstain on the days commanded, it being quarter tense or, if not, ember days or something like that.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; No, Mr Bloom repeated again, I wouldn&apos;t personally
repose much trust in that boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous
element, Dr Mulligan, as a guide, philosopher, and friend, if I were you. He
knows which side his bread is buttered on though in all probability he never
realised what it is to be without regular meals. Of course you didn&apos;t
notice as much as I did but it wouldn&apos;t occasion me the least surprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco
<br><font color="green">{u21, 686}</font>
<br> or some narcotic was put in your drink for some ulterior object.</p>
<p> He understood, however, from all he heard, that Dr Mulligan was a versatile
allround man, by no means confined to medicine only, who was rapidly coming to
the fore in his line and, if the report was verified, bade fair to enjoy a
flourishing practice in the not too distant future in addition to which
professional status his rescue of that man from certain drowning at Skerries, or
Malahide was it?, was, he was bound to admit, an exceedingly plucky deed, so
that he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reason could be at the back
of it except he put it down to jealousy.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they
call picking your brains, he ventured to say.</p>
<p> The guarded glance of half solicitude, half curiosity, augmented by
friendliness which he gave at Stephen&apos;s at present morose expression of features
<br><font color="green">{u22, 577}</font>
<br> did not throw a flood of light, none at all in fact, on the problem as to
whether he had let himself be badly taken in, to judge by two or three
lowspirited remarks he let drop, or, the other way about, saw through the
affair, and, for some reason or other best known to himself, allowed matters to
more or less. Grinding poverty did have that effect, and he more than
conjectured that, highly educated though he was, he experienced no little difficulty in making both ends meet.</p>
<p> Adjacent to the men&apos;s public urinal they perceived an icecream car
round which a group of presumably Italians were getting rid of voluble
expressions in their language in a particularly animated way.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>Puttana madonna, che ci dia i quattrini! Ho ragione? Culo rotto!</i></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>Intendiamoci. Mezzo sovrano pi&ugrave;</i>&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>Dice lui, per&ograve;!</i></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>Farabutto! Mortacci sui!</i></p>
<p> Mr Bloom and Stephen entered the cabman&apos;s shelter, an unpretentious
<br><font color="green">{u21, 687}</font>
<br> wooden structure, where, prior to then, he had rarely, if ever, been
before; the former having previously whispered to the latter a few hints anent
the keeper of it, said to be the once famous Skin-the-Goat, Fitzharris, the
invincible, though he wouldn&apos;t vouch for the actual facts which quite
possibly there was not one vestige of truth in. A few moments later saw our two
noctambules safely seated in a discreet corner only to be greeted by stares from
the decidedly miscellaneous collection of waifs and strays already there engaged
in eating and drinking, diversified by conversation for whom they seemingly formed an object of curiosity.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Now touching a cup of coffee, Mr Bloom suggested, it
occurs to me you want something in the shape of solid food, say a roll of some sort.</p>
<p>
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">He
ordered</span></span> <font color="black">Accordingly
<a name="un4031dr" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031dr">his first act
was</a> to order</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>
these commodities quietly. The <i>hoi polloi</i> of jarvies or stevedores, or
whatever they were, turned their eyes, apparently dissatisfied, away, though one
redbearded bibulous individual, portion of whose hair was greyish, a sailor,
probably, still stared for some appreciable time before transferring his attention to the floor.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom, availing himself of the right of free speech, he having just a
bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute, though, to be sure, rather in
a quandary over <i>voglio</i>, remarked to his prot&eacute;g&eacute; in an audible tone of voice,
<br><font color="green">{u22, 578}</font>
<br> &agrave; propos of the battle royal in the street which was still raging fast and furious.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A beautiful language. I mean for singing purposes. Why do
you not write your poetry in that language? <i>Bella Poetria!</i> It is so
melodious and full. <i>Bella Donna</i>. <i>Voglio</i>.</p>
<p> Stephen, who was trying his dead best to yawn, if he could, suffering from lassitude generally, replied:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; To fill the ear of a cow elephant. They were haggling over money.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Is that so? Mr Bloom asked. Of course, he subjoined
pensively, at the inward reflection of there being more languages to start with
<br><font color="green">{u21, 688}</font>
<br> than were absolutely necessary, it may be only the southern glamour that surrounds it.</p>
<p> The keeper of the shelter in the middle of this
<i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> put a boiling swimming cup of a choice
concoction labelled coffee on the table and a rather antediluvian specimen of a
bun, or so it seemed, after which he retreated to his counter, Mr Bloom
determining to have a good square look at him later on so as not to appear to,
for which reason he encouraged Stephen to proceed with his eyes while he did the
honours by surreptitiously pushing the cup of what was
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">temporarily</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>
supposed to be called coffee gradually nearer him.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Sounds are impostures, Stephen said after a pause of some
little time. Like names. Cicero, Podmore. Napoleon, Mr Goodbody. Jesus, Mr
Doyle. Shakespeares were as common as Murphies. What&apos;s in a name?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, to be sure, Mr Bloom unaffectedly concurred. Of
course. Our name was changed too, he added, pushing the socalled roll across.</p>
<p> The redbearded sailor, who had his eye on the newcomers, boarded Stephen squarely by asking:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And what might your name be?</p>
<p> Just in the nick of time Mr Bloom touched his companion&apos;s boot but
Stephen, apparently disregarding the warm pressure, answered:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Dedalus.</p>
<p> The sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy eyes.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You know Simon Dedalus? he asked at length.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I&apos;ve heard of him, Stephen said.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 579}</font> </p>
<p> Mr Bloom was all at sea for a moment, seeing the others evidently listening too.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He&apos;s Irish, the seaman affirmed, staring still in
much the same way and nodding. All Irish.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; All too Irish, Stephen rejoined.</p>
<p> As for Mr Bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole
<br><font color="green">{u21, 689}</font>
<br> business and he was just asking himself what possible connection when the
sailor, of his own accord, turned to the other occupants of the shelter with the remark:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards
over his shoulder. The lefthand dead shot.</p>
<p> Though he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his gestures
being also clumsy as it was, still he did his best to explain.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Bottles out there, say. Fifty yards measured. Eggs on the
bottles. Cocks his gun over his shoulder. Aims.</p>
<p> He turned his body half round, shut up his right eye completely, then he
screwed his features up someway sideways and glared out into the night with an unprepossessing eye.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Pom! he then shouted once.</p>
<p> The entire audience waited, anticipating an additional detonation, there being still a further egg.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Pom! he shouted twice.</p>
<p> A silence ensued till Mr Bloom for agreeableness&apos; sake just asked him
whether it was for a marksmanship competition.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Beg pardon, the sailor said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Long ago? Mr Bloom pursued
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">without
<a name="un5012co" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5012co">flinching</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Why, the sailor replied, relaxing to a certain extent, it
might be a matter of ten years. He toured the wide world with Hengler&apos;s
Royal Circus. I seen him do that in Stockholm.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Curious coincidence, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen unobtrusively.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Murphy&apos;s my name, the sailor continued, W.B. Murphy, of Carrigaloe. Know where that is?
<br><font color="green">{u22, 580}</font> </p>

<p> Mr Bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene &mdash; homecoming to

rainy night with a blind moon.

<p> The sailor, who scarcely seemed to be a Dublin resident, turned to one of the jarvies with the request:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You don&apos;t happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you, do you?</p>
<p> The jarvey addressed, as it happened, had not but the keeper took a die of
plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the object was passed from hand to hand.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Thank you, the sailor said.</p>
<p> He deposited the quid in his gob and, chewing, and with some slow stammers, proceeded:
<br><font color="green">{u21, 691}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; We come up this morning eleven o&apos;clock. The

<br><font color="green">{u22, 581}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You must have seen a fair share of the world, the keeper remarked, leaning on the counter.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Why, the sailor answered upon reflection upon it,
I&apos;ve circumnavigated a bit since I first joined on. I was in the Red Sea. I
was in China and North America and South America. I seen icebergs plenty,
growlers. I was in Stockholm and the Black Sea, the Dardanelles, under Captain
Dalton, the best bloody man that ever scuttled a ship. I seen Russia. <i>Gospodi
pomilyou</i>. That&apos;s how the Russians prays.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You seen queer sights, don&apos;t be talking, said a jarvey.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Why, the sailor said, shifting his partially chewed plug,
I seen queer things too, ups and downs. I seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an anchor same as I chew that quid.</p>
<p> He took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and, lodging it between his teeth, bit ferociously:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Khaan! Like that. And I seen maneaters in Peru that eats
corpses and the livers of horses. Look here. Here they are. A friend of mine sent me.</p>
<p> He fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket, which seemed to be
in its way a species of repository, and pushed it along the table. The printed
matter on it stated:
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Choza

Beni, Bolivia.</i></font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font></p>
<p> All focussed their attention at the scene exhibited, a group of savage women
in striped loincloths, squatted, blinking, suckling, frowning, sleeping, amid a
swarm of infants (there must have been quite a score of them) outside some primitive huts of osier.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Chews coca all day long, the communicative tarpaulin
added. Stomachs like breadgraters. Cuts off their diddies when they can&apos;t
bear no more children. See them there stark ballocknaked eating a dead horse&apos;s liver raw.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 692}</font> </p>
<p> His postcard proved a centre of attraction for several minutes, if not more.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Know how to keep them off? he inquired genially.</p>
<p> Nobody volunteering a statement, he winked, saying:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Glass. That boggles &apos;em. Glass.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom, without evincing surprise, unostentatiously turned over the card
to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark. It ran as follows:

<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">deuced</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>
hitch or other eternally cropped up with the net result that the scheme fell
through. But even suppose it did come to planking down
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">the
needful</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font> and breaking
Boyd&apos;s heart it was not so dear, purse permitting, a few guineas at the
outside, considering the fare to Mullingar where he figured on going was five
and six there and back. The trip would benefit health on account of the bracing
ozone and be in every way thoroughly pleasurable, especially for a chap whose
liver was out of order, seeing the different places along the route, Plymouth,
Falmouth, Southampton and so on, culminating in an instructive tour of the sights of the great metropolis,
<br><font color="green">{u21, 693}</font>
<br> the spectacle of our modern Babylon, tower, abbey, wealth of Park Lane to
renew acquaintance with. Another thing just struck him as a by no means bad
notion was he might have a gaze around on the spot to see about trying to make
arrangements about a concert tour of summer music embracing the most prominent
pleasure resorts, Margate with mixed bathing and hydros and spas, Falmouth
Plymouth and so on, beautiful Bournemouth, the Channel islands and similar bijou
spots, which might prove highly remunerative. Not, of course, with a hole and
corner scratch company, witness Mrs C.P. M&apos;Coy type &mdash; lend me your
valise and I&apos;ll post you the ticket. No, something top notch, an all star
Irish caste, the Tweedy-Flower grand opera company with his own legal consort as
leading lady as a sort of counterblast to the Elster Grimes and Moody-Manners,
perfectly simple matter, providing puffs in the local papers could be managed by
some fellow who could pull the indispensable wires, and thus combine business with pleasure. But who? That was the rub.

struck him a great field was to be opened up in the line of opening up new
routes <i>apropos</i> of the Fishguard-Rosslare route which, it was mooted, was
once more on the <i>tapis</i> in the circumlocution departments with the usual
quantity of red tape and dillydallying of effete fogeydom and dunderheads
generally. A great opportunity there certainly was for push and enterprise to
meet the travelling needs of the public at large, the average man, i.e., Brown, Robinson and Co.</p>
<p> It was a subject of regret and absurd as well on the face of it and no small
blame to our vaunted society that the man in the street, for a matter of a
couple of paltry pounds, was debarred from seeing more of the world they lived
in instead of being always cooped up since my old stick-in-the-mud took me for a
wife. After all, hang it, they had their eleven and more humdrum months of it
and merited a radical change of <i>venue</i> after the grind of city life in the
summertime, for choice, when Dame Nature
<br><font color="green">{u21, 694}</font>
<br> is at her spectacular best, constituting nothing short of a new lease of
life. There were equally excellent opportunities for vacationists in the home
island, delightful sylvan spots for rejuvenation, offering a plethora of
attractions as well as a bracing tonic for the system in and around Dublin even,
Poulaphouca, to which there was a steam tram, but also farther away from the
madding crowd, in Wicklow, rightly termed the garden of Ireland, and in the
wilds of Donegal where, if report spoke true, the <i>coup d&apos;&oelig;il</i>
was exceedingly grand, though the lastnamed locality was not easily getatable.
Because of course uptodate tourist travelling was as yet merely in its infancy,
so to speak, and the accommodation left much to be desired. Interesting to
fathom, it seemed to him, from a motive of curiosity pure and simple, was
whether it was the traffic that created the route or viceversa or the two sides
in fact. He turned back the other side of the card, picture, and passed it along to Stephen.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 584}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I seen a Chinese one time, related the narrator, that had
little pills like putty and he put them in the water and they opened, and every
pill was something different. One was a ship, another was a house, another was a
flower. Cooks rats in your soup, he added, the Chinese does.</p>
<p> Possibly perceiving an expression of dubiosity on their faces, the
globetrotter went on, adhering to his adventures.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And I seen a man killed in Trieste by an Italian chap. Knife in his back. Knife like that.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 695}</font> </p>
<p> Whilst speaking he produced a dangerous looking claspknife, quite in keeping
with his character, and held it in the striking position.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; In a knockingshop it was count of a tryon between two
smugglers. Fellow hid behind a door, come up behind him. Like that. <i>Prepare
to meet your God</i>, says he. Chuk! It went into his back up to the butt.</p>
<p> His heavy glance, drowsily roaming about, kind of defied their further
questions even should they by any chance want to.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That&apos;s a good bit of steel, repeated he, examining his formidable <i>stiletto</i>.</p>
<p> After which harrowing <i>d&eacute;nouement</i> sufficient to appal the
stoutest he snapped the blade to and stowed the weapon in question away as
before in his chamber of horrors, otherwise pocket.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; They&apos;re great for the cold steel, somebody who was
evidently quite in the dark said for the benefit of them all. That was why they
thought the park murders of the invincibles was done by foreigners on account of them using knives.</p>
<p> At this remark, passed obviously in the spirit of <i>where ignorance is
bliss</i>, Mr Bloom and Stephen, each in his own particular way, both
instinctively exchanged meaning glances, in a religious silence of the strictly
<i>entre nous</i> variety however, towards where Skin-the-Goat, <i>alias</i> the
keeper, was drawing spurts of liquid from his boiler affair. His inscrutable
face, which was really a work of art, a perfect study in itself, beggaring
description, conveyed the impression that he didn&apos;t understand one jot of what was going on. Funny, very.</p>
<p> There followed a somewhat lengthy pause. One man was reading by fits and
starts a stained by coffee evening journal; another, the card with the natives
<i>choza de</i>; another, the seaman&apos;s discharge. Mr Bloom, so far as he
was concerned, was just pondering in pensive mood. He vividly recollected when
the occurrence alluded to took place as well as yesterday, some score of years
previously, in the days of the land troubles when it took the civilised world
<br><font color="green">{u22, 585}</font>
<br> by storm, figuratively speaking, early in the eighties, eightyone to be correct, when he was just turned fifteen.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 696}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ay, boss, the sailor broke in. Give us back them papers.</p>
<p> The request being complied with, he clawed them up with a scrape.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Have you seen the Rock of Gibraltar? Mr Bloom asked.</p>
<p> The sailor grimaced, chewing, in a way that might be read as yes, ay, or no.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ah, you&apos;ve touched there too, Mr Bloom said, Europa
point, thinking he had, in the hope that the rover might possibly by some
reminiscences but he failed to do so, simply letting spurt a jet of spew into
the sawdust, and shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What year would that be about? Mr Bloom interpolated. Can you recall the boats?</p>
<p> Our <i>soi-disant</i> sailor munched heavily awhile hungrily before answering.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I&apos;m tired of all them rocks in the sea, he said, and
boats and ships. Salt junk all the time.</p>
<p> Tired, seemingly, he ceased. His questioner, perceiving that he was not
likely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer, fell to
woolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the globe. Suffice
it to say that, as a casual glance at the map revealed, it covered fully three
fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly what it meant to rule the waves.
On more than one occasion &mdash; a dozen at the lowest &mdash; near the North
Bull at Dollymount he had remarked a superannuated old salt, evidently derelict,
seated habitually near the not particularly redolent sea on the wall, staring
quite obliviously at it and it at him, dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">as
someone somewhere
sings</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>. And it left
him wondering why. Possibly he had tried to find out the secret for himself,
floundering up and down and all that sort of thing and over and under &mdash;
well, not exactly under &mdash; tempting the fates. And the odds were twenty to
nil there was really no secret about it
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">at
all</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>. Nevertheless,
without going into the <i>minutiae</i> of the business, the eloquent fact
remained that the sea was there in all its glory and in the natural course of
things somebody
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">or
other</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font> had to sail on
it though it merely went to show how people usually contrived to load that sort
<br><font color="green">{u21, 697}</font>
<br> of onus on to the other fellow like the hell idea and the lottery and
insurance were run on identically the same lines so that for that very reason,
if no other, lifeboat Sunday was a very laudable institution to which the public
at large, no matter where living, inland or seaside, as the case might be,
having it brought home to them like that, should extend its
<br><font color="green">{u22, 586}</font>
<br> gratitude also to the harbourmasters and coastguard service who had to man
the rigging and push off and out amid the elements, whatever the season, when
duty called <i>Ireland expects that every man</i> and so on and sometimes had a
terrible time of it in the wintertime not forgetting the Irish lights, Kish and
others, rounding which he once with his daughter had experienced some remarkably choppy, not to say stormy, weather.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There was a fellow sailed with me in the <i>Rover</i>, the
old seadog, himself a rover, proceeded, went ashore and took up a soft job as
gentleman&apos;s valet at six quid a month. Them are his trousers I&apos;ve on
me and he gave me an oilskin and that jackknife. I&apos;m game for that job,
shaving and brushup. I hate roaming about. There&apos;s my son now, Danny, run
off to sea and his mother got him took in a draper&apos;s in Cork where he could be drawing easy money.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What age is he? queried one hearer who, by the way, seen
from the side, bore a distant resemblance to Henry Campbell, the townclerk, away
from the cares of office, unwashed, of course, and in a seedy getup and a strong
suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Why, the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance, my
son, Danny? He&apos;d be about eighteen now, way I figure it.</p>
<p> He tore open his grey or unclean anyhow shirt with his two hands and
scratched away at his chest on which was to be seen an image tattooed in blue
Chinese ink, intended to represent an anchor.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There was lice in that bunk in Bridgwater, he remarked,
sure as nuts. I must get a wash tomorrow or next day. It&apos;s them black lads
I object to. I hate those buggers. Sucks your blood dry, they does.</p>
<p> Seeing they were all looking at his chest, he accomodatingly
<br><font color="green">{u21, 698}</font>
<br> dragged his shirt more open so that, on top of the timehonoured symbol of
the mariner&apos;s hope and rest, they had a full view of the figure 16 and a
young man&apos;s sideface looking frowningly rather.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Tattoo, the exhibitor explained. That was done when we
were lying becalmed off Odessa in the Black Sea under Captain Dalton. Fellow the
name of Antonio done that. There he is himself, a Greek.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Did it hurt much doing it? one asked the sailor.</p>
<p> That worthy, however, was busily engaged in collecting round the. Someway in his. Squeezing or.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; See here, he said, showing Antonio. There he is, cursing
the mate. And there he is now, he added, the same fellow, pulling the skin with
his fingers, some special knack evidently, and he laughing at a yarn.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 587}</font> </p>
<p> And in point of fact the young man named Antonio&apos;s livid face did
actually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the unreserved
admiration of everybody, including Skin-the-Goat, who this time stretched over.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ay, ay, sighed the sailor, looking down on his manly
chest. He&apos;s gone too. Ate by sharks after. Ay, ay.</p>
<p> He let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression of before.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Neat bit of work, one said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And what&apos;s the number for? loafer number two queried.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Eaten alive? a third asked the sailor.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ay, ay, sighed again the latter personage, more cheerily
this time, with some sort of a half smile, for a brief duration only, in the
direction of the questioner about the number. A Greek he was. And then he added,
with rather gallowsbird humour, considering his alleged end. <i>As bad as old
Antonio, for he left me on my ownio</i>.</p>
<p> The face of a streetwalker, glazed and haggard under a black straw hat,
peered askew round the door of the shelter, palpably reconnoitring on her own
with the object of bringing more grist to her mill. Mr Bloom turned away on the
moment,
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">flustered</span></span>
<font color="black">flusterfied</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>
but outwardly calm, and, picking up from the table the pink sheet of the Abbey
street organ which the jarvey, if such he was, had laid aside, he picked it up
and looked at the pink of the paper though why pink? His reason for so doing was
he recognised on the moment round the door the same face he had caught a
fleeting glimpse of that afternoon on Ormond Quay, the partially idiotic female,
namely, of the lane, who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you
(Mrs B.), and begged the chance of his washing. Also why washing, which seemed rather vague than not?</p>
<p> Your washing. Still, candour compelled him to admit that he had washed his
wife&apos;s undergarments when soiled in Holles street and women would and did
too a man&apos;s similar garments

loved him, that is to say. Love me, love my dirty shirt. Still, just then he
desired the female&apos;s room more than her company so it came as a genuine
relief when the keeper made her a rude sign to take herself off. Round the side of the
<br><font color="green">{u22, 588}</font>
<br> <i>Evening Telegraph</i> he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face
round the side of the door with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she
was not exactly all there, viewing with evident amusement the group of gazers
round Skipper Murphy&apos;s
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">nautical</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>
chest and then there was no more of her.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The gunboat, the keeper said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It beats me, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen, medically I am
speaking, how a wretched creature like that from the Lock Hospital, reeking with
disease, can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober senses,
if he values his health in the least. Unfortunate creature! Of course, I suppose
some man is ultimately responsible for her condition.

cause is from</a>&nbsp;&hellip;</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font></p>
<p> Stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders, merely remarking:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; In this country people sell much more than she ever had
and do a roaring trade. Fear not them that sell the body but have not power to
buy the soul. She is a bad merchant. She buys dear and sells cheap.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 700}</font> </p>
<p> The elder man, though not by any manner of means a prude, said that it was
nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be put a stop to
<i>instanter</i> to say that women of that stamp (quite apart from any
oldmaidish squeamishness on the subject), a necessary evil, were not licensed
and medically inspected by the proper authorities, a thing he could truthfully
state he as a paterfamias was a stalwart advocate of from the very
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">first</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>
start. Whoever embarked on a policy of the sort, he said, and ventilated the
matter thoroughly would confer a lasting boon on everybody concerned.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You, as a good catholic, he

talking of body and soul, believe in the soul. Or do you mean the intelligence,
the brainpower as such, as distinct from any outside object, the table, let us
say, that cup? I believe in that myself because it has been explained by
competent men as the convolutions of the

Otherwise we would never have such inventions as X rays, for instance. Do you?</p>
<p> Thus cornered, Stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">to</span></span>
<font color="black">and</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>
concentrate and remember before he could say:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; They tell me on the best authority it is a simple
substance and therefore incorruptible. It would be immortal, I understand, but
for the possibility of its annihilation by its First Cause, Who, from all I can
hear, is quite capable of adding that to the number of His other practical
jokes, <i>corruptio per se</i> and <i>corruptio per accidens</i> both being excluded by court etiquette.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 589}</font> </p>
<p> Mr Bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the
mystical finesse involved was a bit out of his depth still he felt bound to
enter a demurrer on the head of simple,

<p> Faultfinding being a proverbially bad hat, Mr Bloom thought well to stir, or
try to, the clotted sugar from the bottom and reflected with something
approaching acrimony on the Coffee Palace and its temperance (and lucrative)
work. To be sure it did a world of good, shelters such as the present one they
were in run on teetotal lines for vagrants at night, concerts, dramatic
evenings, and useful lectures

<br> a very modest remuneration indeed for her pianoplaying. The idea, he was
strongly inclined to believe, was to do good and net a profit, there being no

or something in some dried peas he remembered reading of in a cheap eatinghouse
somewhere but he couldn&apos;t remember when it was or where. Anyhow,

You ought to eat more solid food. You would feel a different man.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Liquids I can eat, Stephen said. But oblige me by taking
away that knife. I can&apos;t look at the point of it. It reminds me of Roman history.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated article, a
blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing

it to the eye, observing that the point was the least conspicuous point about it.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Our mutual friend&apos;s stories are like himself, Mr
Bloom, apropos of knives, remarked to his <i>confidante sotto voce</i>. Do you
think they are genuine? He could spin those yarns for hours on end all night
long and lie like old boots. Look at him.</p>
<p> Yet still, though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air, life was full
of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it was quite
within the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire fabrication though at
first blush there was not much inherent probability in all he said being strictly accurate.</p>
<p> He had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him and
Sherlockholmesing him up. Though a wellpreserved man of no little stamina, if a
trifle prone to baldness, there was something spurious in the cut of his
<br><font color="green">{u21, 703}</font>
<br> jib that suggested a jail delivery and it required no violent stretch of
imagination to associate such a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill fraternity.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 591}</font>
<br> He might even have done for his man, supposing it was his own case he told,
as people often did about others, namely, that he killed him himself and had
served his four or five goodlooking years in durance vile to say nothing of the
Antonio personage (no relation to the dramatic personage of identical name who
sprang from the pen of our national poet) who expiated his crimes in the
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">melodramatic</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>
manner
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">above</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>
described. On the other hand he might be only bluffing, a pardonable weakness,
because meeting unmistakable mugs, Dublin residents, like those jarvies waiting
news from abroad, would tempt any ancient mariner
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">who
sailed the ocean
seas</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font> to draw the
long bow about the schooner <i>Hesperus</i> and etcetera. And when all was said
and done, the lies a fellow told about himself couldn&apos;t probably hold a
proverbial candle to the wholesale whoppers other fellows told about him.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Mind you, I&apos;m not saying that it&apos;s all a pure
invention, he resumed. Analogous scenes are occasionally, if not often, met
with. Giants, though, that is rather a far cry, you see once in a

Aztecs, as they are called, sitting bowlegged. They couldn&apos;t straighten
their legs if you paid them because the muscles here, you see, he proceeded,
indicating on his companion the brief outline, the sinews, or whatever you like
to call them, behind the right knee, were utterly powerless from sitting that
way so long cramped up, being adored as gods. There&apos;s an example again of simple souls.</p>

some unknown listener somewhere, we have the impetuosity of Dante and the
isosceles triangle, Miss Portinari he fell in love with and Leonardo and san Tommaso Mastino.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It&apos;s in the blood, Mr Bloom acceded at once. All are
washed in the blood of the sun. Coincidence, I just happened to be in the
Kildare Street Museum today, shortly prior to our meeting, if I can so call it,
and I was just looking at those antique statues there. The splendid proportions
of hips, bosom. You simply don&apos;t knock against those kind of women here. An
exception here and there. Handsome, yes, pretty in a way you find, but I&apos;m
talking about the female form. Besides, they have so little taste in dress, most of them.

<br> Rumpled stockings &mdash; it may be, possibly is, a foible of mine, but
still it&apos;s a thing I simply hate to see.</p>
<p> Interest, however, was starting to flag somewhat all round and the others
got on to talking about accidents at sea, ships lost in a fog, collisions with
icebergs, all that sort of thing. Shipahoy, of course, had his own say to say.
He had doubled the Cape a few odd times and weathered a monsoon, a kind of wind,
in the China seas and through all those perils of the deep there was one thing,
he declared, stood to him, or words to that effect, a pious medal he had that saved him.</p>
<p> So then after that they drifted on to the wreck off Daunt&apos;s rock, wreck
of that illfated Norwegian barque &mdash; nobody could think of her name for the
moment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of Henry Campbell remembered
it, <i>Palme</i>, on Booterstown Strand, that was the talk of the town that year

he was in the act of getting his bearings, Mr Bloom, who noticed when he stood
up that he had two flasks of presumably ship&apos;s rum sticking one out of each

counterattraction in the shape of a female, who, however, had disappeared to all

away superior to England, with coal in large quantities, six million
pounds&apos; worth of pork exported every year, ten millions between butter and
eggs, and all the riches drained out of it by England levying taxes on the poor

general and all agreed that that was a fact. You could grow any mortal thing in
Irish soil, he stated, and there was Colonel Everard down there in Navan growing
tobacco. Where would you find anywhere the like of Irish bacon? But a day of
reckoning, he stated with no uncertain voice &mdash; thoroughly monopolising all
the conversation &mdash; was in store for mighty England, despite her power of
pelf on account of her crimes. There would be a fall and the greatest fall in
history. The Germans and the Japs were going to have their little look in, he
affirmed. The Boers were the beginning of the end. Brummagem England was
toppling already and her downfall would be Ireland, her Achilles heel, which he
explained to them about the vulnerable point of Achilles, the

for, pending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for, he was
fully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the channel, unless
they were much bigger fools than he took them for, rather concealed their
strength than the opposite. It was quite on a par with the quixotic idea that in
a hundred million years the coal seam of the sister island would be played out
and

reminded him Irish soldiers had as often fought for England as against her, more
so, in fact. And now, why? So the scene between the pair of them, the licensee
of the place, rumoured to be or have been Fitzharris, the famous invincible, and
the other, obviously bogus, reminded him forcibly as being on all fours with the
confidence trick, supposing, that is, it was prearranged, as the

a student of the human soul, if anything, the others seeing least of the game.
And as for the lessee or keeper, who probably wasn&apos;t the other person at
all, he (Bloom) couldn&apos;t help feeling, and most properly, it was better to
give people like that the goby

on all fours with those love vendettas of the south &mdash; have her or swing
for her &mdash; until it just struck him that Fitz, nicknamed Skin-the-Goat,
merely drove the car for the actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not,
if he was reliably informed, actually party to the ambush which, in point of
fact, was the plea some legal luminary saved his skin on. In any case that was
very ancient history by now and as for our friend, the pseudo Skin-the-etcetera,
he had transparently outlived his welcome. He ought to have either died
naturally or on the scaffold high. Like actresses, always farewell &mdash;
positively last performance &mdash; then come up smiling again. Generous to a
fault, of course, temperamental, no economising or any idea of the sort, always
snapping at the bone for the shadow. So similarly he had a very shrewd suspicion
that Mr Johnny Lever got rid of some &pound;. s. d. in the course of his
perambulations round the docks in the congenial atmosphere of the <i>Old
Ireland</i> tavern, come back to Erin and so on. Then as for the other, he had
heard not so long before the same identical lingo, as he told Stephen how he
simply but effectually silenced the offender.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He took umbrage at something or other, that muchinjured
person declared, I let slip. He called me a
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Jew</span></span>
<font color="black">jew</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>,
and in a heated fashion, offensively. So I, without deviating from plain facts
in the least, told him his God, I mean Christ, was a jew too, and all his
family, like me, though in reality I&apos;m not. That was one for him. A soft
answer turns away wrath. He hadn&apos;t a word to say for
himself<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>
as everyone saw. Am I not right?</p>
<p> He turned a long you are wrong gaze on Stephen of timorous dark pride at the
soft impeachment, with a glance also of entreaty.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 711}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>Ex quibus</i>, Stephen mumbled in a noncommital accent,
their two or four eyes conversing, <i>Christus</i> or Bloom his name is, or,
after all, any other, <i>secundum carnem</i>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Of course, Mr Bloom proceeded to stipulate, you must look
at both sides of the question. It is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to right
<br><font color="green">{u22, 598}</font>
<br> and wrong but room for improvement all round there certainly
is<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>
though every country, they say, our own distressful included, has the government
it deserves. But with a little goodwill all round. It&apos;s all very fine to
boast of mutual superiority but what about mutual equality? I resent violence
and intolerance in any shape or form. It never reaches anything or stops
anything. A revolution must come on due instalments plan. It&apos;s a patent
absurdity on the face of it to hate people because they live round the corner
and speak another vernacular, so to speak.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Memorable bloody bridge battle and seven minutes&apos;
war, Stephen assented, between Skinner&apos;s alley and Ormond market.</p>
<p> Yes, Mr Bloom thoroughly agreed, that was overwhelmingly right and the whole
world was overwhelmingly full of that sort of thing.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You just took the words out of my mouth, he said. A
hocuspocus of conflicting evidence that candidly you couldn&apos;t remotely&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> All those wretched quarrels, in his humble opinion, stirring up bad blood,
from some bump of combativeness or gland of some kind, erroneously supposed to
be about a punctilio of honour and a flag, were very largely a question of the
money question which was at the back of everything, greed and jealousy, people never knowing when to stop.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; They accuse, remarked he audibly.</p>
<p> He turned away from the others, who probably &nbsp;&hellip; and spoke nearer
to, so as the others &nbsp;&hellip; in case they&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Jews, he softly imparted in an aside in Stephen&apos;s
ear, are accused of ruining. Not a vestige of truth in it, I can safely say.
History, &mdash; would you be surprised to learn? &mdash; proves up to the hilt
Spain decayed when the Inquisition hounded the jews out and England prospered
when Cromwell, an uncommonly able ruffian, who, in other respects
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">had</span></span>

<br><font color="green">{u21, 712}</font>
<br> much to answer for, imported them. Why? Because they are practical and are
proved to be so. I don&apos;t want to indulge in any &nbsp;&hellip; because you
know the standard works on the subject, and then, orthodox as you are
&nbsp;&hellip; But in the economic, not touching religion, domain, the priest
spells poverty. Spain again, you saw in the war, compared with America. Turks.
It&apos;s in the dogma. Because if they didn&apos;t believe they&apos;d go
straight to heaven when they

&mdash; at least, so I think. That&apos;s the juggle on which the p.p.&apos;s
raise the wind on false pretences. I&apos;m, he resumed with dramatic force, as
good an Irishman as that rude person I told you about at the outset and I want to see

something in the neighbourhood of &pound;300 per annum. That&apos;s the vital

intercourse between man and man. At
least<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>
that&apos;s my idea for what it&apos;s worth. I call that patriotism. <i>Ubi
patria</i>, as we learned a small smattering of in our classical days in <i>Alma
Mater</i>, <i>vita bene</i>. Where you can live well, the sense is, if you work.</p>
<p> Over his untastable apology for a cup of coffee, listening to this synopsis
of things in general, Stephen stared at nothing in particular. He could hear, of
course, all kinds of words changing colour like those crabs about Ringsend in
the morning burrowing quickly into all colours of different sorts of the same
sand where they had a home somewhere beneath or seemed to. Then he looked up and
saw the eyes that said or didn&apos;t say the words the voice he heard said &mdash; if you work.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Count me out, he managed to remark, meaning work.</p>
<p> The eyes were surprised at this observation because as he, the person who
owned them pro. tem. observed, or rather his voice speaking did, all must work, have to, together.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I mean, of course, the other hastened to affirm, work in
the widest possible sense. Also literary labour, not merely for the kudos of the
thing. Writing for the newspapers which is the readiest channel nowadays.
That&apos;s work too. Important work. After all, from the little I know of you,
after all the money expended on your education, you are
<br><font color="green">{u21, 714}</font>
<br> entitled to recoup yourself and command your price. You have every bit as
much right to live by your pen in pursuit of your philosophy as the peasant has.
What? You both belong to Ireland, the brain and the brawn. Each is equally important.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You suspect, Stephen retorted with a sort of
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">a
half</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font> laugh, that I
may be important because I belong to

<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">for

<p class="di">&mdash; I would go a step farther, Mr Bloom insinuated.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; But I suspect, Stephen interrupted, that Ireland must be important because it belongs to me.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What belongs? queried Mr Bloom, bending. Excuse me.
Unfortunately I didn&apos;t catch the latter portion. What was it you&nbsp;&hellip;?</p>
<p> Stephen, patently crosstempered, repeated and shoved aside his mug of
coffee, or whatever you like to call it, none too politely, adding:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; We can&apos;t change the country. Let us change the subject.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 600}</font> </p>
<p> At this pertinent suggestion Mr Bloom, to change the subject, looked down,
but in a quandary,
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">not
knowing</span></span>
<font color="black"><a name="un7008ca" href="../../ff/unbs/un7all.htm#un7008ca">as

<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">which

of some kind was clearer than the other part. Needless to say, the fumes of his

<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">with<a target="foot" id="frr0218">&ordm;</a>
some

in a curious bitter way foreign to his sober state. Probably the home life, to
which Mr Bloom attached the utmost importance, had not been all that was needful
or he hadn&apos;t been familiarised with the right sort of people. With a touch
of fear for the young man beside him, whom he furtively scrutinised with an air
of some consternation, remembering he had just come back from Paris, failing to
throw much light on the subject, however, he brought to mind instances of
cultured fellows that promised so brilliantly nipped in the bud of premature
decay, and nobody to blame but themselves. For instance, there was the case of
O&apos;Callaghan<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">,

crazy faddist, respectably connected, though of inadequate means, with his mad
vagaries, among whose other gay doings he was in the habit of ostentatiously
sporting in public a suit of brown paper (a fact). And then the usual
<i>d&eacute;nouement</i> after the fun had gone on fast and furious he got
landed into hot water and had to be spirited away by a few
friends<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>

the late Mr Patrick Dignam were removed from his residence, n&deg; 9 Newbridge
Avenue, Sandymount, for interment in Glasnevin. The deceased gentleman was a
most popular and genial personality in city life and his demise, after a brief
illness, came as a great shock to citizens of all classes by whom he is deeply
regretted. The obsequies, at which many friends of the deceased were present,
were carried out by (certainly Hynes wrote it with a nudge from Corny) Messrs.
H.J. O&apos;Neill &amp; Son, 164 North Strand Road. The mourners included: Patk.

alluded to the archbishop till he added about foot and mouth with which there
could be no possible connection), overjoyed to set his mind at rest and a bit
flabbergasted at Myles Crawford&apos;s after all managing the thing, there.</p>

ways of bringing off a coup. Lovemaking damages. Though that halfbaked Lyons ran
off at a tangent in his impetuosity to get left. Of course gambling eminently
lent itself to that sort of thing though as the event turned out, the poor fool
hadn&apos;t much reason to congratulate himself on his pick, the forlorn hope. Guesswork it reduced itself to.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There was every indication they would arrive at that, he, Bloom, said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who? the other, whose hand by the way was hurt, said.</p>
<p> One morning you would open the paper, the cabman affirmed, and read, Return
of Parnell. He bet them what they liked. A Dublin fusilier was in that shelter
one night and said he saw him in South Africa. Pride it was killed him. He ought
to have done away with himself or lain low for a time after Committee Room
n&deg; 15. Then they would have gone down on their marrowbones to him to come
back
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">when he
had <a name="un4042k" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4042k">recovered his

wasn&apos;t. The coffin they brought over was full of stones. He changed his
name to De Wet, the Boer general. He made a mistake to fight the priests. And so forth and so on.</p>
<p> All the same Bloom (properly so dubbed) was rather surprised at their
memories for in nine cases out of ten it was a case of

and not singly but in their thousands, and then complete oblivion because it was
twenty odd years. Highly unlikely, of course, there was even a shadow of truth
in the stones and, even supposing, he thought a return highly inadvisable, all
things considered. Something evidently riled them in his death. Either he
petered out too tamely of acute pneumonia just when his various political arrangements were
<br><font color="green">{u21, 718}</font>
<br> nearing completion or whether it transpired he owed his death to his having
neglected to change his boots and clothes after a wetting when a cold resulted
and failing to consult a specialist he being confined to his room till he
eventually died of it or

so the
<br><font color="green">{u22, 604}</font>
<br> remark which emanated from friend cabby might be within the bounds of
possibility. Naturally then, it would prey on his mind as a born leader of men,
which undoubtedly he was, and a commanding figure a sixfooter or at any rate
five feet ten or eleven in his stockinged feet whereas Messrs So-and-So who
ruled the roost after their redeeming features were very few and far between. It
certainly pointed a moral, the idol with feet of clay. And then seventytwo of
his trusty henchmen rounding on him with mutual mudslinging. And the identical
same with murderers. You had to come back &mdash; that haunting sense kind of
drew you &mdash; to show the understudy in the title <i>r&ocirc;le</i> how to.
He saw him once on the auspicious occasion when they broke up the type in

he undoubtedly was under his frigid expression &mdash; what&apos;s bred in the
bone. Still, as regards return, you were a lucky dog if they didn&apos;t set the
terrier at you directly you got back. Then a lot of shillyshally usually
followed, Tom for and Dick and Harry against. And then, number one, you came up
against the man in possession and had to produce your credentials, like the

occasioned a fair amount of laughter among his entourage. As regards Bloom, he reflected
<br><font color="green">{u22, 605}</font>
<br> upon the historic story which had aroused extraordinary interest at the
time when the facts, to make matters worse, were made public with the usual
affectionate letters that passed between them, full of sweet nothings. First, it
was strictly platonic till
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black"><a name="un4043d" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4043d">nature
intervened</a> and</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>
an attachment sprang up between them, till it bit by bit became the talk of the
town till the staggering blow came as a welcome intelligence to not a few
evildisposed, however, who were resolved upon encouraging his downfall though
the thing was public property all along though not to anything like the
sensational extent that it subsequently blossomed into. Since their names were
coupled, though, since he was her declared favourite, where was the particular
necessity to proclaim it from the housetops, the fact, namely, that he had
shared her bedroom, which came out in the witnessbox

retrospective kind of arrangement, all seemed a kind of dream. And then coming
back was the worst thing you ever did because it went without saying you would
feel out of place as things always moved with the times. Why, as he reflected,
Irishtown Strand, a locality he had not been in for quite a number of years,

<p> Stephen, obviously addressed, looked down on the photo showing a large sized
lady, with her charms on evidence in an open fashion, as she was in the full
bloom of womanhood, in evening dress cut ostentatiously low for the occasion to
give a liberal display of bosom, with more than visions of breasts, her full
lips parted, and some perfect teeth, standing near, ostensibly with gravity, a
piano, on the rest of which was <i>In Old Madrid</i>, a ballad, pretty in its
way, which was then all the vogue. Her (the lady&apos;s) eyes, dark, large,
looked at Stephen, about to smile about something to be admired, Lafayette of
Westmoreland street, Dublin&apos;s premier photographic artist, being responsible for the esthetic execution.</p>

<p> Beside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his legal
wife who, he intimated, was the accomplished daughter of Major Brian Tweedy and
displayed at an early age remarkable proficiency as a singer having even made her bow to the public when
<br><font color="green">{u21, 722}</font>
<br> her years numbered barely sweet sixteen. As for the face, it was a speaking
likeness in expression but it did not do justice to her figure, which came in
for a lot of notice usually and which did not come out to the best advantage in
that

She could without difficulty, he said, have posed for the ensemble, not to dwell
on certain opulent curves of the. He dwelt on the female form in general
developmentally because, as it so happened, no later than that afternoon, he had
seen those Grecian statues, perfectly developed
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">as
works of art</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>, in the
National Museum. Marble could give the original, shoulders, back, all the
symmetry. All the rest, yes, puritanism. It does though, St. Joseph&apos;s
sovereign &nbsp;&hellip; whereas no photo could, because it simply wasn&apos;t art, in a word.</p>
<p> The spirit moving him, he would much have liked to follow Jack Tar&apos;s
good example and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to speak for
itself on the plea he
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">&nbsp;&hellip;</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>
so that the other could drink in the beauty for himself, her stage presence
being, frankly, a treat in itself. But it was scarcely professional etiquette
so, though it was a warm pleasant sort of a night now yet wonderfully cool for
the season considering, for sunshine after

<font color="black">&nbsp;&hellip;</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>
And he did feel a kind of need there and then to
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">follow
and</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font> satisfy a
possible need by moving a motion. Nevertheless, he sat tight, just viewing the
slightly soiled photo creased by opulent curves, none the worse for wear,
however, and looked away thoughtfully
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black"><a name="un4030p" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030p">with

<i>distingu&eacute;</i>, and impulsive into the bargain, far and away the pick
of the bunch, though you wouldn&apos;t think he had it in

yet you would. Besides he said the
<br><font color="green">{u22, 608}</font>
<br> picture was handsome which, say what you like, it was, though at the moment
she was distinctly stouter. And why not? An awful lot of makebelieve went on
about that sort of thing involving a lifelong slur with the usual splash page of
letterpress instead of being honest and aboveboard about the whole business. How
they were fated to meet and an attachment sprang up between the two so that
their names were coupled in the public eye was told in court with letters
containing the habitual compromising expressions, leaving no loophole, to show
that they cohabited and relations, when the thing ran its normal course, became
in due course intimate. Then the decree <i>nisi</i> and the King&apos;s Proctor

to show cause why and <i>nisi</i> was made absolute. But as for that the two
misdemeanants, wrapped up as they were in one another, could safely afford to
ignore it as they very largely did

was really too bad at his age. The queer suddenly things he popped out with
attracted the elder man who was several years the other&apos;s senior or like
his father. But something substantial he certainly ought to eat, were it only an
eggflip made on unadulterated maternal nutriment or, failing that, the homely Humpty Dumpty boiled.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; At what o&apos;clock did you dine? he questioned of the
slim form and tired though unwrinkled face.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 726}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Some time yesterday, Stephen said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yesterday! exclaimed Bloom till he remembered it was
already tomorrow, Friday. Ah, you mean it&apos;s after twelve.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The day before yesterday, Stephen said, improving on himself.</p>
<p> Literally astounded at this piece of intelligence Bloom reflected. Though
they didn&apos;t see eye to eye in everything, a certain analogy there somehow
was, as if both their minds were travelling, so to speak, in the one train of
thought. At his age when dabbling in politics roughly some score of years
previously when he had been a <i>quasi</i> aspirant to parliamentary honours he
too recollected in retrospect (which was a source of keen satisfaction in
itself) he had a sneaking regard for those same ultra ideas. For instance, when
the evicted tenants question, then at its first inception, bulked largely in
people&apos;s mind though not contributing a copper or pinning his faith
absolutely to its dictums, he
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black"><a name="un4030s" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030s">at
the outset</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font> in
principle, at all events, was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession, as
voicing the trend of modern opinion,a partiality, however, he was subsequently
partially cured of, and even was twitted with going a step further than Michael
Davitt in the

views he
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">at one
time</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font> inculcated
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">as a
backtothelander</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>,
which was one reason he strongly resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion
<br><font color="green">{u22, 611}</font>
<br> at the gathering of the clans in Barney Kiernan&apos;s so that he, though
often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of mortals, be it
repeated, departed from his customary habit to give him
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">(</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>
metaphorically<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">)</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>
one in the gizzard though, so far as politics
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">themselves</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>
were concerned, he was only too conscious of the casualties invariably resulting
from propaganda and displays of animosity and the misery and suffering it
entailed as a foregone conclusion on fine young fellows, chiefly, destruction of the fittest, in a word.</p>
<p> Anyhow, upon weighing up the pros and cons, getting on for one as it was, it
was high time to be retiring for the night. The crux was it was a bit risky to
bring him home as eventualities might possibly ensue as on the night he
misguidedly brought home a dog (breed unknown) with a lame paw,not that the
cases were either identical or the reverse, though he had hurt his hand too, to
Ontario Terrace, as he very distinctly remembered. On the other hand it was
altogether
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">far and
away</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font> too late for
the Sandymount or Sandycove suggestion so that he was in some perplexity as to
which of the two
alternatives<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span>
<font color="black">&nbsp;&hellip;</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>
Everything pointed to the fact that it behoved him to avail himself to the full
of the opportunity, all things considered. His initial impression was
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">that</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>
he was a
<font color="red"><sup><small>|v6</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">shade</span></span>
<font color="black">bit<a target="foot" id="frr0313">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>v6|</small></sup></font>
standoffish or not over effusive but it grew on him someway. For one thing he
mightn&apos;t what you call jump at the idea, if approached, and what mostly
worried him was he didn&apos;t know how to lead up to it or word it exactly,
supposing he did entertain the proposal, as it would afford him very great
personal pleasure if he would allow him to help to put coin in his way or some
wardrobe, if found suitable. At all events he wound up by concluding, eschewing
for the nonce hidebound precedent, a cup of Epps&apos;s cocoa and a shakedown
for the night plus the use of a rug or two and overcoat doubled into a pillow.
At least he would be in safe hands and as warm as a toast on a trivet. He failed
to perceive any very vast amount of harm in
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">that</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>
always with the proviso no rumpus of any sort was kicked up. A move had to be
made because that merry old soul, the grasswidower in question, didn&apos;t
appear in any particular hurry to wend his way home to his dearly beloved
Queenstown and it was highly likely some sponger&apos;s bawdyhouse of retired
beauties off Sheriff street lower would be the best clue to that equivocal
character&apos;s whereabouts for a few days to come, alternately racking their
feelings (the mermaids&apos;) with sixchamber revolver anecdotes verging on the

<p> The best plan clearly being to clear out, the remainder being plain sailing,
he beckoned, while prudently pocketing the photo, to the keeper of the shanty,

brain. Education (the genuine article), literature, journalism, prize titbits,

<p> The cabby read out of the paper he had got hold of that the former viceroy,
earl Cadogan, had presided at the cabdriver&apos;s association dinner in London

Then the old specimen in the corner read out that Sir Anthony MacDonnell had

not to outstay their welcome having first and foremost taken the wise precaution
to motion to mine host

<p class="di">&mdash; Come, he counselled, to close the <i>s&eacute;ance</i>.</p>
<p> Seeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear, they left the shelter

<p> To which impromptu the neverfailing Bloom replied without a moment&apos;s hesitation, saying straight off:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; To sweep the floor in the morning.</p>
<p> So saying he skipped around, nimbly considering, frankly at the same time
apologetic to get on his companion&apos;s right, a habit of his, by the

air was certainly now a treat to breathe though Stephen was a bit weak on his pins.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It will (the air) do you good, Bloom said, meaning also
the walk, in a moment. The only thing is to walk

<p> Accordingly he passed his left arm in Stephen&apos;s right and led him on accordingly.</p>

<p> Anyhow, they passed the sentrybox with stones, brazier, etc where the
municipal supernumerary, ex Gumley, was still to all intents and purposes
wrapped in the arms of Murphy, as the adage has it, dreaming of fresh fields and
pastures new. And apropos of coffin of stones, the analogy was not bad, as it
was in fact a stoning to death on the part of seventytwo out of eighty odd
constituencies that ratted at the time of the split and chiefly the belauded
peasant class, probably the selfsame evicted tenants he had put in their holdings.</p>
<p> So they passed on to chatting about music, a form of art for which Bloom, as
a pure amateur, possessed the greatest love, as they made tracks arm-in-arm
across Beresford Place. Wagnerian music, though confessedly grand in its way,
was a bit too heavy for Bloom <font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">and hard
<br><font color="green">{u21, 731}</font>
<br> to follow at the first
go-off</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font> but the music
of Mercadante&apos;s <i>Huguenots</i>, Meyerbeer&apos;s <i>Seven Last Words on

as such. He also yielded to none in his admiration of Rossini&apos;s <i>Stabat

Marion Tweedy, made a hit, a veritable sensation, he might even say,

virtuosi rather. There was the unanimous opinion that there was none to come up
to
her<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>
and<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>
suffice it to say in a place of worship for music of a sacred character, there
was a generally voiced desire for an encore. On the whole, though favouring
preferably light opera of the <i>Don Giovanni</i> description, and
<i>Martha</i>, a gem in its line, he had a <i>penchant</i>, though with only a
surface knowledge, for the severe classical school such as Mendelssohn. And
talking of that, taking it for granted he knew all about the old favourites, he
mentioned <i>par excellence</i> Lionel&apos;s air in <i>Martha</i>,
<i>M&apos;appari</i>, which, curiously enough, he heard, or overheard, to be
more accurate, on yesterday, a privilege he keenly appreciated, from the lips of
Stephen&apos;s respected father, sung to perfection, a study of the number, in
fact which made all the others take a back seat. Stephen, in reply to a politely
put query, said he didn&apos;t but launched out into praises of
Shakespeare&apos;s songs, at least of in or about that period, the lutenist
Dowland who lived in Fetter Lane near Gerard the herbalist, who <i>anno ludendo
hausi, Doulandus</i>, an instrument he was contemplating purchasing from Mr
Arnold Dolmetsch, whom Bloom did not quite recall, though the name certainly
sounded familiar, for sixtyfive guineas and Farnaby and son with their
<i>dux</i> and <i>comes</i>
conceits<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>
and Byrd (William), who played the virginals, he said, in the Queen&apos;s Chapel or anywhere else he found
<br><font color="green">{u21, 732}</font>
<br> them and one Tomkins who made toys or
airs<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>
and John Bull.</p>
<p> On the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond the
swingchains a horse, dragging a sweeper, paced on the paven ground, brushing a
long swathe of mire
up<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>
so that with the noise Bloom was not perfectly certain whether he had caught
aright the allusion to sixtyfive guineas and John Bull. He inquired if it was
John Bull the political celebrity of that ilk, as it struck him, the two identical names, as a striking coincidence.</p>
<p> By the chains, the horse slowly swerved to turn, which perceiving,
Bloom<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">,
who was keeping <a name="un4055ce" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4055ce">a
sharp lookout</a> as
usual,<a target="foot" id="frr0352">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>
plucked the other&apos;s sleeve gently, jocosely remarking:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Our lives are in peril tonight. Beware of the steamroller.</p>
<p> They thereupon stopped. Bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">anything
like</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font> sixtyfive
guineas, suddenly in evidence in the dark quite near, so that it seemed new, a
different grouping of bones and even flesh, because palpably it was a
fourwalker, a hipshaker,
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black"><a name="un5012at" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5012at">a
blackbuttocker</a>,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>
a taildangler, a headhanger, putting his hind foot foremost the while the lord of his creation
<br><font color="green">{u22, 616}</font>
<br> sat on the perch, busy with his thoughts. But such a good poor brute, he
was sorry he hadn&apos;t a lump of sugar but, as he wisely reflected, you could
scarcely be prepared for every emergency that might crop up. He was just a big
nervous foolish noodly kind of a horse, without a
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">second</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>
care in the world. But even a dog, he reflected, take that mongrel in Barney
Kiernan&apos;s, of the same size, would be a holy horror to face. But it was no
animal&apos;s fault in particular if he was built that
way<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>
like the camel, ship of the desert, distilling grapes into potheen in his hump.
Nine tenths of them all could be caged or trained, nothing beyond the art of man
barring the bees; whale with a harpoon hairpin, alligator, tickle the small of
his back and he sees the joke; chalk a circle for a rooster; tiger, my eagle
eye. These timely reflections anent the brutes occupied his mind, somewhat
distracted from Stephen&apos;s words, while the ship of the street was
manoeuvring and Stephen went on about the highly interesting
old<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span>
<font color="black">&nbsp;&hellip;</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font></p>
<p class="di">&mdash;

<br><font color="green">{u21, 733}</font>
<br> would have the greatest of pleasure in making your acquaintance as she is
passionately attached to music of any kind.</p>
<p> He looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of Stephen, image
of his mother, which was not quite the same as the usual blackguard type they
unquestionably had an indubitable hankering after as he was perhaps not that way built.</p>
<p> Still, supposing he had his father&apos;s gift, as he more than suspected,
it opened up new vistas in his mind, such as Lady Fingall&apos;s Irish
industries concert on the preceding Monday, and aristocracy in general.</p>
<p> Exquisite variations he was now describing on an air <i>Youth here has
End</i> by Jans Pieter Sweelinck, a Dutchman of Amsterdam where the frows come
from. Even more he liked an old German song of Johannes Jeep about the clear sea
and the voices of sirens, sweet murderers of men, which boggled Bloom a bit:</p>
<p class="set"><i>Von der Sirenen Listigkeit</i>
<br> <i>Tun die Poeten dichten.</i></p>
<p> These opening bars he sang and translated
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black"><i>extempore</i></font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>.
Bloom, nodding, said he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means, which he did.</p>
<p> A phenomenally beautiful
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">tenor</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>
voice like that, the rarest of boons, which Bloom appreciated at the
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">very</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>
first note he got out, could easily, if properly
<br><font color="green">{u22, 617}</font>
<br> handled by some recognised authority on voice production such as
Barraclough and being able to read music into the bargain, command its own price
where baritones were ten a penny and procure for its fortunate possessor in the
near future an <i>entr&eacute;e</i> into fashionable houses in the best
residential quarters of financial magnates in a large way of business and titled
people where, with his university degree of B.A.

bearing to all the more influence the good impression, he would infallibly score
a distinct success, being blessed with brains and other requisites, if his
clothes were properly attended to so as to the better worm his way into their
good graces as he, a youthful tyro in society&apos;s sartorial niceties, hardly understood how a little thing
<br><font color="green">{u21, 734}</font>
<br> like that could militate against you.

but a step in the required direction it was, beyond yea or nay, and both
monetarily and mentally it contained no reflection on his dignity in the
smallest and it often turned in uncommonly handy to be handed a cheque at a
muchneeded moment when every little helped. Besides, though taste latterly had
deteriorated to a degree, original music like that, different from the
conventional rut, would rapidly have a great vogue, as it would be a decided
novelty for Dublin&apos;s musical world after the usual hackneyed run of catchy
tenor solos. Yes, beyond a shadow of a doubt, he could, with all the cards in
his hand,
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">and</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>
he had a capital opening to make a name for himself and win a high place in the

and, booking ahead, give a grand concert for the patrons of the King street
house, given a backerup, if one were forthcoming to kick him upstairs, so to
speak, &mdash; a big <i>if</i>, however &mdash; with some impetus of the goahead

and later on, at a propitious opportunity he purposed (Bloom did), without
anyway prying into his private affairs
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">on the

him to sever his connection with a certain budding practitioner, who, he
noticed, was prone to disparage, and even, to a slight extent, with some

it<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">;</span></span><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>
which, in Bloom&apos;s humble opinion, threw a nasty sidelight on that side of a
person&apos;s character &mdash; no pun intended.</p>
<p> The horse, having reached the end of his tether, so to speak, halted, and,
rearing high a proud feathering tail, added his quota by letting fall on the
floor, which the brush would soon brush up and polish, three smoking globes of
turds. Slowly, three times, one after another, from a full crupper, he mired.
And humanely his driver waited till he (or she) had ended, patient in his scythed car.</p>
<p> Side by side Bloom, profiting by the <i>contretemps</i>, with Stephen passed
through the gap of the chains, divided by the upright, and, stepping over a
strand of mire, went across towards Gardiner street lower, Stephen singing more
boldly, but not loudly, the end of the ballad:</p>
<p class="set"><i>Und alle Schiffe br&uuml;cken</i>.</p>
<p> The driver never said a
word<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">,
<a name="un4055e" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4055e">good, bad or
indifferent</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>. He
merely watched the two figures, both black &mdash; one full, one lean &mdash;
walk towards the railway bridge. As they walked, they at times stopped and
walked again, continuing their <i>t&ecirc;te &agrave; t&ecirc;te</i> (which of
course he was well out of), about sirens, enemies of man&apos;s reason, and a
number of other topics of the same category, usurpers, historical cases of the kind.</p>  </main>
