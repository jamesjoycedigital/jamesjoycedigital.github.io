<p> Preparatory to anything else Mr Bloom brushed off the greater bulk of the
shavings and handed Stephen the hat and ashplant and bucked him up generally in
<a name="s16005v" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16005v">good Samaritan</a>
fashion which he very badly needed. His (Stephen&apos;s) mind was not exactly
what you would call wandering but a bit unsteady and on his expressed desire for
something to drink Mr Bloom in view of the hour it was and there being no pump
of Vartry water available for their
<a name="s16003a" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16003a">ablutions</a> let
alone drinking purposes
<a name="s16002at" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002at">hit upon an
expedient</a> by suggesting the propriety of the cabman&apos;s shelter, as it
was called, near Butt bridge. But how to get there was the rub. For the nonce he
was rather nonplussed but inasmuch<a target="foot" id="frz0028">&ordm;</a> as
the duty devolved upon him he pondered
<a name="un4031cm" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031cm">ways and means</a>
during which Stephen repeatedly yawned. So far as he could see he was rather
<a name="s16001b" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001b">pale in the face</a>
so that <a name="un6015bv" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6015bv">it occurred
to him</a> as highly advisable to get a conveyance of some description
<a name="un4031cp" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031cp">in
this</a><a target="foot" id="frz0029">&ordm;</a>
<a name="un4031cp" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031cp">then condition</a>
always assuming that there was such a thing to be found. Accordingly after a few
such preliminaries as brushing they both walked together along Beaver street or,
more properly lane as far as the farrier&apos;s and the distinctly fetid
atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of Montgomery street where they
made tracks to the left, thence
<a name="un4030ch" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030ch">debouching</a> into
Amiens street round by the corner of Dan Bergin&apos;s. But
<a name="s16028q" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16028q">as he fully
anticipated</a> there was not a sign of a
<a name="un4031cl" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031cl">Jehu</a> plying for
hire anywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler, probably engaged by some fellows
inside on the spree, outside the North Star hotel and there was no symptom of
its budging an inch when Mr Bloom, who was
<a name="un6015do" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6015do">anything but</a> a
loud whistler, endeavoured to hail it by emitting a kind of a whistle, holding his arms arched over his head, twice.</p>
<p> This was a quandary but,
<a name="s16002af" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002af">bringing common
sense to bear on it</a>, evidently there was nothing for it but put a good face
on the matter and foot it which they accordingly did. So, bevelling around by
Mullett&apos;s and the Signal House they proceeded in the direction of Amiens
street railway terminus, Mr Bloom being
<a name="s16009h" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16009h">handicapped by the
circumstance</a> that one of the back buttons of his trousers had,
<a name="s16002ae" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002ae">to vary the
adage</a>, gone the way of all buttons though he heroically
<a name="s16001e" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001e">made light of</a> the
mischance. So they
<a name="s15036av" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15036av">dandered</a> along
past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a fare or a jarvey.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 2}</font>
<br> As it so happened a Dublin United Tramways Company&apos;s sandstrewer
happening to be returning and the elder man recounted to his companion a propos
of the incident his own truly miraculous escape of some little while back. They
passed the main entrance of the Great Northern railway station, the starting
point for Belfast, where of course all traffic was suspended at that late hour
and passing the backdoor of the morgue (a not very enticing locality, not to say
<a name="s16005o" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16005o">gruesome</a>, more
especially at night,<a target="foot" id="frz0030">&ordm;</a> ultimately gained
the Dock Tavern and in due course turned into Store street, famous for its
<a name="s16017bd" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16017bd">C division police
station</a>. Between this point and the high at present unlit warehouses of
Beresford Place Stephen thought to think of Ibsen, associated with Baird&apos;s
the stonecutter&apos;s in his mind somehow in Talbot place, first turning on the
right, while the other who was acting as his <u>fidus Achates</u> inhaled with
internal satisfaction the smell of James Rourke&apos;s city bakery, situated
quite close to where they were, the very
<a name="s16009al" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16009al">palatable</a> odour
indeed of our daily bread, of all commodities of the public the primary and most
indispensable. Bread, the staff of life, earn your bread, O tell me where is
fancy bread, at Rourke&apos;s the baker&apos;s it is said.</p>
<p> En route to his taciturn and, not to put too fine a point on it, not yet
perfectly sober companion Mr Bloom who
<a name="un6015ek" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6015ek">at all events</a>
was in complete possession of his faculties,
<a name="s16013v" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16013v">never more so</a>,
spoke <a name="s16011v" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16011v">a word of
caution</a> <u>re</u> the dangers of nighttown, which, barely permissible once
in a while though
<a name="s16005ag" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16005ag">not as a habitual
practice</a>, was of the nature of a regular deathtrap for young fellows of his
age particularly. Highly providential<a target="foot" id="frz0031">&ordm;</a>
was the appearance on the scene of Corny Kelleher when Stephen was blissfully
unconscious but for that man in the gap the finis might have been the bridewell
and an appearance in the court next day before Mr Tobias or, he being the
solicitor rather, old Wall, he meant to say, or Mahony. A lot of those policemen
were admittedly unscrupulous and, as Mr Bloom put it, recalling a case or two in
the A division in Clanbrassil street, prepared to swear a hole through a ten
gallon pot. Never <a name="s16013ak" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16013ak">on
the spot</a> when wanted but in quiet parts of the city, Pembroke road for
example, they were well in evidence, the
<a name="un5012d" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5012d">obvious</a> reason
being they were paid to protect the upper classes. Another thing he commented on
was <a name="s16021dk" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16021dk">equipping
soldiers with arms of any kind which was tantamount to inciting them</a> against
civilians. You frittered away your time, he very sensibly remarked, and health
and also character besides which
<a name="s16006t" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16006t">fast women</a> of the
<a name="s16005ah" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16005ah">demimonde</a> ran away
<br><font color="green">{ms, 3}</font>
<br> with a lot of
<a name="s16010ao" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16010ao">&pound;.s.d.</a>
into the bargain and the greatest danger of all was who you got drunk with. Most
of all he commented adversely on the desertion of Stephen by all his pubhunting
confr&egrave;res but one,
<a name="s16002ah" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002ah">a most glaring piece
of</a> ratting <a name="s16001av" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001av">under all the circs</a>.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And that one was Judas, Stephen said, who up to then had said nothing of any kind.</p>
<p> Discussing these and kindred topics they passed under the Loop Line bridge
where a brazier of coke burning in front of a sentrybox or something like one
attracted their rather lagging footsteps. Stephen stopped for no special reason
to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by the light emanating from the
brazier he could just make out the darker figure of the corporation
watchman<a target="foot" id="frz0032">&ordm;</a> inside the gloom of the
sentrybox. He began to remember that this had happened or had been mentioned as
having happened before but it cost him no small effort before he remembered that
he recognised in the sentry a
<a name="un5017cl" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5017cl"><u>quondam</u></a>
friend of his father&apos;s, Gumley. To avoid a meeting he drew nearer to the pillars of the railway bridge.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Someone saluted you<a target="foot" id="frz0033">&ordm;</a> Mr Bloom said.</p>
<p> <a name="s16021bp" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16021bp">A figure on the
prowl evidently under the arches saluted again</a>, calling:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Night!</p>
<p> Stephen of course started rather
dizzily<a target="foot" id="frz0034">&ordm;</a> and stopped to
<a name="s16005e" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16005e">return the
compliment</a>. Mr Bloom actuated by motives of delicacy moved off but
nevertheless remained on the <u>qui vive</u> with just a shade of anxiety.
Though unusual in Dublin he knew that it was not by any means unknown for
<a name="s16026bt" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16026bt">desperadoes</a> who
had next to nothing to live on to be abroad waylaying
<a name="s16009ab" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16009ab">and generally
terrorising</a> peaceable
<a name="un4030c" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030c">pedestrians</a> in
some secluded spot outside the city proper, famished loiterers they might be
<a name="s16009p" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16009p">hanging about
there</a> or simply
<a name="un4031ea" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031ea">marauders</a> ready
to decamp with anything and everything at a moment&apos;s notice,
<a name="s16026bt" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16026bt">your money or your life</a>.</p>
<p> Stephen, <a name="s16016o" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16016o">that
is</a> when the accosting figure came to close quarters, though he was not
<a name="s16015ac" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16015ac">in an</a> over
<a name="s16015ac" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16015ac">sober state</a>
himself recognised Corly&apos;s breath redolent of rotten cornjuice. Lord John
Corly some called him and his genealogy came about in this wise. He was the
eldest son of inspector Corly of the G division, lately
<br><font color="green">{ms, 4}</font>
<br> deceased<a target="foot" id="frz0035">&ordm;</a> who had married a certain
Katherine Brophy, the daughter of a Louth farmer. His grandfather Patrick
Michael Corly of New Ross had married the widow of a publican there whose maiden
name had been Katherine (also) Talbot. Rumour had it (though not proved) that
she descended <a name="s16021dd" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16021dd">from
the house of</a> the lords Talbot de Malahide in whose mansion her mother or
aunt or some relative, a woman, as
<a name="s16005t" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16005t">the tale went</a>, of
extreme beauty, had
<a name="s16001bc" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001bc">enjoyed the
distinction</a> of being
<a name="s16021cf" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16021cf">in service in the
washkitchen</a>. This therefore was the reason why the still comparatively young
though dissolute man who now addressed Stephen was spoken of by some with
facetious
<a name="s16001an" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001an">proclivities</a><a target="foot" id="frz0036">&ordm;</a>
as Lord John Corly.</p>
<p> <a name="s16013ao" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16013ao">Taking Stephen
on one side</a> he had the customary doleful ditty to tell. Not as much as a
farthing to purchase a night&apos;s lodgings. His friends had all deserted him.
Furthermore he had a row with Lenehan and called him to Stephen a mean bloody
<a name="s16025e" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16025e">swab</a>
<a name="un4031dk" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031dk">with a sprinkling of
a number of other uncalled for expressions</a>.
<a name="s16021cp" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16021cp">He was out of a job
and implored of Stephen to tell him where on God&apos;s earth he could get
something</a>, anything at all, to do. No, it was the daughter of the mother in
the washkitchen that was
<a name="s16013cd" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16013cd">fostersister</a> to
the heir of the house, both occurrences happening at the same time. Anyhow he was all in.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I wouldn&apos;t ask you only, pursued he, on my solemn
oath and God knows I&apos;m on the rocks</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;
<a name="s16021bo" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16021bo">There&apos;ll be a
job tomorrow or next day, Stephen told him,</a>
<a name="s16021cq" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16021cq">in a boys&apos;
school at Dalkey for a gentleman usher. Mr Garrett Deasy. Try it.</a> You may mention my name.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ah, God, Corley replied, sure I couldn&apos;t teach in a
school, man. I was never one of your bright ones,
<a name="un6015ac" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6015ac">he added with a half
laugh</a>. I got stuck twice in the junior at the christian brothers.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I have no place to sleep myself, Stephen informed him.</p>
<p> Corley at the first go-off was inclined to suspect it was
<a name="s16005ac" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16005ac">something to do
with</a> Stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody tart off
the street. <a name="s16021ct" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16021ct">There
was a dosshouse in Marlborough street</a>, Mrs Maloney&apos;s, but it was only a
tanner touch and full of undesirables but M&apos;Conachie told him you got
<br><font color="green">{ms, 5}</font>
<br> a decent enough do in the Brazen Head over in Winetavern street for a bob.
He was starving too though he hadn&apos;t said a word about it.</p>
<p> Though <a name="s16014ba" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16014ba">this sort
of thing</a> went on every other night or very near it still Stephen&apos;s
feelings got the better of him though he knew that Corley&apos;s brandnew
rigmarole on a par with the others was hardly deserving of much credence.
However <a name="jn2037e" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2037e"><u>haud
ignarus malorum miseris succurrere disco etcetera</u></a> especially
<a name="s16001cs" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001cs">as luck would have
it</a> he <a name="s16005c" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16005c">got paid</a>
his screw <a name="s16005c" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16005c">after every
middle of the month</a> on the sixteenth which was the date of the month as a
matter of fact. But the cream of the joke was nothing would get it out of
Corley&apos;s head that he was living in affluence and hadn&apos;t a thing to do
but hand out the needful. Whereas. He put his hand in a pocket anyhow not with
the idea of finding any food there but thinking he might lend him anything up to
a bob or so <a name="un4030db" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030db">in
lieu</a> so that <a name="un4030ai" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030ai">he
might endeavour</a> <a name="un4030b" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030b">at
all events</a>
<a name="un4030ai" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030ai">and</a>
<a name="un4031cv" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031cv">get sufficient to
eat</a> but <a name="s16010m" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16010m">the result
was in the negative</a> for he found his money missing. A few broken biscuits
were all. He tried his hardest to
<a name="un4030bh" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030bh">recollect</a> for
the moment whether he had lost as well he might have or left because in that
<a name="un4031bp" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031bp">contingency</a> it
was not a pleasant lookout, very much the reverse in fact. He was altogether too
fagged out to institute a thorough search though he tried to
<a name="un4030bh" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030bh">recollect</a>. About
biscuits he dimly remembered. Who now exactly gave them he wondered or where was
or did he buy. However in another pocket he came across what he surmised in the
dark were pennies, <a name="s16005b" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16005b">erroneously</a> however.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Those are halfcrowns, man, Corley corrected him.</p>
<p> And so <a name="un4030r" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030r">in point of
fact</a> they turned out to be. Stephen anyhow lent him one of them.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Thanks, Corley answered, you&apos;re a gentleman.
I&apos;ll pay you back one time. Who&apos;s that with you? I saw him a few times
with Boylan, the billsticker. You might put in a good word for us to get me
taken on there. I&apos;d carry a sandwichboard only the girl in the office told
me they&apos;re full up for the next three weeks, man. God, you&apos;ve to
<a name="un4030ds" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030ds">book ahead</a>, man,
you&apos;d think it was for the Carl Rosa. I don&apos;t give a shite anyway so long as I get a job.</p>
<p> <a name="s16021bq" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16021bq">Subsequently
being not quite so down in the mouth after the two and six he got he informed Stephen about a fellow</a> by the name
<br><font color="green">{ms, 6}</font>
<br> of Bags Comisky that he said Stephen knew well out of Fulham&apos;s, the
shipchandler&apos;s, bookkeeper<a target="foot" id="frz0037">&ordm;</a> there
that used to be often round in
<a name="un4037ba" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4037ba">Nagle&apos;s</a>
back with O&apos;Mara and a little chap with a stutter called Tighe. Anyhow he
was lagged the night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and disorderly
and <a name="s16022f" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16022f">refusing to go with the constable</a>.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the
cobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation
watchman&apos;s sentrybox who evidently a
<a name="s16006o" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16006o">glutton for work</a>,
it struck him, was having a quiet forty winks on his own private account while
Dublin slept. He threw an odd eye at the same time now and then at
Stephen&apos;s
<a name="un5017cm" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5017cm">interlocutor</a> as
if he had seen that nobleman somewhere or other. Being a person who could
<a name="s16003r" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16003r">give points to</a> not
a few in point of shrewd observation he also remarked on his very dilapidated
hat and <a name="s16001n" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001n">slouchy</a>
wearing apparel generally testifying to a
<a name="s16002cd" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002cd">chronic
impecuniosity</a>.
<a name="s16009g" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16009g">Palpably</a> he was
one of his hangers on but
<a name="s16003ap" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16003ap">for the matter of
that</a> of that it was
<a name="un4036h" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4036h">merely a question
of</a> one preying on another all round, in every deep, so to put it, a deeper
depth. In any case he had a consummate amount of assurance intercepting people
at that hour of the night or morning.
<a name="s16004p" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16004p">Pretty thick that</a> was certainly.</p>
<p> The pair parted company and Stephen rejoined Mr Bloom who was
<a name="s15005p" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15005p">not without</a>
perceiving that he had succumbed to the blandiloquence of the other
<a name="un4030do" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030do">parasite</a>.
Alluding to the encounter he said, laughing, Stephen,
<a name="s16016o" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16016o">that is</a>:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He is down on his luck. He asked me to ask you to ask
somebody named Boylan, a billsticker, to give him a job as a sandwichman.</p>
<p> At this intelligence Mr Bloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a moment
or so in the direction of Burgh quay whereupon he observed
<a name="s16013u" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16013u">evasively</a>:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Everybody gets a certain ration of luck, they say.
<a name="s16001aq" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001aq">Now you mention
it</a> his face was familiar to me. But,
<a name="s16009ag" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16009ag">leaving that for the
moment</a>, how much did you part with, he queried, if I am not too
<a name="un4031av" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031av">inquisitive</a>?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Half a crown, Stephen responded. I daresay he needs it to sleep somewhere.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Needs! Mr Bloom
<a name="s16004a" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16004a">ejaculated</a>,
<a name="un4031bf" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031bf">I guarantee</a> he
<a name="un4031be" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031be">invariably</a> does.
Everyone according to his needs or everyone according to his deeds. Where will
you sleep yourself?
<a name="s16021be" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16021be">Walking to Sandycove
is out of the question.</a> And <a name="s16010bn" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16010bn">even
<br><font color="green">{ms, 6a}</font>
<br> supposing</a> you did you won&apos;t get in after what occurred at Westland row station
<br><font color="green">{ms, 7}</font>
<br> Simply fag out there for nothing. I don&apos;t mean to presume to dictate
to you in the slightest degree but why did you leave your father&apos;s house?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; To seek misfortune, Stephen replied.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I met
<a name="s16017bl" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16017bl">your respected
father</a> <a name="s16002bp" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002bp">on a
recent occasion</a>, Mr Bloom remarked, today in fact, or
<a name="un4037cl" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4037cl">to be strictly
accurate</a>, <a name="un4031bc" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031bc">on
yesterday</a>. <a name="s16017bl" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16017bl">Where
does he live</a> at present? I gathered in the course of conversation that he had moved.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;
<a name="s16017bl" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16017bl">I believe he is in
Dublin somewhere</a>, Stephen answered unconcernedly. Why?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A gifted man, Mr Bloom said of
<a name="s16013aq" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16013aq">Mr Dedalus
senior</a>, in more respects than one. He takes great pride, quite legitimate,
out of you. You could go back perhaps, he hasarded, still thinking of the very
unpleasant scene at Westland Row terminus when it was perfectly evident that the
other two, Mulligan, that is, and that English tourist friend of his were
patently trying as if the whole station belonged to them to give Stephen the slip in the confusion, which they did.</p>
<p> There was no response
<a name="s16001bt" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001bt">forthcoming</a> to
the suggestion however, such as it was, Stephen&apos;s mind&apos;s eye being too
busily engaged in repicturing his family hearth the last time he saw it with
<a name="s16017aa" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16017aa">his sister Dilly
sitting by the ingle, her hair hanging down waiting for some weak Trinidad shell
cocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he could
drink it with the oatmealwater for milk after the Friday herrings they had eaten
at two a penny with an egg apiece for Maggie, Boody and Katey, the cat meanwhile
under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells and charred fish heads and bones
on a square of brown paper,</a> in accordance with the third precept of the
church to fast and abstain on the days commanded, it being quarter tense or if not, ember days.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, Mr Bloom repeated again, I wouldn&apos;t personally
<a name="s16004ai" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16004ai">repose</a> much
trust in that
<a name="un6015ah" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6015ah">boon</a> companion
of yours who contributes the
<a name="s16002bl" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002bl">humorous
element</a>, Dr Mulligan, as a
<a name="un4031cw" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031cw">guide, philosopher
and friend</a> if I were you. He knows which side his bread is buttered on
though in all probability
<a name="un4031bv" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031bv">he never realised
what it is to be without</a> regular meals. Of course you didn&apos;t notice as
much as I did. But
<a name="un4030ap" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030ap">it wouldn&apos;t
occasion me the least surprise to learn</a> that
<a name="s15024ap" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15024ap">a pinch of
tobacco</a> or <a name="un4030ap" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030ap">some
narcotic was put in your drink</a> for some
<a name="un4030au" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030au">ulterior object</a>.</p>
<p> He understood however from
<br><font color="green">{ms, 8}</font>
<br> all he heard that Dr Mulligan was a
<a name="s16015e" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16015e">versatile</a>
<a name="s16023o" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16023o">allround man</a> who
was <a name="un4031bk" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031bk">rapidly coming
to the fore</a> in his line in addition to which
<a name="s16010aj" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16010aj">professional
status</a> his rescue of that man from certain drowning at Skerries, or Malahide
was it?, was, <a name="un4031t" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031t">he was
bound to admit</a><a target="foot" id="frz0038">&ordm;</a> an exceedingly
<a name="un4030bq" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030bq">plucky deed</a> so
that he was utterly at a loss to fathom what
<a name="s16002r" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002r">earthly reason</a>
could be at the back of it except he put it down to jealousy.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Except he is what they call picking your
<a name="un4031h" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031h">brains</a>, he ventured to say.</p>
<p> The glance of half solicitude half curiosity
<a name="s16006n" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16006n">augmented</a> by
friendliness which he gave at Stephen&apos;s at present morose expression of
features did not throw a flood of light, none at all in
fact<a target="foot" id="frz0039">&ordm;</a> on the problem as to whether he had
let himself be badly taken in to judge by
<a name="s16009as" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16009as">two or three remarks
he let drop</a> or on the other hand saw through the affair and
<a name="s16002k" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002k">for some reason or
other best known to himself</a> allowed matters to more or less. Grinding
poverty did have that effect and he more than
<a name="un7007cj" href="../../ff/unbs/un7all.htm#un7007cj">conjectured</a>
that, highly educated though he was, he experienced no little difficulty in making both ends meet.</p>
<p> Adjacent to the men&apos;s public urinal they perceived an icecream car
round round which a group of presumably Italians were getting rid of voluble
expressions in their language in a particularly animated way.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Puttana madonna, che ci dia i quattrini! Ho ragione? Culo rotto!</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Intendiamoci. Mezzo sovrano pi&ugrave;&nbsp;&hellip;.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Dice lui per&ograve;!</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Mezzo.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Farabutto! Mortacci sui!</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ma ascolta! Cinque la testa pi&ugrave;&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> Mr Bloom and Stephen entered the cabman&apos;s shelter, an unpretentious
<a name="s16005r" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16005r">wooden structure</a>,
where, <a name="s16002q" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002q">prior to
then</a>, he had
<a name="s16010af" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16010af">rarely if ever</a>
been before, the former having
previously<a target="foot" id="frz0040">&ordm;</a> whispered to
<a name="s15053ae" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15053ae">the latter</a> a few
hints <a name="un4030dk" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030dk">anent</a> the
keeper of it said to be the once famous Skin-the-Goat, Fitzharris, the
invincible, though he could not vouch for the actual facts which quite possibly
there was not one vestige of truth in. They took their seats in a discreet
corner only to be greeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous collection
of waifs and strays already there engaged in eating and drinking diversified by
conversation for whom they
<a name="s16003aj" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16003aj">seemingly</a> formed
<a name="s16003p" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16003p">an object of curiosity</a>.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Now
<a name="s16010bj" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16010bj">touching a cup of
coffee</a>, Mr Bloom suggested, and something
<a name="s16001k" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001k">in the shape of solid food</a>, say, a roll of some sort.</p>
<p> He ordered these commodities quietly. The jarvies or stevedores or whatever
they were turned their eyes,
<a name="s16004d" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16004d">apparently</a>
dissatisfied, away though one redbearded
<a name="s16002bh" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002bh">bibulous</a>
individual, a sailor probably, still stared for some appreciable time before
<a name="s16009n" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16009n">transferring his attention</a> to the floor.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 8a}</font>
<br> Mr Bloom, availing himself of the right of free speech, remarked to
<br><font color="green">{ms, 9}</font>
<br> his proteg&eacute; in an audible tone of voice &agrave; propos of the
wrangle in the street which was still raging
<a name="un5018an" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5018an">fast and furious</a>.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A beautiful language. I mean for singing purposes. Why do
you not write your poetry in that language? <u>Bella Poetria</u>. It is so
melodious and full. <u>Bella Donna. Voglio.</u></p>
<p> Stephen, who was trying his dead best to yawn if he
could<a target="foot" id="frz0041">&ordm;</a>
<a name="s16010o" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16010o">suffering from lassitude generally</a>, replied:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; To fill the ear of a cow elephant. They were haggling over money.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is that so? Mr Bloom asked. Of course, he subjoined
pensively, it may be only the southern glamour that surrounds it.</p>
<p> The keeper of the shelter put a boiling swimming cup of a
<a name="s16009bc" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16009bc">concoction</a>
labelled coffee on the table and a rather antediluvian specimen of a bun, or so
it seemed. After which he retreated to his counter, Mr Bloom determining to have
a good look at him later on so as not<a target="foot" id="frz0042">&ordm;</a>
appear to. for which reason he encouraged Stephen to proceed with his eyes while
surreptitiously pushing the cup of what was supposed to be called coffee gradually nearer him</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Sounds are impostures, Stephen said,
<a name="s12002e" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12002e">like names. Cicero,
Podmore. Napoleon, Mr Goodbody. Jesus, Mr Doyle</a>. Shakespeares were as common as Murphies. What&apos;s in a name?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Of course, Mr Bloom thoroughly agreed. Our name was
changed too, he added, pushing the socalled roll across.</p>
<p> The redbearded sailor who had his eye on the newcomers boarded Stephen squarely by asking:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And what might your name be?</p>
<p> Just in the nick of time Mr Bloom touched his companion&apos;s boot but
Stephen, disregarding the warm pressure apparently, answered:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Dedalus.</p>
<p> The sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy eyes.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You know Simon Dedalus? he asked at length.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I&apos;ve heard of him, Stephen said.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom was <a name="un4048g" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4048g">all
at sea</a> for a moment, seeing the others evidently listening too.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He&apos;s Irish, the
<a name="s16010bi" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16010bi">seaman</a> affirmed, staring still in much the same way and
<br><font color="green">{ms, 10}</font>
<br> nodding. All Irish.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; All too Irish, Stephen rejoined.</p>
<p> As for Mr Bloom he could neither make head or tail of the business and he
was just asking himself what possible connection when the sailor of his own
accord turned to the other occupants in the shelter
<a name="un6015cm" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6015cm">with the remark</a>:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I seen him shoot two eggs
of<a target="foot" id="frz0043">&ordm;</a> two bottles at fifty yards over his shoulder. The lefthand dead shot.</p>
<p> <a name="s16021ae" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16021ae">Though he was
slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his gestures being also
clumsy</a> <a name="s16004f" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16004f">as it was</a> still he did his best to explain.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Bottles out there, say. Fifty yards measured. Eggs on the
bottles. Cocks his gun over his shoulder. Aims.</p>
<p> He turned his body half round, shut up his right eye completely. Then he
screwed his features up someway sideways and glared out into the night with an
<a name="un4055ad" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4055ad">unprepossessing</a> eye.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <a name="s16026h" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16026h">Pom!</a> he then shouted once!</p>
<p> The entire audience waited, anticipating a still further detonation, there being a second egg.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <a name="s16026h" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16026h">Pom!</a> he shouted twice.</p>
<p> A silence
<a name="un4030ar" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030ar">ensued</a> till Mr
Bloom for agreeableness&apos; sake just asked whether it was for a marksmanship competition.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Beg pardon, the sailor said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Long ago? Mr Bloom pursued.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Why, the sailor replied, relaxing to a certain extent, it
might be a matter of ten years.
<a name="s15010ai" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15010ai">He toured the wide
world with</a>
<a name="s16018f" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16018f">Hengler&apos;s Royal
Circus</a>. I seen him do that in Stockholm.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Curious coincidence, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen unobtrusively.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Murphy&apos;s my name, the sailor continued. D.B. Murphy of Carrigaloe. Know where that is?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Queenstown harbour, Stephen replied.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That&apos;s right, the sailor said. That&apos;s where I
<a name="s16002br" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002br">hails from</a>.
<a name="s16026bl" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16026bl">I belongs there.</a>
That&apos;s where I
<a name="s16002br" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002br">hails from</a>.
<a name="s16026am" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16026am">My little
woman&apos;s down there. She&apos;s waiting for me, I know.</a>
<a name="s16026as" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16026as">For England, home
and beauty.</a> She&apos;s my own own true wife I haven&apos;t seen for seven years now, sailing about.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene, homecoming to the
mariner&apos;s roadside shieling a
<a name="s16015u" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16015u">rainy night</a> with a
<a name="s16015t" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16015t">blind moon</a>. Quite
a number of stories there were on that particular topic, Enoch Arden
<br><font color="green">{ms, 11}</font>
<br> and Rip van Winkle and does anybody hereabouts remember Caoc O&apos;Leary,
a favourite and most
<a name="s16013at" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16013at">trying</a>
declamation piece <a name="s16012l" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16012l">by
the way</a> of poor John Casey. Never about the runaway wife coming back,
however much devoted to him. The face at the window when the awful truth dawned
upon him, <a name="s16013ac" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16013ac">wrecked in
his affections</a>. You little expected me but I&apos;ve come to stay and make a
fresh start. There she sits, a grasswidow, at the selfsame fireside. Believes me
dead, <a name="s16024d" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16024d">rocked in the
cradle of the deep</a>. And there sits uncle, the publican of the <u>Crown and
Anchor</u>, in shirtsleeves, eating rumpsteak and onions. No chair for father.
Broo! The wind! Her brandnew arrival is on her knee, post mortem child. With a
high ro and and a randy ro and my galloping tearing tandy, O.
<a name="s16001at" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001at">Bow to the
inevitable.</a> Grin and bear it. I remain
<a name="s16005ak" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16005ak">with much love</a>
your brokenhearted husband D B Murphy.</p>
<p> The sailor, who scarcely seemed to be a Dublin resident, turned to one of the jarvies with the request:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;
<a name="un4030k" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030k">You don&apos;t happen
to have</a> <a name="s16026au" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16026au">such a
thing as</a> a <a name="s16026p" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16026p">spare chaw about you</a>?</p>
<p> The jarvey addressed as it happened had not but the keeper took a die of
plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and
<a name="s16014ac" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16014ac">the object</a> was passed from hand to hand.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Thank you, the sailor said.</p>
<p> He deposited the quid in his gob and, chewing and with some slow stammers, proceeded:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;
<a name="s16021aj" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16021aj">We come up</a> this
morning eleven o&apos;clock. The
<a name="un4031aq" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031aq">threemaster</a>
<u>Rosevean</u> from Bridgwater with bricks. I shipped to get over.
<a name="s16021co" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16021co">Paid off this
afternoon.</a> There&apos;s my
<a name="s16026bv" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16026bv">discharge</a>. See?
D.B. Murphy. <a name="s16027q" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16027q">A.B.S.</a></p>
<p> In confirmation of his statement he extricated from an inside pocket and
handed to his neighbour a not very clean looking folded document.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You must have seen a fair share of the world, the keeper remarked, leaning on the counter.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Why, the sailor answered upon reflection upon it,
I&apos;ve circumnavigated a bit since I first joined on. I was in the Red sea. I
was in China and North America and South America. We was chased by pirates one
voyage. I seen icebergs plenty, growlers. I was in
<br><font color="green">{ms, 12}</font>
<br> Stockholm and the Black Sea, the Dardanelles under Captain Dalton, the best
bloody man that ever scuttled a ship. I seen Russia. <u>Gospodi pomilyou.</u> That&apos;s how the Russians prays.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You seen queer sights, don&apos;t be talking, said a jarvey.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Why, the sailor said, shifting his partially chewed plug.
I seen queer things too,
<a name="s16022ck" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16022ck">ups and downs</a>. I
seen a <a name="s16023f" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16023f">crocodile bite
the fluke of an anchor</a> same as I chew that quid.</p>
<p> He took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and, lodging it between his teeth, bit ferociously:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Khaan! Like that. And I seen maneaters in Peru that eats
corpses and the livers of horses. Look here. Here they are. A friend of mine sent me.</p>
<p> He fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket which seemed to be
in its way a species of repository and pushed it along the table. The printed
matter on it stated: Choza de Indios. Beni, Bolivia.</p>
<p> All focussed their attention at a group of savage women in striped
<a name="s15074p" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15074p">loincloths</a>,
squatted, blinking, suckling, frowning, sleeping amid a swarm of infants (there
must have been quite a score of them) outside some primitive huts of osier.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;
<a name="un4031d" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031d">Chews coca</a> all

of attraction for several minutes if not more.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Know how to keep them off? he inquired generally.</p>
<p> Nobody volunteering a statement<a target="foot" id="frz0045">&ordm;</a> he winked, saying:</p>
