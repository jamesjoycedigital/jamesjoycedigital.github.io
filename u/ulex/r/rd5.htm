they both walked together along Beaver street, or, more properly, lane, as far
as the farrier&apos;s and the distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables
at the corner of Montgomery street where they made tracks to the left, from
thence debouching into Amiens street round by
<br><font color="green">{u21, 678}</font>
<br> the corner of Dan Bergin&apos;s. But, as he

anticipated, there was not a sign of a Jehu plying for hire anywhere to be seen
except a fourwheeler, probably engaged by some fellows inside on the spree,
outside the North Star Hotel, and there was no symptom of its budging an inch
when Mr Bloom, who was anything but a professional whistler, endeavoured to hail
it by emitting a kind of a whistle, holding his arms arched over his head, twice.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 570}</font> </p>
<p> This was a quandary but, bringing common sense to bear on it, evidently
there was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it which
they accordingly did. So, bevelling around by Mullett&apos;s and the Signal
House, which they shortly
reached<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font>
they proceeded in the direction of Amiens street railway terminus, Mr Bloom
being handicapped by the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his
trousers had, to vary the adage, gone the way of all buttons though, entering
thoroughly into the spirit of the thing, he heroically made light of the
mischance. So
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black">as

they dandered along past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a fare
or a jarvey. As it so happened a Dublin United Tramways Company&apos;s
sandstrewer happening to be returning the elder man recounted to his companion a
propos of the incident his own truly miraculous escape of some little while
back. They passed the main entrance of the Great Northern railway station, the
starting point for Belfast, where of course all traffic was suspended at that
late hour, and passing the back door of the morgue (a not very enticing
locality, not to say gruesome, more especially at night), ultimately gained the
Dock Tavern and in due course turned into Store street, famous for its C
division police station. Between this point and the high, at present unlit,
warehouses of Beresford Place Stephen thought to think of Ibsen, associated with
Baird&apos;s, the stonecutter&apos;s in his mind somehow in Talbot Place, first
turning on the right, while the other, who was acting as his <i>fidus
Achates</i> inhaled with internal satisfaction the smell of James Rourke&apos;s
city bakery, situated quite close to where
<br><font color="green">{u21, 679}</font>
<br> they were, the very palatable odour indeed of our daily bread, of all
commodities of the public the primary and most indispensable. Bread, the staff
of life, earn your bread, O tell me where is fancy bread? At Rourke&apos;s the baker&apos;s, it is said.</p>
<p> En route, to his taciturn, and, not to put too fine a point on it, not yet
perfectly sober companion, Mr Bloom, who at all events was in complete
possession of his faculties, never more so, spoke a word of caution <i>re</i>
the dangers of nighttown,

admittedly unscrupulous and, as Mr Bloom put it, recalling a case or two in the
A Division in Clanbrassil street, prepared to swear a hole through a ten gallon
pot. Never on the spot when wanted but in quiet parts of the city, Pembroke road
for example, the guardians of the law were well in evidence, the obvious reason
being they were paid to protect the upper classes. Another thing he commented on
was equipping soldiers with

which was tantamount to inciting them against civilians. You frittered away your
time, he very sensibly remarked, and health and also character besides which, fast women of the demimonde ran
<br><font color="green">{u21, 680}</font>
<br> away with a lot of &pound;. s. d. into the bargain and the greatest danger
of all was who you got drunk with. Most of all he commented adversely on the
desertion of Stephen by all his pubhunting confr&egrave;res but one, a most
glaring piece of ratting
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black">on the
part of his <a name="un5017di" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5017di">brother
medicos</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font> under all the circs.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And that one was Judas, said Stephen, who up to then had said nothing whatsoever of any kind.</p>
<p> Discussing these and kindred topics they passed under the Loop Line bridge
where a brazier of coke burning in front of a sentrybox, or something like one,
attracted their rather lagging footsteps. Stephen stopped for no special reason
to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by the light emanating from the
brazier he could just make out the darker figure of the corporation watchman
inside the gloom of the sentrybox. He began to remember that this had happened,
or had been mentioned as having happened, before but it cost
<br><font color="green">{u22, 572}</font>
<br> him no small effort before he remembered that he recognised in the sentry a
<i>quondam</i> friend of his father&apos;s, Gumley. To avoid a meeting he drew
nearer to the pillars of the railway bridge.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Someone saluted you, Mr Bloom said.</p>
<p> A figure
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black"><a name="un7007ca" href="../../FF/unbs/un7all.htm#un7007ca">of
middle height</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font> on
the prowl, evidently, under the arches saluted again, calling: Night. Stephen,
of course, started rather dizzily and stopped to return the compliment. Mr
Bloom, actuated by motives of
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black"><a name="un5012ae" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5012ae">inherent</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font>
delicacy, moved off, but nevertheless remained on the <i>qui vive</i> with just
a shade of anxiety. Although unusual in Dublin he knew that it was not by any
means unknown for desperadoes who had next to nothing to live on to be about
waylaying and generally terrorising peaceable pedestrians by
<br><font color="green">{u21, 681}</font>
<br> placing a pistol at their head in some secluded spot outside the city
proper, famished loiterers they might be hanging about there or simply marauders
ready to decamp with whatever boodle they could at a moment&apos;s notice, your money or your life.</p>
<p> Stephen, that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters, though he
was not in an over sober state himself, recognised Corly&apos;s breath redolent
of rotten cornjuice. Lord John Corly, some called him, and his genealogy came
about in this wise. He was the eldest son of Inspector Corly of the G Division,
lately deceased, who had married a certain Katherine Brophy, the daughter of a
Louth farmer. His grandfather, Patrick Michael Corly, of New Ross, had married
the widow of a publican there whose maiden name had been Katherine (also)
Talbot. Rumour had it,though not proved, that she descended from the house of
the Lords Talbot de Malahide, in whose
mansion<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black">,
really an
<a name="un6015ee" href="../../FF/unbs/un6all.htm#un6015ee">unquestionably</a>
fine residence <font color="red"><sup><small>|a</small></sup></font>of its
kind<font color="red"><sup><small>a|</small></sup></font> and
<a name="un6015dt" href="../../FF/unbs/un6all.htm#un6015dt">well worth
seeing</a>,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font> her
mother or aunt or some relative had enjoyed the distinction of being in service
in the washkitchen. This, therefore, was the reason why the still comparatively
young though dissolute man who now addressed Stephen was spoken of by some with
facetious proclivities as Lord John Corly.</p>
<p> Taking Stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell. Not
as much as a farthing to purchase a night&apos;s lodgings. His friends had all
deserted him. Furthermore, he had a row with Lenehan and called him to Stephen a
mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of other
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">uncalled-for</span></span>
<font color="black">uncalledfor</font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font>
expressions. He was out of a job and implored of Stephen to tell him where on
God&apos;s earth he could get something, anything at all, to do. No, it was the daughter of the
<br><font color="green">{u22, 573}</font>
<br> mother in the washkitchen that was fostersister to the heir of the house,
both occurrences happening at the same time
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black">if the
whole thing wasn&apos;t
<a name="un6015dr" href="../../FF/unbs/un6all.htm#un6015dr">a complete
fabrication from start to
finish</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font>. Anyhow, he was all in.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I wouldn&apos;t ask you, only, pursued he, on my solemn oath and
<br><font color="green">{u21, 682}</font>
<br> God knows I&apos;m on the rocks.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There&apos;ll be a job tomorrow or the next day, Stephen
told him, in a boys&apos; school at Dalkey for a gentleman usher. Mr Garrett Deasy. Try it. You may mention my name.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ah, God, Corly replied, sure I couldn&apos;t teach in a
school, man. I was never one of your bright ones, he added with a half laugh.
Got stuck twice in the junior at the Christian Brothers.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I have no place to sleep myself, Stephen informed him.</p>
<p> Corly, at the first go-off, was inclined to suspect it was something to do
with Stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody tart off the
street. There was a dosshouse in Marlborough street, Mrs Maloney&apos;s, but it
was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but M&apos;Conachie told him
you got a decent enough do in the Brazen Head over in Winetavern street for a
bob. He was starving too though he hadn&apos;t said a word about it.</p>
<p> Though this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it still
Stephen&apos;s feelings got the better of him
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black"><a name="un7007cp" href="../../FF/unbs/un7all.htm#un7007cp">in
a sense</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font> though
he knew that Corly&apos;s brandnew rigmarole, on a par with the others, was
hardly deserving of much credence. However, <i>haud ignarus malorum miseris
succurrere disco</i>, etcetera, especially as luck would have it he got paid his
screw after every middle of the month on the sixteenth which was the date of the
month as a matter of fact
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black">though
a good bit of

But the cream of the joke was nothing would get it out of Corly&apos;s head that
he was living in affluence and hadn&apos;t a thing to do but hand out the
needful<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">;</span></span>
<font color="black">&mdash;</font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font>
whereas. He put his hand in a pocket anyhow, not with the idea of finding any
food there, but thinking he might lend him anything up to a bob or so in lieu so
that he might endeavour at all events and get sufficient to eat. But the result
was in the negative
for<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black">,
<a name="un7007ct" href="../../FF/unbs/un7all.htm#un7007ct">to his

missing. A few broken biscuits were all
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black">the
result of his
<a name="un4043r" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4043r">investigation</a><a target="foot" id="frr0040">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font>.
He tried his hardest to recollect for the moment whether he had lost, as well he
might have, or left, because in that contingency it was not a pleasant lookout,
very much the reverse, in fact. He was altogether too
<br><font color="green">{u21, 683}</font>
<br> fagged out to institute a thorough search though
<br><font color="green">{u22, 574}</font>
<br> he tried to recollect. About biscuits he dimly remembered. Who now exactly
gave them, or where was, or did he buy? However, in another pocket he came
across what he surmised in the dark were pennies, erroneously, however.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Those are halfcrowns, man, Corly corrected him.</p>
<p> And so in point of fact they turned out to be. Stephen lent him one of them.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Thanks, Corly answered. You&apos;re a gentleman. I&apos;ll
pay you back some time. Who&apos;s that with you? I saw him a few times with
Boylan the billsticker. You might put in a good word for us to get me taken on
there. I&apos;d carry a sandwichboard only the girl in the office told me
they&apos;re full up for the next three weeks, man. God, you&apos;ve to book
ahead, man, you&apos;d think it was for the Carl Rosa. I don&apos;t give a shite anyway so long as I get a job.</p>
<p> Subsequently, being not quite so down in the mouth after the two-and-six he
got, he informed Stephen about a fellow by the name of Bags Comisky that he said
Stephen knew well out of Fulham&apos;s, the shipchandler&apos;s, bookkeeper
there, that used to be often round in Nagle&apos;s back with O&apos;Mara and a
little chap with a stutter called Tighe. Anyhow, he was lagged the night before
last and fined ten bob for a drunk and disorderly and refusing to go with the constable.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the
cobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation
watchman&apos;s sentrybox, who, evidently a glutton for work, it struck him, was
having a quiet forty winks
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black"><a name="un7008at" href="../../FF/unbs/un7all.htm#un7008at">for
all intents and
purposes</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font> on his
own private account while Dublin slept. He threw an odd eye at the same time now
and then at Stephen&apos;s anything but immaculately attired interlocutor as if
he had seen that nobleman somewhere or other. Being a
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black"><a name="un4043ak" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4043ak">levelheaded</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font>
person who could give points to not a few in point of shrewd observation, he
also remarked on his very dilapidated hat and slouchy wearing apparel generally,
<br><font color="green">{u21, 684}</font>
<br> testifying to a chronic impecuniosity. Probably he was one of his
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">hangers-on</span></span>
<font color="black">hangerson</font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font>
but for the matter of that it was merely a question of one preying on another
all round, in every deep, so to put it, a deeper depth. In any case he had a consummate amount of assurance
<br><font color="green">{u22, 575}</font>
<br> intercepting people at that hour of the night or morning. Pretty thick that was certainly.</p>
<p> The pair parted company and Stephen rejoined Mr Bloom, who, with his
practised eye, was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the
blandiloquence of the other parasite. Alluding to the encounter he said, laughing, Stephen, that is:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He&apos;s down on his luck. He asked me to ask you to ask
somebody named Boylan, a billsticker, to give him a job as a sandwichman.</p>
<p> At this
intelligence<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black">,

luck, they say. Now you mention it his face was familiar to me. But leaving that
for the moment, how much did you part with, he queried, if I am not too inquisitive?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Half-a-crown, Stephen responded. I daresay he needs it to sleep somewhere.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Needs! Mr Bloom ejaculated, I guarantee he invariably
does. Everyone according to his needs and everyone according to his deeds.

Simply fag out there for nothing. I don&apos;t mean to presume to dictate to you
in the slightest degree but why did you leave your father&apos;s house?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; To seek misfortune, Stephen replied.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 685}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I met your respected father on a recent occasion, Mr Bloom
remarked, today, in fact, or, to be strictly accurate, on yesterday. Where does
he live at present? I gathered in the course of conversation that he had moved.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I believe he is in Dublin somewhere, Stephen answered unconcernedly. Why?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A gifted man, Mr Bloom said of Mr Dedalus senior, in more
respects than one. He takes great pride, quite legitimately, out of you. You
could go back, perhaps, he hazarded, still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at Westland Row terminus when it
<br><font color="green">{u22, 576}</font>

was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he could drink it with

<p class="di">&mdash; No, Mr Bloom repeated again, I wouldn&apos;t personally
repose much trust in that boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous
element, Dr Mulligan, as a guide, philosopher, and friend, if I were you. He
knows which side his bread is buttered on though in all probability he never
realised what it is to be without regular meals. Of course you didn&apos;t
notice as much as I
did<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font>
but it wouldn&apos;t occasion me the least surprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco
<br><font color="green">{u21, 686}</font>
<br> or some narcotic was put in your drink for some ulterior object.</p>
<p> He understood, however, from all he heard, that Dr Mulligan was a versatile

from certain drowning at Skerries, or Malahide was it?, was, he was bound to

what earthly reason could be at the back of it except he put it down to jealousy.</p>

gave at Stephen&apos;s at present morose expression of features

<br> did not throw a flood of light, none at all in fact, on the problem as to

allowed matters to more or less. Grinding poverty did have that effect, and he
more than conjectured that, highly educated though he was, he experienced no

<p> Mr Bloom and Stephen entered the cabman&apos;s shelter, an unpretentious

only to be greeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous collection of
waifs and strays already there engaged in eating and drinking, diversified by
conversation for whom they seemingly formed an object of curiosity.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Now touching a cup of coffee, Mr Bloom suggested,

of whose hair</a> was

probably, still stared for some appreciable time before transferring his attention to the floor.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom, availing himself of the right of free speech, he having just a
bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute, though, to be sure, rather in
a quandary over <i>voglio</i>, remarked to his prot&eacute;g&eacute; in an audible tone of voice,

<p> Stephen, who was trying his dead best to yawn, if he could, suffering from lassitude generally, replied:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; To fill the ear of a cow elephant. They were haggling over money.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Is that so? Mr Bloom asked. Of course, he subjoined
pensively,

concoction labelled coffee on the table and a rather antediluvian specimen of a
bun, or so it seemed, after which he retreated to his counter, Mr Bloom
determining to have a good square look at him later on so as not to appear to,
for which reason he encouraged Stephen to proceed with his eyes while
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black">he

course. Our name was changed too, he added, pushing the socalled roll across.</p>
<p> The redbearded sailor, who had his eye on the newcomers, boarded Stephen squarely by asking:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And what might your name be?</p>
<p> Just in the nick of time Mr Bloom touched his companion&apos;s boot but
Stephen, apparently disregarding the warm pressure, answered:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Dedalus.</p>
<p> The sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy eyes.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You know Simon Dedalus? he asked at length.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I&apos;ve heard of him, Stephen said.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 579}</font> </p>
<p> Mr Bloom was all at sea for a moment, seeing the others evidently listening too.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He&apos;s Irish, the seaman affirmed, staring still in
much the same way and nodding. All Irish.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; All too Irish, Stephen rejoined.</p>
<p> As for Mr Bloom he could neither make head or tail of the
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black">whole</font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font>
<br><font color="green">{u21, 689}</font>
<br> business and he was just asking himself what possible connection when the
sailor, of his own accord, turned to the other occupants of the shelter with the remark:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards
over his shoulder. The lefthand dead shot.</p>
<p> Though he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his gestures
being also clumsy as it was, still he did his best to explain.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Bottles out there, say. Fifty yards measured. Eggs on the
bottles. Cocks his gun over his shoulder. Aims.</p>
<p> He turned his body half round, shut up his right eye completely, then he
screwed his features up someway sideways and glared out into the night with an unprepossessing eye.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Pom! he then shouted once.</p>
<p> The entire audience waited, anticipating
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">a

detonation, there being
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black">still</font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font>
a further egg.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Pom! he shouted twice.</p>
<p> A silence ensued till Mr Bloom for agreeableness&apos; sake just asked him
whether it was for a marksmanship competition.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Beg pardon, the sailor said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Long ago? Mr Bloom pursued.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Why, the sailor replied, relaxing to a certain extent, it
might be a matter of ten years. He toured the wide world with Hengler&apos;s
Royal Circus. I seen him do that in Stockholm.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Curious coincidence, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen unobtrusively.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Murphy&apos;s my name, the sailor continued, W.B. Murphy, of Carrigaloe. Know where that is?
<br><font color="green">{u22, 580}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Queenstown Harbour, Stephen replied.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 690}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That&apos;s right, the sailor said. That&apos;s where I
hails from. My little woman&apos;s down there. She&apos;s waiting for me, I
know.

truth dawned upon him anent his better half, wrecked in his affections. You

<p> The sailor, who scarcely seemed to be a Dublin resident, turned to one of the jarvies with the request:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You don&apos;t happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you, do you?</p>
<p> The jarvey addressed, as it happened, had not but the keeper took a die of
plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the object was passed from hand to hand.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Thank you, the sailor said.</p>
<p> He deposited the quid in his gob and, chewing, and with some slow stammers, proceeded:
<br><font color="green">{u21, 691}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; We come up this morning eleven o&apos;clock. The
threemaster <i>Rosevean</i> from Bridgwater with bricks. I shipped to get over.
Paid off this afternoon. There&apos;s my discharge. See? W.B. Murphy. A.B.S.</p>
<p> In confirmation of his statement he extricated from an inside pocket and
handed to his neighbour a not very clean looking folded document.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 581}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You must have seen a fair share of the world, the keeper remarked, leaning on the counter.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Why, the sailor answered upon reflection upon it,
I&apos;ve circumnavigated a bit since I first joined on. I was in the Red Sea. I
was in China and North America and South America. I seen icebergs plenty,
growlers. I was in Stockholm and the Black Sea, the Dardanelles, under Captain
Dalton, the best bloody man that ever scuttled a ship. I seen Russia. <i>Gospodi
pomilyou</i>. That&apos;s how the Russians prays.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You seen queer sights, don&apos;t be talking, said a jarvey.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Why, the sailor said, shifting his partially chewed plug,
I seen queer things too, ups and downs. I seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an anchor same as I chew that quid.</p>
<p> He took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and, lodging it between his teeth, bit ferociously:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Khaan! Like that. And I seen maneaters in Peru that eats
corpses and the livers of horses. Look here. Here they are. A friend of mine sent me.</p>
<p> He fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket, which seemed to be
in its way a species of repository, and pushed it along the table. The printed
matter on it stated: Choza de Indios. Beni, Bolivia.</p>
<p> All focussed their attention at
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black"><a name="un6015cx" href="../../FF/unbs/un6all.htm#un6015cx">the

<br><font color="green">{u21, 692}</font> </p>
<p> His postcard proved a centre of attraction for several minutes, if not more.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Know how to keep them off? he inquired genially.</p>
<p> Nobody volunteering a statement, he winked, saying:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Glass. That boggles &apos;em. Glass.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom, without evincing surprise, unostentatiously turned over the card
to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark. It ran as follows:
Tarjeta Postal, Se&ntilde;or A Boudin, Galeria Becche, Santiago, Chile. There
was no message evidently, as he took particular notice.</p>

in Wicklow, rightly termed the garden of Ireland, and in the wilds of Donegal
where, if report spoke true, the <i>coup d&apos;&oelig;il</i> was exceedingly
grand, though the lastnamed locality was not easily getatable. Because of course
uptodate tourist travelling was as yet merely in its infancy, so to speak, and
the accommodation left much to be desired. Interesting to fathom, it seemed to
him, from a motive of curiosity pure and simple, was whether it was the traffic
that created the route or viceversa or the two sides in fact. He turned back the
other side of the card, picture, and passed it along to Stephen.

conveyed the impression that he didn&apos;t understand one jot of what was going on. Funny, very.</p>
<p> There followed a somewhat lengthy pause. One man was reading by fits and
starts a stained by coffee evening journal; another, the card with the natives
<i>choza de</i>; another, the seaman&apos;s discharge. Mr Bloom, so far as he
was concerned, was just pondering in pensive mood. He vividly recollected when
the occurrence alluded to took place as well as yesterday, some score of years
previously, in the days of the land
troubles<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font>

<p class="di">&mdash; Ay, boss, the sailor broke in. Give us back them papers.</p>
<p> The request being complied with, he clawed them up with a scrape.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Have you seen the Rock of Gibraltar? Mr Bloom asked.</p>
<p> The sailor grimaced, chewing, in a way that might be read as yes, ay, or no.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ah, you&apos;ve touched there too, Mr Bloom said, Europa
point, thinking he had, in the hope that the rover might possibly by some
reminiscences<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.
But</span></span>
<font color="black">but</font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font>
he failed to do so, simply letting spurt a jet of spew into the sawdust, and
shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What year would that be about? Mr Bloom interpolated. Can you recall the boats?</p>
<p> Our <i>soi-disant</i> sailor munched heavily
awhile<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font>

before answering.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I&apos;m tired of all them rocks in the sea, he said, and
boats and ships. Salt junk all the time.</p>
<p> Tired, seemingly, he ceased. His questioner, perceiving that he was not
likely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer, fell to
woolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the globe. Suffice
it to say that, as a casual glance at the map revealed, it covered fully three
fourths of
it<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font>
and he fully realised accordingly what it meant to rule the waves. On more than
one occasion &mdash; a dozen at the lowest &mdash; near the North Bull at
Dollymount he had remarked a superannuated old salt, evidently derelict, seated
habitually near the not particularly redolent sea on the wall, staring

at it and it at him, dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new. And it left him
wondering why. Possibly he had tried to find out the secret for himself,
floundering up and down and all that sort of thing and over and under &mdash;
well, not exactly under &mdash; tempting the fates. And the odds were
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black">twenty

Irish lights, Kish and others, rounding which he once with his daughter had
experienced some remarkably choppy, not to say stormy, weather.</p>

<p class="di">&mdash; What age is he? queried one hearer who, by the way, seen
from the side, bore a distant resemblance to Henry Campbell, the townclerk, away
from the cares of office, unwashed, of course, and in a seedy getup and a strong
suspicion of nosepaint

<p class="di">&mdash; Why, the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance, my

<p> He tore open his grey or unclean anyhow shirt with his two hands and
scratched away at his chest on which was to be seen an image tattooed in blue

sure as nuts. I must get a wash tomorrow or next day. It&apos;s them black lads

<p> Seeing they were all looking at his chest, he accomodatingly
<br><font color="green">{u21, 698}</font>
<br> dragged his shirt more open so that, on top of the timehonoured symbol of
the mariner&apos;s hope and rest, they had a full view of the figure 16 and a
young man&apos;s sideface looking frowningly rather.</p>

chest. He&apos;s gone too. Ate by sharks after. Ay, ay.</p>
<p> He let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression of before.</p>

<p> The face of a streetwalker, glazed and haggard under a black straw hat,
peered askew round the door of the shelter, palpably reconnoitring on her own
with the object of bringing more grist to her mill. Mr Bloom turned away on the
moment,
flustered<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font>
but outwardly calm, and, picking up from the table the pink sheet of the Abbey
street organ which the jarvey, if such he was, had laid aside, he picked it up
and looked at the pink of the paper though why pink? His reason for so doing was
he recognised on the moment round the door the same face he had caught a
fleeting glimpse of that afternoon on Ormond Quay, the partially idiotic female,
namely, of the lane, who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you
(Mrs B.), and begged the chance of his washing. Also why washing, which seemed
rather vague than
not<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span><font color="black">?</font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font></p>
<p> Your washing. Still, candour compelled him to admit that he had washed his
wife&apos;s undergarments when soiled in Holles street and women would and did
too a man&apos;s similar garments if they really loved him, that is to say. Love
me, love my dirty shirt. Still, just then he desired the female&apos;s room more
than her company so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a rude
sign to take herself off. Round the side of the
<br><font color="green">{u22, 588}</font>
<br> <i>Evening Telegraph</i> he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face
round the side of the door with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she
was not exactly all there, viewing with evident amusement the group of gazers
round Skipper Murphy&apos;s chest and then there was no more of her.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The gunboat, the keeper said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It beats me, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen, medically I am
speaking, how a wretched creature like that from the Lock Hospital, reeking with
disease, can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober senses,
if he values his health in the least. Unfortunate creature! Of course, I suppose
some man is ultimately responsible for her condition.</p>
<p> Stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders, merely remarking:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; In this country people sell much more than she ever had

buy the soul. She is a bad merchant. She buys dear and sells cheap.

concentrate and remember before he could say:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; They tell me on the best authority it is a simple
substance and therefore incorruptible. It would be immortal, I understand, but
for the possibility of its annihilation by its First Cause, Who, from all I can
hear, is quite capable of adding that to the number of His other practical
jokes, <i>corruptio per se</i> and <i>corruptio per accidens</i> both being excluded by court etiquette.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 589}</font> </p>
<p> Mr Bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the
mystical finesse involved was a bit
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">beyond
him.</span></span> <font color="black">out of his depth still

shouldn&apos;t think that is the proper word. Of course, I grant you, to concede
a point, you do knock across a simple soul once in a while. But what I am
anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for instance to invent those rays
R&ouml;ntgen did, or the telescope like Edison, though I believe it was before
his time, Galileo was the man I mean. The same applies to the laws, for example,
of a far-reaching natural phenomenon such as electricity but it&apos;s a horse
of quite another colour to say you believe in the existence of a supernatural God.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 701}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O that, Stephen expostulated, has been proved conclusively
by several of the bestknown passages in Holy Writ, apart from circumstantial evidence.</p>
<p> On this knotty point, however, the views of the pair, poles apart as they
were, both in schooling and everything else, with the marked difference in their respective ages, clashed.</p>

who precisely wrote them, like <i>Hamlet</i> and Bacon, as, you who know your
Shakespeare infinitely better than I, of course I needn&apos;t tell you.
Can&apos;t you drink that coffee, by the way? Let me stir it. And take a piece
of that bun. It&apos;s like one of our skipper&apos;s bricks disguised. Still,
no-one can give what he hasn&apos;t got. Try a bit.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Couldn&apos;t, Stephen replied.</p>
<p> Faultfinding being a proverbially bad hat, Mr Bloom thought well to stir, or
try to, the clotted sugar from the bottom and reflected with something
approaching acrimony on the Coffee Palace and its temperance (and lucrative)
work. To be sure it did a world of good, shelters such as the present one they
were in run on teetotal lines for vagrants at night, concerts, dramatic
evenings, and useful lectures by qualified men for the lower orders. On the
other hand, he had a distinct recollection they paid his wife, Madam Marion
Tweedy, who had been prominently associated with it at one time,
<br><font color="green">{u22, 590}</font>
<br> a very modest remuneration indeed for her pianoplaying. The idea, he was
strongly inclined to believe, was to do good and net a profit, there being no
competition to speak of. Sulphate of copper poison SO<sub><small>4</small></sub>
or something in some dried peas he remembered reading of in a cheap eatinghouse
somewhere but he couldn&apos;t remember when it was or where. Anyhow,
<br><font color="green">{u21, 702}</font>
<br> inspection, medical inspection, of all eatables, seemed to him more than ever necessary.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Have a shot at it now, he ventured to say of the coffee after being stirred.</p>
<p> Thus prevailed on to at any rate taste it, Stephen lifted the heavy mug from
the brown puddle &mdash; it clopped out of it when taken up &mdash; by the handle and took a sip.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Still, it&apos;s solid food, his good genius urged,
I&apos;m a stickler for solid food, his one and only reason being not
gormandising but regular meals as the <i>sine qua non</i> for any kind of proper
work, mental or manual. You ought to eat more solid food. You would feel a different man.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Liquids I can eat, Stephen said. But oblige me by taking
away that knife. I can&apos;t look at the point of it. It reminds me of Roman history.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated article, a
blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing very Roman or antique in it to the
eye, observing that the point was the least conspicuous point about it.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Our mutual friend&apos;s stories are like himself, Mr
Bloom, apropos of knives, remarked to
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Stephen</span></span>
<font color="black"><a name="un5018bc" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5018bc">his
<i>confidante</i></a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font>
<i>sotto voce</i>. Do you think they are genuine? He could spin those yarns for
hours on end all night long and lie like old boots. Look at him.</p>
<p> Yet still, though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air, life was full
of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it was quite
within the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire fabrication though at
first blush there was not much inherent probability in all he said being strictly accurate.</p>
<p> He had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black">and
<a name="un5018ap" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5018ap">Sherlockholmesing</a>

Though a wellpreserved man of no little stamina, if a trifle prone to baldness,
there was something spurious in the cut of his
<br><font color="green">{u21, 703}</font>
<br> jib that suggested a jail delivery and it required no violent stretch of
imagination to associate such a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill fraternity.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 591}</font>
<br> He might even have done for his man, supposing it was his own case he told,
as people often did about others, namely, that he killed him himself and had
served his four or five goodlooking years in durance vile to say nothing of the
Antonio personage
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black">(no
relation to
<font color="red"><sup><small>|a</small></sup></font>the<font color="red"><sup><small>a|</small></sup></font>

<a name="un5017dd" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5017dd">our national
poet</a>)</font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font> who
expiated his crimes in the manner described. On the other hand he might be only
bluffing, a pardonable weakness, because meeting
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black">unmistakable</font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font>
mugs, Dublin residents, like those jarvies waiting news from abroad, would tempt
any ancient mariner to draw the long bow about the schooner <i>Hesperus</i> and
etcetera. And when all was said and done, the lies a fellow told about himself
couldn&apos;t probably hold a
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black">proverbial</font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font>
candle to the
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black">wholesale</font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font>
whoppers other fellows told about him.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Mind you, I&apos;m not saying that it&apos;s all a pure
invention, he resumed. Analogous scenes are occasionally, if not often, met
with. Giants, though, that is rather a far cry, you see once in a way Marcella
the Midget Queen. In those waxworks in Henry street I myself saw some Aztecs, as
they are called, sitting bowlegged. They couldn&apos;t straighten their legs if
you paid them because the muscles here, you see, he proceeded, indicating on his
companion the brief outline, the sinews, or whatever you like to call them,
behind the right knee, were utterly powerless from sitting that way so long
cramped up, being adored as gods. There&apos;s an example again of simple souls.</p>
<p> However, reverting to friend Sinbad and his horrifying adventures, there was
nothing intrinsically incompatible about it, he conceded. On the contrary, that stab in the
<br><font color="green">{u21, 704}</font>
<br> back touch was quite in keeping with those Italianos, though candidly he
was
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black"><a name="un5017bg" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5017bg">none
the less</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font> free to
admit those ice creamers and friers in the fish way not to mention the chip
potato persuasion and so forth over in little Italy there, near the Coombe, were
sober thrifty hardworking fellows except perhaps a bit too given to pothunting
the harmless necessary animal of the feline persuasion of others at night so as
to have a good old succulent meal with garlic <i>de rigueur</i> off him or her
next day on the quiet and, he added, on the cheap.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Spaniards, for instance, he continued, passionate impetuous temperaments like
<br><font color="green">{u22, 592}</font>
<br> that are given to taking the law into their own hands and give you your
quietus doublequick with those poignards they carry in the abdomen. It comes
from the great heat, climate generally. My wife is, so to speak, Spanish, half,
that is. Point of fact she could actually claim Spanish nationality if she
wanted having been born in (technically) Spain, i.e. Gibraltar. She has the
Spanish type. Quite dark, regular brunette, black. I, for one, certainly believe
climate accounts for character. That&apos;s why I asked you if you wrote poetry in Italian.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The temperaments at the door, Stephen interposed with,
were very passionate about five shillings. Roberto ruba roba sua.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Quite so, Mr Bloom dittoed.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Then, Stephen said, staring and rambling on to himself or
some unknown listener somewhere, we have the impetuosity of Dante and the
isosceles triangle, Miss Portinari he fell in love with and Leonardo and san Tommaso Mastino.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It&apos;s in the blood, Mr Bloom acceded at once. All are
washed in the blood of the sun. Coincidence, I just happened to be in the
Kildare Street Museum today, shortly prior to our meeting, if I can so call it,
and I was just looking at those antique statues there. The splendid proportions
of hips, bosom. You simply don&apos;t knock against those kind of women here. An
exception here and there. Handsome, yes, pretty in a way you find, but I&apos;m
talking about the female form. Besides, they have so little taste in dress, most of them.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 705}</font>
<br> Rumpled stockings &mdash; it may be, possibly is, a foible of mine, but
still it&apos;s a thing I simply hate to see.</p>
<p> Interest, however, was
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">beginning</span></span>
<font color="black">starting</font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font>
to flag somewhat all round and the others got on to talking about accidents at
sea, ships lost in a fog, collisions with icebergs, all that sort of thing.
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">The
sailor</span></span>
<font color="black">Shipahoy</font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font>,
of course, had his own say to say. He had doubled the Cape a few odd times and
weathered a monsoon, a kind of wind, in the China seas and through all those
perils of the deep there was one thing, he declared, stood to him, or words to
that effect, a pious medal he had that saved him.</p>
<p> So then after that they drifted on to the wreck off Daunt&apos;s rock, wreck
of that illfated Norwegian barque &mdash; nobody could think of her name for the
moment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of Henry Campbell remembered
it, <i>Palme</i>, on Booterstown Strand, that was the talk of the town that
year, breakers running over her and crowds and crowds on the shore petrified
with horror. Then someone said something about the case of the s.s. <i>Lady
Cairns</i> of Swansea, run into by the <i>Mona</i>, which was on an opposite
tack, and lost with all hands. No aid was given. Her master, the
<i>Mona</i>&apos;s, said he was afraid his collision bulkhead would give way.
She had no water, it appears, in her hold.</p>
<p> At this stage an incident happened. It having become necessary for him to
unfurl a reef, the sailor vacated his seat.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Let me cross your bows, mate, he said to his neighbour,
who was just gently dropping off into a doze.</p>
<p> He walked heavily, slowly, with a dumpy sort of a gait to the door, stepped
heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter and bore due left with a
dumpy kind of a gait. While he was in the act of getting his bearings, Mr Bloom,
who noticed when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ship&apos;s
rum sticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his burning
interior, saw him take one out and uncork it, or unscrew,
and<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black">,
applying its
<a name="un5017cu" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5017cu">nozzle</a> to his
lips,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font> take a good
old swig out of it. The irrepressible Bloom, who also
<br><font color="green">{u21, 706}</font>
<br> had a shrewd suspicion he went out on a manoeuvre after the
counterattraction in the shape of a female, who, however, had disappeared to all
intents and purposes, could, by straining, just perceive him, when duly
refreshed by his rum puncheon exploit, gazing up at the piers and girders of the
Loop Line, rather out of his depth, as of course it was all radically altered
since his last visit and greatly improved. Some person or persons invisible
directed him to the urinal erected by the cleansing committee all over the place
for the purpose, but after a brief space of time during which silence reigned
supreme, the sailor eased himself closer at hand, the noise of his bilgewater
some little time subsequently splashing on the ground where it apparently awoke a horse of the cabrank.</p>
<p> A hoof scooped anyway for new foothold after sleep and harness jingled.
Slightly disturbed in his sentrybox by the brazier of live coke, the watcher of
the corporation, who, though now broken down and fast breaking up, was none
other in reality than the Gumley aforesaid given the temporary job by Pat Tobin
in all human probability from dictates of humanity, knowing him before &mdash;
shifted about and shuffled in his box before composing his limbs again in the arms
<br><font color="green">{u22, 594}</font>
<br> of Morpheus, a truly amazing piece of hard times in its most virulent form
on a fellow most respectably connected and familiarised with decent home
comforts all his life. And there he was at the end of his tether after having
often painted the town tolerably pink, without a penny to his name. He drank,
needless to be told, and it pointed only once more a moral when he might quite
easily be in a large way of business if &mdash; a big if, however &mdash; he had
contrived to cure himself of his partiality.</p>
<p> All, meantime, were loudly lamenting the falling off in Irish shipping,
coastwise and foreign as well, which was part and parcel of the same thing. A
Palgrave Murphy boat was put off the ways at Alexandra Basin, the only launch
that year. Right enough the harbours were there only no ships ever called.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 707}</font> </p>
<p> There were wrecks and wrecks, the keeper said, who was evidently <i>au
fait</i>. What he wanted to ascertain was why that ship ran bang against the
only rock in Galway Bay when the Galway Harbour scheme was mooted, eh? Ask
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the

captain, he advised them, how much palmoil the British Government gave him for
that day&apos;s work. Captain John Lever of the Lever Line.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Am I right, skipper? he queried of the sailor now
returning after his private potation and the rest of his exertions.</p>
<p> That worthy, picking up the scent of the fagend of the song or words,
growled in wouldbe music, but with great vim, some kind of chanty or other in
seconds or thirds. Mr Bloom&apos;s sharp ears heard him then expectorate the
plug probably which it was so that he must have lodged it for the time being in
his fist while he did the drinking and making water jobs and found it a bit sour
after
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black">the

<br> <i>O, Johnny Lever!</i>
<br> <i>Johnny Lever, O!</i></p>
<p> After which effusion the redoubtable specimen arrived on the
<br><font color="green">{u22, 595}</font>
<br> scene and, regaining his seat, he sank rather than sat heavily on the form provided.</p>
<p> Skin-the-Goat, assuming he was he, evidently with an axe to grind, was
airing his grievances in a forcible-feeble philippic anent the natural resources
of Ireland, or something of that sort, which he described in his lengthy
dissertation as the richest country on the face of God&apos;s earth, far and
away superior to England, with coal in large quantities, six million
pounds&apos; worth of pork exported every year, ten millions between butter and
eggs, and all the riches drained out of it by England levying taxes on the poor
people that paid through the nose always, and gobbling up the best meat in the market, and a lot more
<br><font color="green">{u21, 708}</font>
<br> surplus steam in the same vein. Their conversation accordingly became
general and all agreed that that was a fact. You could grow any mortal thing in
Irish soil, he stated, and there was Colonel Everard down there in Navan growing
tobacco. Where would you find anywhere the like of Irish bacon? But a day of
reckoning, he stated with no uncertain voice &mdash; thoroughly monopolising all
the conversation &mdash; was in store for mighty England, despite her power of
pelf on account of her crimes. There would be a fall and the greatest fall in
history. The Germans and the Japs were going to have their little look in, he
affirmed. The Boers were the beginning of the end. Brummagem England was
toppling already and her downfall would be Ireland, her Achilles heel, which he
explained to them about the vulnerable point of Achilles, the hero &mdash; a
point his auditors at once seized as he showed the tendon on his boot. His
advice to every Irishman was: stay in the land of your birth and work for
Ireland and live for Ireland. Ireland, Parnell said, could not spare a single one of her sons.</p>
<p> Silence all round marked the termination of his finale. The impervious
navigator heard these lurid tidings undismayed.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Take a bit of doing, boss, he retaliated.</p>
<p> To which cold douche, referring to downfall and so on, the keeper concurred
but nevertheless held to his main view.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who&apos;s the best troops in the army? the grizzled old
veteran irately interrogated. And the best jumpers and racers? And the best
admirals and generals we&apos;ve got? Tell me that.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The Irish, for choice, retorted the cabby like Campbell.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 596}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That&apos;s right, the old tarpaulin corroborated. The
Irish catholic peasant. He&apos;s the backbone of our empire. You know Jem Mullins?</p>
<p> While allowing him his individual opinions, as every man, the keeper added
he cared nothing for any empire, ours or his, and considered no Irishman worthy
of his salt that served it. Then they began to have a few irascible words, when it waxed hotter, both,
<br><font color="green">{u21, 709}</font>
<br> needless to say, appealing to the listeners who followed the passage of
arms with interest so long as they didn&apos;t indulge in recriminations and come to blows.</p>
<p> From inside information Mr Bloom was rather inclined to poohpooh the
suggestion as egregious balderdash, for, pending that consummation devoutly to
be or not to be wished for, he was fully cognisant of the fact that their
neighbours across the channel, unless they were much bigger fools than he took
them for, rather concealed their strength than the opposite. It was quite on a
par with the quixotic idea that in a hundred million years the coal seam of the
sister island would be played out and as a host of
contingencies<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black">,
equally <a name="un5017ai" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5017ai">relevant to
the issue</a>,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font> might
occur ere then it was highly advisable in the interim to try to make the most of
both countries, even though poles apart. Another little interesting point, the
amours of whores and chummies reminded him Irish soldiers had as often fought
for England as against her, more so, in fact. And now, why? So the scene between
the pair of them, the licensee of the place, rumoured to be or have been
Fitzharris, the famous invincible, and the other, obviously bogus, reminded him
forcibly as being on all fours with the confidence trick, supposing, that is, it
was prearranged, as the looker-on, a student of the human soul, if anything, the
others seeing least of the game. And as for the lessee or keeper, who probably
wasn&apos;t the other person at all, he (Bloom) couldn&apos;t help feeling, and
most properly, it was better to give people like that the goby and refuse to
have anything to do with them in private life and their felonsetting, there
always being the offchance of a Dannyman turning Queen&apos;s evidence &mdash;
or King&apos;s, now &mdash; like Denis Carey, an idea he utterly repudiated.
Quite apart from that, he disliked those careers of wrongdoing and crime on
principle.
Yet<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black">,
though <a name="un7007cr" href="../../FF/unbs/un7all.htm#un7007cr">such criminal
propensities had never been an inmate of his
bosom</a>,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font> he
certainly did feel, and no denying it, a certain
<br><font color="green">{u22, 597}</font>
<br> kind of admiration for a man who had actually brandished a knife, cold
steel, with the courage of his political opinions, on all fours with those love
vendettas of the south &mdash; have her or swing for her &mdash; until it just
struck him that Fitz, nicknamed Skin-the-Goat, merely drove the car for the
actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not, if he was reliably informed,
actually party to the ambush which, in point of fact, was the plea some legal
luminary saved his skin on. In any case that was very ancient history by now and
as for our friend, the pseudo Skin-the-etcetera, he had transparently outlived
his welcome. He ought to have either died naturally or on the scaffold high.
Like actresses, always farewell &mdash; positively last performance &mdash; then
come up smiling again. Generous to a fault, of course, temperamental, no
economising or any idea of the sort, always snapping at the bone for the shadow.
So similarly he had a very shrewd suspicion that Mr Johnny Lever got rid of some
&pound;. s. d.

he had heard not so long before the same identical lingo, as he told Stephen how
he simply but effectually silenced the offender.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He took umbrage at something or other, that muchinjured
person declared, I let slip. He called me a Jew, and in a heated fashion,
offensively. So I, without deviating from plain facts in the least, told him his
God, I mean Christ, was a jew too, and all his family, like me, though in
reality I&apos;m not. That was one for him. A soft answer turns away wrath. He
hadn&apos;t a word to say for himself, as everyone saw. Am I not right?</p>
<p> He turned a long you are wrong gaze on Stephen of timorous dark pride at the
soft impeachment, with a glance also of entreaty.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 711}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>Ex quibus</i>, Stephen mumbled in a noncommital accent,

after all, any other, <i>secundum carnem</i>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Of course, Mr Bloom proceeded to stipulate, you must look
at both sides of the question. It is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to right
<br><font color="green">{u22, 598}</font>
<br> and wrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is, though
every country, they say, our own distressful included, has the government it
deserves. But with a little goodwill all round. It&apos;s all very fine to boast
of mutual superiority but what about mutual equality? I resent violence and
intolerance in any shape or form. It never reaches anything or stops anything. A
revolution must come on due instalments plan. It&apos;s a patent absurdity
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black"><a name="un4048n" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4048n">on

to hate people because they live round the corner and speak another vernacular, so to speak.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Memorable bloody bridge battle and seven minutes&apos;
war, Stephen assented, between Skinner&apos;s alley and Ormond market.</p>
<p> Yes, Mr Bloom thoroughly agreed, that was overwhelmingly right and the whole
world was overwhelmingly full of that sort of thing.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You just took the words out of my mouth, he said. A
hocuspocus of conflicting evidence that candidly you couldn&apos;t remotely&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> All those wretched quarrels, in his humble opinion, stirring up bad blood,
from some bump of combativeness or gland of some kind, erroneously supposed to
be about a punctilio of honour and a flag, were very largely a question of the
money question which was at the back of everything, greed and jealousy, people never knowing when to stop.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; They accuse, remarked he audibly.</p>
<p> He turned away from the others, who probably
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext"><font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font></span></span>

<p class="di">&mdash; Jews, he softly imparted in an aside in Stephen&apos;s
ear, are accused of ruining. Not a vestige of truth in it, I can safely say.
History, &mdash; would you be surprised to learn? &mdash; proves up to the hilt
Spain decayed when the Inquisition hounded the jews out and England prospered
when Cromwell, an uncommonly able ruffian, who, in other respects had
<br><font color="green">{u21, 712}</font>
<br> much to answer for, imported them. Why? Because they are practical and are
proved to be so. I don&apos;t want to indulge in any
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext"><font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font></span></span>
<font color="black">&nbsp;&hellip;</font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font>
because you know the standard works on the subject, and then, orthodox as you
are

<font color="black">&nbsp;&hellip;</font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font>
But in the economic, not touching religion, domain, the priest spells poverty.
Spain again, you saw in the war, compared with America. Turks. It&apos;s in the
dogma. Because if they didn&apos;t believe they&apos;d go straight to heaven
when they died they&apos;d try to live better, &mdash; at least, so I think.
That&apos;s the juggle on which the p.p.&apos;s raise the wind on false
pretences. I&apos;m, he resumed with dramatic force, as good an Irishman as that
rude person I told you about at the outset and I want to see
<br><font color="green">{u22, 599}</font>
<br> everyone, concluded he, all creeds and classes having a comfortable income,
something in the neighbourhood of &pound;300 per annum. That&apos;s the vital
issue at stake and it&apos;s feasible and would be provocative of friendlier
intercourse between man and man. At least, that&apos;s my idea for what
it&apos;s worth. I call that patriotism. <i>Ubi patria</i>, as we learned a
small smattering of in our classical days in <i>Alma Mater</i>, <i>vita
bene</i>. Where you can live well, the sense is, if you work.</p>
<p> Over his untastable apology for a cup of coffee, listening to this synopsis
of things in general, Stephen stared at nothing in particular. He could hear, of
course, all kinds of words changing colour like those crabs about Ringsend in
the morning burrowing quickly into all colours of different sorts of the same
sand where they had a home somewhere beneath or seemed to. Then he looked up and
saw the eyes that said or didn&apos;t say the words the voice he heard said &mdash; if you work.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Count me out, he managed to remark, meaning work.</p>
<p> The eyes were surprised at this observation because as he, the person who
owned them pro. tem. observed, or rather his voice speaking did, all must work, have to, together.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I mean, of course, the other hastened to affirm, work in
the widest possible sense. Also literary labour, not merely for the kudos of the
thing. Writing for the newspapers which is the readiest channel nowadays.
That&apos;s work too. Important work. After all, from the little I know of you,
after all the money expended on your education, you are
<br><font color="green">{u21, 714}</font>
<br> entitled to recoup yourself and command your price. You have every bit as
much right to live by your pen in pursuit of your philosophy as the peasant has.
What? You both belong to Ireland, the brain and the brawn. Each is equally important.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You suspect, Stephen retorted with a sort of laugh, that I
may be important because I belong to Ireland.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I would go a step farther, Mr Bloom insinuated.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; But I suspect, Stephen interrupted, that Ireland must be important because it belongs to me.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What belongs? queried Mr Bloom, bending. Excuse me.
Unfortunately I didn&apos;t catch the latter portion. What was it you&nbsp;&hellip;?</p>
<p> Stephen, patently crosstempered, repeated and shoved aside his mug of
coffee, or whatever you like to call it, none too politely, adding:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; We can&apos;t change the country. Let us change the subject.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 600}</font> </p>
<p> At this pertinent suggestion Mr Bloom, to change the subject, looked down,
but in a quandary, not knowing exactly what construction to put on belongs to.
The rebuke of some kind was clearer than the other part. Needless to say, the
fumes of his recent orgy spoke then in a curious bitter way foreign to his sober
state. Probably the home life, to which Mr Bloom attached the utmost importance,
had not been all that was needful or he hadn&apos;t

sort of people. With a touch of fear for the young man beside him, whom he
furtively scrutinised with an air of some consternation, remembering he had just
come back from Paris, failing to throw much light on the subject, however, he
brought to mind instances of cultured fellows that promised so brilliantly
nipped in the bud of premature decay, and nobody to blame but themselves. For
instance, there was the case of O&apos;Callaghan the half crazy faddist,
respectably connected, though of inadequate means, with his mad vagaries, among
whose other gay doings he was in the habit of ostentatiously sporting in public
a suit of brown paper (a fact). And then the usual <i>d&eacute;nouement</i>

<br><font color="green">{u21, 715}</font>
<br> acquaintance of someone of no uncommon calibre who could provide food for
talk would amply repay any small. Intellectual stimulation as such was, he felt,
from time to time a firstrate tonic for the mind. Added to which was the
coincidence of meeting, discussion, dance, row, old salt, night loafers, all
went to make up a miniature cameo of the world we live in. To improve the
shining hour he wondered whether he might meet with anything approaching the
same luck as Mr Philip Beaufoy if taken down in writing. Suppose he were to pen

New York disaster, thousand lives lost. Foot and Mouth. Funeral of the late Mr Patrick Dignam.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 602}</font> </p>
<p> So to change the subject he read about Dignam, R.I.P., which, he reflected, was anything but a gay sendoff.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; This morning (Hynes put it in, of course), the remains of
the late Mr Patrick Dignam were removed from his residence, n&deg; 9 Newbridge
Avenue, Sandymount, for interment in Glasnevin. The deceased gentleman was a
most popular and genial personality in city life and his demise, after a brief
illness, came as a great shock to citizens of all classes by whom he is deeply
regretted. The obsequies, at which many friends of the deceased were present,
were carried out by (certainly Hynes wrote it with a nudge from Corny) Messrs.
H.J. O&apos;Neill &amp; Son, 164 North Strand Road. The mourners included: Patk.
Dignam (son), Bernard Corrigan (brother-in-law), Jno. Henry Menton, solr, Martin
Cunningham, John Power eatondph 1/8 ador dorador douradora (must be where he
called Monks the dayfather about Keyes&apos;s ad) Thomas Kernan, Simon Dedalus,
Stephen Dedalus, B.A., Edward J. Lambert, Cornelius Kelleher, Joseph M&apos;C.
Hynes, L. Boom, C.P. M&apos;Coy, &mdash; Mackintosh, and several others.</p>
<p> Nettled not a little by L. Boom (as it incorrectly stated) and the line of
bitched type, but amused simultaneously by C.P. M&apos;Coy and Stephen Dedalus,
B.A., who were conspicuous, needless to say, by their absence, L. Boom pointed
it out to his companion, B.A., engaged in stifling another yawn, half
nervousness, not forgetting the usual crop of nonsensical misprints.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Is that first epistle to the Hebrews, he asked, as soon as
his bottom jaw would let him, in? Text: open thy mouth and put thy foot in it.</p>

Different ways of bringing off a coup. Lovemaking damages. Though that halfbaked
Lyons ran off at a tangent in his impetuosity to get left. Of course gambling
eminently lent itself to that sort of thing though as the event turned out, the
poor fool hadn&apos;t much reason to congratulate himself on his pick, the
forlorn hope. Guesswork it reduced itself to.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There was every indication they would arrive at that, he, Bloom, said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who? the other, whose hand by the way was hurt, said.</p>
<p> One morning you would open the paper, the cabman affirmed, and read, Return
of Parnell. He bet them what they liked. A Dublin fusilier was in that shelter
one night and said he saw him in South Africa. Pride it was killed him. He ought
to have done away with himself or lain low for a time after Committee Room
n&deg; 15. Then they would have gone down on their marrowbones to him to come
back. Dead he wasn&apos;t. The coffin they brought over was full of stones. He
changed his name to De Wet, the Boer general. He made a mistake to fight the priests. And so forth and so on.</p>
<p> All the same Bloom

was rather surprised at their memories for in nine cases out of ten it was a
case of tar-barrels, and not singly but in their thousands, and then complete
oblivion because it was twenty odd years. Highly unlikely, of course, there was
even a shadow of truth in the stones and, even supposing, he thought a return
highly inadvisable, all things considered. Something evidently riled them in his
death. Either he petered out too tamely of
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black">acute</font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font>
pneumonia just when his various political arrangements were

his movements, even before, there was absolutely no clue to his whereabouts, so the
<br><font color="green">{u22, 604}</font>
<br> remark which emanated from friend cabby might be within the bounds of
possibility. Naturally then, it would prey on his mind as a born leader of men,

didn&apos;t set the terrier at you directly you got back. Then a lot of
shillyshally usually followed, Tom for and Dick and Harry against. And then,
number one, you came up against the man in possession and had to produce your
credentials, like the claimant in the Tichborne case, Roger Charles Tichborne,
<i>Bella</i> was the boat&apos;s name he, the heir, went down in, as the
evidence went to show, and there was a tattoo mark too in Indian ink, Lord Bellew, was it? As he might very
<br><font color="green">{u21, 719}</font>
<br> easily have picked up the details from some pal on board ship and then
introduce himself with, Excuse me, my name is So-and-So, or some such
commonplace remark. A more prudent course, as Bloom said to the not over
effusive in fact like the distinguished personage under discussion beside him,
would have been to sound the lie of the land first.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That bitch, that English whore, did for him, the shebeen
proprietor commented. She put the first nail in his coffin.</p>

<p> This occasioned a fair amount of laughter among his entourage. As regards Bloom, he reflected
<br><font color="green">{u22, 605}</font>
<br> upon the historic story which had aroused extraordinary interest at the
time when the facts, to make matters worse, were made public with the usual
affectionate letters that passed between them, full of sweet nothings. First, it
was strictly platonic till an attachment sprang up between them, till it bit by
bit became the talk of the town till the staggering blow came as a welcome
intelligence to not a few evildisposed, however, who were resolved upon

question, needless to say, cropped up. Can real love exist between married folk?
Though it was no concern of theirs absolutely if he regarded her with affection,
carried away by a wave of folly. A magnificent specimen of manhood he was truly,
augmented by gifts of a high order as compared with the other military

effectually cooked his matrimonial goose. Looking back now in a retrospective
kind of arrangement, all seemed a kind of dream. And then coming back was the
worst thing you ever did because it went without saying you would feel out of
place as things always moved with the times. Why, as he reflected, Irishtown
Strand, a locality he had not been in for quite a number of years, looked
different somehow since, as it happened, he went to live on the north side.
North or south, however, it was just a case of hot passion, pure and simple,

<p class="di">&mdash; The King of Spain&apos;s daughter, Stephen answered.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Was she? Bloom said, surprised, though not astonished by
any means. I never heard that rumour before. Possible, especially there, it was, as she lived there. So, Spain.</p>

<p> Stephen, obviously addressed, looked down on the photo showing a large sized
lady, with her charms on evidence in an open fashion, as she was in the full
bloom of womanhood, in evening dress cut ostentatiously low for the occasion to
give a liberal display of bosom, with more than visions of breasts, her full
lips parted, and some perfect teeth, standing near, ostensibly with gravity, a
piano, on the rest of which was <i>In Old Madrid</i>, a ballad, pretty in its
way, which was then all the vogue. Her (the lady&apos;s) eyes, dark, large,
looked at Stephen, about to smile about something to be admired, Lafayette

<p> Beside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his legal
wife who, he intimated, was the accomplished daughter of Major Brian Tweedy and
displayed at an early age remarkable proficiency as a singer having even made her bow to the public when
<br><font color="green">{u21, 722}</font>
<br> her years numbered barely

sixteen. As for the face, it was a speaking likeness in expression but it did
not do justice to her figure, which came in for a lot of notice usually and
which did not come out to the best advantage in that get-up. She could without
difficulty, he said, have posed for the ensemble, not to dwell on certain
opulent curves of the. He dwelt on the female form in general developmentally
because, as it
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black">so</font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font>
happened, no later than that afternoon, he had seen those Grecian statues,
perfectly developed, in the National Museum. Marble could give the original,
shoulders, back, all the symmetry. All the rest, yes, puritanism. It does
though, St. Joseph&apos;s sovereign

<font color="black">&nbsp;&hellip;</font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font>
whereas no photo could, because it simply wasn&apos;t art, in a word.</p>
<p> The spirit moving him, he would much have liked to follow Jack Tar&apos;s
good example and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to speak for
itself on the plea he so that the other could drink in the beauty for himself,
her stage presence being, frankly, a treat in itself. But it was scarcely
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black">professional</font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font>
etiquette so, though it was a warm pleasant sort of a night now yet wonderfully
cool for the season considering, for sunshine after storm. And he did feel a
kind of need there and then to satisfy a
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black">possible</font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font>
need <font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black">by

Nevertheless, he sat tight, just viewing the slightly soiled photo creased by
opulent curves, none the worse for wear, however, and looked away thoughtfully.
In fact, the slight soiling was only an added charm, like the case of linen
slightly soiled, good as new, much better, in fact, with the starch out. Suppose
she was gone when he? I looked for the lamp which she told me came into his mind
but merely as a passing fancy of his because then he recollected the morning
littered bed etcetera, and the book about Ruby with met him pike hoses (sic) in
it which must have fell down sufficiently appropriately beside the chamberpot with apologies to Lindley Murray.

<p> The vicinity of the young man he certainly relished, educated,
<i>distingu&eacute;</i>, and impulsive into the bargain, far and away the pick
of the bunch, though you wouldn&apos;t think he had it in him, yet you would. Besides he said the
<br><font color="green">{u22, 608}</font>
<br> picture was handsome which, say what you like, it was, though at the moment
she was distinctly stouter. And why not? An awful lot of makebelieve went on
about that sort of thing involving a lifelong slur with the usual splash page of
letterpress
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black">instead

were fated to meet and an attachment sprang up between the two so that their

the habitual compromising expressions, leaving no loophole, to show that they
cohabited and relations, when the thing ran its normal course, became in due

were in one another, could safely afford to ignore it as they very largely did.

all on account of some scurrilous effusions from the facile pens of the
O&apos;Brienite scribes at the usual mudslinging occupation, reflecting on the

man, he was still a commanding figure, though carelessly garbed as usual, with
that look of settled purpose which went a long way with the shillyshallyers till
<br><font color="green">{u21, 724}</font>
<br> they discovered to their discomfiture that their idol had feet of clay,
which she, however, was the first to perceive. As those were particularly hot

personally, being of a sceptical bias, believed, and made no bones about saying

<br> the nature of single blessedness he would one day take unto himself a wife
when Miss Right came on the scene but in the interim ladies&apos; society was a

with the orthodox preliminary canter of compliment paying leading up to fond
lovers&apos; ways and flowers and chocs. To think of him house and homeless,
rooked by some landlady worse than any stepmother was really too bad at his age.
The queer suddenly things he popped out with attracted the elder man who was
several years the other&apos;s senior or like his father. But something
substantial he certainly ought to eat, were it only an eggflip made on
unadulterated maternal nutriment or, failing that, the homely Humpty Dumpty boiled.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; At what o&apos;clock did you dine? he questioned of the

<br><font color="green">{u21, 726}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Some time yesterday, Stephen said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yesterday! exclaimed Bloom till he remembered it was

said<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black">,

<p> Literally astounded at this piece of intelligence Bloom reflected. Though
they didn&apos;t see eye to eye in everything, a certain analogy there somehow
was, as if both their minds were travelling, so to speak, in the one train of
thought. At his age when dabbling in politics roughly some score of years
previously
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black">when he
had been a <i>quasi</i>
<a name="un5017f" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5017f">aspirant to</a>
<a name="un4031ds" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031ds">parliamentary

recollected in retrospect (which was a source of
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black">keen</font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font>
satisfaction in itself) he had a sneaking regard for those same ultra ideas. For
instance, when the evicted tenants question, then at its first inception, bulked
largely in people&apos;s mind though not contributing a copper or pinning his
faith absolutely to its dictums, he in principle, at all events, was in thorough
sympathy with peasant possession, as voicing the trend of modern opinion,a
partiality, however, he was subsequently partially cured of, and even was
twitted with going a step further than Michael Davitt in the views he
inculcated, which was one reason he strongly resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion
<br><font color="green">{u22, 611}</font>
<br> at the gathering of the clans in Barney Kiernan&apos;s so that he, though
often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of mortals, be it
repeated, departed from his customary habit to give him metaphorically one in
the gizzard though, so far as politics were concerned, he was only too conscious
of the casualties invariably resulting from propaganda and displays of animosity
and the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on fine young
fellows, chiefly, destruction of the fittest, in a word.</p>
<p> Anyhow, upon weighing up the pros and cons, getting on for one as it was, it
was high time to be retiring for the night. The crux was it was a bit risky to
bring him home as eventualities might possibly ensue as on the night he
misguidedly brought home a dog (breed unknown) with a lame paw,not that the
cases were either identical or the reverse, though he had hurt his hand too, to
Ontario Terrace, as he very distinctly remembered. On the other hand it was
altogether too late for the Sandymount or Sandycove suggestion so that he was in
some perplexity as to which of the two alternatives. Everything pointed to the
fact that it behoved him to avail himself to the full of the opportunity, all
things considered. His initial impression was he was a shade standoffish or not
over effusive but it grew on him someway. For one thing he mightn&apos;t what
you call jump at the idea, if approached, and what mostly worried him was he
didn&apos;t know how to lead up to it or word it exactly, supposing he did
entertain the proposal, as it would afford him very great personal pleasure if
he would allow him to help to put coin in his way or some wardrobe, if found
suitable. At all events he wound up by concluding, eschewing for the nonce
hidebound precedent, a cup of Epps&apos;s cocoa and a shakedown for the night
plus the use of a rug or two and overcoat doubled into a pillow. At least he
would be in safe hands and as warm as a toast
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black">on a
trivet</font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font>. He failed to
perceive any very vast amount of harm in always with the proviso no rumpus of
any sort was kicked up. A move had to be made because that merry old soul, the
grasswidower in question, didn&apos;t appear in any particular hurry to wend his
way home to his dearly beloved Queenstown and it was highly likely some
sponger&apos;s bawdyhouse of retired beauties off Sheriff street lower would be
the best clue to that equivocal character&apos;s whereabouts for a few days to
come, alternately racking their feelings (the mermaids&apos;) with

<p> The best plan clearly being to clear out, the remainder being plain sailing,
he beckoned, while prudently pocketing the photo, to the keeper of the shanty, who didn&apos;t seem to.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, that&apos;s the best, he assured Stephen, to whom for
the matter of that it was all more or less.</p>
<p> All kinds of Utopian plans were flashing through his (Bloom&apos;s) brain.
Education (the genuine article), literature, journalism, prize titbits, up to
date billing, hydros and concert tours in English watering resorts packed with
theatres, turning money away, duets in Italian with the accent perfectly true to
nature, no necessity of course to tell the world and his wife from the housetops
about it, and a slice of luck. An opening was all was wanted. Because he more
than suspected he had his father&apos;s voice so it would be just as well, by
the way no harm, to trail the conversation in that direction just to.</p>

cut a long story
short</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font> Bloom was
the first to rise from his seat
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black">so as
not <a name="un6015di" href="../../FF/unbs/un6all.htm#un6015di">to outstay their

first and foremost taken the wise precaution to motion to mine host a scarcely
perceptible sign when the others were not looking, to the effect that the amount
due as forthcoming, making a grand total of fourpence (the amount he deposited
unobtrusively in four coppers, literally the last of the Mohicans), he having
previously seen on the printed pricelist for all who ran to read opposite him in
unmistakable figures, coffee 2d, confectionery do. and honestly well worth twice the money.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Come, he counselled, to close the <i>s&eacute;ance</i>.</p>
<p> Seeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear, they left the shelter
or shanty together and the &eacute;lite society of oilskin and company
<br><font color="green">{u21, 730}</font>
<br>. Stephen, who confessed to still feeling poorly and fagged out, paused at the, for a moment, the door.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; One thing I never understood, he said, to be original on
the spur of the moment. Why they put tables upside down at night on the tables in caf&eacute;s.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 614}</font> </p>
<p> To which impromptu the neverfailing Bloom replied without a moment&apos;s hesitation, saying straight off:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; To sweep the floor in the morning.</p>
<p> So saying he skipped around, nimbly considering, frankly at the same time
apologetic to get on his companion&apos;s right, a habit of his, by the bye. The
night air was certainly now a treat to breathe though Stephen was a bit weak on his pins.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It will (the air) do you good, Bloom said, meaning also
the walk, in a moment. The only thing is to walk. It&apos;s not far. Lean on me.</p>
<p> Accordingly he passed his left arm in Stephen&apos;s right and led him on accordingly.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, Stephen said uncertainly, because he thought he felt
a strange kind of flesh approach him, sinewless and wobbly and all that.</p>
<p><font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black">&rArr;</font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font>
Anyhow, they passed the sentrybox with stones, brazier, etc where the municipal
supernumerary, ex Gumley, was still to all intents and purposes wrapped in the
arms of Murphy, as the adage has it, dreaming of fresh fields and pastures new.
And apropos of coffin of stones, the analogy was not bad, as it was in fact a
stoning to death on the part of seventytwo out of eighty odd constituencies that
ratted at the time of the split and chiefly the belauded peasant class, probably
the selfsame evicted tenants he had put in their holdings.</p>
<p> So they passed on to chatting about music, a form of art for which Bloom, as
a pure amateur, possessed the greatest love, as they made tracks arm-in-arm
across Beresford Place. Wagnerian music, though confessedly grand in its way,
was a bit too heavy for Bloom but the music of Mercadante&apos;s
<i>Huguenots</i>, Meyerbeer&apos;s <i>Seven Last Words on the Cross</i>, and
Mozart&apos;s <i>Twelfth Mass</i>, the <i>Gloria</i> in that being to his mind
the acme of first class
music<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black">,
<a name="un5018bb" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5018bb">as
such</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font>. He also
yielded to none in his admiration of Rossini&apos;s <i>Stabat Mater</i>, a work
simply abounding in immortal numbers, in which his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy,
made a hit, a veritable sensation, he might even say, putting the others totally in the
<br><font color="green">{u22, 615}</font>
<br> shade, in the jesuit fathers&apos; church in upper Gardiner street, the
sacred edifice being thronged
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black">to the
doors</font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font> to hear her
with virtuosos, or virtuosi rather. There was the unanimous opinion that there
was none to come up to her, and suffice it to say in a place of worship for
music of a sacred character, there was a generally voiced desire for an encore.
On the whole, though favouring preferably light opera of the <i>Don Giovanni</i>
description, and <i>Martha</i>, a gem in its line, he had a <i>penchant</i>,
though with only a surface knowledge, for the severe classical school such as
Mendelssohn. And talking of that, taking it for granted he knew all about the
old favourites, he mentioned
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black"><a name="un5012b" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5012b"><i>par
excellence</i></a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font>
Lionel&apos;s air in <i>Martha</i>, <i>M&apos;appari</i>, which, curiously
enough, he heard, or overheard, to be more accurate, on yesterday, a privilege
he keenly appreciated, from the lips of Stephen&apos;s respected father, sung to
perfection, a study of the number, in fact
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black">which
made all the others
<a name="un5018au" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5018au">take a back
seat</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font>. Stephen,
in reply to a politely put query, said he didn&apos;t but launched out into
praises of Shakespeare&apos;s songs, at least of in or about that period, the
lutenist Dowland who lived in Fetter Lane near Gerard the herbalist, who <i>anno
ludendo hausi, Doulandus</i>, an instrument he was contemplating purchasing from
Mr Arnold Dolmetsch, whom Bloom did not quite recall, though the name certainly
sounded familiar, for sixtyfive guineas and Farnaby and son with their
<i>dux</i> and <i>comes</i> conceits, and Byrd (William), who played the
virginals, he said, in the Queen&apos;s Chapel or anywhere else he found
<br><font color="green">{u21, 732}</font>
<br> them and one Tomkins who made toys or airs, and John Bull.</p>
<p> On the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond the
swingchains a horse, dragging a sweeper, paced on the paven ground, brushing a
long swathe of mire up, so that with the noise Bloom was not perfectly certain
whether he had caught aright the allusion to sixtyfive guineas and John Bull. He
inquired if it was John Bull the political celebrity of that ilk, as it struck
him, the two identical names, as a striking coincidence.</p>
<p> By the chains, the horse slowly swerved to turn, which perceiving, Bloom
plucked the other&apos;s sleeve gently, jocosely remarking:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Our lives are in peril tonight. Beware of the steamroller.</p>
<p> They thereupon stopped. Bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth
sixtyfive guineas, suddenly in evidence in the dark quite near, so that it
seemed new, a different grouping of bones and even flesh, because palpably it
was a fourwalker, a hipshaker, a taildangler, a headhanger, putting his hind
foot foremost the while the lord of his creation
<br><font color="green">{u22, 616}</font>
<br> sat on the perch, busy with his thoughts. But such a good poor brute, he
was sorry he hadn&apos;t a lump of sugar but, as he wisely reflected, you could
scarcely be prepared for every emergency that might crop up. He was just a big
nervous foolish noodly kind of a horse, without a care in the world. But even a
dog, he reflected, take that mongrel in Barney Kiernan&apos;s, of the same size,
would be a holy horror to face. But it was no animal&apos;s fault in particular
if he was built that way, like the camel, ship of the desert, distilling grapes
into potheen in his hump. Nine tenths of them all could be caged or trained,
nothing beyond the art of man barring the bees; whale with a harpoon hairpin,
alligator, tickle the small of his back and he sees the joke; chalk a circle for
a rooster; tiger, my eagle eye. These timely reflections anent the brutes
occupied his mind, somewhat distracted from Stephen&apos;s words, while the ship
of the street was manoeuvring and Stephen went on about the highly interesting old.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; My wife, he intimated,
<br><font color="green">{u21, 733}</font>
<br> would
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">be

as she is passionately attached to music of any kind.</p>
<p> He looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of Stephen, image
of his mother, which was not quite the same as the usual blackguard type they
unquestionably had an indubitable hankering after as he was perhaps not that way built.</p>
<p> Still, supposing he had his father&apos;s gift, as he more than suspected,
it opened up new vistas in his mind, such as Lady Fingall&apos;s Irish
industries concert on the preceding Monday, and aristocracy in general.</p>
<p> Exquisite variations he was now describing on an air <i>Youth here has
End</i> by Jans Pieter Sweelinck, a Dutchman of Amsterdam where the frows come
from. Even more he liked an old German song of Johannes Jeep about the clear sea
and the voices of sirens, sweet murderers of men, which boggled Bloom a bit:</p>
<p class="set"><i>Von der Sirenen Listigkeit</i>
<br> <i>Tun die Poeten dichten.</i></p>
<p> These opening bars he sang and translated. Bloom, nodding, said he perfectly
understood and begged him to go on by all means, which he did.</p>
<p> A phenomenally beautiful voice like that, the rarest of boons, which Bloom
appreciated at the first note he got out, could easily, if properly
<br><font color="green">{u22, 617}</font>
<br> handled

causing a slight flutter in the dovecotes of the fair sex and being made a lot
of by ladies out for sensation, cases of which, as he happened to know, were on
record. Added to which, of course, would be the pecuniary emolument by no means
to be sneezed at. Not, he parenthesised, that for the sake of filthy lucre he
need necessarily embrace the lyric platform as a walk in life for any lengthy
space of time, but a step in the required direction it was, beyond yea or nay,
and both monetarily and mentally it contained no reflection on his dignity in
the smallest and it often turned in uncommonly handy to be handed a cheque at a
muchneeded moment when every little helped. Besides, though taste latterly had
deteriorated to a degree, original music like that, different from the
conventional rut, would rapidly have a great vogue, as it would be a decided
novelty for Dublin&apos;s musical world after the usual hackneyed run of catchy
tenor solos. Yes, beyond a shadow of a doubt, he could, with all the cards in

literature in his spare moments when desirous of so doing without its clashing
with his vocal career. In fact, he had the ball at his feet.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 735}</font> </p>
<p> The horse was just then, and later on, at a propitious opportunity he
purposed (Bloom did), without anyway prying into his private affairs, advising
him to sever his connection with a certain budding practitioner, who, he
noticed, was prone to disparage, and even, to a slight extent, with some
hilarious pretext, when not present, deprecate him, or whatever you like to call
it; which, in Bloom&apos;s humble opinion, threw a nasty sidelight on that side
of a person&apos;s character &mdash; no pun intended.</p>
<p> The horse, having reached the end of his tether, so to speak, halted, and,
rearing high a proud feathering tail, added his quota by letting fall on the
floor, which the brush would soon brush up and polish, three smoking globes of
turds. Slowly, three times, one after another, from a full crupper, he mired.
And humanely his driver waited till he (or she) had ended, patient in his scythed car.</p>
<p> Side by side Bloom, profiting by the
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">contretemps</span></span>
<font color="black"><i>contretemps</i></font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font>,
with Stephen passed through the gap of the chains, divided by the upright, and,
stepping over a strand of mire, went across towards Gardiner street lower,
Stephen singing more boldly, but not loudly, the end of the ballad:</p>
<p class="set"><i>Und alle Schiffe br&uuml;cken</i>.</p>
<p> The driver never said a word. He merely watched the two figures, both black
&mdash; one full, one lean &mdash; walk towards the railway bridge. As they
walked, they at times stopped and walked again, continuing their <i>t&ecirc;te
&agrave; t&ecirc;te</i> (which of course he was well out of), about sirens,
enemies of man&apos;s reason, and a number of other topics of the same category,
usurpers, historical cases of the kind.</p>  </main>
