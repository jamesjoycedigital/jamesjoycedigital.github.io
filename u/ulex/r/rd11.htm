<p> Preparatory to anything else Mr Bloom brushed off the greater bulk of the
shavings and handed Stephen the hat and ashplant and bucked him up generally in
orthodox Samaritan fashion, which he very badly needed. His (Stephen&apos;s)
mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a bit unsteady and on his
expressed desire for some beverage to drink Mr Bloom, in view of the hour it was
and there being no
<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">pump</span></span>

of Vartry water available for their ablutions, let alone drinking purposes, hit
upon an expedient by suggesting, off the reel, the propriety of the
cabman&apos;s shelter, as it was called, hardly a stonesthrow away near Butt
Bridge<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><a target="foot" id="frr0002">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
where they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk and soda or a
mineral. But how to get there was the rub. For the nonce he was rather
nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon him to take some
measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and means during which Stephen
repeatedly yawned. So far as he could see he was rather pale in the face so that
it occurred to him as highly advisable to get a conveyance of some description
which would answer in their then condition, both of them being e.d. ed,
particularly Stephen, always assuming that there was such a thing to be found.
Accordingly<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font>,<a target="foot" id="frr0003">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
after a few such

in spite of his having forgotten to take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief
after it had done yeoman service in the shaving line,

they both walked together along Beaver

Street<a target="foot" id="frr0007">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>,
or, more properly, lane, as far as the farrier&apos;s and the distinctly fetid
atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of Montgomery street where they
made tracks to the left from thence debouching into Amiens
<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">street</span></span>
Street<a target="foot" id="frr0008">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
round by the corner of Dan Bergin&apos;s. But, as he confidently anticipated,
there was not a sign of a Jehu plying for hire anywhere to be seen except a
fourwheeler, probably engaged by some fellows inside on the spree, outside the
North Star Hotel and there was no symptom of its budging a quarter of an inch
when Mr Bloom, who was anything but a professional whistler, endeavoured to hail
it by emitting a kind of a whistle, holding his arms arched over his head, twice.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 570}</font> </p>
<p> This was a quandary but, bringing

to bear on it, evidently there was nothing for it but put a good face on the
matter and foot it which they accordingly did. So, bevelling around by

Mullet&apos;s<a target="foot" id="frr0010">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
and the Signal House, which they shortly reached, they proceeded perforce in the
direction of Amiens
<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">street</span></span>

railway terminus, Mr Bloom being handicapped by the circumstance that one of the
back buttons of his trousers had, to vary the timehonoured adage, gone the way
of all
buttons<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font>,<a target="foot" id="frr0012">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
though, entering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing, he heroically made
light of the mischance. So as neither of them were particularly pressed for
time, as it happened, and the temperature refreshing since it cleared up after
the recent visitation of Jupiter Pluvius, they dandered along past by where the
empty vehicle was waiting without a fare or a jarvey. As it so happened a Dublin
United Tramways Company&apos;s sandstrewer happening to be returning
<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font>and<a target="foot" id="frr0013">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
the elder man recounted to his companion <i>&agrave; propos</i> of the incident
his own truly miraculous escape of some little while back. They passed the main
entrance of the Great Northern railway station, the starting point for Belfast,
where of course all traffic was suspended at that late hour,
and<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><a target="foot" id="frr0014">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
passing the back door of the morgue (a not very enticing locality, not to say
gruesome to a degree, more especially at night), ultimately gained the Dock
Tavern and in due course turned into Store

famous for its C division police station. Between this point and the high, at
present unlit, warehouses of Beresford Place Stephen thought to think of Ibsen,
associated with Baird&apos;s, the
stonecutter&apos;s<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><a target="foot" id="frr0016">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
in his mind somehow in Talbot Place, first turning on the right, while the
other, who was acting as his <i>fidus
Achates</i><font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><a target="foot" id="frr0017">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
inhaled with internal satisfaction the smell of James Rourke&apos;s city bakery,
situated quite close to where they were, the very palatable odour indeed of our
daily bread, of all commodities of the public the primary and most
indispensable. Bread, the staff of life, earn your bread, O tell me where is
fancy bread? At Rourke&apos;s the baker&apos;s, it is said.</p>
<p> <i>En route</i>, to his taciturn, and, not to put too fine a point on it,
not yet perfectly sober companion, Mr Bloom, who at all
events<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font>,<a target="foot" id="frr0018">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
was in complete possession of his faculties, never more so, in fact disgustingly
sober, spoke a word of caution <i>re</i> the dangers of nighttown, women of ill
fame and swell mobsmen, which, barely permissible once in a while, though not as
a habitual practice, was of the nature of a regular deathtrap for young fellows
of his age particularly if they had acquired drinking habits under the influence
of liquor unless you knew a little

for every contingency as even a fellow on the broad of his back could administer
a nasty kick if you didn&apos;t look out. Highly providential was the appearance
on the scene of Corny Kelleher when Stephen
<br><font color="green">{u22, 571}</font>
<br> was blissfully unconscious that, but for that man in the gap turning up at
the eleventh hour, the finis might have been that he might have been a candidate
for the accident

which simply spelt ruin for a chap when it got bruited about. The reason he
mentioned the fact was that a lot of those policemen, whom he cordially
disliked, were admittedly unscrupulous in the service of the Crown and, as Mr
Bloom put it, recalling a case or two in the A Division in Clanbrassil
<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">street</span></span>

prepared to swear a hole through a ten gallon pot. Never on the spot when wanted
but in quiet parts of the city, Pembroke

for example, the guardians of the law were well in evidence, the obvious reason
being they were paid to protect the upper classes. Another thing he commented on
was equipping soldiers with firearms or sidearms of any description, liable to
go off at any
time<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><a target="foot" id="frr0025">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
which was tantamount to inciting them against civilians should by any chance
they fall out over anything. You frittered away your time, he very sensibly
maintained, and health and also character besides
which<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><a target="foot" id="frr0026">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
the squandermania of the thing, fast women of the <i>demimonde</i> ran away with
a lot of &pound;. s. d. into the bargain and the greatest danger of all was who
you got drunk with though, touching the much vexed question of
stimulants<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><a target="foot" id="frr0027">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
he relished a glass of choice old wine in season as both nourishing and
bloodmaking and possessing aperient virtues (notably a good burgundy which he
was a staunch believer in) still never beyond a certain point where he
invariably drew the line as it simply led to trouble all round to say nothing of
your being at the tender mercy of others

Most of all he commented adversely on the desertion of Stephen by all his
pubhunting <i>confr&egrave;res</i> but one, a most glaring piece of ratting on
the part of his brother medicos under all the circs.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And that one was Judas, said Stephen, who up to then had said nothing whatsoever of any kind.</p>
<p> Discussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back of
the Customhouse and passed under the Loop Line bridge
<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">where</span></span>
when<a target="foot" id="frr0029">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
a brazier of coke burning in front of a sentrybox, or something like one,
attracted their rather lagging footsteps. Stephen of his own accord stopped for
no special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by the light
emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker figure of the
corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox. He began to remember
that this had happened, or had been mentioned as having happened, before but it cost
<br><font color="green">{u22, 572}</font>
<br> him no small effort before he remembered that he recognised in the sentry a
<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext"><i>quondam</i></span></span>
quondam<a target="foot" id="frr0030">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
friend of his father&apos;s, Gumley. To avoid a meeting he drew nearer to the pillars of the railway bridge.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Someone saluted you, Mr Bloom said.</p>
<p> A figure of middle height on the prowl, evidently, under the arches saluted
again, calling: <i>Night!</i> Stephen, of course, started rather dizzily and
stopped to return the compliment. Mr Bloom, actuated by motives of inherent
delicacy,
<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">inasmuch</span></span>
inamsuch<a target="foot" id="frr0031">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
as he always believed in minding his own business, moved off but nevertheless
remained on the <i>qui vive</i> with just a shade of anxiety though not funkyish
in the least. Although unusual in the Dublin area, he knew that it was not by
any means unknown for desperadoes who had next to nothing to live on to be about
waylaying and generally terrorising peaceable pedestrians by placing a pistol at
their head in some secluded spot outside the city proper, famished loiterers of
the Thames embankment category they might be hanging about there or simply
marauders ready to decamp with whatever boodle they could in one fell swoop at a
moment&apos;s notice, your money or your life, leaving you there to point a moral, gagged and garrotted.</p>
<p> Stephen, that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters, though he
was not in
<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">an</span></span>
any<a target="foot" id="frr0033">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
over sober state himself, recognised Corley&apos;s breath redolent of rotten
cornjuice. Lord John Corley, some called him, and his genealogy came about in
this wise. He was the eldest son of Inspector Corley of the G Division, lately
deceased, who had married a certain Katherine Brophy, the daughter of a Louth
farmer. His grandfather, Patrick Michael Corley, of New Ross, had married the
widow of a publican there whose maiden name had been Katherine (also) Talbot.
Rumour had it,though not proved, that she descended from the house of the Lords
Talbot de Malahide, in whose mansion, really an unquestionably fine residence of
its kind and well worth seeing, her mother or aunt or some relative had enjoyed
the distinction of being in service in the washkitchen. This, therefore, was the
reason why the still comparatively young though dissolute man who now addressed
Stephen was spoken of by some with facetious proclivities as Lord John Corley.</p>
<p> Taking Stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell. Not
as much as a farthing to purchase a night&apos;s lodgings. His friends had all
deserted him. Furthermore, he had a row with
<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Lenehan</span></span>
Leneban<a target="foot" id="frr0034">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
and called him to Stephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of other
uncalledfor expressions. He was out of a job and implored of Stephen to tell him
where on God&apos;s earth he could get something, anything at
all<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><a target="foot" id="frr0035">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
to do. No, it was the daughter of the
<br><font color="green">{u22, 573}</font>
<br> mother in the washkitchen that was fostersister to the heir of the house or
else they were connected through the mother in some way, both occurrences
happening at the same time if the whole thing wasn&apos;t a complete fabrication
from start to finish. Anyhow, he was all in.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I wouldn&apos;t ask you, only, pursued he, on my solemn
oath and God knows I&apos;m on the rocks.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There&apos;ll be a job
<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">tomorrow</span></span>
to
morrow<a target="foot" id="frr0036">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
or the next day, Stephen told him, in a boys&apos; school at Dalkey for a
gentleman usher. Mr Garrett Deasy. Try it. You may mention my name.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ah, God, Corley replied, sure I couldn&apos;t teach in a
school, man. I was never one of your bright ones, he added with a half
laugh<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span>,<a target="foot" id="frr0037">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
Got stuck twice in the junior at the Christian Brothers.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I have no place to sleep myself, Stephen informed him.</p>
<p> Corley, at the first go-off, was inclined to suspect it was something to do
with Stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody tart off the
street. There was a dosshouse in Marlborough
<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">street</span></span>
Street<a target="foot" id="frr0038">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>,
Mrs Maloney&apos;s, but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but
M&apos;Conachie told him you got a decent enough do in the Brazen Head over in
Winetavern

Street<a target="foot" id="frr0039">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
(which was distantly suggestive to the person addressed of friar Bacon) for a
bob. He was starving too though he hadn&apos;t said a word about it.</p>
<p> Though this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it still
Stephen&apos;s feelings got the better of him in a sense though he knew that
Corley&apos;s brandnew rigmarole, on a par with the others, was hardly deserving
of much credence. However, <i>haud ignarus malorum miseris succurrere disco</i>,
etcetera, as the Latin poet remarks, especially as luck would have it he got
paid his screw after every middle of the month on the sixteenth which was the
date of the month as a matter of fact though a good bit of the wherewithal was
demolished. But the cream of the joke was nothing would get it out of
Corley&apos;s head that he was living in affluence and hadn&apos;t a thing to do
but hand out the needful &mdash; whereas. He put his hand in a pocket anyhow,
not with the idea of finding any food there, but thinking he might lend him
anything up to a bob or so in lieu so that he might endeavour at all events and
get sufficient to eat. But the result was in the negative for, to his chagrin,
he found his cash missing. A few broken biscuits were all the result of his
<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">investigation</span></span>
invetiongstia<a target="foot" id="frr0040">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>.
He tried his hardest to recollect for the moment whether he had lost, as well he
might have, or left, because in that contingency it was not a pleasant lookout,
very much the reverse, in fact. He was altogether too fagged out to institute a thorough search though
<br><font color="green">{u22, 574}</font>
<br> he tried to
recollect<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.
About</span></span>
about<a target="foot" id="frr0041">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
biscuits he dimly remembered. Who now exactly gave them, or where was, or did he
buy? However, in another pocket he came across what he surmised in the dark were
pennies, erroneously, however, as it turned out.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Those are halfcrowns, man, Corley corrected him.</p>
<p> And so in point of fact they turned out to be. Stephen lent him one of them.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Thanks, Corley answered. You&apos;re a gentleman.
I&apos;ll pay you back some time. Who&apos;s that with you? I saw him a few
times in the Bleeding Horse in Camden street with Boylan the billsticker. You
might put in a good word for us to get me taken on there. I&apos;d carry a
sandwichboard only the girl in the office told me they&apos;re full up for the
next three weeks, man. God, you&apos;ve to book ahead, man, you&apos;d think it
was for the Carl Rosa. I don&apos;t give a shite anyway so long as I get a
job<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><a target="foot" id="frr0042">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
even as a crossing sweeper.</p>
<p> Subsequently, being not quite so down in the mouth after the two-and-six he
got, he informed Stephen about a fellow by the name of Bags Comisky that he said
Stephen knew well out of Fullam&apos;s, the shipchandler&apos;s, bookkeeper
there, that used to be often round in Nagle&apos;s back with O&apos;Mara and a
little chap with a stutter the name of Tighe. Anyhow, he was lagged the night
before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and disorderly and refusing to go with the constable.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the
cobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation
watchman&apos;s sentrybox, who, evidently a glutton for work, it struck him, was
having a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own private
account while Dublin slept. He threw an odd eye at the same time now and then at
Stephen&apos;s anything but immaculately attired interlocutor as if he had seen
that nobleman somewhere or other though where he was not in a position to
truthfully state nor had he the remotest idea when. Being a levelheaded
individual who could give points to not a few in point of shrewd observation, he
also remarked on his very dilapidated hat and slouchy wearing apparel generally,
testifying to a chronic impecuniosity. Probably he was one of his hangerson but
for the matter of that it was merely a question of one preying on his nextdoor
neighbour all round, in every deep, so to put it, a deeper depth and for the
matter of that if the man in the street chanced to be in the dock himself penal
servitude, with or without the option of a fine, would be a very <i>rara
avis</i> altogether. In any case he had a consummate amount of cool assurance
<br><font color="green">{u22, 575}</font>
<br> intercepting people at that hour of the night or morning. Pretty thick that was certainly.</p>
<p> The pair parted company and Stephen rejoined Mr Bloom,
who<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><a target="foot" id="frr0044">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
with his practised eye, was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the
blandiloquence of the other parasite. Alluding to the encounter he said, laughingly, Stephen, that is:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He&apos;s down on his luck. He asked me to ask you to ask
somebody named Boylan, a billsticker, to give him a job as a sandwichman.</p>
<p> At this intelligence, in which he seemingly evinced little interest, Mr
Bloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the direction
of a
<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">bucketdredger</span></span>
bucket
dredger<a target="foot" id="frr0045">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>,
rejoicing in the farfamed name of Eblana, moored alongside Customhouse Quay and
quite possibly out of repair, whereupon he observed evasively:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Everybody gets their own ration of luck, they say. Now you
mention it his face was familiar to me. But leaving that for the moment, how
much did you part with, he queried, if I am not too inquisitive?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Half-a-crown, Stephen responded. I daresay he needs it to sleep somewhere.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
Needs<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">!</span></span>,<a target="foot" id="frr0046">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
Mr Bloom ejaculated, professing not the least surprise at the intelligence, I
can quite credit the assertion and I guarantee he invariably does. Everyone
according to his needs and everyone according to his deeds.
But<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><a target="foot" id="frr0047">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
talking about things in general, where, added he with a smile, will you sleep
yourself? Walking to Sandycove is out of the question and, even supposing you
did, you won&apos;t get in after what occurred at Westland Row station. Simply
fag out there for nothing. I don&apos;t mean to presume to dictate to you in the
slightest degree but why did you leave your father&apos;s house?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; To seek misfortune, was Stephen&apos;s answer.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I met your respected father on a recent occasion, Mr Bloom
diplomatically returned,
<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">today</span></span>
Today<a target="foot" id="frr0048">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>,
in fact, or, to be strictly accurate, on yesterday. Where does he live at
present? I gathered in the course of conversation that he had moved.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I believe he is in Dublin somewhere, Stephen answered unconcernedly. Why?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A gifted man, Mr Bloom said of Mr Dedalus senior, in more
respects than one and a born <i>raconteur</i> if ever there was one. He takes
great pride, quite legitimately, out of you. You could go back, perhaps, he
hazarded, still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at Westland Row terminus when it
<br><font color="green">{u22, 576}</font>
<br> was perfectly evident that the other two, Mulligan, that is, and that
English tourist friend of his, who eventually euchred their third companion,
were patently trying, as if the whole bally

belonged</span></span>
stationbelonged<a target="foot" id="frr0049">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
to them, to give Stephen the slip in the confusion.</p>
<p> There was no response forthcoming to the suggestion, however, such as it
was, Stephen&apos;s mind&apos;s eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his
family hearth the last time he saw it, with his sister Dilly sitting by the
ingle, her hair hanging down, waiting for some weak Trinidad shell cocoa that
was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he could drink it with
the oatmeal water for milk after the Friday herrings they had eaten at two a
penny, with an egg apiece for Maggy, Boody and Katey, the cat meanwhile under
the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells and charred fish heads and bones on a
square of brown
paper<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><a target="foot" id="frr0051">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
in accordance with the third precept of the church to fast and abstain on the
days commanded, it being quarter tense or, if not, ember days or something like that.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; No, Mr Bloom repeated again, I wouldn&apos;t personally
repose much trust in that boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous
element, Dr Mulligan, as a guide, philosopher, and friend, if I were in your
shoes. He knows which side his bread is buttered on
<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">though</span></span>
through<a target="foot" id="frr0052">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
in all probability he never realised what it is to be without regular meals. Of
course you didn&apos;t notice as much as I did but it wouldn&apos;t occasion me
the least surprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic was put in your drink for some ulterior object.</p>
<p> He understood, however, from all he heard, that Dr Mulligan was a versatile
allround man, by no means confined to medicine only, who was rapidly coming to
the fore in his line and, if the report was verified, bade fair to enjoy a
flourishing practice in the not too distant future as a tony medical
practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services in addition to which
professional status his rescue of that man from certain drowning by artificial
respiration and what they call first aid at Skerries, or Malahide was
it?<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><a target="foot" id="frr0053">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
was, he was bound to admit, an exceedingly plucky deed which he could not too
highly praise, so that frankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly
reason could be at the back of it except he put it down to sheer cussedness or jealousy, pure and simple.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they
call picking your brains, he ventured to throw out.</p>
<p> The guarded glance of half solicitude, half curiosity, augmented by
friendliness<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><a target="foot" id="frr0054">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
which he gave at Stephen&apos;s at present morose expression of features
<br><font color="green">{u22, 577}</font>
<br> did not throw a flood of light, none at all in fact, on the problem as to
whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled, to judge by two or three
lowspirited remarks he let drop, or, the other way about, saw through the
affair, and, for some reason or other best known to himself, allowed matters to
more or less&nbsp;&hellip; Grinding poverty did have that effect and he more
than conjectured that, high educational abilities though he possessed, he
experienced no little difficulty in making both ends meet.</p>
<p> Adjacent to the men&apos;s public urinal
<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">they</span></span>
he<a target="foot" id="frr0055">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
perceived an icecream car round which a group of presumably Italians in heated
altercation were getting rid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language
in a particularly animated way, there being some little differences between the parties.</p>

<p> Mr Bloom and Stephen entered the cabman&apos;s shelter, an unpretentious
wooden structure, where, prior to then, he had rarely, if ever, been before; the
former having previously whispered to the latter a few hints anent the keeper of
it, said to be the once famous Skin-the-Goat, Fitzharris, the invincible, though
he wouldn&apos;t vouch for the actual
facts<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font>,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in. A few moments later
saw our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet
corner<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font>,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
only to be greeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous collection of
waifs and strays and other nondescript specimens of the genus <i>homo</i>,
already there engaged in eating and drinking, diversified by conversation, for
whom they seemingly formed an object of marked curiosity.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Now touching a cup of coffee, Mr Bloom ventured to
plausibly suggest to break the ice, it occurs to me you ought to sample
something in the shape of solid food, say a roll of some description.</p>
<p> Accordingly his first act was with characteristic <i>sangfroid</i> to order
these commodities quietly. The <i>hoi polloi</i> of jarvies or stevedores, or
whatever they were, after a cursory
<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">examination</span></span>
examinatiou<a target="foot" id="frr0062">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>,
turned their eyes, apparently dissatisfied, away, though one redbearded bibulous
individual, portion of whose hair was greyish, a sailor, probably, still stared
for some appreciable time before transferring his rapt attention to the floor.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom, availing himself of the right of free speech, he having just a
bowing acquaintance with the language in
dispute<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><a target="foot" id="frr0063">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
though, to be sure, rather in a quandary over <i>voglio</i>, remarked to his
<i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i> in an audible tone of voice,
<br><font color="green">{u22, 578}</font>
<br> <i>apropos</i> of the battle royal in the street which was still raging fast and furious:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A beautiful language. I mean for singing purposes. Why do
you not write your poetry in that language? <i>Bella Poetria!</i>

<p> Stephen, who was trying his dead best to yawn, if he could, suffering from
<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font>dead<a target="foot" id="frr0068">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
lassitude generally, replied:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; To fill the ear of a cow elephant. They were haggling over money.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Is that so? Mr Bloom asked. Of course, he subjoined
pensively, at the inward reflection of there being more languages to start with
than were absolutely necessary, it may be only the southern glamour that surrounds it.</p>
<p> The keeper of the shelter in the middle of this
<i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> put a boiling swimming cup of a choice
concoction labelled coffee on the table and a rather antediluvian specimen of a
bun, or so it seemed, after which he beat a retreat to his
counter<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span>.<a target="foot" id="frr0069">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
Mr Bloom determining to have a good square look at him later on so as not to
appear to&nbsp;&hellip; for which reason he encouraged Stephen to proceed with
his eyes while he did the honours by surreptitiously pushing the cup of what was
temporarily supposed to be called coffee gradually nearer him.</p>

Shakespeares were as common as Murphies. What&apos;s in a name?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, to be sure, Mr Bloom unaffectedly concurred. Of
course. Our name was changed too, he added, pushing the socalled roll across.</p>
<p> The redbearded sailor, who had his weather eye on the newcomers, boarded
Stephen, whom he had singled out for attention in particular, squarely by asking:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And what might your name be?</p>
<p> Just in the nick of time Mr Bloom touched his companion&apos;s boot but
Stephen, apparently disregarding the warm
pressure<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font>,<a target="foot" id="frr0074">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
from an unexpected quarter, answered:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Dedalus.</p>
<p> The sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes, rather
bunged up from excessive use of boose, preferably good old Hollands and water.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You know Simon Dedalus? he asked at length.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I&apos;ve heard of him, Stephen said.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 579}</font> </p>
<p> Mr Bloom was all at sea for a moment, seeing the others evidently eavesdropping too.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He&apos;s Irish, the seaman bold affirmed, staring still
in much the same way and nodding. All Irish.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; All too Irish, Stephen rejoined.</p>
<p> As for Mr Bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole business and
he was just asking himself what possible connection when the sailor, of his own
accord, turned to the other occupants of the shelter with the remark:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards
over his shoulder. The
<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">lefthand</span></span>
left
hand<a target="foot" id="frr0075">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
dead shot.</p>
<p> Though he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his gestures
being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Bottles</span></span>
Bottle<a target="foot" id="frr0076">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
out there, say. Fifty yards measured. Eggs on the bottles. Cocks his gun over his shoulder. Aims.</p>
<p> He turned his body half round, shut up his right eye completely, then he
screwed his features up
<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">someway</span></span>
some
way<a target="foot" id="frr0077">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
sideways and glared out into the night with an unprepossessing cast of countenance.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
Pom<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">!</span></span>,<a target="foot" id="frr0078">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
he then shouted once.</p>
<p> The entire audience waited, anticipating an additional detonation, there being still a further egg.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
Pom<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">!</span></span>,<a target="foot" id="frr0079">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>

Egg two evidently demolished, he nodded and winked, adding bloodthirstily:</p>
<p class="inset"><font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font>&rArr;<a target="foot" id="frr0081">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>&mdash;
<i>Buffalo Bill shoots to kill,</i>
<br> <i>Never missed nor he never will.</i></p>
<p> A silence ensued till Mr Bloom for agreeableness&apos; sake just felt like
asking him whether it was for a marksmanship competition like the Bisley.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Beg pardon, the sailor said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Long ago? Mr Bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Why, the sailor replied, relaxing to a certain extent
under the magic influence of diamond cut diamond, it might be a matter of ten
years. He toured the wide world with Hengler&apos;s Royal Circus. I seen him do that in Stockholm.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Curious coincidence, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen unobtrusively.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Murphy&apos;s my name, the sailor continued, W.B. Murphy, of Carrigaloe. Know where that is?
<br><font color="green">{u22, 580}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Queenstown Harbour, Stephen replied.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That&apos;s right, the sailor said. Fort Camden and Fort
Carlisle. That&apos;s where I hails from. My little woman&apos;s down there.
She&apos;s waiting for me, I know. <i>For England, home and beauty</i>.
She&apos;s my own true wife I haven&apos;t seen for seven years now, sailing about.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene &mdash; the
homecoming to the mariner&apos;s roadside shieling after having diddled Davy
Jones &mdash; a rainy night with a blind moon. Across the world for a wife.
Quite a number of stories there were on that particular Alice Ben Bolt topic,
Enoch Arden and Rip van Winkle and does anybody hereabouts remember Caoc
O&apos;Leary, a favourite and most trying declamation piece, by the way, of poor
John Casey and a bit of perfect poetry in its own small way. Never about the
runaway wife coming back, however much devoted to the absentee. The face at the
window! Judge of his astonishment when he

did breast the tape and the awful truth dawned upon him anent his better half,
wrecked in his affections. You little expected me but I&apos;ve come to stay and
make a fresh start. There she sits, a

might be, the publican of the Crown and Anchor, in shirtsleeves, eating
rumpsteak and onions. No chair for father.

<p> The sailor, who scarcely seemed to be a Dublin resident, turned to one of the jarvies with the request:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You don&apos;t happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you, do you?</p>
<p> The jarvey addressed, as it happened, had not but the keeper took a die of
plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object was passed from hand to hand.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Thank you, the sailor said.</p>
<p> He deposited the quid in his gob and, chewing, and with some slow stammers, proceeded:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; We come up this morning eleven o&apos;clock. The

a not very cleanlooking folded document.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 581}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You must have seen a fair share of the world, the keeper remarked, leaning on the counter.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Why, the sailor
answered<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font>,<a target="foot" id="frr0089">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
upon reflection upon it, I&apos;ve circumnavigated a bit since I first joined
on. I was in the Red Sea. I was in China and North America and South America. I
seen icebergs plenty, growlers. I was in Stockholm and the Black Sea, the
Dardanelles, under Captain Dalton, the best bloody man that ever scuttled a
ship. I seen Russia. <i>Gospodi</i>

<p class="di">&mdash; You seen queer sights, don&apos;t be talking, put in a jarvey.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Why, the sailor said, shifting his partially chewed plug,
I seen queer things too, ups and downs. I seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an anchor same as I chew that quid.</p>
<p> He took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and, lodging it between his teeth,
bit
ferociously<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">:</span></span>.<a target="foot" id="frr0091">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Khaan! Like that. And I seen maneaters in Peru that eats
corpses and the livers of horses. Look here. Here they are. A friend of mine sent me.</p>
<p> He fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket, which seemed to be
in its way a species of repository, and pushed it along the table. The printed
matter on it stated: <i>Choza de Indios. Beni, Bolivia.</i></p>
<p> All focussed their attention on the scene exhibited, at a group of savage
women in striped loincloths, squatted, blinking, suckling, frowning, sleeping,
amid a swarm of infants (there must have been quite a score of them) outside some primitive shanties of osier.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Chews coca all day long, the communicative tarpaulin
added. Stomachs like breadgraters. Cuts off their diddies when they can&apos;t
bear no more children. See them there stark ballocknaked eating a dead horse&apos;s liver raw.</p>
<p> His postcard proved a centre of attraction for Messrs the greenhorns for several minutes, if not more.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Know how to keep them off? he inquired genially.</p>

to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark. It ran as follows:

having detected a discrepancy between his name (assuming he was the person he
represented himself to be and not sailing under false colours after having boxed
the compass on the strict q.t. somewhere), and the fictitious addressee of the
missive which made him nourish some suspicions of our friend&apos;s <i>bona
fides</i> nevertheless it reminded him in a way of a longcherished plan he meant
to one day realise some Wednesday or Saturday of travelling to London <i>via</i>
long sea not to say that he had ever travelled extensively to any great extent
but he was at heart a born adventurer though by a trick of fate he had
consistently remained a landlubber except you call going to Holyhead which was
his longest. Martin Cunningham frequently said he would work a pass through Egan
but some deuced hitch or other eternally cropped up with the net result that the
scheme fell through. But even suppose it did come to planking down the needful
and breaking Boyd&apos;s heart it was not so dear, purse permitting, a few
guineas at the

considering the fare to Mullingar where he figured on going was five and six
there and back. The trip would benefit health on account of the bracing ozone
and be in every way thoroughly pleasurable, especially for a chap whose liver
was out of order, seeing the different places along the route, Plymouth,
Falmouth, Southampton and so on, culminating in an instructive tour of the
sights of the great metropolis, the spectacle of our modern Babylon where
doubtless he would see the greatest
improvement<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><a target="foot" id="frr0100">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
tower, abbey, wealth of Park Lane to renew acquaintance with. Another thing just
struck him as a by no means bad notion was he might have a gaze around on the
spot to see about trying to make arrangements about a concert tour of summer
music embracing the most prominent pleasure resorts, Margate with mixed bathing
and firstrate hydros and spas, Eastbourne, Scarborough, Margate and so on,
beautiful Bournemouth, the Channel islands and similar bijou spots, which might
prove highly remunerative. Not, of course, with a hole and corner scratch
company or local ladies on the job, witness Mrs C.P. M&apos;Coy type &mdash;
lend me your valise and I&apos;ll post you the ticket. No, something top notch,
an all star Irish caste, the Tweedy-Flower grand opera company with his own
legal consort as leading lady as a sort of counterblast to the Elster Grimes and
Moody-Manners, perfectly simple matter and he was quite sanguine of success,
providing puffs in the local papers could be managed by some fellow with a bit
of bounce who could pull the indispensable wires and thus combine business with pleasure. But who? That was the rub.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 583}</font> </p>
<p> Also, without being actually positive, it struck him a great field was to be
opened up in the line of opening up new routes to keep pace with the times
<i>apropos</i> of the Fishguard-Rosslare route which, it was mooted, was once
more on the <i>tapis</i> in the circumlocution departments with the usual
quantity of red tape and dillydallying of effete fogeydom and dunderheads
generally. A great opportunity there certainly was for push and enterprise to
meet the travelling needs of the public at large, the average man,

<p> It was a subject of regret and absurd as well on the face of it and no small
blame to our vaunted society that the man in the street, when the system really
needed toning up, for a matter of a couple of paltry pounds, was debarred from
seeing more of the world they lived in instead of being always cooped up since
my old stick-in-the-mud took me for a wife. After all, hang it, they had their
eleven and more humdrum months of it and merited a radical change of
<i>venue</i> after the grind of city life in the summertime, for choice, when
Dame Nature is at her spectacular best, constituting nothing short of a new
lease of life. There were equally excellent opportunities for vacationists in
the home island, delightful sylvan spots for rejuvenation, offering a plethora
of attractions as well as a bracing tonic for the system in and around Dublin
and its picturesque
environs<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font>,<a target="foot" id="frr0103">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>

the madding crowd, in Wicklow, rightly termed the garden of Ireland, an ideal
neighbourhood for elderly wheelmen, so long as it didn&apos;t come down, and in
the wilds of Donegal where, if report spoke true, the <i>coup
d&apos;&oelig;il</i> was exceedingly grand, though the lastnamed locality was
not easily getatable so that the influx of visitors was not as yet all that it
might be considering the signal benefits to be derived from it, while Howth with
its historic associations and otherwise, Silken Thomas, Grace O&apos;Malley,
George IV, rhododendrons several hundred feet above sealevel was a favourite
haunt with all sorts and conditions of men, especially in the spring when young
men&apos;s fancy, though it had its own toll of deaths by falling off the cliffs
by design or accidentally, usually, by the way, on their left leg, it being only
about three quarters of an hour&apos;s run from the pillar. Because of course
uptodate tourist travelling was as yet merely in its infancy, so to speak, and
the accommodation left much to be desired. Interesting to fathom, it seemed to
him, from a motive of curiosity pure and simple, was whether it was the traffic
that created the route or viceversa or the two sides in fact. He turned back the
other side of the

questions even should they by any chance want to.

a good bit of steel, repeated he, examining his formidable <i>stiletto</i>.</p>
<p> After which harrowing <i>d&eacute;nouement</i> sufficient to appal the
stoutest he snapped the blade to and stowed the weapon in question away as
before in his chamber of horrors, otherwise pocket.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; They&apos;re great for the cold steel, somebody who was
evidently quite in the dark said for the benefit of them all. That was why they
thought the park murders of the invincibles was done by foreigners on account of them using knives.</p>
<p> At this remark, passed obviously in the spirit of <i>where ignorance is
bliss</i>, Mr Bloom and Stephen, each in his own particular way, both
instinctively exchanged meaning glances, in a religious silence of the strictly
<i>entre nous</i> variety however, towards where Skin-the-Goat, <i>alias</i> the
keeper, was drawing spurts of liquid from his boiler affair. His inscrutable
face, which was really a work of art, a perfect study in itself, beggaring
description, conveyed the impression that he didn&apos;t understand one jot of what was going on. Funny, very.</p>
<p> There ensued a somewhat lengthy pause. One man was reading by fits and
starts a stained by coffee evening journal; another, the card with the natives
<i>choza de</i>; another, the seaman&apos;s discharge. Mr Bloom, so far as he
was personally concerned, was just pondering in pensive mood. He vividly
recollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well as yesterday, some
score of years previously, in the days of the land troubles when it took the civilised world
<br><font color="green">{u22, 585}</font>
<br> by storm, figuratively speaking, early in the eighties, eightyone to be
correct, when he was just turned fifteen.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ay, boss, the sailor broke in. Give us back them papers.</p>
<p> The request being complied with, he clawed them up with a scrape.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Have you seen the Rock of Gibraltar? Mr Bloom inquired.</p>
<p> The sailor grimaced, chewing, in a way that might be read as yes, ay, or no.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ah, you&apos;ve touched there too, Mr Bloom said, Europa
point, thinking he had, in the hope that the rover might possibly by some
reminiscences but he failed to do so, simply letting spurt a jet of spew into
the sawdust, and shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What year would that be about? Mr Bloom interpolated. Can you recall the boats?</p>
<p> Our <i>soi-disant</i> sailor munched heavily awhile, hungrily, before answering.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I&apos;m tired of all them rocks in the sea, he said, and
boats and ships. Salt junk all the time.</p>
<p> Tired, seemingly, he ceased. His questioner, perceiving that he was not
likely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer, fell to
woolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the globe. Suffice
it to say that, as a casual glance at the map revealed, it covered fully three
fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly what it
meant<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font>,<a target="foot" id="frr0115">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
to rule the waves. On more than one occasion &mdash; a dozen at the lowest
&mdash; near the North Bull at Dollymount he had remarked a superannuated old
salt, evidently derelict, seated habitually near the not particularly redolent
sea on the wall, staring quite
<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">obliviously</span></span>

at it and it at him, dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone
somewhere sings. And it left him wondering why. Possibly he had tried to find
out the secret for himself, floundering up and down the antipodes and all that
sort of thing and over and under &mdash; well, not exactly under &mdash;
tempting the fates. And the odds were twenty to nil there was really no secret
about it at all. Nevertheless, without going into the <i>minutiae</i> of the
business, the eloquent fact remained that the sea was there in all its glory and
in the natural course of things somebody or other had to sail on it and fly in
the face of providence though it merely went to show how people usually
contrived to load that

which were run on identically the same lines so that for that very reason, if no
other, lifeboat Sunday was a very laudable institution to which the public at
large, no matter where living, inland or seaside, as the case might be, having
it brought home to them like that, should extend its
<br><font color="green">{u22, 586}</font>
<br> gratitude also to the harbourmasters and coastguard service who had to man
the rigging and push off and out amid the elements, whatever the season, when
duty called <i>Ireland expects that every man</i> and so

and sometimes had a terrible time of it in the wintertime not forgetting the
Irish lights, Kish and others, liable to capsize at any moment rounding which he
once with his daughter had experienced some remarkably choppy, not to say stormy, weather.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There was a fellow sailed with me in the <i>Rover</i>, the

ashore and took up a soft job as gentleman&apos;s valet at six quid a month.
Them are his trousers I&apos;ve on me and he gave me an oilskin and that
jackknife. I&apos;m game for that job, shaving and brushup. I hate roaming

from the side, bore a distant resemblance to Henry Campbell, the townclerk, away
from the carking cares of office, unwashed, of course, and in a seedy getup and

actually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the unreserved
admiration of everybody, including

<p> The face of a streetwalker, glazed and haggard under a black straw hat,
peered askew round the door of the shelter, palpably reconnoitring on her own
with the object of bringing more grist to her mill. Mr Bloom, scarcely knowing
which way to look, turned away on the moment, flusterfied but outwardly calm,
and<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><a target="foot" id="frr0137">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
picking up from the table the pink sheet of the Abbey street organ which the
jarvey, if such he was, had laid aside, he picked it up and looked at the pink
of the paper though why pink? His reason for so doing was he recognised on the
moment round the door the same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that
afternoon on Ormond Quay, the partially idiotic female, namely, of the lane, who
knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you (Mrs B.), and begged the
chance of his washing. Also why washing, which seemed rather vague than not?</p>
<p> Your washing. Still, candour compelled him to admit that he had washed his
wife&apos;s undergarments when soiled in Holles

and women would and did too a man&apos;s similar garments initialled with Bewley
and Draper&apos;s marking ink (hers were, that is) if they really loved him,
that is to say. Love me, love my dirty shirt. Still, just then, being on
tenterhooks, he desired the female&apos;s room more than her company so it came
as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a rude sign to take herself off. Round the side of the
<br><font color="green">{u22, 588}</font>
<br> <i>Evening Telegraph</i> he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face
round the side of the door with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she
was not exactly all there, viewing with evident amusement the group of gazers
round Skipper Murphy&apos;s nautical chest and then there was no more of her.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The gunboat, the keeper said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It beats me, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen, medically I am
speaking, how a wretched creature like that from the Lock Hospital, reeking with
disease, can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober senses,
if he values his health in the least. Unfortunate creature! Of course, I suppose
some man is ultimately responsible for her condition. Still no matter what the cause is from&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> Stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders, merely remarking:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; In this country people sell much more than she ever had
and do a roaring trade. Fear not them that sell the body but have not power to
buy the soul. She is a bad merchant. She buys dear and sells cheap.</p>
<p> The elder man, though not by any manner of means an old maid or a prude,
said that it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be put a stop
to <i>instanter</i> to say that women of that stamp (quite apart from any
oldmaidish squeamishness on the subject), a necessary evil, were not licensed
and medically inspected by the proper authorities, a thing he could truthfully
state he, as a <i>paterfamilias</i>, was a stalwart advocate of from the very
first start. Whoever embarked on a policy of the sort, he said, and ventilated
the matter thoroughly would confer a lasting boon on everybody concerned.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You, as a good catholic, he observed, talking of body and
soul, believe in the soul. Or do you mean the intelligence, the brainpower as
such, as distinct from any outside object, the table, let us say, that cup? I
believe in that myself because it has been explained by competent men as the
convolutions of the grey matter. Otherwise we would never have such inventions as X rays, for instance. Do you?</p>
<p> Thus cornered, Stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try and
concentrate and remember before he could
say<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">:</span></span>.<a target="foot" id="frr0140">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; They tell me on the best authority it is a simple
substance and therefore incorruptible. It would be immortal, I understand, but
for the possibility of its annihilation by its First Cause, Who, from all I can
hear, is quite capable of adding that to the number of His other practical
jokes, <i>corruptio per se</i> and <i>corruptio per accidens</i> both being excluded by court etiquette.

<p> Mr Bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the
mystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he felt
bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple, promptly rejoining:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Simple? I shouldn&apos;t think that is the proper word. Of
course, I grant you, to concede a point, you do knock across a simple soul once
in a blue moon. But what I am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for
instance to invent those rays

Galileo was the man I mean. The same applies to the laws, for example, of a
farreaching natural phenomenon such as electricity but it&apos;s a horse of
quite another colour to say you believe in the existence of a supernatural God.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O that, Stephen expostulated, has been proved conclusively
by several of the

passages in Holy Writ, apart from circumstantial evidence.</p>
<p> On this knotty point, however, the views of the pair, poles apart as they
were, both in schooling and everything else, with the marked difference in their respective ages, clashed.</p>

sticking to his original point. I&apos;m not so sure about that. That&apos;s a
matter of every man&apos;s opinion and, without dragging in the sectarian side
of the business, I beg to differ with you <i>in toto</i> there. My belief is, to
tell you the candid truth, that those bits were genuine forgeries all of them
put in by monks most probably or it&apos;s the big question of our national poet
over again, who precisely wrote them, like <i>Hamlet</i> and Bacon,

organs for the moment refusing to dictate further.</p>
<p> Faultfinding being a proverbially bad hat, Mr Bloom thought well to stir, or
try to, the clotted sugar from the bottom and reflected with something
approaching acrimony on the Coffee Palace and its temperance (and lucrative)
work. To be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond yea or nay did a world of
good<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,

Shelters<a target="foot" id="frr0147">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>

and useful lectures (admittance free) by qualified men for the lower orders. On
the other hand, he had a distinct and painful recollection they paid his wife,
Madam Marion
Tweedy<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><a target="foot" id="frr0149">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
who had been prominently associated with it at one time,
<br><font color="green">{u22, 590}</font>
<br> a very modest remuneration indeed for her pianoplaying. The idea, he was
strongly inclined to believe, was to do good and net a profit, there being no
competition to speak of. Sulphate of copper
poison<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font>,<a target="foot" id="frr0150">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
SO<sub><small>4</small></sub> or something in some dried peas he remembered
reading of in a cheap eatinghouse somewhere but he couldn&apos;t remember when
it was or where. Anyhow, inspection, medical inspection, of all eatables, seemed
to him more than ever necessary which possibly accounted for the vogue of Dr
Tibble&apos;s Vi-Cocoa on account of the medical analysis involved.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Have a shot at it now, he ventured to say of the coffee after being stirred.</p>
<p> Thus prevailed on to at any rate taste it, Stephen lifted the heavy mug from
the brown puddle &mdash; it clopped out of it when taken up &mdash; by the
handle and took a sip of the offending beverage.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Still, it&apos;s solid food, his good genius urged,
I&apos;m a stickler for solid food, his one and only reason being not
gormandising in the least but regular meals as the <i>sine qua non</i> for any
kind of proper work, mental or manual. You ought to eat more solid food. You would feel a different man.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Liquids I can eat, Stephen said. But oblige me by taking
away that knife. I can&apos;t look at the point of it. It reminds me of Roman history.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated article, a
blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly Roman or antique
about it to the lay eye, observing that the point was the least conspicuous point about it.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Our mutual friend&apos;s stories are like himself, Mr
Bloom, <i>apropos</i> of knives, remarked to his <i>confidante sotto voce</i>.
Do you think they are genuine? He could spin those yarns for hours on end all
night long and lie like old boots. Look at him.</p>
<p> Yet still, though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air, life was full
of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it was quite
within the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire fabrication though at
first blush there was not much inherent probability in all the spoof he got off
his chest being strictly accurate gospel.</p>
<p> He had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him and
Sherlockholmesing him
up<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font>,<a target="foot" id="frr0152">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
ever since he clapped eyes on him. Though a wellpreserved man of no little
stamina, if a trifle prone to baldness, there was something spurious in the cut
of his jib that suggested a jail delivery and it required no violent stretch of
imagination to associate such a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill fraternity.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 591}</font>
<br> He might even have done for his man, supposing it was his own case he told,
as people often did about others, namely, that he killed him himself and had
served his four or five goodlooking years in durance vile to say nothing of the
Antonio personage (no relation to the dramatic personage of identical name who
sprang from the pen of our national poet) who expiated his crimes in the
melodramatic manner above described. On the other hand he might be only
bluffing, a pardonable weakness, because meeting unmistakable mugs, Dublin
residents, like those jarvies waiting news from abroad, would tempt any ancient
mariner who sailed the ocean seas to draw the long bow about the schooner
<i>Hesperus</i> and etcetera. And when all was said and done, the lies a fellow
told about himself couldn&apos;t probably hold a proverbial candle to the
wholesale whoppers other fellows coined about him.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Mind you, I&apos;m not saying that it&apos;s all a pure
invention, he resumed. Analogous scenes are occasionally, if not often, met
with. Giants, though, that is rather a far
cry<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,

see once in a way. Marcella, the midget queen. In those waxworks in Henry street
I myself saw some Aztecs, as they are called, sitting bowlegged. They
couldn&apos;t straighten their legs if you paid them because the muscles here,
you see, he proceeded, indicating on his companion the brief outline, the
sinews, or whatever you like to call them, behind the right knee, were utterly
powerless from sitting that way so long cramped up, being adored as gods.
There&apos;s an example again of simple souls.</p>
<p> However, reverting to friend Sinbad and his horrifying adventures (who
reminded him a bit of Ludwig, <i>alias</i> Ledwidge, when he occupied the boards
of the Gaiety when Michael Gunn was identified with the management in the
<i>Flying Dutchman</i>, a stupendous success, and his host of admirers came in
large numbers, everyone simply flocking to hear him though ships of any sort,
phantom or the reverse, on the stage usually fell a bit flat as also did
trains), there was nothing intrinsically incompatible about it, he conceded. On
the contrary, that stab in the back touch was quite in keeping with those
Italianos, though candidly he was none the less free to admit those ice creamers
and friers in the fish way, not to mention the chip potato variety and so forth,
over in little Italy there, near the Coombe, were sober thrifty hardworking
fellows except perhaps a bit too given to pothunting the harmless necessary
animal of the feline persuasion of others at night so as to have a good old

with garlic <i>de rigueur</i> off him or her next day on the quiet and, he added, on the cheap.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Spaniards, for instance, he continued, passionate temperaments like

with those poignards they carry in the abdomen. It comes from the great heat,
climate generally. My wife is, so to speak, Spanish, half, that is. Point of
fact she could actually claim Spanish nationality if she wanted, having been
born in (technically) Spain, i.e. Gibraltar. She has the Spanish type. Quite
dark, regular brunette, black. I, for one, certainly believe climate accounts
for character. That&apos;s why I asked you if you wrote your poetry in Italian.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The temperaments at the door, Stephen interposed with,
were very passionate about ten shillings. <i>Roberto ruba roba sua</i>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Quite so, Mr Bloom dittoed.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Then, Stephen said, staring and rambling on to himself or
some unknown listener somewhere, we have the impetuosity of Dante and the
isosceles triangle, Miss
Portinari<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font>,<a target="foot" id="frr0156">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
he fell in love with and Leonardo and san Tommaso Mastino.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It&apos;s in the blood, Mr Bloom acceded at once. All are
washed in the blood of the sun. Coincidence, I just happened to be in the
Kildare Street Museum today, shortly prior to our meeting, if I can so call it,
and I was just looking at those antique statues there. The splendid proportions
of hips, bosom. You simply don&apos;t knock against those kind of women here. An
exception here and there. Handsome, yes, pretty in a way you find, but what
I&apos;m talking about is the female form. Besides, they have so little taste in
dress, most of them, which greatly enhances a woman&apos;s natural beauty, no
matter what you say. Rumpled stockings &mdash; it may be, possibly is, a foible
of mine, but still it&apos;s a thing I simply hate to see.</p>
<p> Interest, however, was starting to flag somewhat all round and the others
got on to talking about accidents at sea, ships lost in a fog, collisions with
icebergs, all that sort of thing. Shipahoy, of course, had his own say to say.
He had doubled the Cape a few odd times and weathered a monsoon, a kind of wind,
in the China seas and through all those perils of the deep there was one thing,
he declared, stood to him, or words to that effect, a pious medal he had that saved him.</p>
<p> So then after that they drifted on to the wreck

Daunt&apos;s rock, wreck of that illfated Norwegian barque &mdash; nobody could
think of her name for the moment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of
Henry Campbell remembered it, <i>Palme</i>, on Booterstown Strand, that was the
talk of the town that year (Albert William Quill wrote a fine piece of original verse of distinctive merit
<br><font color="green">{u22, 593}</font>

breakers running over her and crowds and crowds on the shore in commotion
petrified with horror. Then someone said something about the case of the s.s.
<i>Lady Cairns</i> of Swansea, run into by the <i>Mona</i>, which was on an
opposite tack, in rather muggyish weather and lost with all hands on deck. No
aid was given. Her master, the <i>Mona</i>&apos;s, said he was afraid his
collision bulkhead would give way. She had no water, it appears, in her hold.</p>
<p> At this stage an incident happened. It having become necessary for him to
unfurl a reef, the sailor vacated his seat.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Let me cross your bows, mate, he said to his neighbour,
who was just gently dropping off into a peaceful doze.</p>
<p> He made tracks heavily, slowly, with a dumpy sort of a gait to the door,
stepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter and bore due
left. While he was in the act of getting his bearings, Mr Bloom, who noticed
when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ship&apos;s rum sticking
one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his burning interior, saw
him produce a bottle and uncork it, or unscrew, and, applying its nozzle to his
lips, take a good old delectable swig out of it with a gurgling noise. The
irrepressible Bloom, who also had a shrewd suspicion that the old stager went
out on a

after the counterattraction in the shape of a female, who, however, had
disappeared to all intents and purposes, could, by straining, just perceive him,
when duly

by his rum puncheon exploit, gazing up at the piers and girders of the Loop
Line, rather out of his depth, as of course it was all radically altered since
his last visit and greatly improved. Some person or persons invisible directed
him to the male urinal erected by the cleansing committee all over the place for
the purpose but, after a brief space of time during which silence reigned
supreme, the sailor, evidently giving it a wide berth, eased himself

truly amazing piece of hard times in its most virulent form on a fellow most
respectably connected and familiarised with decent home comforts all his life
who came in for a cool &pound;100 a year at one time which of course the
doublebarrelled ass proceeded to make general ducks and drakes of. And there he
was at the end of his tether after having often painted the town tolerably pink,
without a beggarly stiver. He drank, needless to be told, and it pointed only
once more a moral when he might quite easily be in a large way of business if
&mdash; a big if, however &mdash; he had contrived to cure himself of his particular partiality.</p>
<p> All, meantime, were loudly lamenting the falling off in Irish shipping,
coastwise and foreign as well, which was all part and parcel of the same thing.
A Palgrave Murphy boat was put off the ways at Alexandra Basin, the only launch
that year. Right enough the harbours were there only no ships ever called.</p>
<p> There were wrecks and wrecks, the keeper said, who was evidently <i>au fait</i>.</p>
<p> What he wanted to ascertain was why that ship ran bang against the only rock
in Galway Bay when the Galway Harbour scheme was mooted by a Mr Worthington or
some name like that, eh? Ask her captain, he advised them, how much palmoil the
British Government gave him for that day&apos;s work. Captain John Lever of the

returning after his private potation and the rest of his exertions.</p>
<p> That worthy, picking up the scent of the fagend of the song or words,
growled in wouldbe music, but with great vim, some kind of chanty or other in
seconds or thirds. Mr Bloom&apos;s sharp ears heard him then expectorate the
plug probably (which it was), so that he must have lodged it for the time being
in his fist while he did the drinking and making water jobs and found it a bit
sour after the liquid fire in question. Anyhow in he rolled after his successful
libation-<i>cum</i>-potation, introducing an atmosphere of drink into the
<i>soir&eacute;e</i>, boisterously trolling, like a veritable son of a seacook:</p>

specimen duly arrived on the
<br><font color="green">{u22, 595}</font>
<br> scene and, regaining his seat, he sank rather than sat heavily on the form provided.</p>
<p> Skin-the-Goat, assuming he was he, evidently with an axe to grind, was
airing his grievances in a forcible-feeble philippic anent the natural resources
of Ireland, or something of that sort, which he described in his lengthy
dissertation as the richest country bar none on the face of God&apos;s earth,
far and away superior to England, with coal in large quantities, six million
pounds&apos; worth of pork exported every year, ten millions between butter and
eggs, and all the riches drained out of it by England levying taxes on the poor
people that paid through the nose always, and gobbling up the best meat in the
market, and a lot more surplus steam in the same vein. Their conversation
accordingly became general and all agreed that that was a fact. You could grow
any mortal thing in Irish soil, he stated, and there was Colonel Everard down
there in
<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Navan</span></span>
Cavan<a target="foot" id="frr0179">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
growing tobacco. Where would you find anywhere the like of Irish bacon? But a
day of reckoning, he stated <i>crescendo</i> with no uncertain voice &mdash;
thoroughly monopolising all the conversation &mdash; was in store for mighty
England, despite her power of pelf on account of her crimes. There would be a
fall and the greatest fall in history. The Germans and the Japs were going to
have their little lookin, he affirmed. The Boers were the beginning of the end.
Brummagem England was toppling already and her downfall would be Ireland, her
Achilles heel, which he explained to them about the vulnerable point of
Achilles, the Greek hero &mdash; a point his auditors at once seized as he
completely gripped their attention by showing the tendon referred to on his
boot. His advice to every Irishman was: stay in the land of your birth and work
for Ireland and live for Ireland. Ireland, Parnell said, could not spare a single one of her sons.</p>
<p> Silence all round marked the termination of his <i>finale</i>. The
impervious navigator heard these lurid tidings undismayed.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Take a bit of doing, boss, retaliated that rough diamond
palpably a bit peeved in response to the foregoing truism.</p>
<p> To which cold douche, referring to downfall and so on, the keeper concurred
but nevertheless held to his main view.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who&apos;s the best troops in the army? the grizzled old
veteran irately interrogated. And the best jumpers and racers? And the best
admirals and generals we&apos;ve got? Tell me that.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The
Irish<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><a target="foot" id="frr0181">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
for choice, retorted the cabby like Campbell, facial blemishes apart.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 596}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That&apos;s right, the old tarpaulin corroborated. The
Irish catholic peasant. He&apos;s the backbone of our empire. You know Jem Mullins?</p>
<p> While allowing him his individual opinions, as every man, the keeper added
he cared nothing for any empire, ours or his, and considered no Irishman worthy
of his salt that served it. Then they began to have a few irascible words, when
it waxed hotter, both, needless to say, appealing to the listeners who followed
the passage of arms with interest so long as they didn&apos;t indulge in recriminations and come to blows.</p>
<p> From inside information extending over a series of years Mr Bloom was rather
inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash for, pending that
consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for, he was fully cognisant of
the fact that their neighbours across the channel, unless they were much bigger
fools than he took them for, rather concealed their strength than the opposite.
It was quite on a par with the quixotic idea in certain quarters that in a
hundred million years the coal seam of the sister island would be played out and
if, as time went on, that turned out to be how the cat jumped all he could
personally say on the matter was that as a host of contingencies, equally
relevant to the issue, might occur ere then it was highly advisable in the
interim to try to make the most of both countries, even though poles apart.

point, the amours of whores and chummies, to put it in common parlance, reminded
him Irish soldiers had as often fought for England as against her, more so, in
fact. And now, why? So the scene between the pair of them, the licensee of the
place, rumoured to be or have been Fitzharris, the famous invincible, and the
other, obviously bogus, reminded him forcibly as being on all fours with the
confidence trick, supposing, that is, it was prearranged, as the lookeron, a
student of the human soul, if anything, the others seeing least of the game. And
as for the lessee or keeper, who probably wasn&apos;t the other person at all,
he (Bloom) couldn&apos;t help feeling, and most properly, it was better to give
people like that the goby unless you were a blithering idiot altogether and
refuse to have anything to do with them as a golden rule in private life and
their felonsetting, there always being the offchance of a Dannyman

forward and turning queen&apos;s evidence &mdash; or king&apos;s, now &mdash;
like Denis or Peter Carey, an idea he utterly repudiated. Quite apart from that,
he disliked those careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle. Yet, though such
criminal propensities had never been an inmate of his bosom in any shape or
form, he certainly did feel, and no denying it (while inwardly remaining what he was), a certain
<br><font color="green">{u22, 597}</font>

inflicted fatal injuries on his adored one as a result of an alternative
postnuptial <i>liaison</i> by plunging his knife into her until it just struck
him that Fitz, nicknamed Skin-the-Goat, merely drove the car for the actual
perpetrators of the outrage and so was not, if he was reliably informed,
actually party to the ambush which, in point of fact, was the plea some legal
luminary saved his skin on. In any case that was very ancient history by now and
as for our friend, the pseudo Skin-the-etcetera, he had transparently outlived
his welcome. He ought to have either died naturally or on the scaffold high.
Like actresses, always farewell &mdash; positively last performance &mdash; then

offensively. So I, without deviating from plain facts in the least, told him his
God, I mean Christ, was a jew too, and all his family, like me, though in
reality I&apos;m not. That was one for him. A soft answer turns away wrath. He
hadn&apos;t a word to say for himself as everyone saw. Am I not right?</p>

on the face of it to hate people because they live round the corner and speak another vernacular, so to speak.</p>

apology for a cup of coffee, listening to this synopsis of things in general,
Stephen stared at nothing in particular. He could hear, of course, all kinds of
words changing colour like those crabs about Ringsend in the
morning<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font>,<a target="foot" id="frr0211">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
burrowing quickly into all colours of different sorts of the same sand where
they had a home somewhere beneath or seemed to. Then he looked up and saw the
eyes that said or didn&apos;t say the words the voice he heard said &mdash; if you work.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Count me out, he managed to remark, meaning

because as he, the person who owned them pro. tem. observed, or

must work, have to, together.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I mean, of course, the other hastened to affirm, work in
the widest possible sense. Also literary labour, not merely for the kudos of the
thing. Writing for the newspapers which is the readiest channel nowadays.
That&apos;s work too. Important work. After all, from the little I know of you,
after all the money expended on your education, you are entitled to recoup
yourself and command your price. You have every bit as much right to live by
your pen in pursuit of your philosophy as the peasant has. What? You both belong
to Ireland, the brain and the brawn. Each is equally important.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You suspect, Stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh,
that I may be important because I belong to the <i>faubourg Saint-Patrice</i> called Ireland for short.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I would go a step farther, Mr Bloom insinuated.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; But I suspect, Stephen interrupted, that Ireland must be important because it belongs to me.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What belongs? queried Mr Bloom, bending, fancying he was
perhaps under some misapprehension. Excuse me. Unfortunately I didn&apos;t catch
the latter portion. What was it you
<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">&nbsp;&hellip;?</span></span>?&nbsp;&hellip;<a target="foot" id="frr0217">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font></p>
<p> Stephen, patently crosstempered, repeated and shoved aside his mug of
coffee, or whatever you like to call it, none too politely, adding:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; We can&apos;t change the country. Let us change the subject.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 600}</font> </p>
<p> At this pertinent suggestion, Mr Bloom, to change the subject, looked down,
but in a quandary, as he couldn&apos;t tell exactly what construction to put on
belongs to which sounded rather a far cry. The rebuke of some kind was clearer
than the other part. Needless to say, the fumes of his recent orgy spoke then
<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">with</span></span>
which<a target="foot" id="frr0218">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
some asperity in a curious bitter
way<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font>,<a target="foot" id="frr0219">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
foreign to his sober state. Probably the home life, to which Mr Bloom attached
the utmost importance, had not been all that was needful or he hadn&apos;t been
familiarised with the
<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font>the<a target="foot" id="frr0220">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
right sort of people. With a touch of fear for the young man beside him, whom he
furtively scrutinised with an air of some consternation, remembering he had just
come back from Paris, the eyes more especially reminding him forcibly of father
and sister, failing to throw much light on the subject, however, he brought to
mind instances of cultured fellows that promised so

nipped in the bud of premature decay, and nobody to blame but themselves. For
instance, there was the case of O&apos;Callaghan, for one, the half crazy
faddist, respectably connected, though of inadequate means, with his mad
vagaries, among whose other gay doings when rotto and making himself a nuisance
to everybody all round he was in the habit of ostentatiously sporting in public
a suit of brown paper (a fact). And then the usual <i>d&eacute;nouement</i>
after the fun had gone on fast and furious he got landed into hot water and had
to be spirited away by a few friends, after a strong hint to a blind horse from
John Mallon of Lower Castle Yard, so as not to be made amenable under section
two of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, certain names of those subp&oelig;naed
being handed in but not divulged, for reasons which will occur to anyone with a
pick of brains. Briefly, putting two and two together, six sixteen, which he
pointedly turned a deaf ear to, Antonio and so forth, jockeys and

House of Lords, because early in life the occupant of the throne, then heir
apparent, the other members of the upper ten and other high personages simply
following in the footsteps of the head of the state, he reflected about the
errors of notorieties and crowned heads running counter to morality such as the

as the law stands, was terribly down on, though not for the reason they thought
they were probably, whatever it was, except women chiefly, who were always
fiddling more or less at one another, it being largely a matter of dress and all
the rest of it. Ladies who like distinctive underclothing should, and every

degrees in the shade not caring a continental. However, reverting to the
original, there were on the other hand others who had forced their way to the
top from the lowest rung by the aid of their bootstraps. Sheer force of natural genius, that. With brains, sir.</p>

acquaintance of someone of no uncommon calibre who could provide food for

One morning you would open the paper, the cabman affirmed, and read, <i>Return
of Parnell</i>. He bet them what they liked. A Dublin fusilier was in that
shelter one night and said he saw him in South Africa. Pride it was killed him.
He ought to have done away with himself or lain low for a time after Committee
Room n&deg; 15 until he was his old self again with no-one to point a

at him. Then they would all to a man have gone down on their marrowbones to him
to come back when he had recovered his senses. Dead he wasn&apos;t. Simply
absconded somewhere. The coffin they brought over was full of stones. He changed
his name to De Wet, the Boer general. He made a mistake to fight the priests. And so forth and so on.</p>
<p> All the same Bloom (properly so dubbed) was rather surprised at their
memories for in nine cases out of ten it was a case of tarbarrels, and not
singly but in their thousands, and then complete oblivion because it was twenty
odd years. Highly unlikely, of course, there was even a shadow of truth in the
stones and, even supposing, he thought a return highly inadvisable, all things
considered. Something evidently riled them in his death. Either he petered out
too tamely of acute pneumonia just when his various different political
arrangements were nearing completion or whether it transpired he owed his death
to his having neglected to change his boots and clothes after a wetting when a
cold resulted and failing to consult a specialist he being confined to his room
till he eventually died of it amid widespread regret before a

was at an end or quite possibly they were distressed to find the job was taken
out of their hands. Of course nobody being acquainted with his movements even
before, there was absolutely no clue as to his whereabouts which were decidedly
of the <i>Alice, where art thou</i> order even prior to his starting to go under
several aliases such as Fox and Stewart, so the
<br><font color="green">{u22, 604}</font>
<br> remark which emanated from friend cabby might be within the bounds of
possibility. Naturally then, it would prey on his mind as a born leader of men,
which undoubtedly he was, and a commanding figure, a sixfooter or at any rate
five feet ten or eleven in his stockinged feet, whereas

So-and-So who, though they weren&apos;t even a patch on the former man, ruled
the roost after their redeeming features were very few and far between. It
certainly pointed a moral, the idol with feet of clay. And then seventytwo of
his trusty henchmen rounding on him with mutual mudslinging. And the identical
same with murderers. You had to come back &mdash; that haunting sense kind of
drew you &mdash; to show the understudy in the title <i>r&ocirc;le</i> how to.
He saw him once on the auspicious occasion when they broke up the type in the
<i>Insuppressible</i> or was it <i>United Ireland</i>, a privilege he keenly
appreciated, and, in point of fact, handed him his silk hat when it was knocked
off and he said <i>Thank you</i>, excited as he undoubtedly was under his frigid
expression notwithstanding the little misadventure mentioned between the cup and
the
lip<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font>,<a target="foot" id="frr0264">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>

dog if they didn&apos;t set the terrier at you directly you got back. Then a lot

Tom for and Dick and Harry against. And then, number one, you came up against
the man in possession and had to produce your credentials, like the claimant in
the Tichborne case, Roger Charles Tichborne, <i>Bella</i> was the boat&apos;s
name to the best of his recollection he, the heir, went down in, as the evidence
went to show, and there was a tattoo mark too in Indian ink, Lord Bellew, was
it? As he might very easily have picked up the details from some pal on board
ship and then, when got up to tally with the description given, introduce
himself with, <i>Excuse me, my name is So-and-So</i> or some such commonplace
remark. A more prudent course,

<p class="di">&mdash; Ay, Skin-the-Goat amusingly added. He was, and a cottonball one.</p>
<p> This gratuitous contribution of a humorous character occasioned a fair
amount of laughter among his <i>entourage</i>. As regards Bloom, he, without the
faintest suspicion of a smile, merely gazed in the direction of the door and reflected
<br><font color="green">{u22, 605}</font>
<br> upon the historic story which had aroused extraordinary interest at the
time when the facts, to make matters worse, were made public with the usual
affectionate letters that passed between them, full of sweet nothings. First, it
was strictly platonic till nature intervened and an attachment sprang up between
them, till
<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font>it<a target="foot" id="frr0269">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
bit by bit matters came to a climax and the matter became the talk of the town
till the staggering blow came as a welcome intelligence to not a few

though the thing was public property all along though not to anything like the

coupled, though, since he was her declared

namely, that he had shared her bedroom, which came out in the witnessbox on oath
when a thrill went through the packed court literally electrifying everybody in
the shape of witnesses swearing to having witnessed him on such and such a
particular date in the act of scrambling out of an upstairs apartment with the
assistance of a ladder in night apparel, having gained admittance in the same
fashion, a fact that the weeklies, addicted to the lubric a little, simply
coined shoals of money out of. Whereas the simple fact of the case was it was
simply a case of the husband not being up to the scratch with nothing in common
between them beyond the name and then a real man arriving on the scene, strong
to the verge of weakness, falling a victim to her siren charms and forgetting
home ties. The usual sequel, to bask in the loved one&apos;s smiles. The eternal
question of the life connubial, needless to say, cropped up. Can real love,
supposing there happens to be another chap in the case, exist between married
folk? Though it was no concern of theirs absolutely if he regarded her with
affection<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><a target="foot" id="frr0274">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
carried away by a wave of folly. A magnificent specimen of manhood he was truly,
augmented obviously by gifts of a high order as compared with the other military
supernumerary, that is (who was just the usual everyday <i>farewell, my gallant
captain</i> kind of an individual in the light dragoons, the
18<sup>th</sup></font> hussars to be accurate), and inflammable doubtless (the
fallen leader, that

not the other) in his own peculiar way which she of course, woman, quickly
perceived as highly likely to carve his way to fame, which he almost bid fair to
do till the priests and ministers of the gospel as a whole, his erstwhile
staunch adherents and his beloved evicted tenants for whom he had done yeoman
service in the rural parts of the country by taking up the cudgels on their
behalf in a way that exceeded their most sanguine expectations, very effectually
cooked his matrimonial goose, thereby heaping
<br><font color="green">{u22, 606}</font>
<br> coals of fire on his

in the same way as the fabled ass&apos;s kick. Looking back now in a
retrospective kind of arrangement, all seemed a kind of dream. And

coming back was the worst thing you ever did because it went without saying you
would feel out of place as things always moved with the times. Why, as he
reflected, Irishtown Strand, a locality he had not been in for quite a number of
years, looked different somehow since, as it happened, he went to reside on the
north side. North or
south<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><a target="foot" id="frr0278">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
however, it was just the wellknown case of hot passion, pure and simple,
upsetting the applecart with a vengeance and just bore out the very thing he was
saying, as she also was Spanish or half so, types that wouldn&apos;t do things
by halves, passionate abandon of the south, casting every shred of decency to the winds.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Just bears out what I was saying,

it was, as she lived there. So, Spain.</p>

by the by of that Capel street library book out of date, he took out his
pocketbook and, turning over the various contents rapidly, finally he&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Do you consider, by the by, he said, thoughtfully
selecting a faded photo which he laid on the table, that a Spanish type?</p>
<p> Stephen, obviously addressed, looked down on the photo showing a large sized
lady, with her fleshy charms on evidence in an open fashion, as she was in the
full bloom of womanhood, in evening dress cut ostentatiously low for the
occasion to give a liberal display of bosom, with more than vision of breasts,
her full lips parted, and some perfect teeth, standing near, ostensibly with
gravity, a piano, on the rest of which was <i>In</i>

(the lady&apos;s) eyes, dark, large, looked at Stephen, about to smile about
something to be admired, Lafayette of Westmoreland street, Dublin&apos;s premier
photographic artist, being responsible for the esthetic execution.</p>

Madam Marion Tweedy, Bloom indicated. Taken a few years since. In or about &apos;96. Very like her then.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 607}</font> </p>
<p> Beside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his legal
wife who, he intimated, was the accomplished daughter of Major Brian Tweedy and
displayed at an early age remarkable proficiency as a singer having even made
her bow to the public when her years numbered barely sweet sixteen. As for the
face, it was a speaking likeness in expression but it did not do justice to her
figure, which came in for a lot of notice usually and which did not come out to
the best advantage in that getup. She could without difficulty, he said, have
posed for the ensemble, not to dwell on certain opulent curves of
the&nbsp;&hellip; He dwelt, being a bit of an artist in his spare time, on the
female form in general developmentally because, as it so happened, no later than
that afternoon, he had seen those Grecian statues, perfectly developed as works
of art, in the National Museum. Marble could give the original, shoulders, back,
all the symmetry. All the rest, yes,

It does though, St. Joseph&apos;s sovereign &nbsp;&hellip; whereas no photo
could, because it simply wasn&apos;t art, in a word.</p>
<p> The spirit moving him, he would much have liked to follow Jack Tar&apos;s
good example and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to speak for
itself on the plea he&nbsp;&hellip; so that the other could drink in the beauty
for himself, her stage presence being, frankly, a treat in itself which the
camera could not at all do justice to. But it was scarcely professional
etiquette so, though it was a warm pleasant sort of a night now yet wonderfully
cool for the season considering, for sunshine after storm&nbsp;&hellip; And he
did feel a kind of need there and then to follow suit like a kind of inward
voice and satisfy a possible need by moving a motion. Nevertheless, he sat
tight, just viewing the slightly soiled photo creased by opulent curves, none
the worse for wear, however, and looked away

while gauging her symmetry of heaving <i>embonpoint</i>. In fact, the slight
soiling was only an added charm, like the case of linen slightly soiled, good as
new, much better, in fact, with the starch out. Suppose she was gone when he

I looked for the lamp which she told me came into his mind but merely as a
passing fancy of his because he then recollected the morning littered bed
etcetera and the book about Ruby with met him pike hoses (<i>sic</i>) in it
which must have fell down sufficiently appropriately beside the domestic
chamberpot with apologies to Lindley Murray.</p>
<p> The vicinity of the young man he certainly relished, educated,
<i>distingu&eacute;</i>, and impulsive into the bargain, far and away the pick
of the bunch, though you wouldn&apos;t think he had it in him&nbsp;&hellip; yet you would. Besides he said the
<br><font color="green">{u22, 608}</font>
<br> picture was handsome which, say what you like, it was, though at the moment
she was distinctly stouter. And why not? An awful lot of makebelieve went on
about that sort of thing involving a lifelong slur with the usual splash page of
letterpress about the same old matrimonial tangle alleging misconduct with
professional golfer or the newest stage favourite instead of being honest and
aboveboard about the whole business. How they were fated to meet and an
attachment sprang up between the two so that their names were coupled in the
public eye was told in court with letters containing the habitual mushy and
compromising expressions, leaving no loophole, to show that they openly
cohabited two or three times a week at some wellknown seaside hotel and
relations, when the thing ran its normal course, became in due course intimate.
Then the decree <i>nisi</i> and the King&apos;s Proctor to show cause why and,
he failing to quash it, <i>nisi</i> was made absolute. But as for

distinction of being close to Erin&apos;s uncrowned king in the flesh when the

reflecting on the erstwhile tribune&apos;s private morals. Though palpably a
radically altered man, he was still a commanding figure, though carelessly
garbed as usual, with that look of settled purpose which went a long way with
the shillyshallyers till they discovered to their vast discomfiture that their
idol had feet of

after placing him upon a pedestal, which she, however, was the first to
perceive. As those were particularly hot times in the general hullaballoo Bloom
sustained a minor injury from a nasty prod of some chap&apos;s elbow in the
crowd that of course congregated lodging some place about the pit of the
stomach, fortunately not of a grave character. His hat
(Parnell&apos;s)<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font>,<a target="foot" id="frr0298">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
was inadvertently knocked off and, as a matter of strict history, Bloom was the
man who picked it up in the crush after witnessing the occurrence meaning to
return it to him (and return it to him he did with the utmost
<br><font color="green">{u22, 609}</font>
<br> celerity) who, panting and hatless and whose thoughts were miles away from
his hat at the time, being a gentleman born with a stake in the country, he, as
a matter of fact, having gone into it more for the kudos of the thing than
anything else, what&apos;s bred in the bone, instilled into him in infancy at
his mother&apos;s knee in the shape of knowing what good form was came out at
once because he turned round to the donor and thanked him with perfect
<i>aplomb</i>, saying: <i>Thank you,
sir</i><font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><a target="foot" id="frr0299">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
though in a very different tone of voice from the ornament of the legal
profession whose headgear Bloom also set to rights earlier in the course of the
day, history repeating itself with a difference, after the burial of a mutual
friend when they had left him alone in his glory after the grim task of having committed his remains to the grave.</p>
<p> On the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatant jokes of
the

and so on, who passed it all off as a jest, laughing immoderately, pretending to
understand everything, the why and the wherefore, and in reality not knowing
their own minds, it being a case for the two parties themselves unless it ensued
that the legitimate husband happened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous
letter from the usual boy Jones, who happened to come across them at the crucial
moment in a loving position locked in one another&apos;s
arms<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><a target="foot" id="frr0301">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
drawing attention to their illicit proceedings and leading up to a domestic
rumpus and the erring fair one begging forgiveness of her lord and master upon
her knees and promising to sever the connection and not receive his visits any
more if only the aggrieved husband would overlook the matter and let bygones be
bygones, with tears in her eyes, though possibly with her tongue in her fair
cheek at the same time, as quite possibly there were several others. He
personally, being of a sceptical bias, believed, and didn&apos;t make the
smallest bones about saying so either, that man, or men in the plural, were
always hanging around on the waiting list about a lady, even supposing she was
the best wife in the world and they got on fairly well together for the sake of
argument, when, neglecting her duties, she chose to be tired of wedded
life<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font>,<a target="foot" id="frr0302">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>

debauchery<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><a target="foot" id="frr0303">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
to press their attentions on her with improper intent, the upshot being that her
affections centred on another, the cause of many <i>liaisons</i> between still
attractive married women getting on for fair and forty and younger men, no doubt
as several famous cases of feminine infatuation proved up to the hilt.</p>
<p> It was a thousand pities a young fellow blessed with an allowance of brains,
as his neighbour obviously was, should waste his valuable time with profligate
women, who might present him with a nice dose to last him his lifetime. In

Miss Right came on the scene but in the interim ladies&apos; society was a
<i>conditio sine qua non</i> though he had the gravest possible doubts, not that
he wanted in the smallest to pump Stephen about Miss Ferguson (who was very
possibly the particular lodestar who brought him down to Irishtown so early in
the morning), as to whether he would find much satisfaction basking in the boy
and girl courtship idea and the company of smirking misses without a penny to
their names

tri-weekly with the orthodox preliminary canter of complimentpaying and walking
out leading up to fond lovers&apos; ways and flowers and chocs. To think of him
house and homeless, rooked by some landlady worse than any stepmother, was
really too bad at his age. The queer suddenly things he popped out with
attracted the elder man who was several years the other&apos;s senior or like
his father. But something substantial he certainly ought to eat, were it only an
eggflip made on unadulterated maternal nutriment or, failing that, the homely Humpty Dumpty boiled.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; At what o&apos;clock did you dine? he questioned of the

intelligence<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><a target="foot" id="frr0307">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>

reflected. Though they didn&apos;t see eye to eye in everything, a certain
analogy there somehow was, as if both their minds were travelling, so to speak,
in the one train of thought. At his age when dabbling in politics roughly some
score of years previously when he had been a <i>quasi</i> aspirant to
parliamentary honours in the Buckshot Foster days he too recollected in
retrospect (which was a source of keen satisfaction in itself) he had a sneaking
regard for those same ultra ideas. For instance, when the evicted tenants
question, then at its first inception, bulked largely in people&apos;s

though, it goes without saying, not contributing a copper or pinning his faith
absolutely to its dictums, some of which wouldn&apos;t exactly hold water, he at
the outset in principle, at all events, was in thorough sympathy with peasant
possession, as voicing the trend of modern opinion,a partiality, however, which,
realising his mistake, he was subsequently partially cured of, and even was
twitted with going a step further than Michael Davitt in the striking views he
at one time inculcated as a backtothelander, which was one reason he strongly
resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion
<br><font color="green">{u22, 611}</font>
<br> at the gathering of the clans in Barney Kiernan&apos;s so that he, though
often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of mortals, be it
repeated, departed from his customary habit to give him (metaphorically) one in
the gizzard

so far as politics themselves were concerned, he was only too conscious of the
casualties invariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity
and the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on fine young
fellows, chiefly, destruction of the fittest, in a word.</p>
<p> Anyhow, upon weighing
<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">up</span></span><a target="foot" id="frr0312">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
the pros and cons, getting on for one as it was, it was high time to be retiring
for the night. The crux was it was a bit risky to bring him home as
eventualities might possibly ensue (somebody having a temper of her own
sometimes) and spoil the hash altogether as on the night he misguidedly brought
home a dog (breed unknown) with a lame paw,not that the cases were either
identical or the reverse, though he had hurt his hand too, to Ontario Terrace,
as he very distinctly remembered, having been there, so to speak. On the other
hand it was altogether far and away too late for the Sandymount or Sandycove
suggestion so that he was in some perplexity as to which of the two
alternatives&nbsp;&hellip; Everything pointed to the fact that it behoved him to
avail himself to the full of the opportunity, all things considered. His initial
impression was that he was a bit standoffish or not over effusive but it grew on
him someway. For one thing he mightn&apos;t what you call jump at the idea, if
approached, and what mostly worried him was he didn&apos;t know how to lead up
to it or word it exactly, supposing he did entertain the proposal, as it would
afford him very great personal pleasure if he would allow him to help to

coin in his way or some wardrobe, if found suitable. At all events he wound up
by concluding, eschewing for the nonce hidebound precedent, a cup of Epps&apos;s
cocoa and a shakedown for the night plus the use of a rug or two and overcoat
doubled into a pillow. At least he would be in safe hands and as warm as a toast
on a trivet. He failed

any very vast amount of harm in that always with the proviso no rumpus of any
sort was kicked up. A move had to be made because that merry old soul, the
grasswidower in question who appeared to be glued to the spot, didn&apos;t
appear in any particular hurry to wend his way home to his dearly beloved
Queenstown and it was highly likely some sponger&apos;s bawdyhouse of retired
beauties off Sheriff street lower would be the best clue to that equivocal
character&apos;s whereabouts for a few days to come, alternately racking their
feelings (the mermaids&apos;) with sixchamber revolver anecdotes verging on the
tropical calculated to freeze the marrow of anybody&apos;s bones and mauling
their largesized charms between whiles with rough and tumble gusto

same time he inwardly chuckled over his repartee to the blood and ouns champion
about his God being a jew. People could put up with being bitten by a wolf but
what properly riled them was a bite from a sheep. The most vulnerable point too
of tender Achilles, your God was a jew, because mostly they appeared to imagine

<p> All kinds of Utopian plans were flashing through his (Bloom&apos;s) busy
brain. Education (the genuine article), literature, journalism, prize titbits,
up to date billing, hydros and concert tours in English watering resorts packed
with theatres, turning money away, duets in Italian with the accent perfectly
true to nature and a quantity of other things, no necessity of course to tell
the world and his wife from the housetops about

and a slice of luck. An opening was all was wanted. Because he more than
suspected he had his father&apos;s voice to bank his hopes on which it was quite
on the cards he had so it would be just as well, by the way no harm, to trail
the conversation in the direction of that particular red herring just to&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

somewhere. Silence with a yawn or two accompanied this thrilling announcement.
Then the old specimen in the corner who appeared to have some spark of vitality
left read out that Sir Anthony MacDonnell had left Euston for the chief
secretary&apos;s lodge or words to that effect. To which absorbing piece of intelligence echo answered why.</p>

<p> Thereupon he pawed the journal open and pored upon Lord only knows what,
found drowned or the exploits of King Willow, Iremonger having made a hundred

regardless of Ire) the keeper was intensely occupied loosening an apparently new

it was sold it, all of them who were sufficiently awake enough to be picked out
by their facial expressions, that is to say, either simply looking on glumly or passing a trivial remark.</p>

so as not to outstay their welcome having first and foremost, being as good as
his word that he would foot the bill for the occasion, taken the wise precaution
to unobtrusively motion to mine host as a parting shot a scarcely perceptible
sign when the others were not looking to the effect that the amount due was
forthcoming, making a grand total of fourpence (the amount he deposited

right side being, in classical idiom, his tender Achilles. The night air was
certainly now a treat to breathe though Stephen was a bit weak on his pins.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It will (the air) do you good, Bloom said, meaning also
the walk, in a moment. The only thing is to walk then you&apos;ll feel a
different man. It&apos;s not far. Lean on me.</p>
<p> Accordingly he passed his left arm in Stephen&apos;s right and led him on accordingly.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, Stephen said uncertainly, because he thought he felt
a strange kind of flesh of a different man approach him, sinewless and wobbly and all that.</p>
<p> Anyhow, they passed the sentrybox with stones, brazier,

was still to all intents and purposes wrapped in the arms of Murphy, as the
adage has it, dreaming of fresh fields and pastures new. And <i>apropos</i> of
coffin of stones, the analogy was not at all bad, as it was in fact a stoning to
death on the part of seventytwo out of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at
the time of the split and chiefly the belauded peasant class, probably the
selfsame evicted tenants he had put in their holdings.</p>
<p> So they passed on to chatting about music, a form of art for which Bloom, as
a pure amateur, possessed the greatest love, as they made tracks arm-in-arm
across Beresford

Place<a target="foot" id="frr0342">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>.
Wagnerian music, though confessedly grand in its way, was a bit too heavy for
Bloom and hard to follow at the first go-off but the music of Mercadante&apos;s
<i>Huguenots</i>, Meyerbeer&apos;s <i>Seven Last Words on the Cross</i>, and
Mozart&apos;s <i>Twelfth
Mass</i><font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font>,<a target="foot" id="frr0343">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
he simply revelled in, the <i>Gloria</i> in that being to his mind the acme of
first class music as such, literally knocking everything else into a cocked hat.
He infinitely preferred the sacred music of the catholic church to anything the
opposite shop could offer in that line such as those Moody and Sankey hymns or
<i>Bid me to live and I will live thy protestant to be</i>. He also yielded to
none in his admiration of Rossini&apos;s <i>Stabat Mater</i>, a work simply
abounding in immortal numbers, in which his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy, made a
hit, a veritable sensation, he might safely

the sacred edifice being thronged to the doors to hear her with virtuosos, or
<i>virtuosi</i> rather. There was the unanimous opinion that there was none to
come up to her and, suffice it to say in a place of worship for music of a
sacred character, there was a generally voiced desire for an encore. On the
whole, though favouring preferably light opera of the <i>Don Giovanni</i>
description, and

a gem in its line, he had a <i>penchant</i>, though with only a surface
knowledge, for the severe classical school such as Mendelssohn. And talking of
that, taking it for granted he knew all about the old favourites, he mentioned

which, curiously enough, he heard, or overheard, to be more accurate, on
yesterday, a privilege he keenly appreciated, from the lips of Stephen&apos;s
respected father, sung to perfection, a study of the number, in fact, which made
all the others take a back seat. Stephen, in reply to a politely put query, said
he didn&apos;t but launched out into praises of Shakespeare&apos;s songs, at
least of in or about that period, the lutenist Dowland who lived in Fetter Lane
near Gerard the herbalist, who <i>anno ludendo hausi, Doulandus</i>, an
instrument he was contemplating purchasing from Mr Arnold Dolmetsch, whom Bloom
did not quite recall, though the name certainly sounded familiar, for sixtyfive
guineas and Farnaby and son with their <i>dux</i> and <i>comes</i> conceits and
Byrd (William), who played the virginals, he said, in the Queen&apos;s Chapel or
anywhere else he found them and one Tomkins who made toys or airs and John Bull.</p>
<p> On the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond the
<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">swingchains</span></span>

chain,<a target="foot" id="frr0351">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
a horse, dragging a sweeper, paced on the paven ground, brushing a long swathe
of mire up so that with the noise Bloom was not perfectly certain whether he had
caught aright the allusion to sixtyfive guineas and John Bull. He inquired if it
was John Bull the political celebrity of that ilk, as it struck him, the two
identical names, as a striking coincidence.</p>
<p> By the chains, the horse slowly swerved to turn, which perceiving, Bloom,
who was keeping a sharp lookout as
usual<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><a target="foot" id="frr0352">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
plucked the other&apos;s sleeve gently, jocosely remarking:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Our lives are in peril
<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">tonight</span></span>

Beware of the steamroller.</p>
<p> They thereupon stopped. Bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth
anything like sixtyfive guineas, suddenly in evidence in the dark quite near, so
that it seemed new, a different grouping of bones and even flesh, because
palpably it was a fourwalker, a hipshaker, a blackbuttocker, a taildangler, a
headhanger, putting his hind foot foremost the while the lord of his creation
<br><font color="green">{u22, 616}</font>
<br> sat on the perch, busy with his thoughts. But such a good poor brute, he
was sorry he hadn&apos;t a lump of sugar but, as he wisely reflected, you could
scarcely be prepared for every emergency that might crop up. He was just a big
<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">nervous

nervous<a target="foot" id="frr0355">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
noodly kind of a horse, without a second care in the world. But even a dog, he
reflected, take that mongrel in Barney Kiernan&apos;s, of the same size, would
be a holy horror to face. But it was no animal&apos;s fault in particular if he
was built that way like the camel, ship of the desert, distilling grapes into
potheen in his hump. Nine tenths of them all could be caged or trained, nothing
beyond the art of man barring the bees; whale with a harpoon hairpin, alligator,
tickle the small of his back and he sees the joke; chalk a circle for a rooster;
tiger, my eagle eye. These timely reflections anent the brutes of the field
occupied his mind, somewhat distracted from Stephen&apos;s words, while the ship
of the street was
<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">manoeuvring</span></span>
man&oelig;uvring<a target="foot" id="frr0356">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
and Stephen went on about the highly interesting old&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What&apos;s this I was saying? Ah, yes! My wife, he
intimated, plunging <i>in medias res</i>, would have the greatest of pleasure in
making your acquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind.</p>
<p> He looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of Stephen, image
of his mother, which was not quite the same as the usual blackguard type they
unquestionably had an indubitable hankering after as he was perhaps not that way built.</p>
<p> Still, supposing he had his father&apos;s gift, as he more than suspected,
it opened up new vistas in his mind, such as Lady Fingall&apos;s Irish
industries concert on the preceding Monday, and aristocracy in general.</p>
<p> Exquisite variations he was now describing on

about the clear sea and the voices of sirens, sweet murderers of men, which boggled Bloom a bit:</p>
<p class="set"><i>Von der Sirenen Listigkeit</i>
<br> <i>Tun die Poeten dichten.</i></p>
<p> These opening bars he sang and translated <i>extempore</i>. Bloom, nodding,
said he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means, which he did.</p>
<p> A phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that, the rarest of boons, which
Bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out, could easily, if properly
<br><font color="green">{u22, 617}</font>
<br> handled by some recognised authority on voice production such as
Barraclough and being able to read music into the bargain, command its own price
where baritones were ten a penny and procure for its fortunate possessor in the
near future an <i>entr&eacute;e</i> into fashionable houses in the best
residential quarters of financial magnates in a large way of business and titled
people where, with his university degree of B.A. (a huge ad in its way) and
gentlemanly bearing to all the more influence the good
impression<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><a target="foot" id="frr0360">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
he would infallibly score a distinct success, being blessed with brains which
also could be utilised for the purpose and other requisites, if his clothes were
properly attended to, so as to the better worm his way into their good graces as
he, a youthful tyro in society&apos;s sartorial niceties, hardly understood how
a little thing like that could militate against you. It was in fact only a
matter of months and he could easily foresee him participating in their musical
and artistic <i>conversaziones</i> during the festivities of the Christmas
season, for choice, causing a slight flutter in the dovecotes of the fair sex
and being made a lot of by ladies out for sensation, cases of which, as he
happened to know, were on record
<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">&mdash;</span></span>,<a target="foot" id="frr0361">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>

of course, would be the

emolument by no means to be sneezed at, going hand in hand with his tuition
fees. Not, he parenthesised, that for the sake of filthy lucre he need
necessarily embrace the lyric platform as a walk in life for any lengthy space
of time but a step in the required direction it was, beyond yea or nay, and both
monetarily and mentally it contained no reflection on his dignity in the
smallest and it often turned in uncommonly handy to be handed a cheque at a
muchneeded moment when every little helped. Besides, though taste latterly had
deteriorated to a degree, original music like that, different from the
conventional rut, would rapidly have a great vogue, as it would be a decided
novelty for Dublin&apos;s musical world after the usual hackneyed run of catchy
tenor solos foisted on a confiding public by Ivan St Austell and Hilton St Just
and their <i>genus omne</i>. Yes, beyond a shadow of a doubt, he could, with all
the cards in his
hand<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><a target="foot" id="frr0364">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
and he had a capital opening to make a name for himself and win a high place in
the city&apos;s esteem where he could command a stiff figure and, booking ahead,
give a grand concert for the patrons of the King

&mdash; a big <i>if</i>, however &mdash; with some impetus of the goahead sort
to obviate the inevitable procrastination which often tripped up a too much
f&ecirc;ted prince of good fellows and it need not detract from the

<br> other by one iota as, being his own master, he would have heaps of time to
practise literature in his spare moments when desirous of so doing without its
clashing with his vocal career or containing anything derogatory

soever<a target="foot" id="frr0369">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
as it was a matter for himself alone. In fact, he had the ball at his feet and
that was the very reason why the other, possessed of a remarkably sharp nose for
smelling a rat of any sort, hung on to him at all.</p>
<p> The horse was just then&nbsp;&hellip; and later on, at a propitious
opportunity he purposed (Bloom did), without anyway prying into his private
affairs on the <i>fools step in where angels</i>
principle<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><a target="foot" id="frr0370">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>u22)</small></sup></font>
advising him to sever his connection with a certain budding practitioner, who,
he noticed, was prone to disparage, and even, to a slight extent, with some
hilarious pretext, when not present, deprecate him, or whatever you like to call
it, which, in Bloom&apos;s humble opinion, threw a nasty sidelight on that side
of a person&apos;s character &mdash; no pun intended.</p>
<p> The horse, having reached the end of his tether, so to speak, halted, and,
rearing high a proud feathering tail, added his quota by letting fall on the
floor, which the brush would soon brush up and polish, three smoking globes of
turds. Slowly, three times, one after another, from a full crupper, he mired.
And humanely his driver waited till he (or she) had ended, patient in his scythed car.</p>
<p> Side by side Bloom, profiting by the <i>contretemps</i>, with Stephen passed
through the gap of the chains, divided by the upright, and, stepping over a
strand of mire, went across towards Gardiner
<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">street</span></span>

lower, Stephen singing more boldly, but not loudly, the end of the ballad:</p>
<p class="set"><i>Und alle Schiffe br&uuml;cken</i>.</p>
<p> The driver never said a word, good, bad or indifferent. He merely watched
the two figures,
<font color="red"><sup><small>(u21</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext"><i>as

both black &mdash; one full, one lean &mdash; walk towards the railway bridge,
<i>to be married by Father Maher</i>. As they walked, they at times stopped and
walked again, continuing their <i>t&ecirc;te &agrave; t&ecirc;te</i> (which of
course he was utterly out of), about sirens, enemies of man&apos;s reason,
mingled with a number of other topics of the same category, usurpers, historical
cases of the kind while the man in the sweeper car or you might as well call it
in the sleeper car who in any case couldn&apos;t possibly hear because they were
too far simply sat in his
