evidently<a target="foot" id="frz0047">&ordm;</a> as he took particular notice.</p>
<p> Though not an implicit believer in the lurid story narrated having detected
a discrepancy<a target="foot" id="frz0048">&ordm;</a> between his name, assuming
he was the person he represented himself to be, and the fictitious addressee of
the missive nevertheless it reminded him in a way of a longcherished plan he
meant to one day realise of travelling to London via long sea for he was at
heart a born adventurer, though by a trick of fate he had consistently remained
a landlubber except you call going to Holyhead which was his longest. Martin
Cunningham frequently said he would work a pass through Egan but some hitch or
other eternally cropped up with the net result that the scheme fell through. But
even suppose it did come to planking down and breaking Boyd&apos;s heart it was
not so dear, purse permitting, a few guineas at the outside considering the fare
to Mullingar was five and six, there and back. The trip would benefit health on
account of the bracing ozone and be in every way
<a name="un4031au" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031au">thoroughly
pleasurable</a> seeing the different places along the route, Plymouth, Falmouth,
Southampton and so on culminating in an instructive tour of the sights of the
great metropolis, modern Babylon, tower, abbey, wealth of Park lane, to renew
acquaintance with. Another thing just struck him as by no means a bad notion was
he might have a gaze around on the spot to see about trying to
<a name="s16010aq" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16010aq">make
arrangements</a> about a concert tour embracing the chief pleasure resorts,
Margate and so on. Not, of course, with a hole and corner scratch company,
witness Mrs C P M<sup><small>c</small></sup>Coy type lend me your valise and
I&apos;ll post you the ticket. No,
<a name="un5018av" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5018av">something top
notch</a>, an all star Irish caste, perfectly simple matter providing puffs in
the local papers could be managed and thus combine business with pleasure.</p>
<p> Also it struck him a great field was to be opened up in the line of opening
up new routes apropos of the Fishguard-Rosslare route which it was
<a name="s16007j" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16007j">mooted</a> was once
more on the tapis in the circumlocution departments with the usual dillydallying
of effete fogeydom and dunderheads generally. A great opportunity there
certainly was for push and enterprise to meet the travelling needs of the public
at large, the average man, i.e, Brown, Robinson and so forth.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 14}</font> </p>
<p> It was a subject of regret and absurd as well on the face of it and no small
blame to our vaunted society that the man in the street for the
<a name="un4030dn" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030dn">matter of a couple
of paltry pounds</a> was debarred from seeing more of the world they lived in
instead of being always and ever cooped up since my old stick-in-the-mud took me
for a wife. After all they had their eleven and more humdrum months of it and
merited a radical change of venue in the summertime for choice when
<a name="s16013bf" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16013bf">dame Nature</a> is
at her best constituting nothing short of a new lease of life. There were
delightful sylvan spots for rejuvenation in and around Dublin even, Poulaphouca
to which there was a steamtram but also farther away from the madding crowd in
Wicklow, rightly termed the garden of Ireland, and in the wilds of Donegal, if
report spoke true, though not easily gettatable. Because of course uptodate
tourist travelling was as yet merely in its infancy, so to speak, and the
accomodation left much to be desired. Interesting to fathom it seemed to him
from a motive of curiosity, pure and simple, was whether it was the traffic that
created the route or viceversa or the two sides in fact. He turned back the
other side of the card, picture, and passed it along to Stephen.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I seen a Chinese one time, related the narrator, that had
little pills like putty and he put them in the water and they opened and every
pill was something different. One was a ship, another was a house, another was a
flower. Cooks rats in your soup, he added, the chinks does.</p>
<p> Possibly perceiving an expression of dubiosity on their faces the
globetrotter went on, adhering to his adventure.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And I seen a man killed in Trieste by an Italian chap. Knife in his back. Knife like that.</p>
<p> Whilst speaking he produced a dangerouslooking claspknife quite in keeping
with his character and held it in the striking position.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; In a knockingshop it was, count of a tryon between two
smugglers. Fellow hid behind a door, come up behind him. Like that. Prepare to
meet your God, says he. Chuk! It went into his back up to the butt.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 15}</font> </p>
<p> His<a target="foot" id="frz0049">&ordm;</a> heavy glance drowsily roaming
about kind of defied their further questions even
<a name="s16001cv" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001cv">should they by any chance</a> want to.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That&apos;s a good bit of steel, repeated he, examining his formidable knife.</p>
<p> After which harrowing tale he snapped the blade to and stowed the weapon in
question away as before in his chamber of horrors, otherwise pocket.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; They&apos;re great for the cold steel, somebody said for
the benefit of them all. That was why they thought the park murders of the
invincibles was done by foreigners on account of them using knives.</p>
<p> At this remark passed obviously in the spirit of where ignorance is bliss Mr
B. and Stephen, each in his own
particular<a target="foot" id="frz0050">&ordm;</a> way, both instinctively
exchanged meaning glances, in a religious silence of the strictly <u>entre
nous</u> variety however, towards where Skin-the-Goat, alias the keeper, not
turning a hair, was drawing spurts of liquid from his boiler affair. His
inscrutable face which was really a work of art, a perfect study in itself,
conveyed the impression<a target="foot" id="frz0051">&ordm;</a> that he
didn&apos;t understand one jot of what was going on. Funny, very!</p>
<p> There followed a somewhat lengthy pause. One man was reading
<a name="un5012an" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5012an">in fits and
starts</a> a stained by coffee evening journal, another the card with the
natives <u>choza de</u>, another the seaman&apos;s discharge. Mr Bloom, so far
as he was concerned, was just pondering in pensive mood. He vividly recollected
when the occurrence alluded to took place as well as yesterday, roughly some
score of years previously in the days of the land troubles, when it took the
civilised world by storm, figuratively speaking, in eightyone when he was just turned fifteen</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ay, boss, the sailor broke in. Give us back them papers.</p>
<p> The request being complied with he clawed them up with a scrape.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Have you seen the rock of Gibraltar? Mr Bloom asked.</p>
<p> The sailor grimaced, chewing, in a way that might be read as yes, ay or no.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ah, you&apos;ve touched there too, Mr Bloom said, Europa point, thinking he had,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 16}</font>
<br> in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences. But he
failed to do so, simply letting spirt a jet of spew into the sawdust and shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What year would that be about? Mr B interrogated. Can you recall the boats?</p>
<p> Our sailor munched heavily awhile hungrily before answering:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I&apos;m tired of all them rocks in the sea, he said, and
boats and ships. Salt junk all the time.</p>
<p> Tired seemingly, he ceased. His questioner perceiving that he was not likely
to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer, fell to
woolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the globe, suffice
it to say that it covered fully three fourths of it, and he fully realised
accordingly what it meant to rule the waves. On more than one occasion, a dozen
at the lowest, near the North Bull at Dollymount he had remarked a superannuated
old salt, evidently derelict, seated habitually near the not particularly
redolent sea on the wall, staring calmly at it and it at him, dreaming of fresh
woods and pastures new. And it left him wondering why. Possibly he had tried to
find out the secret for himself, floundering up and down and all that sort of
thing and over and under, well, not exactly under,
<a name="s16010ar" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16010ar">tempting the
fates</a>. And the odds were there was really no secret about it. Nevertheless
the eloquent fact remained that the sea was there in all its glory and in the
natural course of things somebody had to sail on it though it merely went to
show how people usually contrived to load that sort of onus on to the other
fellow like the hell idea and the lottery and insurance were run on identically
the same lines so that for that very reason if no other lifeboat Sunday was a
highly laudable institution to which the public at large, no matter where living
inland or seaside, having it brought home to them like that should extend
<br><font color="green">{ms, 17}</font>
<br> its gratitude also to the harbourmasters and coastguard service who had to
man the rigging and push off and out
<a name="s16010as" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16010as">whatever the
season</a> when duty called and sometimes had a terrible time of it in the
wintertime not forgetting the Irish lights, Kish and others, rounding which he
once with his daughter had experienced<a target="foot" id="frz0052">&ordm;</a>
some remarkably choppy, not to say, stormy weather.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; There was a fellow sailed with me in the Rover, the old
seadog, himself a rover, proceeded, went ashore and took up a soft job as
gentleman&apos;s valet at six quid a month. Them are his trousers I&apos;ve on
me and he gave me an oilskin and that jackknife. I&apos;m game for that job,
shaving and brushup. I hate roaming about. There&apos;s my son now, Danny, run
off to sea and his mother got him took in a draper&apos;s in Cork where he could be drawing easy money.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What age is he? queried one hearer who, by the way, seen
from the side, bore a distant resemblance to Henry Campbell, the townclerk, away
from the cares of office, unwashed of course and in a seedy getup and a strong suspicion of nosepaint.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Why, the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance,
my son, Danny? He&apos;d be about eighteen now, way I figure it.</p>
<p> He tore open his grey or unclean anyhow shirt with his two hands and
scratched away at his chest on which was to be seen an image tattooed in blue
Chinese ink intended to represent an anchor</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; There was lice in that bunk in Bridgwater, he remarked,
sure as nuts. <a name="s16013bv" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16013bv">I must
get a wash tomorrow</a> or next day. It&apos;s them black lads I objects to. I
hate those buggers. Suck your blood dry, they does.</p>
<p> Seeing they were all looking at his chest he accomodatingly dragged his
shirt more open so that on top of the timehonoured symbol of the mariner&apos;s
hope and rest they had a full view of the figure 16 and a young man&apos;s sideface looking frowningly rather.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Tattoo, the exhibitor explained. That was done when we
were lying becalmed off Odessa in the Black Sea under Captain Dalton, best bloody man ever scuttled
<br><font color="green">{ms, 18}</font>
<br> a ship. Fellow, the name of Antonio, done that. There he is himself, a Greek.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Did it hurt much doing it? one asked the sailor.</p>
<p> <a name="s16003k" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16003k">That worthy</a>,
however, was busily engaged in collecting round the. Someway in his. Squeezing or.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; See here, he said, showing Antonio. There he is cursing
the mate. And there he is now, he added, the same fellow, pulling the skin with
his fingers some special knack evidently, and he laughing at a yarn.</p>
<p> And <a name="un4030r" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030r">in point of
fact</a> the young man named Antonio&apos;s livid face did actually look like
forced smiling and the curious effect excited the unaffected
admiration<a target="foot" id="frz0053">&ordm;</a> of everybody including
Skin-the-Goat who this time stretched over.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ay, ay, sighed the sailor, looking down on his manly
chest. He&apos;s gone too. Ate by sharks after. Ay, ay.</p>
<p> He let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression of before.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Neat bit of work, one said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And what&apos;s the number for? another said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Eaten alive? a third.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ay, ay, sighed again the sailor, more cheerily this time
with some sort of a half smile for a brief duration only in the
direction<a target="foot" id="frz0054">&ordm;</a> of the questioner about the
number. Ate. A Greek he was, and then he added with rather gallowsbird humour
considering his alleged end. As bad as old Antonio for he left me on my ownio.</p>
<p> The face of a streetwalker glazed and haggard under a black straw hat peered
askew round the door of the shelter. Mr Bloom turned away on the moment
<a name="s16011ae" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16011ae">flusterfied</a> but
outwardly calm, and, picking up from the table the pink sheet of the Abbey
street organ which the jarvey, if such he was, had laid aside, he picked it up
and looked at the pink of the paper though why pink. His reason for so doing was
he recognised on the moment round the door the same face he met that afternoon
on Ormond quay, the female, namely, of the lane who knew the lady in the brown
costume does be with you (Mrs B.) and begged the chance of his washing. Also why
washing which seemed rather vague than not,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 19}</font>
<br> your washing. Still candour compelled him to admit he had washed his
wife&apos;s undergarments when soiled in Holles street and women would and did
too a man&apos;s similar garments if they really loved him, that is to say, love
me, love my dirty shirt. Still just then he desired the female&apos;s room more
than her company so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a rude
sign to take herself off. Round the side of the <u>Evening Telegraph</u> he just
caught a
<a name="un5012aa" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5012aa">fleeting</a> glimpse
of her face round the side of the door with a kind of demented glassy grin
viewing with evident amusement the group of gazers round skipper Murphy&apos;s
chest and then there was no more of her.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The gunboat, the keeper said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It beats me, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen, medically I am
speaking, how a wretched creature like that from the Lock hospital reeking with
disease can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober senses,
if he values his health in the least. Unfortunate creature! Of course I suppose
some man is
<a name="un4031bs" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031bs">ultimately</a> responsible for her condition.</p>
<p> Stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders, merely remarking:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; In this country people sell much more than she ever had
and do a roaring trade. Fear not them that sell the body but have not power to
buy the soul. She is a bad merchant. She buys dear and sells cheap.</p>
<p> The elder man, though not by any manner of means a prude, said it was
nothing short of a crying scandal that women of that stamp, a necessary evil,
were not licensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities, a thing, he
could truthfully state, he was a
<a name="s16010at" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16010at">stalwart
advocate</a> of from the very start. Whoever embarked on a policy
<a name="s16013g" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16013g">of the sort</a>, he
said, would confer a lasting boon on everybody concerned.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You as a good catholic, he subjoined, talking of body and
soul, believe in the soul. Or do you mean the
intelligence<a target="foot" id="frz0055">&ordm;</a>, the brainpower as such, as
distinct from any outside object, the table, let us say, that cup. I believe in
that myself because it has been explained by the convolutions<a target="foot" id="frz0056">&ordm;</a>
<br><font color="green">{ms, 20}</font>
<br> of the brain. Otherwise we would never have such inventions as X rays, for instance. Do you?</p>
<p> Thus asked, Stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try to
concentrate and remember before he could say:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; They tell me on the best authority it is a simple
substance and therefore incorruptible<a target="foot" id="frz0057">&ordm;</a>.
It would be immortal, I understand, but for the possibility of its annihilation
by its <a name="un4030j" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030j">First Cause</a>
Who, from all I can hear, is quite capable of adding that to the number of His
other practical jokes, <u>corruptio per se</u> and <u>corruptio per accidens</u>
both being excluded by court etiquette.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the
mystical finesse involved was a bit beyond him.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Simple, he demurred, I shouldn&apos;t think that is the
proper word. Of course, I grant you to concede a point, you do knock across a
simple soul once in a while. But what I am anxious to arrive at is it is one
thing for instance to invent those rays R&ouml;ntgen did or the telescope like
Edison, though I believe it was before his time Galileo was the man, I mean, the
same applies to the laws, for example, of a far reaching natural phenomenon such
as electricity but it&apos;s a horse of quite another colour to say you believe
in the existence of a supernatural God.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O that, Stephen expostulated, has been proved
conclusively by several of the bestknown passages in Holy Writ, apart from circumstantial evidence.</p>
<p> On this knotty point however the views of the pair, poles apart as they were
both in schooling and everything else with the marked difference in their respective ages, clashed.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Has been? the more experienced of the two objected,
sticking to his original point with a smile of unbelief. I&apos;m not so sure
about that. That&apos;s a matter for everyman&apos;s opinion and
<a name="un4030cj" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030cj">I beg to differ</a>
with you there. Those bits were put in by monks most probably or it&apos;s a big
question who precisely wrote them like <u>Hamlet</u> and Bacon, as,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 21}</font>
<br> you who know your Shakespeare infinitely better than I, of course I
needn&apos;t tell you. Can&apos;t you drink that coffee,
<a name="s16012l" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16012l">by the way</a>? Let me
stir it. And take a piece of that bun. It&apos;s like one of our skipper&apos;s
bricks disguised. Still no-one can give what he hasn&apos;t got. Try a bit.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Couldn&apos;t, Stephen replied.</p>
<p> Faultfinding being a proverbially bad hat Mr Bloom thought well to stir or
try to the clotted sugar from the bottom of Stephen&apos;s cup and reflected
with something approaching acrimony on the Coffee Palace and its temperance (and
lucrative) work. To be sure it did a world of good, shelters such as the present
one they were in run on teetotal lines for vagrants at night,
concerts<a target="foot" id="frz0058">&ordm;</a>, dramatic evenings and useful
lectures by <a name="s16004w" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16004w">qualified
men</a> for the lower orders. On the other hand he had a distinct recollection
they paid his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy, a very modest remuneration indeed for
her pianoplaying<a target="foot" id="frz0059">&ordm;</a>. The idea, he was
strongly inclined to believe, was to do good and net a profit there being no
competition to speak of. Sulphate of copper poison SO<sub><small>4</small></sub>
or something in some dried peas he remembered reading of in a cheap eatinghouse
somewhere but he couldn&apos;t remember when it was or where. Anyhow inspection,
medical inspection, of all eatables seemed to him more than ever necessary.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Have a shot at it now, he ventured to say of the coffee after being stirred.</p>
<p> Thus prevailed on to at any rate taste it Stephen lifted the heavy mug from
the brown puddle it clopped out of it when taken up by the handle and took a sip.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Still it&apos;s solid food, his
<a name="s16013ab" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16013ab">good genius</a>
urged, I&apos;m a stickler for solid food, his one and only reason being not
gormandising<a target="foot" id="frz0060">&ordm;</a> but regular meals as the
<u>sine qua non</u> for anykind of proper work, mental or manual. You ought to
eat more solid food. You would feel a different man.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Liquids I can eat, Stephen said. But O, oblige me by
taking away that knife. I can&apos;t look at the point of it. It reminds me of Roman history</p>
<p> Mr Bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the
incriminated<a target="foot" id="frz0061">&ordm;</a> article, a blunt hornhandled
<br><font color="green">{ms, 22}</font>
<br> ordinary knife with nothing very Roman or antique in it to the eye,
observing that the point was the least conspicuous point about it.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Our mutual friend&apos;s stories are like
himself<a target="foot" id="frz0062">&ordm;</a>, Mr Bloom apropos of knives
remarked to Stephen <u>sotto voce</u>. Do you think they are genuine? He could
spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and lie like old boots. Look at him.</p>
<p> Yet still though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air life was full of
a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it was quite within
the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire fabrication though at first
blush there was not much inherent probability in all he said being
<a name="un4037cl" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4037cl">strictly accurate</a>.</p>
<p> He had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him. Though
a wellpreserved man, if a trifle prone to baldness, there was something
spurious<a target="foot" id="frz0063">&ordm;</a> in the cut of his jib that
suggested a jail delivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to
associate such a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill fraternity.
He might even have done for his man supposing it was his own case he told, as
people often did about others, namely, that he killed him himself. On the other
hand he might be only bluffing, a pardonable weakness because meeting mugs,
Dublin residents, like those jarvies
waiting<a target="foot" id="frz0064">&ordm;</a> news from abroad would tempt any
ancient mariner to draw the long bow about the schooner <u>Hesperus</u> and
etcetera. And when all was said and done the lies a fellow told about himself
couldn&apos;t probably hold a candle to the whoppers other fellows told about him.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Mind you, I&apos;m not saying that it&apos;s all a pure
invention, he resumed. Analogous scenes are occasionally, if not often, met
with. Giants, though that is
<a name="un5012ac" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5012ac">rather a far
cry</a>, you see once in a way, Marcella the midget queen. In those waxworks in
Henry street I myself saw some Aztecs, as they are called, sitting bowlegged.
They couldn&apos;t straighten their legs because the muscles here, you see, he
proceeded, indicating on his companion the brief outline of
<br><font color="green">{ms, 23}</font>
<br> the sinews <a name="s16006f" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16006f">or
whatever you like to call them</a> behind the right knee, were utterly powerless
from sitting that way so long cramped up, being adored as gods. There&apos;s an example again of simple souls.</p>
<p> However reverting to friend Sinbad and his horrifying adventures there was
nothing intrinsically incompatible<a target="foot" id="frz0065">&ordm;</a> about
it, he conceded. On the contrary that stab in the back touch was quite typical
of those italianos though candidly he was free to admit those icecream and
fishfriers and so forth over in little Italy there near the Coombe were sober
thrifty hardworking fellows except perhaps a bit too given to pothunting the
harmless necessary cat of others at night so as to have a good old succulent
meal with garlic <u>de rigueur</u> off him or her next day on the quiet and, he added, on the cheap.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Spaniards, for instance, he continued, passionate
impetuous temperaments like that are given to taking the law into their own
hands and give you your quietus doublequick with a those poignards they carry in
the abdomen. It comes from the great heat, climate generally. My wife is, so to
speak, Spanish, half that is. She has the Spanish type. Quite dark, regular
brunette, black. I for one certainly believe climate accounts for character.
That&apos;s why I asked you if you wrote poetry in Italian.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The temperaments at the door, Stephen interposed with,
were very passionate about five shillings. Roberto ruba roba sua.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Quite so, Mr Bloom agreed.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Then, Stephen said staring and rambling on to himself or
some unknown listener somewhere, we have the impetuosity of Dante and the
isoceles triangle miss Portinari he fell in love with and Leonardo and san Tommaso Mastino.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It&apos;s in the blood, Mr Bloom acceded at once. All are
washed in the blood of the sun. Coincidence I just happened to be in the Kildare
street museum today, shortly prior to our meeting if I can so call it, and I was
just looking at those antique statues there. The splendid proportions of hips,

<br> yes, pretty in a way you find but I&apos;m talking about the female form.
Besides they have so little taste in dress, most of them. Rumpled stockings, it
may be, possibly is, a foible of mine but still it&apos;s a thing I simply hate to see.</p>
<p> Interest, however, was beginning to flag somewhat all round and the others
got on to talking about accidents at sea, ships lost in a fog, collisions with
icebergs, all that sort of thing.
<a name="s16022bi" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16022bi">The sailor of course
had his own say to say.</a> He had doubled the cape a few odd times and
weathered a monsoon, a kind of wind, in the China seas and through all those
perils of the deep there was one thing, he declared, stood to him or words to
that effect, a pious medal he had that saved him.</p>
<p> So then after that they drifted on to the wreck
of<a target="foot" id="frz0066">&ordm;</a> Daunt&apos;s rock, wreck of the
Norwegian barque nobody could think of her name for the moment till the jarvey
who had really quite a look of Henry Campbell remembered it <u>Palme</u> on
Booterstown strand. That was the talk of the town that year, breakers running
over her and crowds and crowds on the shore petrified with horror. Then someone
said something the case of the s.s. <u>Lady Cairns</u> of Swansea run into by
the <u>Mona</u> which was on an opposite tack and lost with all hands. No aid
was given. Her master, the <u>Mona</u>&apos;s, said he was
afraid<a target="foot" id="frz0067">&ordm;</a> his collision bulkhead would give
way. She had no water, it appears, in her hold.</p>
<p> At this stage an incident happened. It having become necessary for him to
unfurl a reef the sailor vacated his seat.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Let me cross your bows mate, he said to his neighbour who
was just gently dropping off into a doze.</p>
<p> He walked heavily, slowly to the door, stepped heavily down the one step
there was out of the shelter and bore due left with a dumpy kind of a gait.
While he was in the act of getting his bearings Mr Bloom who noticed when he
stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ship&apos;s rum one sticking one
out of each pocket for the private consumption of his burning interior, saw him
take one out and uncork it or unscrew and take a good old swig out of it on the strict q.t. The irrepressible
<br><font color="green">{ms, 25}</font>
<br> Bloom who also had a shrewd suspicion he went out on a manoeuvre after the
female attraction who however had disappeared to all intents and purposes, could
by straining just perceive him, when duly refreshed, gaping up at the piers and
girders of the Loop line rather out of his depth as of course it was all
radically altered since his last visit and greatly improved. Some person or
persons invisible directed him to the urinal erected by the cleansing committee
all over the place for the purpose but after a brief space of time during which
silence reigned supreme the sailor eased himself closer at hand, the noise of
his bilgewater some little time subsequently splashing on the ground where it
apparently awoke a horse of the cabrank. A hoof scooped anyway for new foothold
after sleep and harness jingled. Slightly disturbed in his sentrybox by the
brazier of live coke the watcher of the
corporation<a target="foot" id="frz0068">&ordm;</a> who, though now broken down
and <a name="s16004v" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16004v">fast breaking
up</a>, was none other in reality than the Gumley aforesaid given the
temporary<a target="foot" id="frz0069">&ordm;</a> job by Pat Tobin in all human
probability from
<a name="s16001ao" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001ao">dictates of
humanity</a> knowing him before shifted about and shuffled in his box before
composing his limbs again in to the arms of Morpheus, a
<a name="s16013m" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16013m">truly amazing</a>
piece of hard lines <a name="s16001u" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001u">in
its most virulent form</a> on a fellow most
<a name="s16006aq" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16006aq">respectably
connected</a> and
<a name="s16013al" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16013al">familiarised
with</a> decent home comforts all his life. And there he was at the end of his
tether after having often
<a name="s16005bh" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16005bh">painted the town
tolerably pink</a> without
<a name="s16001h" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001h">a penny to his
name</a>. <a name="s16002as" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002as">He
drank</a> needless to be told and

<a name="s16008h" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16008h">&mdash; a big if,
however,</a> he had
<a name="un4031u" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031u">contrived to</a> cure himself of his partiality</p>
<p> All meantime were loudly lamenting the falling off in Irish shipping,
coastwise and foreign as well which was part and parcel of the same thing. A
Palgrave Murphy boat was put off the ways at Alexandra basin, the only
<br><font color="green">{ms, 26}</font>
<br> launch<a target="foot" id="frz0070">&ordm;</a> that year. Right enough the
harbours were there only no ships ever called</p>
<p> There were wrecks and wrecks, the keeper said. What he wanted to ascertain
was why that ship ran bang against the only rock in Galway bay when the Galway
harbour scheme was mooted, eh? Ask the then captain, he advised them, how much
palmoil the British government gave him for that day&apos;s work, Captain John Lever of the Lever Line.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Am I right, skipper? he queried of the sailor, now
returning <a name="s16011e" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16011e">after
his</a> private potation and the rest of his
<a name="s16011e" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16011e">exertions</a>.</p>
<p> <a name="s16003k" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16003k">That worthy</a>
picking up the scent of the fagend of the song or words growled in wouldbe music
but with great vim some kind of chanty or other in seconds or thirds. Mr
Bloom&apos;s sharp ears heard him then expectorate the plug probably which it
was so that he must have lodged it for the time being in his fist while he did
the drinking and making water jobs and found it a bit sour after. Anyhow in he
rolled, <a name="s16012f" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16012f">boisterously</a> trolling:</p>
<p class="pdiset">&mdash; <u>The biscuits was as hard as brass
<br> And the beef as salt as Lot&apos;s wife arse.
<br> O, Johnny Lever!
<br> Johnny Lever, O!</u></p>
<p> After which
<a name="un5012aj" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5012aj">effusion</a> he
<a name="s16010d" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16010d">arrived on the
scene</a> and regaining his seat he
<a name="s16013bd" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16013bd">sank rather than
sat</a> heavily on the form provided. Skin the Goat, assuming he was he,
evidently with an axe to grind, was airing his grievances in a
<a name="s16009ap" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16009ap">forcible-feeble
philippic</a> anent the natural resources of Ireland or something of that sort
which he described in his dissertation as the richest country on the face of
God&apos;s earth, far and away superior to England, with coal in large
quantities, six million pounds worth of pork exported every year, ten millions
between butter and eggs and all the riches drained out of it by England levying
taxes on the poor people that paid through the nose always and gobbling up the
best meat in the market and a lot more surplus steam in the same vein. Their
conversation accordingly became general and all agreed that that was a fact. You
could grow any mortal thing in Irish soil, he stated,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 27}</font>
<br> and there was colonel Everard down there in Navan growing tobacco. Where
would you find anywhere the like of Irish bacon. But a day of reckoning, he
stated with no uncertain voice, thoroughly
<a name="s16010ba" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16010ba">monopolising</a><a target="foot" id="frz0071">&ordm;</a>
all the conversation, was in store for mighty England, despite her power of pelf
on account of her crimes. There would be a fall and the greatest fall in
history. The Germans and the Japs were going to have their little look in, he
affirmed. The Boers were the beginning of the end. Brummagem England was
toppling already and her downfall would be Ireland, her Achilles heel, which he
explained to them about the vulnerable point of Achilles, the hero, a point his
auditors at once seized as he showed the tendon on his boot.
<a name="s16018b" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16018b">His advice to every
Irishman was: stay in the land of your birth and work for Ireland and live for
Ireland.</a> Ireland, Parnell said, could not spare a single one of her sons.</p>
<p> Silence all round
<a name="s16007bb" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16007bb">marked the
termination</a> of his
<a name="s16007q" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16007q">finale</a>. The sailor
heard these lurid tidings, undismayed.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Take a bit of doing, boss, he retaliated.</p>
<p> To which cold douche referring to downfall and so on the keeper concurred
but nevertheless held to his main view.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Who&apos;s the best troops in the army? the grizzled old
veteran irately interrogated. And the best jumpers and racers? And the best
admirals and generals we&apos;ve got? Tell me that.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The Irish, for choice, retorted the cabby like Campbell.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That&apos;s right, the old tarpaulin corroborated. The
Irish catholic peasant. He&apos;s the backbone of our empire. You know Jem Mullins?</p>
<p> While allowing him his individual opinions as everyman the keeper added he
cared nothing for any empire, ours or his, and considered no Irishman worthy of
his salt that served it. Then they began to have a few irascible words when it
waxed hotter, both, needless to say, appealing to the listeners who followed the
<a name="s16007e" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16007e">passage of arms</a>
with interest so long as they didn&apos;t indulge in recriminations and
<br><font color="green">{ms, 28}</font>
<br> come to blows.</p>
<p> From inside information Mr Bloom was rather inclined to poohpooh the
suggestion for, pending that
consummation<a target="foot" id="frz0072">&ordm;</a> devoutly to be or not to be
wished for, he was fully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the
channel, unless they were bigger fools than he took them for, rather concealed
their strength than the opposite. It was quite on a par with the quixotic idea
that in a hundred million years the coal seam of the sister island would be
played out and as a host of contingencies might occur
<a name="s16010bc" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16010bc">ere then</a> it was
highly advisable in the interim to try to
<a name="s16009bf" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16009bf">make the most of
both countries</a> even though
<a name="s16007as" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16007as">poles apart</a>.
Another little point, the amours of
<a name="s16017l" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16017l">whores and
chummies</a> reminded him Irish soldiers had as often fought for England as
against her, more so, in fact. And now, why? So the scene between the pair of
them, the licensee of the place rumoured to be or have been Fitzharris, the
famous invincible, and the other, obviously bogus
<a name="s16007u" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16007u">reminded him
forcibly</a> of the confidence trick, supposing, that is, it was prearranged as
the looker-on, a student of the human soul if anything, the others seeing least
of the game. And as for the
<a name="s16007o" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16007o">lessee</a> or keeper,
who probably wasn&apos;t the other person at all, he, (B.) couldn&apos;t help
feeling and most properly it was better to give people like that the goby and
refuse to have anything to do with them
<a name="s16007bc" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16007bc">in private life</a>
and their felonsetting, there always being the offchance of a Dannyman turning
Queen&apos;s evidence or King&apos;s now like Denis Carey, an idea he utterly
repudiated. Quite apart from that he disliked those careers of wrongdoing and
crime on principle. Yet he certainly did feel and no denying it a certain kind
of admiration for a man who had actually brandished a knife, cold steel, with
the courage of his political<a target="foot" id="frz0073">&ordm;</a> convictions
on all fours with those love vendettas of the south, have her or swing for her,
until it just struck him that, Fitz, nicknamed Skin-the, merely drove the car
for the actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not, if he was reliably
informed, actually party to the ambush which,
<a name="un4030r" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030r">in point of fact</a>,
was the plea some <a name="s16006g" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16006g">legal
<br><font color="green">{ms, 29}</font>
<br> luminary</a> saved his skin on. In any case that was very ancient history
by now and as for our friend, the pseudo Skin the etcetera he had
<a name="s16007ad" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16007ad">transparently</a>
outlived his welcome. He ought to have either died naturally or on the scaffold
high. Like actresses, always farewell positively last performance then come up
smiling again.
<a name="s16016n" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16016n">Generous to a
fault</a> of course,
<a name="s16013bn" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16013bn">temperamental</a>,
no economising or <a name="s16013g" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16013g">any
idea of the sort</a>, always snapping at the
<a name="s16014f" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16014f">bone for the
shadow</a> so similarly he had a very shrewd suspicion that Mr Johnny Lever
<a name="s16014r" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16014r">got rid of some
&pound;.s.d. round the docks in the <u>Old Ireland</u> tavern</a>, come back to
Erin and so on. Then as for the other he had heard not so long before the same
identical lingo as he told Stephen how he simply but effectually silenced the offender</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He took umbrage at something or other, that muchinjured
person declared, I let slip. He called me a jew and in a heated fashion
offensively. So I without deviating from plain facts in the leasts told him his
God, I mean Christ, was a jew too and all his family like me though in really
I&apos;m not. That was one for him. A soft answer turns away wrath. He
hadn&apos;t a word to say for himself, as everyone saw. Am I not right?</p>
<p> He turned a long you are wrong gaze on Stephen of timorous dark pride at the
soft impeachment with a glance also of entreaty.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Ex quibus</u>, Stephen mumbled
<a name="s16012m" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16012m">in a noncommital
accent</a>, their two or four eyes conversing, <u>Christus</u> or Bloom his name
is or after all any other, <u>secundum carnem</u>.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Of course, Mr B. proceeded to stipulate, you must look at
both sides of the question. It is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to
right and wrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is, though
every country, they say, our own distressful included, has the government it
deserves. But with a little goodwill all round. It&apos;s
<a name="s16007ac" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16007ac">all very fine</a> to
boast of mutual superiority but what about mutual equality. I resent violence
and intolerance in any shape or form. It never reaches anything or stops
anything. A revolution must come on the instalments plan. It&apos;s a patent
absurdity to hate people because they live round the corner and speak another
vernacular, in the next house so to speak.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Memorable Bloody Bridge battle, Stephen assented, between
Skinner&apos;s alley and Ormond market.</p>
<p> Yes, Mr Bloom thoroughly agreed, that was overwhelmingly right. And the
whole world was full <a name="s16014ba" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16014ba">of that sort of
<br><font color="green">{ms, 30}</font>
<br> sort of thing</a>.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You just took the words out of my mouth, he said. A
hocuspocus of conflicting evidence that
<a name="s16006as" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16006as">candidly</a> you couldn&apos;t remotely&nbsp;&hellip;.</p>
<p> All those wretched quarrels, in his humble opinion, stirring up bad blood,
bump of combativeness or gland of some kind, erroneously supposed to be about a
punctilio of honour and a flag, were very largely a question of the money
<a name="s16012t" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16012t">question</a> which was
at the back of everything greed and jealousy, people never knowing when to stop.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; They accuse, remarked he audibly.</p>
<p> He turned away from the others who probably and spoke nearer to, so as the others in case they.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Jews, he softly imparted in an aside in Stephen&apos;s
ear, are accused of ruining.
<a name="s16010ap" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16010ap">Not a vestige of
truth</a> in it, <a name="s16001r" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001r">I can
safely say</a>. History,

<a name="s16004h" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16004h">proved to be</a> so. I
don&apos;t want to indulge in any because you know
<a name="s16005bm" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16005bm">the standard works
on the subject</a> and then orthodox as you are. But in the economic, not
<a name="s16014ap" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16014ap">touching</a>
religion, domain the priest spells poverty. Spain again, you saw in the war,
compared with America. Turks. It&apos;s in the dogma. Because if they
didn&apos;t believe they&apos;d go straight to heaven when they died they&apos;d
try to live better, at least so I think. That&apos;s the juggle on which the
p.p&apos;s raise the wind on false pretences. I&apos;m, he resumed with dramatic
force, as good an Irishman as that rude person I told you about at the outset
and I want to see everyone, concluded he, all creeds and classes having a
comfortable income, something in the neighbourhood of &pound;300 per annum.
That&apos;s the vital issue at stake and it&apos;s feasible and would be
provocative of friendlier intercourse between man and man. At least, that&apos;s
my idea for what it&apos;s worth. I call that patriotism. <u>Ubi patria</u>, as
we learned a smattering of in our classical days, <u>vita bene</u>. Where you
can live well, the sense is, if you work.</p>
<p> Over his untastable apology for a cup of coffee, listening to this synopsis of things in general, Stephen stared
<br><font color="green">{ms, 31}</font>
<br> at nothing in particular. He could hear, of course, all kinds of words
changing colour like those crabs about Ringsend in the morning burrowing quickly
into all colours of different sorts of the same sand where they had a home
somewhere beneath or seemed to. Then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or
didn&apos;t say the words the voice he heard said, if you work.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Count me out, he managed to remark, meaning work.</p>
<p> The eyes were surprised at this observation because as he, the person who
owned them pro. tem. observed or rather his voice speaking did, all must work, have to, together.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I mean, of course, the other hastened to affirm, work in
the widest possible sense. Also literary labour not merely for the kudos of the
thing. Writing for the newspapers which is the readiest channel nowadays.
That&apos;s work too. Important work. After all, from the little I know of you,
after all the money expended on your education you are entitled to recoup
yourself and command your price. You have every bit as much right to live by
your pen in pursuit of your philosophy as the peasant has. What? You both belong
to Ireland, the brain and the brawn. Each is equally important.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You suspect, Stephen retorted with a sort of laugh, that
I may be important because I belong to Ireland.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I would go a step farther, Mr Bloom insinuated.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But I suspect, Stephen interrupted, that Ireland must be important because it belongs to me.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What belongs, queried Mr Bloom bending. Excuse me.
Unfortunately, I didn&apos;t catch the latter portion. What was it you&nbsp;&hellip;.?</p>
<p> Stephen, patently crosstempered, repeated and shoved aside his mug of coffee
<a name="s16006f" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16006f">or whatever you like
to call it</a> none too politely, adding:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; We can&apos;t change the country. Let us change the subject.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 32}</font> </p>
<p> At this pertinent suggestion Mr Bloom, to change the subject looked down but
in a quandary, not knowing exactly what construction to put on belongs to. The
rebuke of some kind was clearer than the other part. Needless to say the fumes
of his recent orgy spoke then in a curious bitter way foreign
<a name="s16015ac" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16015ac">to his sober
state</a>. Probably the homelife to which Mr B attached the utmost importance
had not been all that was needful or he hadn&apos;t met the right sort of
people. With a touch of fear for the young man beside him whom he furtively
scrutinised with an air of some consternation remembering he had just come back
from Paris, failing to throw much light on the subject, however, he brought to
mind instances of cultured fellows a bit too precious that promised so
brilliantly nipped in the bud of premature decay and nobody to blame but
themselves. For instance there was the case of O&apos;Callaghan the halfcrazy
faddist, respectably connected though of inadequate means, with his mad vagaries
among whose other gay doings he was in the habit of ostentatiously sporting in
public a suit of brown paper (a fact). And then the usual denouement he got
<a name="s16003aa" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16003aa">landed</a> into hot
water and had to be spirited away by a few friends after a strong hint from John
Mallon of Lower Castle Yard, under section two of the criminal law amendment
act, certain names being handed in but not divulged
<a name="s16010e" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16010e">for reasons which will
occur to anyone</a>. Putting

turned a deaf ear to</a>, Antonio and so forth jockeys and esthetes and the
tattoo which was all the go in the seventies or thereabouts even in the house of
lords because <a name="s16006bi" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16006bi">early
in life</a> the then heir apparent he reflected about the errors of notorieties

under their <a name="s16006p" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16006p">veneer</a>
in a way scarcely intended by nature a thing Mrs Grundy was terribly down on though not for the reason they
<br><font color="green">{ms, 33}</font>
<br> thought they were probably whatever it was except women chiefly who were
always fiddling more or less at one another it being largely a matter of dress
and all the rest of it ladies who like distinctive underclothing should and
every welltailored man must trying to make the gap wider between them by

more of a filip to acts of impropriety between the two she unbuttoned his and
then he untied her mind the pin whereas savages at ninety degrees in the shade
not <a name="un4055ak" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4055ak">caring a
particular</a>. However,

<p class="pdi">&mdash; This morning (Hynes put it in of course) the remains of
the late Mr Patrick Dignam were removed from his residence. no 9 Newbridge
Avenue, Sandymount, for interment in Glasnevin. The deceased gentleman was a
most popular and genial personality in city life and his demise after a brief
illness came as a great shock to citizens of all classes by whom he is deeply
regretted. The obsequies, at which many friends of the deceased were present
were carried out by (certainly Hynes wrote it with a nudge from Corny) Messrs
H.J. O&apos;Neill and Son, 164 North Strand Road. The mourners included: Patk.

<p> One morning you would open the paper, the cabman affirmed, and read: Return
of Parnell. He bet them what they liked. A Dublin fusilier was in that shelter
one night and said he saw him in South Africa. Pride it was killed him. He ought
to have done away with himself or lain low for a time after committee room no 15
then they would have gone down on their marrowbones to him to come back. Dead he wasn&apos;t. The coffin they
<br><font color="green">{ms, 36}</font>
<br> brought<a target="foot" id="frz0076">&ordm;</a> over was full of stones. He
changed his name to De Wet, the Boer general. He made a mistake to fight the priests. And so forth and so on.</p>
<p> All the same Bloom was rather surprised at their memories for in nine cases
out of ten it was a case of tarbarrels and
<a name="s16009av" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16009av">not singly but in
their thousands</a> and then complete oblivion because it was
<a name="un4031aj" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031aj">twenty odd
years</a>. Highly unlikely of course there was even a shadow of truth in the
stones and, <a name="s16010bn" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16010bn">even
supposing</a>, he thought a return highly inadvisable, all things considered.
Something evidently riled them in his death. Either
<a name="s16009bg" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16009bg">he petered out</a>
too tamely of pneumonia or whatever it
<a name="s16004e" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16004e">transpired</a> he
<a name="s16001bl" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001bl">owed his death</a>
to or the job was taken out of their hands. Of course nobody being
<a name="s16009ad" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16009ad">acquainted with his
movements</a> even before there was absolutely
<a name="s16001bo" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001bo">no clue to his
whereabouts</a> so the
<a name="s16009an" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16009an">remark which
emanated from</a> friend cabby might be within the bounds of possibility.
Naturally then it would
<a name="s16007r" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16007r">prey on his mind</a>
as a born <a name="s16009f" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16009f">leader of
men</a> which undoubtedly he was and
<a name="s16010r" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16010r">a commanding
figure</a> whereas Messrs So and So who ruled the roost after their
<a name="s16001cm" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001cm">redeeming
features</a> were very few and far between.
<a name="s16001am" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001am">It certainly pointed
a moral</a>, <a name="s16001bv" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001bv">the
idol with feet of clay</a>, and then seventytwo of his trusty henchmen rounding
on him with mutual mudslinging. And the identical same with murderers. You had
to come back. That haunting sense kind of drew you. To show the understudy in
the <a name="un4030al" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030al">title role</a>

once</a> when they broke up the type in <u>United Ireland</u>, a privilege he
keenly appreciated, and,
<a name="un4030r" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030r">in point of fact</a>,
handed him his silk hat when it was knocked off and he said thank you excited as
he undoubtedly was under his frigid exterior: what&apos;s bred in the bone.
Still as regards return. You were a lucky dog if they didn&apos;t set the
terrier at you. Then a lot of shillyshally usually followed, Tom for and Dick
and Harry against. And then, number one, you came up against the man in
possession and had to produce your credentials like
