it seemed to him from a motive of curiosity, pure and simple, was whether it was
the traffic that created the route or viveversa, the two sides, in fact. He
turned back the other side of the card, picture, and passed it along to Stephen.</p>

recollected vividly just when the

took place</a> <a name="s16004k" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16004k">as well

<a name="s16026av" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16026av">Have you seen the rock of Gibraltar? Mr Bloom asked.</a></p>
<p> The sailor grimaced, chewing,

read one way or the other be yes, ay or no</a>.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ah, you&apos;ve touched there too, Europa point se habla

possibly by some reminiscences. But he failed to do so, simply letting spirt a
jet of spew into the sawdust, and shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What year would that be about? Mr Bloom said. Can you remember the boats?</p>
<p> The sailor munched freshly awhile without answering.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I&apos;m tired of all them rocks in the sea, he said, and
boats &amp; ships. Salt junk all the time.</p>
<p> Tired
<a name="s16003aj" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16003aj">seemingly</a>, he
ceased. His questioner perceiving that he was

<a name="s16005h" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16005h">wily old customer</a>,
fell to reflecting on the enormous dimensions of the water about the globe,
<a name="un5012o" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5012o">suffice it to say</a>
that it covered
<a name="s16017bg" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16017bg">fully three fourths
of it</a>, and he fully realised what it meant therefore to
<a name="s16017bj" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16017bj">rule the waves</a>.
<a name="un4030di" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030di">On more than one

it and it at him</a>
<a name="un5012r" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5012r">dreaming of fresh

<a name="s16021dj" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16021dj">Possibly he had
tried to find out the secret</a>

<a name="un4031bd" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031bd">the odds were</a>
there was really no secret about it. Nevertheless the eloquent
<a name="un4031cn" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031cn">fact remained</a>
that the sea was there in all its glory and in the natural course somebody had
to sail on it though

<a name="s16001bp" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001bp">brought home to

<p class="pdi">&mdash; There was a fellow sailed with me in the Rover, the old
seadog, himself a rover, proceeded, went ashore and took up a safe

<p class="pdi">&mdash; Why, the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance,
my son, he&apos;d be about eighteen <a name="un4031b" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031b">way I figure it</a>.</p>
<p> He tore open his grey shirt with his two hands and scratched away at his
chest on which was to be seen
<a name="s16026ac" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16026ac">an image
tattooed</a> in blue Chinese ink intended to represent an anchor.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; There was lice in that bunk in Bridgwater, he remarked,
sure as nuts. I must get a bath tomorrow or next day. It&apos;s them black lads
I objects to. I hate those buggers. Suck your blood dry, they does.</p>
<p> Seeing they were all looking at his chest he accomodatingly dragged his
shirt more open so that on top of the timehonoured symbol of the mariner&apos;s
hope and rest they <a name="un5012u" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5012u">had
a full view of</a> the figures 16 and a young man&apos;s profile looking frowningly rather.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Tattoo, the exhibitor explained. That was done when we
were lying becalmed off Odessa in the Black sea under Captain Dalton by a
fellow, a Greek, the name of Antonio. There he is himself.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Did it hurt much doing it? one asked the sailor.</p>
<p> <a name="s16003k" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16003k">That worthy</a>,

<p> The young man named Antonio&apos;s livid face did in fact look like forced
smiling and the curious effect excited the general &amp; unaffected admiration
of all, including the keeper who stretched over.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;
<a name="s15020af" href="../../FF/unbs/s15all.htm#s15020af">Ay, ay, the sailor
sighed, looking down on his chest. He&apos;s gone too. Ate by sharks after. Ay, ay.</a></p>
<p> He let go off<a target="foot" id="frz0009">&ordm;</a> the skin so that the
profile resumed its normal expression.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Neat bit of work, one said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And what&apos;s the number for? another said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Eaten alive? a third.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ay, ay, the sailor sighed again, more cheerfully this
time with a kind of a smile for a
<a name="un5012v" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5012v">brief duration</a> in
the direction of the last questioner. Ate. A Greek he was, and he added with a
touch of grim humour. As bad as old Antonio he left me on my ownio.</p>
<p> The face of a
<a name="s16019d" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16019d">streetwalker</a>
glazed and haggard under a black straw hat peered askew
<a name="s16019d" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16019d">round the door</a> of
the shelter. Mr Bloom turned away quickly and, picking up from the table the
pink sheet of the Abbey street organ which the carman, if such he was, had laid
by. Mr Bloom had recognised the face which came on him as a surprise that
afternoon on Ormond Quay,
<a name="s16004l" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16004l">the female</a>, i.e.
of the lane who had
<a name="s16026aw" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16026aw">begged the chance of
his washing</a> and knew the lady in the brown costume. The washing idea seemed
rather vague than not, your washing, still he had washed Molly&apos;s soiled in
Holles street and women did if they liked really the man his dirty shirts love
me, love my shirt. Still just then he desired her room more than her company so
it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a rude sign to take herself
off. <a name="s16004l" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16004l">The
female&apos;s</a> face with demented amusement viewed the group of gazers round
a man&apos;s painted chest then slowly after a
<a name="un5012aa" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5012aa">fleeting glimpse</a>
was withdrawn with a glassy grin of evident
<a name="s16005br" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16005br">amusement at his expense</a>.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The <a name="s15061cd" href="../../FF/unbs/s15all.htm#s15061cd">gunboat</a>, the carman said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It beats me, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen, medically I am
speaking, how a wretched creature like that from the Lock hospital reeking with
disease can be
<a name="un4030bg" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030bg">barefaced</a> enough
to solicit or how any man in his sober senses
<br><font color="green">{ms, 6}</font>
<br> if he values his health at all. Unfortunate creature! Of course I suppose
some man is responsible for her condition.</p>
<p> Stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; In this country people sell much more than she ever had
and do a roaring trade. Fear not them that sell the body but have not power to
buy the soul. She is a bad merchant. She buys dear and sells cheap.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom, though
<a name="un4036ap" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4036ap">not by any manner of
means</a> <a name="un4030dv" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030dv">a
prude</a>, said it was nothing short of a crying scandal that women of that
stamp, a necessary evil, were not licensed and medically inspected by
<a name="un4030cq" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030cq">the proper
authorities</a> a thing
<a name="s16001x" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001x">he could truthfully
state</a> he was a stalwart advocate of from the very start. Whoever embarked on
a policy of the sort, he said, would confer a lasting
<a name="un6015ah" href="../../FF/unbs/un6all.htm#un6015ah">boon</a> on the race.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You as a good catholic, he subjoined to Stephen, believe
in the soul. Or do you mean the intelligence, the brainpower as such
<a name="s16002aj" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002aj">as distinct
from</a>, let us say, any object, the table, the cup of coffee. I believe in
that myself because
<a name="un4030an" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030an">it has been
explained</a>
<a name="un4030ao" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030ao">materially</a>.
Otherwise we would never have such inventions as X rays, for instance.</p>
<p> Stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory
<a name="s16002av" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002av">to try &amp;
concentrate</a> &amp; to remember before he could say:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; They tell me
<a name="s16024c" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16024c">on the best
authority</a> that it is a simple substance and therefore incorruptible. It
would be immortal, I understand, but for the possibility of its annihilation who
is quite capable, from all I can hear, of adding that to his other feats
corruptio per se and corruptio per accidens both being excluded by etiquette.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom thoroughly<a target="foot" id="frz0010">&ordm;</a> in the general
drift of this though the finesse was <a name="s16016p" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16016p">quite beyond him</a>.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Simple, Mr Bloom demurred, I shouldn&apos;t think that is
the right word for it. Of course I grant you, to concede a point, there are
simple souls too. But what I am anxious to arrive at is, it is one thing for
instance to invent those R&ouml;ntgen rays they call them or the telescope and
<a name="s16002ac" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002ac">the same applies
to</a> the laws of a natural phenomenon so
<a name="s16003af" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16003af">farreaching</a> as
electricity like Edison but a horse of quite another colour to believe in
<a name="s15009ap" href="../../FF/unbs/s15all.htm#s15009ap">the existence of a God.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, That, Stephen expostulated, has been proved
conclusively by several passages from Holy Writ</a>, apart from
<a name="s16017ca" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16017ca">circumstantial evidence</a>.</p>
<p> On this knotty point however the
<a name="s16012r" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16012r">opinions</a> of the
pair, <a name="s16007as" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16007as">poles
apart</a> as they were, both in
<a name="s16011m" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16011m">schooling</a> and
everything else, with
<a name="s16001cg" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001cg">a marked difference
in their</a> respective
<a name="s16001cg" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001cg">ages</a>,
<a name="s16012r" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16012r">clashed</a>.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Has been? objected Mr Bloom
<a name="s16002c" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002c">sticking to his
original point</a> with a smile of unbelief. I&apos;m not so sure about that.
That&apos;s a matter of everyman&apos;s opinion and
<a name="un4030cj" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030cj">I beg to differ</a>
with you there. Those bits were
<a name="s16021ab" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16021ab">put in by monks</a>
&amp; it&apos;s a big question
<a name="s16021ac" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16021ac">who precisely wrote
them like <u>Hamlet</u></a> as, of course, you
<a name="s16002ak" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002ak">know your
Shakespeare</a> infinitely better than I. Can&apos;t you drink that coffee? Let
me stir it. Take a piece of that bun. It&apos;s
<br><font color="green">{ms, 7}</font>
<br> as hard as one of our skipper&apos;s bricks. Still,
<a name="s16018q" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16018q">no-one can give what he hasn&apos;t</a>.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Couldn&apos;t, Stephen said.</p>
<p> Faultfinding being a proverbially bad hat Mr Bloom
<a name="s16013k" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16013k">thought well to
stir</a>, or try to, clotted sugar from the bottom of Stephen&apos;s cup and
reflected with something approaching acrimony on the
<a name="s16018r" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16018r">Coffee Palace</a> and
its temperance (&amp; lucrative) work. Certainly it did a world of good,
shelters such as the present one
<a name="s16010ae" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16010ae">run on teetotal
lines</a> at night for poor vagrants, concerts and useful lectures for the lower
orders. Still he recollected they had paid his wife, Madam Tweedy, a very modest
remuneration indeed for her pianoplaying. The idea, he was strongly inclined to
believe, was to do good and net a profit, there being no competition. Sulphate
of copper poison case or some dried peas he remembered in a cheap eatinghouse
somewhere but he could not remember when it was or where. Inspection, medical
inspection, of food, seemed to him absolutely necessary.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Try it now, he ventured to say of the coffee.</p>
<p> Thus prevailed on to taste it, at least, Stephen lifted the heavy mug from
the brown lake in the saucer and drank from it a sip.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Still, it&apos;s solid food, Mr Bloom urged. I&apos;m a
<a name="un4030aj" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030aj">stickler for</a>
solid food his one &amp; only reason being that he believed in regular meals as
the <a name="un5012ab" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5012ab">sine qua
non</a>. You ought to eat more solid food. You would
<a name="un4055ca" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4055ca">feel a different man</a>.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;
<a name="s16019e" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16019e">Liquids I can eat</a>,
Stephen said. But O, oblige me by taking away that bowieknife!
<a name="un4030ba" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030ba">I can&apos;t look at the point of it</a>.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom promptly removed out of sight the incriminated article, a blunt
hornhandled knife, observing that its point was the least conspicuous point about it.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Our mutual friend&apos;s stories are like himself, Mr
Bloom remarked to Stephen sotto voce. Do you think they are genuine? He could
spin those yarns all night for hours on end
<a name="s16014bn" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16014bn">all night long</a> and lie like old boots. Look at him.</p>
<p> Yet still though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air the world was
full of a host of things &amp; coincidences of a terrible nature and it was
quite within the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire
<br><font color="green">{ms, 8}</font>
<br> fabrication though at first blush there was not much
<a name="un5012ae" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5012ae">inherent</a> probability about it.</p>
<p> He had been
<a name="un4030bk" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030bk">meantime</a>
<a name="s16025h" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16025h">taking stock of the
individual in front of him</a>. Though a
<a name="s16013r" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16013r">wellpreserved man</a>
if a trifle prone to baldness there was something spurious in the cut of his
<a name="un5014bl" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5014bl">jib</a> that
suggested a <a name="s16017aj" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16017aj">jail
delivery</a> and it required no violent stretch of imagination to associate such
a <a name="s16014bd" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16014bd">weirdlooking
specimen</a> with the
<a name="un4031l" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031l">oakum</a> &amp;
<a name="s16027ab" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16027ab">treadmill</a>
fraternity. He might even have
<a name="s16022bc" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16022bc">done for his man</a>
supposing it was <a name="s16014s" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16014s">his
own case he told that he killed him himself</a> that is, though that was
<a name="un5012ac" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5012ac">rather a far
cry</a>. Or, on the other hand, he might be only bluffing a pardonable weakness.
because Meeting mugs like those jarvies Dublin residents wanting news from
abroad would tempt any ancient mariner to
<a name="un4030bp" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030bp">draw the long
bow</a> about <a name="s16026br" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16026br">the
schooner <u>Hesperus</u></a> etcetera. And, when all was said and done,
<a name="un4031bh" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031bh">the lies a fellow
told about himself couldn&apos;t probably hold a candle to the whoppers other fellows told about him</a>.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;
<a name="s16028j" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16028j">Mind you, I&apos;m not
saying</a> that it&apos;s all
<a name="s16014aq" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16014aq">a pure
invention</a>, he resumed.
<a name="s16013an" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16013an">Analogous scenes</a>
are occasionally, though not often, met with. Giants you see
<a name="s16009am" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16009am">once in a way</a>.
<a name="s16017bf" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16017bf">Marcella, the midget
queen</a> In the Waxworks in Henry street I myself saw some Aztecs, as they are
called, sitting bowlegged. They couldn&apos;t straighten their legs because the
muscles here, you see, he proceeded, indicating on his companion the brief
outline of the sinews behind the right knee, were completely powerless from
sitting that way so long cramped up, being adored as gods. There&apos;s an example again of simple souls.</p>
<p> However,
<a name="s16001bk" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001bk">reverting to</a>
friend <a name="s15020ah" href="../../FF/unbs/s15all.htm#s15020ah">Sinbad</a>
and his horrifying adventures, there was nothing intrinsically incompatible
about it, he conceded. In point of fact
<a name="s16012q" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16012q">that stab in the back
touch seemed to him typical of those italianos</a> though
<a name="s16006as" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16006as">candidly</a> he
<a name="s16028s" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16028s">was free to admit</a>
that those icecream and fishfriers and so on over in little Italy there near the
Coombe were thrifty hardworking sober fellows except perhaps a bit too prone to
pothunting <a name="s16010bf" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16010bf">the
harmless necessary cat</a> of others at night in order to have a succulent meal

<a name="s16005al" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16005al">on the quiet</a> and, he added, on the cheap.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; &ldquo;Spaniards, for instance,

<br> he continued,
<a name="s16027l" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16027l">passionate</a>
impetuous temperaments like that are given to taking the law in their own hands
and give you your quietus doublequick with a those poignards they name them in
the abdomen. It comes from the great heat, climate generally. My wife is,
<a name="s16026cb" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16026cb">so to speak</a>,

I <a name="un4031ci" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031ci">for one</a>
certainly believe climate influences character. That&apos;s why I asked you if you wrote poetry in Italian.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The temperaments at the door,
<a name="s16014an" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16014an">Stephen interposed
with</a>, were very
<a name="s16027l" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16027l">passionate</a> about
five shillings. Roberto ruba roba sua.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Quite so, Mr Bloom agreed.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Then, Stephen said staring and rambling on to himself or
some unknown listener somewhere, we have the

<p class="pdi">&mdash;
<a name="s16024a" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16024a">It&apos;s in the
blood</a>, Mr Bloom acceded at once. All are washed in the blood of the sun.
Coincidence I just happened to be in the Kildare street museum today, shortly
prior to our meeting if I can call it so, and I was just looking at those
antique statues there. The splendid proportions, hips, bosom. You simply
don&apos;t knock against those kind of women here. An exception here and there.
Handsome, yes, in a way, you find but I&apos;m talking about the female form.
Besides they have so little taste in dress, most of them.
<a name="s16026ah" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16026ah">Rumpled stockings,
it may be a foible of mine but still it&apos;s a thing I simply hate to see</a>.</p>
<p> <a name="un5012aq" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5012aq">Interest,
however, was beginning to flag</a> somewhat all round and then the others got on
to talking about accidents at sea, ships lost in fog, collisions with icebergs,
<a name="s16014ba" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16014ba">all that sort of
thing</a>. The sailor of course
<a name="s16013e" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16013e">had his say</a> to
say. <a name="s16022bi" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16022bi">He had doubled
the cape a few times and weathered a monsoon</a> in the china seas and, through

effect</a>, <a name="s16022c" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16022c">a holy medal he had</a> that saved him.</p>
<p> Then they drifted on to

<br> the <a name="s16022ai" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16022ai">wreck off

could think of her name for the moment till the jarvey who had really quite a

was the talk of the town that year,

over her and crowds and crowds on the shore
<a name="s16022aj" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16022aj">petrified</a> with

he cared nothing for any empire and considered no Irishman worthy of

served it. Then they began to have a few irascible words when it waxed hotter,

<a name="s16020d" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16020d">poohpooh</a> the
suggestion on a par with the
<a name="s16002bf" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002bf">quixotic</a> idea

<a name="un4031dc" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031dc">fully cognisant</a>
of the fact that their neighbours across the channel, unless they were bigger
fools than he took them for,
<a name="un4031ao" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031ao">rather concealed
their strength than the opposite</a>. The amours of
<a name="s16017l" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16017l">whores and
chummies</a> reminded him
<a name="s16017bu" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16017bu">Irish soldiers had
as often fought for Eng. as against her</a>. And now why? The scene between
<a name="s16017bv" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16017bv">the two, the
licensee of the place rumoured to be or have been Fitzharris the and the
other,</a> the bogus, suggested a little the confidence trick and the lookers
on, a student of the human soul if anything, saw least of the game. As for the
keeper (who probably wasn&apos;t the other man at all) he couldn&apos;t help
feeling and most properly that it was better to give people like that the goby
&amp; refuse to have anything to do with them &amp; their
<a name="s16017ak" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16017ak">felonsetting</a>
because there was always the offchance of a
<a name="s16026ap" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16026ap">Dannyman</a>
<a name="s16026al" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16026al">informer</a> turning
<a name="s16017e" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16017e">queen&apos;s
evidence</a> to divulge the names of his accomplices like Denis Carey, an idea
he repudiated, and then he disliked those careers of crime &amp; wrongdoing on
principle. Yet he certainly did feel some kind of an admiration for a man who
had brandished a knife with the courage of his political convictions or, say,
those love vendettas of the south, have her or
<a name="s16007s" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16007s">swing for her</a>,
until it struck him that Fitzharris, nicknamed Skin the Goat, simply drove the
car for the actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not, as he was
reliably informed, actually party to the ambush, matter of fact that was the
plea he saved his skin on. In any case that was ancient history<a target="foot" id="frz0015">&ordm;</a>
<br><font color="green">{ms, 14}</font>
<br> And as for our friend the
<a name="s16010a" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16010a">pseudo</a> Skin
etcetera he had outlived his welcome. He ought to have died either naturally or
on the scaffold high<a target="foot" id="frz0016">&ordm;</a> Like actresses,
always farewell performances and never retiring. Then as for the sailor Mr Bloom
had heard quite recently pretty much the identical lingo and he told S. of how he simply silenced the offender.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;
<a name="s16014ad" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16014ad">He took umbrage</a>
at something or other, that
<a name="s16007ae" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16007ae">much injured
person</a> declared, he called me a jew. And in
<a name="s16007g" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16007g">a heated fashion</a>
offensively. So I, without deviating from plain facts, told him his God was a
jew, I mean Christ, and all his family like me though I&apos;m not really. That
was one for him <a name="s16007am" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16007am">a
soft answer turns away wrath</a>. He hadn&apos;t a word to say for himself, as everyone saw. Am I not right!</p>
<p> He turned a long you are wrong gaze on S. of dark timorous pride with
glances of entreaty for the soft impeachment, however.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Ex quibus</u>, Stephen mumbled
<a name="s16007bf" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16007bf">their eyes
conversing</a>, all alone to himself,
<a name="s16022ch" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16022ch"><u>Christus</u> or
Bloom</a> his name is or after all any other, <u>secundum carnem</u>.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Of course, Mr B proceeded to say. You must look at both
sides of the question. It is hard to lay down any hard &amp; fast rule as to
what is right or wrong but there certainly is room for improvement though every
country, they say, has the government it deserves. But
<a name="s16021f" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16021f">with a little
goodwill</a> to prevail all round it ought to be. It&apos;s all very well to
boast of mutual superiority but what about mutual equality. I resent violence
&amp; intolerance in any shape or form. It never reaches anything or stops
anything. A revolution must come bit by bit. It&apos;s absurd to hate people
because they live round the corner &amp; speak another language, in the next house so to speak.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Bloody Bridge battle, Stephen said, was fought between
the boss of Skinner&apos;s alley and that memorable Ormond market.</p>
<p> Yes, Mr Bl. thoroughly agreed. That was overwhelmingly right. It was, as
yet, a manifest fact. The world was full of that sort of thing</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You just took the words out of my mouth, he said. A
hocuspocus of conflicting evidence you couldn&apos;t&nbsp;&hellip;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 15}</font> </p>
<p> It was Mr B&apos;s view that all that all those wretched quarrels, stirring
up bad blood, from some bump of combativeness or gland of the kind,
<a name="s16005ae" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16005ae">erroneously</a>
supposed to be about honour and a flag offence were largely a question of money
which was at the back of everything jealously &amp; greed. People never knew when to stop.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; They accuse, Mr Bloom
<a name="s16011f" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16011f">audibly remarked</a></p>
<p> He turned away from the others who probably and spoke nearer to so as the others.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Jews, he imparted, in an aside in Stephen&apos;s ear
softly, are accused of ruining. Not a word of truth in it as I can show. History
proves that Spain decayed when the inquisition hounded the jews out and England
prospered when Cromwell brought them in. Why? Because they are practical. I
don&apos;t want to say anything because you a good catholic but the priest
spells poverty. Spain again. They, compared with America. Turkey. It&apos;s the
religion. Because if they didn&apos;t believe they go to heaven after death
they&apos;d try to make life here better. Do you see? That&apos;s the secret how
the p.p&apos;s raise all the cash they do on false pretences. I&apos;m as good
an Irishman as he summed up
<a name="s16001bu" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001bu">with dramatic
force</a>,<a target="foot" id="frz0017">&ordm;</a> that rude man I told you of

I want to see everyone, he concluded his collocution, all creeds and classes
having a comfortable income, something in the neighbourhood of &pound;300 per
annum. That&apos;s the real issue at stake. And it&apos;s feasible. At least and
would be provocative of friendlier intercourse between man &amp; man that&apos;s
my idea for what it is worth. I call that patriotism. <u>Ubi patria</u> (as we
learned a smattering of in our classical days, <u>vita bene</u>. Where you can live well, the sense is, if you work.</p>
<p> Over his untastable apology for a cup of coffee listening to this
<a name="s16007at" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16007at">synopsis</a> of
things in general Stephen stared at nothing special.
<a name="s16017ba" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16017ba">He heard or saw all
kinds of words changing colour like little crabs and burrowing quickly into all
<br><font color="green">{ms, 16}</font>

didn&apos;t say the words the voice he heard said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Count me out, he said, meaning work.</p>
<p> The eyes he saw that said the words was surprised at this observation
because as he, the person who owned the eyes pro. tem., observed or rather his
voice did <a name="s16021di" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16021di">we all must work, have to, together</a>.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I mean of course, he hastened to affirm work in the

<p class="pdi">&mdash; I would go a step farther, Mr Bloom insinuated&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I suspect, Stephen interrupted with, that Ireland is important because it belongs to me.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What belongs? queried Mr Bloom bending. Excuse me.

<p> Stephen evidently rather crosstempered repeated and shoved aside his mug none too politely adding:</p>

<p> At this <a name="s16002s" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002s">pertinent
