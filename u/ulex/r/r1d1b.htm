<p> whereas<a target="foot" id="frz0020">&ordm;</a> no photo could because it simply wasn&apos;t art, in a word.</p>
<p> The <a name="s15068v" href="../../FF/unbs/s15all.htm#s15068v">spirit moving
him</a> he would very much liked to have followed Jack Tar&apos;s example and
leave the photo there a minute or so on the plea he. But it was scarcely
etiquette so. Though it was a warm pleasant sort of night for. And he felt a
kind of need then and there to satisfy a need. Nevertheless he just sat where he
was viewing again the slightly soiled photo creased by opulent curves,
<a name="s15066g" href="../../FF/unbs/s15all.htm#s15066g">none the worse for
wear</a>, however and looked away thoughtfully In fact the slight soiling was
only an added charm like linen slightly soiled
<a name="s16021q" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16021q">as good as new</a>,
much better in fact.
<a name="s16022a" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16022a">Suppose she
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">were</span></span> was gone. I
looked for the lamp which she told me came into his mind but only as a passing
fancy because he then thought of the morning littered bed</a> etcetera.</p>
<p> He liked the vicinity of the young man educated,
<a name="s16027c" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16027c">distingu&eacute;</a>
and impulsive too though
<a name="s16001bn" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001bn">you wouldn&apos;t
think he had it in him</a>. Besides he said the picture was handsome
<br><font color="green">{ms, 20}</font>
<br> which it was. And why not? An awful lot of pretence went on about that sort
of thing. Decree nisi and the King&apos;s proctor showed cause and
<a name="s16005am" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16005am">their names were coupled</a> till relations became intimate.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 15v}</font>
<br><font color="green">{ms, 20}</font>
<br> On<a target="foot" id="frz0021">&ordm;</a> the other hand what incensed him
more inwardly was the
<a name="un4030ct" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030ct">blatant</a> jokes of
the cabman and company pretending to understand everything. It was
<a name="un4048bj" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4048bj">a thousand
pities</a> certainly a young fellow like that wasting his time with profligate
women. In the nature of things he one day would take unto himself a wife when
Miss Right came along but in the interim ladies&apos; society was a
<u>conditio</u>
<a name="un4030u" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030u"><u>sine qua
non</u></a> though he had the
<a name="s16013f" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16013f">gravest doubts</a> as
to whether he would find much satisfaction in the society of smirking misses. To
think of him homeless &amp; houseless or a prey to some landlady worse than any
stepmother was really too bad at his age. The sudden
<a name="un4030bj" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030bj">queer things</a> he
came out with attracted him rather like his father but more he certainly ought to eat.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; At what o&apos;clock did you dine? he
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">asked</span></span> questioned.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Some time yesterday, Stephen said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yesterday! exclaimed Bloom till he
remem<a target="foot" id="frz0022">&ordm;</a> it was already tomorrow. Ah, you mean it&apos;s after 12.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The
<a name="un4037bi" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4037bi">day before</a> yesterday, Stephen said.</p>
<p> Literally astounded at this piece of intelligence Bloom reflected. Though
they didn&apos;t see eye to eye in everything a certain analogy there somehow
was as if both their minds were travelling, so to speak, in the same train of
thought. At his age he too recollected he had a sneaking sympathy for those
ultra ideas for instance when the evicted tenants question bulked
<br><font color="green">{ms, 21}</font>
<br> largely in the public view, though
<a name="s16001ck" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001ck">not contributing a
copper</a> to the cause, he was in principle in sympathy with peasant possession
&amp; even went a step farther than
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">most</span></span> Michael Davitt
in his views which was the reason he strongly resented the innuendo put on him
in so barefaced a fashion by our friend at his gathering of the clans so that he
departed from his usual custom to give him one in the gizzard though, so far as
politics were concerned, he was only too conscious of the casualties
<a name="un4031be" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031be">invariably</a>
resulting from propaganda and the misery &amp; suffering it entailed on fine
young fellows, destruction of the fittest, in a word.</p>
<p> Anyhow, weighing up the pros and cons, getting on for one as it was, it was
high time to be retiring for the night. The crux was it was a bit risky to bring
him home as eventualities might possibly ensue as on the night he misguidedly
brought home a Newfoundland dog with a lame paw (not that the cases were
identical though <a name="s16012k" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16012k">he
had hurt his hand</a>) to Ontario Terrace, as he very distinctly remembered. On
the other hand it was altogether too late for the Sandycove suggestion so that
he was in some perplexity as to which of the two alternatives. It seemed to him
he ought to avail himself
<a name="s16010g" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16010g">to the full</a> of the
opportunity, all things considered. His
<a name="s16002bc" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002bc"><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">firs</span></span>
initial impression</a> was he was a shade standoffish but it grew on him
someway. He mightn&apos;t exactly jump at the idea and what worried him was he
didn&apos;t know how to lead up to it or word it exactly, supposing he
entertained the proposal as it would
<a name="s16002ai" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002ai">afford him very
great pleasure if he would allow him to help</a>.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 22}</font>
<br> At all events, he wound up by concluding, a cup of Epps&apos;s cocoa and a
shakedown for the night there could be no very vast amount of harm in always
with the proviso no rumpus of any sort was kicked up. A move had to be made
because the grasswidower in question didn&apos;t seem in any particular hurry
back to his beloved Queenstown and probably some bawdyhouse off Sheriff street
lower would be his abode for a few days to come.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 22}</font>
<br> At the same time he chuckled inwardly over his repartee to the blood and
iron champion<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span> about
his god being a jew. People put up with being bit by a wolf but what properly
riled them was being bit by a sheep. The most vulnerable point too. Your God was
a. Phew!&nbsp;&hellip; Because they mostly seemed to imagine he came from
Carrick-on-Shannon or somewhereabouts in the county
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Fermanagh.</span></span> Sligo.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I propose, he
<a name="s16020a" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16020a">eventually</a>
suggested <a name="s16013ae" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16013ae">after
mature reflection</a>, you might come home with me and talk things over. My
<a name="s16028b" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16028b">diggings</a> are quite
close in the vicinity. You can&apos;t drink that stuff. Do you like cocoa? Wait. I&apos;ll just pay this.</p>
<p> He beckoned accordingly to the keeper and put a sixpence on the table.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, that&apos;s the best, he assured.</p>
<p> All kinds of Utopian plans were flashing through his head, education (the
genuine article) literature journalism, prize titbits, concert stage joint tours
in Eng. watering places packed with seaside
<a name="un5012db" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5012db">theatres</a>,
<a name="s15013bv" href="../../FF/unbs/s15all.htm#s15013bv">duets in Italian
with the accent perfectly correct</a>, no necessity to tell anybody about, and a
<a name="un4008bg" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4008bg">slice of luck</a>.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 23}</font>
<br> An opening was all was wanted. Because he more than suspected he had his
father&apos;s voice so it would just be as well,
<a name="s16012l" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16012l">by the way</a> no
harm, to trail the conversation in that direction just to.</p>
<p> The cabby read out of the paper he had got hold of that
<a name="s16019c" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16019c">the former viceroy,
earl Cadogan, had presided at the Cabdriver&apos;s association dinner in London
somewhere</a>. Silence with a yawn or two accompanied this. Then the old
specimen in the corner read out that
<a name="s16017bh" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16017bh">sir Anthony
MacDonnell had left Euston for the chief secretary&apos;s lodge</a>. To which echo answered when.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Give us a squint at that literature,
<a name="s16015o" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16015o">grandfather</a>, said sailor Jack.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And welcome, answered
<a name="s16014aj" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16014aj">the old party</a> addressed.</p>
<p> The sailor brought out from a case he had a pair of greenish
<a name="s16022av" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16022av">goggles</a> which he very slowly hooked over his ear.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;
<a name="s16022av" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16022av">Are you bad in the
eyes?</a> the sympathetic personage like the town clerk queried.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Why, answered the sailor, staring out of
<a name="s16022av" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16022av">seagreen
portholes</a>, <a name="s16022av" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16022av">I
uses goggles reading</a>. Sand in the Red Sea done that. One time
<a name="s16018c" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16018c">I could read a
book</a> in the dark, manner of speaking. <u>The Arabian nights
entertainments</u> was my favourite and <u>Red as a Rose is she</u>.</p>
<p> <a name="s16018c" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16018c">He pawed the paper
open and pored on it reading</a> Lord knows what, during which time the keeper
was intensely occupied
<a name="s16021bb" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16021bb">loosening</a> an
<a name="s16004d" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16004d">apparently</a>
<a name="s16021bb" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16021bb">new boot</a> which
evidently pinched him as he muttered against
<br><font color="green">{ms, 23v}</font>
<br> whoever sold it to him, all of them who were awake enough, looking on.</p>
<p> <a name="s16001ct" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001ct">Bloom was the
first to rise from his seat</a> having first and foremost taken the
<a name="s16002ca" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002ca">wise precaution</a>
to motion to the keeper, a scarcely perceptible
<a name="s16015j" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16015j">sign when the others
were not looking</a>, to the effect that
that<a target="foot" id="frz0023">&ordm;</a> the money due was
<a name="s16001bt" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001bt">forthcoming</a>
making a <a name="s16004u" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16004u">grand
total</a> of fourpence (the amount he deposited) as he had previously read the
pricelist in unmistakable figures opposite him, coffee 2d, confectionery do.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Come, he counselled.</p>
<p> As they left the shelter together Stephen paused a moment by the door.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; One thing I never understood, he said
<a name="s16001t" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001t">on the spur of the
moment</a>. Why they put the chairs upside down on the table
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">in</span></span> at night in a caf&eacute;.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; To sweep the floor in the morning, Bloom replied straight off.</p>
<p> So saying <a name="s16022v" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16022v">he
skipped round</a> <a name="s16022v" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16022v">to
get on Stephen&apos;s right.</a> The night air was certainly a treat to breathe
but it made Stephen bit weak on his pins.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It will do you good in
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">m</span></span> a moment, Bloom
said. The only thing is to walk. Come. It&apos;s not far. Lean on me.</p>
<p> <a name="s16026bu" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16026bu">He passed his
left arm in Stephen&apos;s</a> and <a name="s15013cb" href="../../FF/unbs/s15all.htm#s15013cb">led him on</a>.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, Stephen said uncertainly,
<a name="s16027j" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16027j">feeling a strange kind
of flesh touch him, sinewless rather and ample and all that.</a> They passed by
the sentrybox with its stones and brazier where the
<a name="s16006ai" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16006ai">municipal
supernumerary</a> was still to all intents &amp; purposes wrapped
<a name="un4003h" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4003h">in the arms of
Murphy</a>. And apropos of
<a name="s16026bf" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16026bf">coffin of stones</a>
the analogy was not bad as it was in fact a stoning to death on the part of
seventytwo out of 80 constituencies that ratted at the time of the split
<br><font color="green">{ms, 22v}</font>
<br> and chiefly the belauded peasant class probably the very evicted tenants he had put in their holdings.</p>
<p> They turned on to music an art for which Bloom possessed the greatest love
as they made tracks arm in arm across Beresford Place. Wagnerian music, though
grand in its way, was a trifle too heavy for Bloom, the music of
<a name="s16022t" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16022t">Mercadante&apos;s
<u>Huguenots</u></a>,
<a name="s16022u" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16022u">Meyerbeer&apos;s
<u>Seven Last Words on the Cross</u></a> and Mozart&apos;s
<u>Twellfh</u><a target="foot" id="frz0024">&ordm;</a> <u>Mass</u>, the
<u>Gloria</u> in that being the acme of musical expression. He also yielded to
none in his admiration of Rossini&apos;s <u>Stabat Mater</u> in which his wife,
Madam Marion Tweedy, made a hit, a veritable sensation in the jesuit church, the
<a name="s16006an" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16006an">sacred edifice</a>
being thronged by
<a name="s16006q" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16006q">virtuosos</a> to hear
her. On the whole though favouring preferably light opera like <u>Don
Giovanni</u> and Martha he had a penchant for classical composers like
Mendelssohn. Talking of that he mentioned Lionel&apos;s air in <u>Martha
M&apos;appari</u> which, curiously enough, he had heard or rather overheard, to
be more accurate, <a name="s16010bg" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16010bg">a
privilege he keenly appreciated</a>, from the lips of Stephen&apos;s own
respected father, sung to perfection, in fact, a study. Stephen, in reply to a
politely put query, said he didn&apos;t sing it but went on
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">in</span></span> into praises of
the songs of Shakespeare&apos;s time, the lutenist Dowland, an instrument he was
thinking of purchasing from Mr Arnold Dolmetsch whom Bloom did not recall though
the name was familiar, for sixty guineas and
<a name="s16022g" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16022g">William Byrd, who
played the virginals in the Queen&apos;s Chapel</a> and out of it, and
<a name="s16022h" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16022h">John Bull</a>.</p>
<p> On the roadway beyond the swingchains which they were approaching, a horse,
dragging a <a name="s16026af" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16026af">sweeper</a>, paced on the
<br><font color="green">{ms, 21v}</font>
<br> <a name="s16027d" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16027d">paven ground</a>,
brushing a long swathe of mire so that with the noise Bloom was not sure whether
he had caught aright the allusion to sixty guineas and
<a name="s16022h" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16022h">John Bull</a>. He
inquired if it was
<a name="s16022h" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16022h">John Bull</a>, the
political celebrity of that ilk. The two names, so like, struck him as a curious coincidence.</p>
<p> By the chains <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">where they
halted</span></span> the horse slowly
served<a target="foot" id="frz0025">&ordm;</a> to turn, perceiving which Bloom
plucked Stephen&apos;s sleeve gently, saying jocosely:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;
<a name="s16027n" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16027n">Beware of the
steamroller.</a> Our lives are in peril tonight.</p>
<p> They accordingly halted.
<a name="s16026m" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16026m">Bloom looked at the
head of a beast</a> not worth 60 gns suddenly revealed by darkness, near, new
and strange, a different grouping of bones and even flesh because it was
<a name="s16009g" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16009g">palpably</a> a
fourwalker, a hipshaker, a headhanger
<a name="s16026n" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16026n">putting his hind foot
foremost</a> for the sake of the chariotdriver on the perch. But a good poor
brute<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span> he was sorry
he hadn&apos;t <a name="s16017cd" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16017cd">a
lump of sugar</a> but, as he reflected, you could scarcely be prepared for every
<a name="un4031bo" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031bo">emergency</a> that
might crop up. He was just a big nervous foolish noodly sort of a horse.
<a name="s16026l" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16026l">But even a dog, he
reflected, take that mongrel in Barney Kiernan&apos;s of the same size would be
a holy horror to
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">meet</span></span> face.</a> It
was no animal&apos;s fault if he was built that way, like
<a name="s16026u" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16026u">the camel, ship of the
desert, distilling grapejuice into potheen in his hump</a>. Mostly all could be
tamed and caged, nothing being beyond the art of man barring the bees. Whale
with a harpoon hairpin, alligator tickle the small of his back and he sees the
joke, chalk a circle for a rooster, tiger my eagle eye. These timely reflections
occupied his mind rather distracted from Stephen&apos;s words while the
<br><font color="green">{ms, 20v}</font>
<br> ship of the street was
<a name="s16014ah" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16014ah">manoeuvring</a> and Stephen was talking of the.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; My wife, he said, would be very much interested to make
your acquaintance as he was
<a name="s16027l" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16027l">passionately</a> attached to music of any kind.</p>
<p> He looked sideways in a friendly way at the sideface of Stephen which was
not quite the same as the usual handsome blackguard type they had an incurable
fancy for<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span> as he was perhaps not that built.</p>
<p> Still <a name="un4031bl" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031bl">it opened
up vistas</a> in his mind such as Lady Fingall&apos;s recent industrial concert and aristocracy.</p>
<p> <a name="s16021v" href="../../FF/unbs/s16all.htm#s16021v">Exquisite
variations he was now talking about on an air <u>Youth has here

Pieter Sweelinck, a
Dutchman<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span> of
Amsterdam where the frous come from. Even more he liked an old German song of
Johannes Jeep</a> in which you saw the clear sea and heard the wooing voices of the sirens, sweet, false and cruel.</p>
<p class="set"><u>Von der Sirenen Listigkeit</u>
<br> <u>Tun die Po&euml;ten dichten</u></p>
<p> These opening bars he sang and translated. Bloom nodding said he understood
and begged him to continue which he did.</p>

<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">fin</span></span> beautiful

best fashionable houses
<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">unread</span></font>
with his university degree and gentlemanly bearing he would undoubtedly
<a name="un4031bn" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031bn">score a distinct
success</a> if his clothes were properly attended to. Added to which of course
would be the emolument. Not that for the sake of filthy lucre he need
necessarily embrace the concert platform. But it
<a name="un4031bt" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031bt">contained no
reflection on his dignity</a> <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">at
all</span></span> <a name="un4030dm" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030dm">in
the smallest</a> and it often turned in uncommonly handy to be handed a cheque at a
<br><font color="green">{ms, 19v}</font>
<br> muchneeded moment when every little helped. Besides original music like
that would be a decided novelty for the Dublin musical world after the usual
<a name="un4030v" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030v">hackneyed</a> run of
tenor solos. Yes, beyond a doubt he could with all the cards in his hand
<a name="un4030ca" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030ca">win a high place in
Dublin&apos;s esteem</a>, given a backerup, and it would not detract from the
other in the least as he could practise literature in his spare time.
