and soda or a</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>
mineral. But how to get there was the rub. For the nonce he was rather
nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon him to take some
measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and means during which Stephen
repeatedly yawned. So far as he could see he was rather pale in the face so that
it occurred to him as highly advisable to get a conveyance of some description
which would answer in their then condition, both of them being e.d. ed,
particularly Stephen, always assuming that there was such a thing to be found.
Accordingly after a few such preliminaries as brushing, in spite of his having
forgotten to take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had done yeoman
service in the shaving line, they both walked together along Beaver street, or,
more properly, lane, as far as the farrier&apos;s and the distinctly fetid
atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of Montgomery street where they
made tracks to the
left<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>
from thence debouching into Amiens street round by
<br><font color="green">{u21, 678}</font>
<br> the corner of Dan Bergin&apos;s. But, as he confidently anticipated, there
was not a sign of a Jehu plying for hire anywhere to be seen except a
fourwheeler, probably engaged by some fellows inside on the spree, outside the
North Star Hotel and there was no symptom of its budging a quarter of an inch
when Mr Bloom, who was anything but a professional whistler, endeavoured to hail
it by emitting a kind of a whistle, holding his arms arched over his head, twice.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 570}</font> </p>
<p> This was a quandary but, bringing common sense to bear on it, evidently
there was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it which
they accordingly did. So, bevelling around by Mullett&apos;s and the Signal
House, which they shortly reached, they proceeded perforce in the direction of
Amiens street railway terminus, Mr Bloom being handicapped by the circumstance
that one of the back buttons of his trousers had, to vary the
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">timehonoured</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>
adage, gone the way of all buttons though, entering thoroughly into the spirit
of the thing, he heroically made light of the mischance. So as neither of them
were particularly pressed for time, as it happened, and the temperature
refreshing since it cleared up after the recent visitation of Jupiter Pluvius,
they dandered along past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a fare
or a jarvey. As it so happened a Dublin United Tramways Company&apos;s
sandstrewer happening to be returning the elder man recounted to his companion
<i>&agrave; propos</i> of the incident his own truly miraculous escape of some
little while back. They passed the main entrance of the Great Northern railway
station, the starting point for Belfast, where of course all traffic was
suspended at that late hour, and passing the back door of the morgue (a not very
enticing locality, not to say gruesome to a degree, more especially at night),
ultimately gained the Dock Tavern and in due course turned into Store street,
famous for its C division police station. Between this point and the high, at
present unlit, warehouses of Beresford Place Stephen thought to think of Ibsen,
associated with Baird&apos;s, the stonecutter&apos;s in his mind somehow in
Talbot Place, first turning on the right, while the other, who was acting as his
<i>fidus Achates</i> inhaled with internal satisfaction the smell of James
Rourke&apos;s city bakery, situated quite close to where
<br><font color="green">{u21, 679}</font>
<br> they were, the very palatable odour indeed of our daily bread, of all
commodities of the public the primary and most indispensable. Bread, the staff
of life, earn your bread, O tell me where is fancy bread? At Rourke&apos;s the baker&apos;s, it is said.</p>
<p> <i>En route</i>, to his taciturn, and, not to put too fine a point on it,
not yet perfectly sober companion, Mr Bloom, who at all events was in complete
possession of his faculties, never more so, in
fact<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>
disgustingly sober, spoke a word of caution <i>re</i> the dangers of nighttown,
women of ill fame and swell mobsmen, which, barely permissible once in a while,
though not as a habitual practice, was of the nature of a regular deathtrap for
young fellows of his age particularly
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8'</small></sup></font><font color="black">if
they had <a name="un4055ba" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4055ba">acquired
drinking habits</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>8'|</small></sup></font>
under the influence of liquor unless you knew a little jiujitsu for every
contingency as even a fellow on the broad of his back could administer a nasty
kick if you didn&apos;t look out. Highly providential was the appearance on the scene of Corny Kelleher when Stephen
<br><font color="green">{u22, 571}</font>
<br> was blissfully unconscious that, but for that man in the gap turning up at
the eleventh hour, the finis might have been that he might have been a candidate
for the accident ward or, failing that, the bridewell and an appearance in the
court next day before Mr Tobias, or, he being the solicitor rather, old Wall, he
meant to say, or Mahony
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8'</small></sup></font><font color="black">which
<a name="un4048aj" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4048aj">simply spelt ruin
for</a> a chap when it got bruited
about</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8'|</small></sup></font>. The reason
he mentioned the fact was that a lot of those policemen, whom he cordially
disliked, were admittedly unscrupulous in the service of the Crown and, as Mr
Bloom put it, recalling a case or two in the A Division in Clanbrassil street,
prepared to swear a hole through a ten gallon pot. Never on the spot when wanted
but in quiet parts of the city, Pembroke road for example, the guardians of the
law were well in evidence, the obvious reason being they were paid to protect
the upper classes. Another thing he commented on was equipping soldiers with
firearms or sidearms of any description, liable to go off at any time which was
tantamount to inciting them against civilians should by any chance they fall out
over anything. You frittered away your time, he very sensibly maintained, and
health and also character besides which, the squandermania of the thing, fast women of the <i>demimonde</i> ran
<br><font color="green">{u21, 680}</font>
<br> away with a lot of &pound;. s. d. into the bargain and the greatest danger
of all was who you got drunk with though, touching the much vexed question of
stimulants, he relished a glass of choice old wine in season as both nourishing
and bloodmaking
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8'</small></sup></font><font color="black">and
possessing aperient
virtues</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8'|</small></sup></font> (notably a
good burgundy which he was a staunch believer in) still never beyond a certain
point where he invariably drew the line as it simply led to trouble all round to
say nothing of your being at the tender mercy of others practically. Most of all
he commented adversely on the desertion of Stephen by all his pubhunting
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">confr&egrave;res</span></span>
<font color="black"><i>confr&egrave;res</i></font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>
but one, a most glaring piece of ratting on the part of his brother medicos under all the circs.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And that one was Judas, said Stephen, who up to then had said nothing whatsoever of any kind.</p>
<p> Discussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back of
the Customhouse and passed under the Loop Line bridge where a brazier of coke
burning in front of a sentrybox, or something like one, attracted their rather
lagging footsteps. Stephen
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8'</small></sup></font><font color="black">of his
own accord</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8'|</small></sup></font> stopped
for no special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by the
light emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker figure of the
corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox. He began to remember
that this had happened, or had been mentioned as having happened, before but it cost
<br><font color="green">{u22, 572}</font>
<br> him no small effort before he remembered that he recognised in the sentry a
<i>quondam</i> friend of his father&apos;s, Gumley. To avoid a meeting he drew
nearer to the pillars of the railway bridge.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Someone saluted you, Mr Bloom said.</p>
<p> A figure of middle height on the prowl, evidently, under the arches saluted
again, calling: <i>Night!</i> Stephen, of course, started rather dizzily and
stopped to return the compliment. Mr Bloom, actuated by motives of inherent
delicacy,
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8'</small></sup></font><font color="black">inasmuch<a target="foot" id="frr0031">&ordm;</a>
as he always believed in minding his own
business,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8'|</small></sup></font> moved off
but nevertheless remained on the <i>qui vive</i> with just a shade of anxiety
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8'</small></sup></font><font color="black">though
not funkyish in the
least</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8'|</small></sup></font>. Although
unusual in the Dublin area, he knew that it was not by any means unknown for
desperadoes who had next to nothing to live on to be about waylaying and generally terrorising peaceable pedestrians by
<br><font color="green">{u21, 681}</font>
<br> placing a pistol at their head in some secluded spot outside the city
proper, famished loiterers of the Thames embankment category they might be
hanging about there or simply marauders ready to decamp with whatever boodle
they could in one fell swoop at a moment&apos;s notice, your money or your life,
leaving you there to point a moral, gagged and

<font color="black">garrotted</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>.</p>
<p> Stephen, that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters, though he
was not in an over sober state himself, recognised
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Corly&apos;s</span></span>
<font color="black">Corley&apos;s</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>
breath redolent of rotten cornjuice. Lord John
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Corly</span></span>
<font color="black">Corley</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>,
some called him, and his genealogy came about in this wise. He was the eldest
son of Inspector
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Corly</span></span>
<font color="black">Corley</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>
of the G Division, lately deceased, who had married a certain Katherine Brophy,
the daughter of a Louth farmer. His grandfather, Patrick Michael
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Corly</span></span>
<font color="black">Corley</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>,
of New Ross, had married the widow of a publican there whose maiden name had
been Katherine (also) Talbot. Rumour had it,though not proved, that she
descended from the house of the Lords Talbot de Malahide, in whose mansion,
really an unquestionably fine residence of its kind and well worth seeing, her
mother or aunt or some relative had enjoyed the distinction of being in service
in the washkitchen. This, therefore, was the reason why the still comparatively
young though dissolute man who now addressed Stephen was spoken of by some with
facetious proclivities as Lord John
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Corly</span></span>
<font color="black">Corley</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>.</p>
<p> Taking Stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell. Not
as much as a farthing to purchase a night&apos;s lodgings. His friends had all
deserted him. Furthermore, he had a row with Lenehan and called him to Stephen a
mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of other uncalledfor expressions. He was out
of a job and implored of Stephen to tell him where on God&apos;s earth he could
get something, anything at all, to do. No, it was the daughter of the
<br><font color="green">{u22, 573}</font>
<br> mother in the washkitchen that was fostersister to the heir of the
house<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>
or else they were connected through the mother in some way, both occurrences
happening at the same time if the whole thing wasn&apos;t a complete fabrication
from start to finish. Anyhow, he was all in.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I wouldn&apos;t ask you, only, pursued he, on my solemn oath and
<br><font color="green">{u21, 682}</font>
<br> God knows I&apos;m on the rocks.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There&apos;ll be a job tomorrow or the next day, Stephen
told him, in a boys&apos; school at Dalkey for a gentleman usher. Mr Garrett Deasy. Try it. You may mention my name.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ah, God,
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Corly</span></span>
<font color="black">Corley</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>
replied, sure I couldn&apos;t teach in a school, man. I was never one of your
bright ones, he added with a half laugh. Got stuck twice in the junior at the Christian Brothers.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I have no place to sleep myself, Stephen informed him.</p>
<p>
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Corly</span></span>
<font color="black">Corley</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>,
at the first go-off, was inclined to suspect it was something to do with Stephen
being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody tart off the street. There
was a dosshouse in Marlborough street, Mrs Maloney&apos;s, but it was only a
tanner touch and full of undesirables but M&apos;Conachie told him you got a
decent enough do in the Brazen Head over in Winetavern street
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8'</small></sup></font><font color="black">(which
was distantly suggestive to the person addressed of friar
Bacon)</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8'|</small></sup></font> for a bob.
He was starving too though he hadn&apos;t said a word about it.</p>
<p> Though this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it still
Stephen&apos;s feelings got the better of him in a sense though he knew that
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Corly&apos;s</span></span>
<font color="black">Corley&apos;s</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>
brandnew rigmarole, on a par with the others, was hardly deserving of much
credence. However, <i>haud ignarus malorum miseris succurrere disco</i>,
etcetera,
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">as the
Latin poet remarks</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>
especially as luck would have it he got paid his screw after every middle of the
month on the sixteenth which was the date of the month as a matter of fact
though a good bit of the wherewithal was demolished. But the cream of the joke
was nothing would get it out of
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Corly&apos;s</span></span>
<font color="black">Corley&apos;s</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>
head that he was living in affluence and hadn&apos;t a thing to do but hand out
the needful &mdash; whereas. He put his hand in a pocket anyhow, not with the
idea of finding any food there, but thinking he might lend him anything up to a
bob or so in lieu so that he might endeavour at all events and get sufficient to
eat. But the result was in the negative for, to his chagrin, he found his cash
missing. A few broken biscuits were all the result of his investigation. He
tried his hardest to recollect for the moment whether he had lost, as well he
might have, or left, because in that contingency it was not a pleasant lookout,
very much the reverse, in fact. He was altogether too
<br><font color="green">{u21, 683}</font>
<br> fagged out to institute a thorough search though
<br><font color="green">{u22, 574}</font>
<br> he tried to recollect. About biscuits he dimly remembered. Who now exactly
gave them, or where was, or did he buy? However, in another pocket he came
across what he surmised in the dark were pennies, erroneously, however, as it turned out.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Those are halfcrowns, man,
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Corly</span></span>
<font color="black">Corley</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font> corrected him.</p>
<p> And so in point of fact they turned out to be. Stephen lent him one of them.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Thanks,
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Corly</span></span>
<font color="black">Corley</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>
answered. You&apos;re a gentleman. I&apos;ll pay you back some time. Who&apos;s
that with you? I saw him a few times in the Bleeding Horse in Camden street with
Boylan the billsticker. You might put in a good word for us to get me taken on
there. I&apos;d carry a sandwichboard only the girl in the office told me
they&apos;re full up for the next three weeks, man. God, you&apos;ve to book
ahead, man, you&apos;d think it was for the Carl Rosa. I don&apos;t give a shite
anyway so long as I get a job, even as a crossing sweeper.</p>
<p> Subsequently, being not quite so down in the mouth after the two-and-six he
got, he informed Stephen about a fellow by the name of Bags Comisky that he said
Stephen knew well out of Fullam&apos;s, the shipchandler&apos;s, bookkeeper
there, that used to be often round in Nagle&apos;s back with O&apos;Mara and a
little chap with a stutter the name of Tighe. Anyhow, he was lagged the night
before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and disorderly and refusing to go with the constable.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the
cobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation
watchman&apos;s sentrybox, who, evidently a glutton for work, it struck him, was
having a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own private
account while Dublin slept. He threw an odd eye at the same time now and then at
Stephen&apos;s anything but immaculately attired interlocutor as if he had seen
that nobleman somewhere or other though where he was not in a position to
truthfully state nor had he the remotest idea when. Being a levelheaded
individual who could give points to not a few in point of shrewd observation, he
also remarked on his very dilapidated hat and slouchy wearing apparel generally,
<br><font color="green">{u21, 684}</font>
<br> testifying to a chronic impecuniosity. Probably he was one of his hangerson
but for the matter of that it was merely a question of one preying on his
nextdoor neighbour all round, in every deep, so to put it, a deeper depth and
for the matter of that if the man in the street chanced to be in the dock
himself penal
servitude<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></SUP></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>
with or without the option of a
fine<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">,<a target="foot" id="frr0043">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>
would be a very <i>rara avis</i> altogether. In any case he had a consummate amount of cool assurance
<br><font color="green">{u22, 575}</font>
<br> intercepting people at that hour of the night or morning. Pretty thick that was certainly.</p>
<p> The pair parted company and Stephen rejoined Mr Bloom, who, with his
practised eye, was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the
blandiloquence of the other parasite. Alluding to the encounter he said,
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">laughing</span></span>
<font color="black">laughingly</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>, Stephen, that is:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He&apos;s down on his luck. He asked me to ask you to ask
somebody named Boylan, a billsticker, to give him a job as a sandwichman.</p>
<p> At this intelligence, in which he seemingly evinced little interest, Mr
Bloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the direction
of a
bucketdredger<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>
rejoicing in the farfamed name of
Eblana<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>
moored alongside
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Burgh</span></span>
<font color="black">Customhouse</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>
Quay and quite possibly out of repair, whereupon he observed evasively:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Everybody gets their own ration of luck, they say. Now you
mention it his face was familiar to me. But leaving that for the moment, how
much did you part with, he queried, if I am not too inquisitive?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Half-a-crown, Stephen responded. I daresay he needs it to sleep somewhere.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Needs! Mr Bloom ejaculated, professing not the least
surprise at the intelligence,
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8'</small></sup></font><font color="black">I can
quite <a name="un4055u" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4055u">credit the
assertion</a> and</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8'|</small></sup></font> I
guarantee he invariably does. Everyone according to his needs and everyone
according to his deeds. But, talking about things in general, where, added he
with a smile, will you sleep yourself? Walking to Sandycove is out of the
question and, even supposing you did, you won&apos;t get in after what occurred
at Westland Row station. Simply fag out there for nothing. I don&apos;t mean to
presume to dictate to you in the slightest degree but why did you leave your father&apos;s house?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; To seek misfortune, was Stephen&apos;s answer.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 685}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I met your respected father on a recent occasion, Mr Bloom
diplomatically returned, today, in fact, or, to be strictly accurate, on
yesterday. Where does he live at present? I gathered in the course of conversation that he had moved.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I believe he is in Dublin somewhere, Stephen answered unconcernedly. Why?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A gifted man, Mr Bloom said of Mr Dedalus senior, in more
respects than one
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8'</small></sup></font><font color="black">and a
born <i>raconteur</i> if ever there was
one</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8'|</small></sup></font>. He takes great
pride, quite legitimately, out of you. You could go back, perhaps, he hazarded,
still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at Westland Row terminus when it
<br><font color="green">{u22, 576}</font>
<br> was perfectly evident that the other two, Mulligan, that is, and that
English tourist friend of his, who eventually euchred their third companion,
were patently trying, as if the whole
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">bally</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>
station belonged to them, to give Stephen the slip in the confusion.</p>
<p> There was no response forthcoming to the suggestion, however, such as it
was, Stephen&apos;s mind&apos;s eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his
family hearth the last time he saw it, with his sister Dilly sitting by the
ingle, her hair hanging down, waiting for some weak Trinidad shell cocoa that
was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he could drink it with
the oatmeal water for milk after the Friday herrings they had eaten at two a
penny, with an egg apiece for Maggy, Boody and Katey, the cat meanwhile under
the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells and charred fish heads and bones on a
square of brown paper, in accordance with the third precept of the church to
fast and abstain on the days commanded, it being quarter tense or, if not, ember days or something like that.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; No, Mr Bloom repeated again, I wouldn&apos;t personally
repose much trust in that boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous
element, Dr Mulligan, as a guide, philosopher, and friend, if I were in your
shoes. He knows which side his bread is buttered on though in all probability he
never realised what it is to be without regular meals. Of course you didn&apos;t
notice as much as I did but it wouldn&apos;t occasion me the least surprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco
<br><font color="green">{u21, 686}</font>
<br> or some narcotic was put in your drink for some ulterior object.</p>
<p> He understood, however, from all he heard, that Dr Mulligan was a versatile
allround man, by no means confined to medicine only, who was rapidly coming to
the fore in his line and, if the report was verified, bade fair to enjoy a
flourishing practice in the not too distant future as a tony medical
practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services in addition to which
professional status his rescue of that man from certain drowning by artificial
respiration and what they call first aid at Skerries, or Malahide was it?, was,
he was bound to admit, an exceedingly plucky deed
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8'</small></sup></font><font color="black"><a name="un4054aq" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4054aq">which
he could not too highly
praise</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>8'|</small></sup></font>, so that
frankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reason could be at the
back of it except he put it down to
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">sheer
cussedness or</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>
jealousy<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">,
pure and simple</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they
call picking your brains, he ventured to throw out.</p>
<p> The guarded glance of half solicitude, half curiosity, augmented by
friendliness which he gave at Stephen&apos;s at present morose expression of features
<br><font color="green">{u22, 577}</font>
<br> did not throw a flood of light, none at all in fact, on the problem as to
whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled, to judge by two or three
lowspirited remarks he let drop, or, the other way about, saw through the
affair, and, for some reason or other best known to himself, allowed matters to
more or
less<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span>

<p> Adjacent to the men&apos;s public urinal they perceived an icecream car

<p> Mr Bloom and Stephen entered the cabman&apos;s shelter, an unpretentious
<br><font color="green">{u21, 687}</font>
<br> wooden structure, where, prior to then, he had rarely, if ever, been
before; the former having previously whispered to the latter a few hints anent
the keeper of it, said to be the once famous Skin-the-Goat, Fitzharris, the
invincible, though he wouldn&apos;t vouch for the actual facts which quite
possibly there was not one vestige of truth in. A few moments later saw our two
noctambules safely seated in a discreet corner only to be greeted by stares from
the decidedly miscellaneous collection of waifs and strays
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8'</small></sup></font><font color="black">and
other nondescript specimens of
<a name="un4055bl" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4055bl">the genus
<i>homo</i></a> </font><font color="red"><sup><small>8'|</small></sup></font>
already there engaged in eating and drinking, diversified by
conversation<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>
for whom they seemingly formed an object of
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">marked</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>
curiosity.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Now touching a cup of coffee, Mr Bloom ventured to
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black"><a name="s15061cf" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15061cf">plausibly</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>
suggest to break the ice, it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the
shape of solid food, say a roll of some description.</p>
<p> Accordingly his first act was with characteristic <i>sangfroid</i> to order
these commodities quietly. The <i>hoi polloi</i> of jarvies or stevedores, or
whatever they were, after a cursory examination, turned their eyes, apparently
dissatisfied, away, though one redbearded bibulous individual, portion of whose
hair was greyish, a sailor, probably, still stared for some appreciable time
before transferring his rapt attention to the floor.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom, availing himself of the right of free speech, he having just a
bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute, though, to be sure, rather in
a quandary over <i>voglio</i>, remarked to his <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i> in an audible tone of voice,
<br><font color="green">{u22, 578}</font>
<br> <i>&agrave; propos</i> of the battle royal in the street which was still
raging fast and
furious<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span><font color="black">:</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A beautiful language. I mean for singing purposes. Why do
you not write your poetry in that language? <i>Bella Poetria!</i> It is so
melodious and full. <i>Bella Donna</i>. <i>Voglio</i>.</p>
<p> Stephen, who was trying his dead best to yawn, if he could, suffering from lassitude generally, replied:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; To fill the ear of a cow elephant. They were haggling over money.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Is that so? Mr Bloom asked. Of course, he subjoined
pensively, at the inward reflection of there being more languages to start with
<br><font color="green">{u21, 688}</font>
<br> than were absolutely necessary, it may be only the southern glamour that surrounds it.</p>
<p> The keeper of the shelter in the middle of this
<i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> put a boiling swimming cup of a choice
concoction labelled coffee on the table and a rather antediluvian specimen of a
bun, or so it seemed, after which he
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">retreated</span></span>
<font color="black">beat a
retreat</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font> to his
counter, Mr Bloom determining to have a good square look at him later on so as
not to appear
to<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span>
<font color="black">&nbsp;&hellip;</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>
for which reason he encouraged Stephen to proceed with his eyes while he did the
honours by surreptitiously pushing the cup of what was temporarily supposed to
be called coffee gradually nearer him.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Sounds are impostures, Stephen said after a pause of some
little time. Like names. Cicero, Podmore. Napoleon, Mr Goodbody. Jesus, Mr
Doyle. Shakespeares were as common as Murphies. What&apos;s in a name?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, to be sure, Mr Bloom unaffectedly concurred. Of
course. Our name was changed too, he added, pushing the socalled roll across.</p>
<p> The redbearded sailor, who had his weather eye on the newcomers, boarded
Stephen<font color="red"><sup><small>|8'</small></sup></font><font color="black">,
whom he had <a name="un4055ap" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4055ap">singled
out for attention</a> in
particular,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8'|</small></sup></font> squarely by asking:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And what might your name be?</p>
<p> Just in the nick of time Mr Bloom touched his companion&apos;s boot but
Stephen, apparently disregarding the warm pressure
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8'</small></sup></font><font color="black">from
<a name="un4036i" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4036i">an unexpected
quarter</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>8'|</small></sup></font>, answered:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Dedalus.</p>
<p> The sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes, rather
bunged up from excessive
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">use
of</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>
boose<font color="red"><sup><small>|8'</small></sup></font><font color="black">,

<p class="di">&mdash; You know Simon Dedalus? he asked at length.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I&apos;ve heard of him, Stephen said.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 579}</font> </p>
<p> Mr Bloom was all at sea for a moment, seeing the others evidently eavesdropping too.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He&apos;s Irish, the seaman
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">bold</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>
affirmed, staring still in much the same way and nodding. All Irish.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; All too Irish, Stephen rejoined.</p>
<p> As for Mr Bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole
<br><font color="green">{u21, 689}</font>
<br> business and he was just asking himself what possible connection when the
sailor, of his own accord, turned to the other occupants of the shelter with the remark:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards
over his shoulder. The lefthand dead shot.</p>
<p> Though he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his gestures
being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Bottles out there, say. Fifty yards measured. Eggs on the
bottles. Cocks his gun over his shoulder. Aims.</p>
<p> He turned his body half round, shut up his right eye completely, then he
screwed his features up someway sideways and glared out into the night with an unprepossessing cast of countenance.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Pom! he then shouted once.</p>
<p> The entire audience waited, anticipating an additional detonation, there being still a further egg.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Pom! he shouted twice.</p>
<p><font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">&rArr;
Egg<a target="foot" id="frr0080">&ordm;</a> two evidently demolished, he nodded
and winked, adding

<br> <i>Never missed nor he never will.</i></a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font></p>
<p> A silence ensued till Mr Bloom for agreeableness&apos; sake just
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">asked</span></span>
<font color="black">felt like
asking</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font> him whether
it was for a marksmanship competition like the Bisley.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Beg pardon, the sailor said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Long ago? Mr Bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Why, the sailor replied, relaxing to a certain extent
under the magic influence of diamond cut diamond, it might be a matter of ten
years. He toured the wide world with Hengler&apos;s Royal Circus. I seen him do that in Stockholm.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Curious coincidence, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen unobtrusively.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Murphy&apos;s my name, the sailor continued, W.B. Murphy, of Carrigaloe. Know where that is?
<br><font color="green">{u22, 580}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Queenstown Harbour, Stephen replied.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 690}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That&apos;s right, the sailor said. Fort Camden and Fort
Carlisle. That&apos;s where I hails from. My little woman&apos;s down there.
She&apos;s waiting for me, I know. <i>For England, home and beauty</i>.
She&apos;s my own true wife I haven&apos;t seen for seven years now, sailing about.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene &mdash; the
homecoming to the mariner&apos;s roadside shieling after having diddled Davy
Jones &mdash; a rainy night with a blind moon. Across the world for a wife.
Quite a number of stories there were on that particular Alice Ben Bolt topic,
Enoch Arden and Rip van Winkle and does anybody hereabouts remember Caoc
O&apos;Leary, a favourite and most trying declamation piece, by the way, of poor
John Casey and a bit of perfect poetry in its
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">own
small</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font> way. Never
about the runaway wife coming back, however much devoted to the absentee. The
face at the window! Judge of his astonishment when he finally did breast the
tape and the awful truth dawned upon him anent his better half, wrecked in his
affections. You little expected me but I&apos;ve come to stay and make a fresh
start. There she sits, a grasswidow, at the selfsame fireside. Believes me dead,
rocked in the cradle of the deep. And there sits uncle

With a high ro! and a randy ro! and my galloping tearing tandy O! Bow to the

<p> The sailor, who scarcely seemed to be a Dublin resident, turned to one of the jarvies with the request:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You don&apos;t happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you, do you?</p>
<p> The jarvey addressed, as it happened, had not but the keeper took a die of
plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object was passed from hand to hand.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Thank you, the sailor said.</p>
<p> He deposited the quid in his gob and, chewing, and with some slow stammers, proceeded:
<br><font color="green">{u21, 691}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; We come up this morning eleven o&apos;clock. The
threemaster <i>Rosevean</i> from Bridgwater with bricks. I shipped to get over.
Paid off this afternoon. There&apos;s my discharge. See? W.B. Murphy. A.B.S.</p>
<p> In confirmation of which statement he extricated from an inside pocket and
handed to his neighbour a not very

looking</span></span>
<font color="black">cleanlooking</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font> folded document.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 581}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You must have seen a fair share of the world, the keeper remarked, leaning on the counter.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Why, the sailor answered upon reflection upon it,
I&apos;ve circumnavigated a bit since I first joined on. I was in the Red Sea. I
was in China and North America and South America. I seen icebergs plenty,
growlers. I was in Stockholm and the Black Sea, the Dardanelles, under Captain
Dalton, the best bloody man that ever scuttled a ship. I seen Russia. <i>Gospodi
pomilyou</i>. That&apos;s how the Russians prays.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You seen queer sights, don&apos;t be talking,
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">said</span></span>
<font color="black">put in</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font> a jarvey.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Why, the sailor said, shifting his partially chewed plug,
I seen queer things too, ups and downs. I seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an anchor same as I chew that quid.</p>
<p> He took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and, lodging it between his teeth, bit ferociously:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Khaan! Like that. And I seen maneaters in Peru that eats
corpses and the livers of horses. Look here. Here they are. A friend of mine sent me.</p>
<p> He fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket, which seemed to be
in its way a species of repository, and pushed it along the table. The printed
matter on it stated: <i>Choza de Indios. Beni, Bolivia.</i></p>
<p> All focussed their attention on the scene exhibited, at a group of savage
women in striped loincloths, squatted, blinking, suckling, frowning, sleeping,
amid a swarm of infants (there must have been quite a score of them) outside some primitive shanties of osier.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Chews coca all day long, the communicative tarpaulin
added. Stomachs like breadgraters. Cuts off their diddies when they can&apos;t
bear no more children. See them there stark ballocknaked eating a dead horse&apos;s liver raw.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 692}</font> </p>
<p> His postcard proved a centre of attraction
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">for
Messrs the

for several minutes, if not more.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Know how to keep them off? he inquired genially.</p>
<p> Nobody volunteering a statement, he winked, saying:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Glass. That boggles &apos;em. Glass.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom, without evincing surprise, unostentatiously turned over the card
to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark. It ran as follows:
<i>Tarjeta Postal, Se&ntilde;or A. Boudin, Galeria Becche, Santiago, Chile</i>.
There was no message evidently, as he took particular notice.</p>
<p> Though not an implicit believer in the lurid story narrated (or the
eggsniping transaction for that matter despite William Tell and the Lazarillo-Don Cesar de Bazan incident
<br><font color="green">{u22, 582}</font>
<br> depicted in <i>Maritana</i> on which occasion the former&apos;s ball passed
through the latter&apos;s hat), having detected a discrepancy between his
name<font color="red"><sup><small>|s8</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>s8|</small></sup></font>
(assuming he was the person he represented himself to be and not sailing under
false colours after having boxed the compass on the strict q.t. somewhere) and
the fictitious addressee of the missive which made him nourish some suspicions
of our friend&apos;s <i>bona fides</i> nevertheless it reminded him in a way of
a longcherished plan he meant to one day realise some Wednesday or Saturday of
travelling to London <i>via</i> long sea not to say that he had ever travelled
extensively to any great extent but he was at heart a born adventurer though by
a trick of fate he had consistently remained a landlubber except you call going
to Holyhead which was his longest. Martin Cunningham frequently said he would
work a pass through Egan but some deuced hitch or other eternally cropped up
with the net result that the scheme fell through. But even suppose it did come
to planking down the needful and breaking Boyd&apos;s heart it was not so dear,
purse permitting, a few guineas at the outside, considering the fare to
Mullingar where he figured on going was five and six there and back. The trip
would benefit health on account of the bracing ozone and be in every way
thoroughly pleasurable, especially for a chap whose liver was out of order,
seeing the different places along the route, Plymouth, Falmouth, Southampton and
so on, culminating in an instructive tour of the sights of the great metropolis,
<br><font color="green">{u21, 693}</font>
<br> the spectacle of our modern Babylon where doubtless he would see the
greatest improvement, tower, abbey, wealth of Park Lane to renew acquaintance
with. Another thing just struck him as a by no means bad notion was he might
have a gaze around on the spot to see about trying to make arrangements about a
concert tour of summer music embracing the most prominent pleasure resorts,
Margate with mixed bathing and firstrate hydros and spas, Eastbourne,
Scarborough, Margate and so on, beautiful Bournemouth, the Channel islands and
similar bijou spots, which might prove highly remunerative. Not, of course, with
a hole and corner scratch company

<br><font color="green">{u22, 583}</font> </p>
<p> Also, without being actually positive, it struck him a great field was to be
opened up in the line of opening up new routes to keep pace with the times
<i>apropos</i> of the Fishguard-Rosslare route which, it was mooted, was once
more on the <i>tapis</i> in the circumlocution departments with the usual
quantity of red tape and dillydallying of effete fogeydom and dunderheads
generally. A great opportunity there certainly was for push and enterprise to
meet the travelling needs of the public at large, the average man, i.e., Brown, Robinson and Co.</p>
<p> It was a subject of regret and absurd as well on the face of it and no small
blame to our vaunted society that the man in the street, when the system really
needed toning up, for a matter of a couple of paltry pounds, was debarred from
seeing more of the world they lived in instead of being always cooped up since
my old stick-in-the-mud took me for a wife. After all, hang it, they had their
eleven and more humdrum months of it and merited a radical change of
<i>venue</i> after the grind of city life in the summertime, for choice, when Dame Nature
<br><font color="green">{u21, 694}</font>
<br> is at her spectacular best, constituting nothing short of a new lease of
life. There were equally excellent opportunities for vacationists in the home

attractions as well as a bracing tonic for the system in and around Dublin

seemed to him, from a motive of curiosity pure and simple, was whether it was

turned back the other side of the card, picture, and passed it along to Stephen.

<p class="di">&mdash; I seen a Chinese one time, related the doughty narrator,
that had little pills like putty and he put them in the water and they opened,
and every pill was something different. One was a ship, another was a house,
another was a flower. Cooks rats in your soup, he appetisingly added, the Chinese does.</p>
<p> Possibly perceiving an expression of dubiosity on their faces, the
globetrotter went on, adhering to his adventures.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And I seen a man killed in Trieste by an Italian chap. Knife in his back. Knife like that.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 695}</font> </p>
<p> Whilst speaking he produced a dangerous looking claspknife, quite in keeping
with his character, and held it in the striking position.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; In a knockingshop it was count of a tryon between two
smugglers. Fellow hid behind a door, come up behind him. Like that. <i>Prepare

<p> His heavy glance, drowsily roaming about, kind of defied their further
questions even should they by any chance want to.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That&apos;s a good bit of steel, repeated he, examining his formidable <i>stiletto</i>.</p>
<p> After which harrowing <i>d&eacute;nouement</i> sufficient to appal the
stoutest he snapped the blade to and stowed the weapon in question away as
before in his chamber of horrors, otherwise pocket.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; They&apos;re great for the cold steel, somebody who was
evidently quite in the dark said for the benefit of them all. That was why they
thought the park murders of the invincibles was done by foreigners on account of them using knives.</p>
<p> At this remark, passed obviously in the spirit of <i>where ignorance is
bliss</i>, Mr Bloom and Stephen, each in his own particular way, both
instinctively exchanged meaning glances, in a religious silence of the strictly
<i>entre nous</i> variety however, towards where Skin-the-Goat, <i>alias</i> the
keeper, was drawing spurts of liquid from his boiler affair. His inscrutable
face, which was really a work of art, a perfect study in itself, beggaring
description, conveyed the impression that he didn&apos;t understand one jot of what was going on. Funny, very.</p>
<p> There ensued a somewhat lengthy pause. One man was reading by fits and
starts a stained by coffee evening journal; another, the card with the natives
<i>choza de</i>; another, the seaman&apos;s discharge. Mr Bloom, so far as he
was personally concerned, was just pondering in pensive mood. He vividly
recollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well as yesterday, some
score of years previously, in the days of the land troubles when it took the civilised world
<br><font color="green">{u22, 585}</font>
<br> by storm, figuratively speaking, early in the eighties, eightyone to be correct, when he was just turned fifteen.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 696}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ay, boss, the sailor broke in. Give us back them papers.</p>
<p> The request being complied with, he clawed them up with a scrape.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Have you seen the Rock of Gibraltar? Mr Bloom inquired.</p>
<p> The sailor grimaced, chewing, in a way that might be read as yes, ay, or no.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ah, you&apos;ve touched there too, Mr Bloom said, Europa
point, thinking he had, in the hope that the rover might possibly by some
reminiscences but he failed to do so, simply letting spurt a jet of spew into
the sawdust, and shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What year would that be about? Mr Bloom interpolated. Can you recall the boats?</p>
<p> Our <i>soi-disant</i> sailor munched heavily
awhile<font color="red"><sup><small>|s8</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>s8|</small></sup></font>
hungrily<font color="red"><sup><small>|s8</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>s8|</small></sup></font>
before answering.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I&apos;m tired of all them rocks in the sea, he said, and
boats and ships. Salt junk all the time.</p>
<p> Tired, seemingly, he ceased. His questioner, perceiving that he was not
likely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer, fell to
woolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the globe. Suffice
it to say that, as a casual glance at the map revealed, it covered fully three
fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly what it meant to rule the waves.
On more than one occasion &mdash; a dozen at the lowest &mdash; near the North
Bull at Dollymount he had remarked a superannuated old salt, evidently derelict,
seated habitually near the not particularly redolent sea on the wall, staring
quite obliviously at it and it at him, dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new
as someone somewhere sings. And it left him wondering why. Possibly he had tried
to find out the secret for himself, floundering up and down the antipodes and
all that sort of thing and over and under &mdash; well, not exactly under
&mdash; tempting the fates. And the odds were twenty to nil there was really no
secret about it at all. Nevertheless, without going into the <i>minutiae</i> of
the business, the eloquent fact remained that the sea was there in all its glory
and in the natural course of things somebody or other had to sail on it
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">and
<a name="un4048i" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4048i">fly in the face of

though it merely went to show how people usually contrived to load that sort
<br><font color="green">{u21, 697}</font>
<br> of onus on to the other fellow like the hell idea and the lottery and
insurance which were run on identically the same lines so that for that very
reason, if no other, lifeboat Sunday was a very laudable institution to which
the public at large, no matter where living, inland or seaside, as the case
might be, having it brought home to them like that, should extend its
<br><font color="green">{u22, 586}</font>
<br> gratitude also to the harbourmasters and coastguard service who had to man
the rigging and push off and out amid the elements, whatever the season, when
duty called <i>Ireland expects that every man</i> and so on and sometimes had a
terrible time of it in the wintertime not forgetting the Irish lights, Kish and
others, liable to capsize at any moment rounding which he once with his daughter
had experienced some remarkably choppy, not to say stormy, weather.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There was a fellow sailed with me in the <i>Rover</i>, the
old seadog, himself a rover, proceeded, went ashore and took up a soft job as
gentleman&apos;s valet at six quid a month. Them are his trousers I&apos;ve on
me and he gave me an oilskin and that jackknife. I&apos;m game for that job,
shaving and brushup. I hate roaming about. There&apos;s my son now, Danny, run
off to sea and his mother got him took in a draper&apos;s in Cork where he could be drawing easy money.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What age is he? queried one hearer who, by the way, seen
from the side, bore a distant resemblance to Henry Campbell, the townclerk, away
from the
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">carking</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>
cares of office, unwashed, of course, and in a seedy getup and a strong
suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Why, the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance, my
son, Danny? He&apos;d be about eighteen now, way I figure it.</p>
<p>
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">He</span></span>

his grey or unclean anyhow shirt with his two hands and scratched away at his
chest on which was to be seen an image tattooed in blue Chinese ink, intended to represent an anchor.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There was lice in that bunk in Bridgwater, he remarked,
sure as nuts. I must get a wash tomorrow or next day. It&apos;s them black lads

to. I hate those buggers. Sucks your blood dry, they does.</p>
<p> Seeing they were all looking at his chest, he accomodatingly
<br><font color="green">{u21, 698}</font>
<br> dragged his shirt more open so that, on top of the timehonoured symbol of
the mariner&apos;s hope and rest, they had a full view of the figure 16 and a
young man&apos;s sideface looking frowningly rather.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Tattoo, the exhibitor explained. That was done when we
were lying becalmed off Odessa in the Black Sea under Captain Dalton. Fellow the
name of Antonio done that. There he is himself, a Greek.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Did it hurt much doing it? one asked the sailor.</p>
<p> That worthy, however, was busily engaged in collecting round the. Someway in
his. Squeezing
or<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span>
<font color="black">&nbsp;&hellip;</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; See here, he said, showing Antonio. There he is, cursing
the mate. And there he is now, he added, the same fellow, pulling the skin with
his fingers, some special knack evidently, and he laughing at a yarn.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 587}</font> </p>
<p> And in point of fact the young man named Antonio&apos;s livid face did
actually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the unreserved
admiration of everybody, including Skin-the-Goat, who this time stretched over.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ay, ay, sighed the sailor, looking down on his manly
chest. He&apos;s gone too. Ate by sharks after. Ay, ay.</p>
<p> He let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression of before.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Neat bit of work, one longshoreman said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And what&apos;s the number for? loafer number two queried.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Eaten alive? a third asked the sailor.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ay, ay, sighed again the latter personage, more cheerily
this time, with some sort of a half smile, for a brief duration only, in the
direction of the questioner about the number. A Greek he was.</p>

<p> The face of a streetwalker, glazed and haggard under a black straw hat,
peered askew round the door of the shelter, palpably reconnoitring on her own
with the object of bringing more grist to her mill. Mr
Bloom<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">,
<br><font color="green">{u21, 699}</font>
<br> scarcely knowing which way to
look,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font> turned away on
the moment, flusterfied but outwardly calm, and, picking up from the table the
pink sheet of the Abbey street organ which the jarvey, if such he was, had laid
aside, he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though why pink? His
reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round the door the same face
he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that afternoon on Ormond Quay, the partially
idiotic female, namely, of the lane, who knew the lady in the brown costume does
be with you (Mrs B.), and begged the chance of his washing. Also why washing, which seemed rather vague than not?</p>
<p> Your washing. Still, candour compelled him to admit that he had washed his
wife&apos;s undergarments when soiled in Holles street and women would and did
too a man&apos;s similar garments initialled with Bewley and Draper&apos;s
marking ink (hers were, that is) if they really loved him, that is to say. Love
me, love my dirty shirt. Still, just then, being on tenterhooks, he desired the
female&apos;s room more than her company so it came as a genuine relief when the
keeper made her a rude sign to take herself off. Round the side of the
<br><font color="green">{u22, 588}</font>
<br> <i>Evening Telegraph</i> he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face
round the side of the door with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she
was not exactly all there, viewing with evident amusement the group of gazers
round Skipper Murphy&apos;s nautical chest and then there was no more of her.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The gunboat, the keeper said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It beats me, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen, medically I am
speaking, how a wretched creature like that from the Lock Hospital, reeking with
disease, can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober senses,
if he values his health in the least. Unfortunate creature! Of course, I suppose
some man is ultimately responsible for her condition. Still no matter what the cause is from&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> Stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders, merely remarking:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; In this country people sell much more than she ever had
and do a roaring trade. Fear not them that sell the body but have not power to
buy the soul. She is a bad merchant. She buys dear and sells cheap.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 700}</font> </p>
<p> The elder man, though not by any manner of means
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">an old
maid or</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font> a prude,
said that it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be put a stop
to <i>instanter</i> to say that women of that stamp (quite apart from any
oldmaidish squeamishness on the subject), a necessary evil, were not licensed
and medically inspected by the proper authorities, a thing he could truthfully
state
he<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>
as a
paterfamias<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>
was a stalwart advocate of from the very first start. Whoever embarked on a
policy of the sort, he said, and ventilated the matter thoroughly would confer a
lasting boon on everybody concerned.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You, as a good catholic, he observed, talking of body and
soul, believe in the soul. Or do you mean the intelligence, the brainpower as
such, as distinct from any outside object, the table, let us say, that cup? I
believe in that myself because it has been explained by competent men as the
convolutions of the grey matter. Otherwise we would never have such inventions as X rays, for instance. Do you?</p>
<p> Thus cornered, Stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try and
concentrate and remember before he could say:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; They tell me on the best authority it is a simple
substance and therefore incorruptible. It would be immortal, I understand, but
for the possibility of its annihilation by its First Cause, Who, from all I can
hear, is quite capable of adding that to the number of His other practical
jokes, <i>corruptio per se</i> and <i>corruptio per accidens</i> both being excluded by court etiquette.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 589}</font> </p>
<p> Mr Bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the
mystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he felt
bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple, promptly rejoining:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Simple? I shouldn&apos;t think that is the proper word. Of
course, I grant you, to concede a point, you do knock across a simple soul once
in a blue moon. But what I am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for
instance to invent those rays R&ouml;ntgen did, or the telescope like Edison,
though I believe it was before his time, Galileo was the man I mean. The same
applies to the laws, for example, of a farreaching natural phenomenon such as
electricity but it&apos;s a horse of quite another colour to say you believe in the existence of a supernatural God.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 701}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O that, Stephen expostulated, has been proved conclusively
by several of the bestknown passages in Holy Writ, apart from circumstantial evidence.</p>
<p> On this knotty point, however, the views of the pair, poles apart as they
were, both in schooling and everything else, with the marked difference in their respective ages, clashed.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Has been? the more experienced of the two objected,
sticking to his original point. I&apos;m not so sure about that. That&apos;s a
matter of every man&apos;s opinion and, without dragging in the sectarian side
of the business, I beg to differ with you <i>in toto</i> there. My belief is, to
tell you the candid truth, that those bits were genuine forgeries all of them
put in by monks most probably or it&apos;s the big question of our national poet
over again, who precisely wrote them, like <i>Hamlet</i> and Bacon, as, you who
know your Shakespeare infinitely better than I, of course I needn&apos;t tell
you. Can&apos;t you drink that coffee, by the way? Let me stir it. And take a
piece of that bun. It&apos;s like one of our skipper&apos;s bricks disguised.
Still, no-one can give what he hasn&apos;t got. Try a bit.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Couldn&apos;t, Stephen contrived to get out, his mental
organs for the moment refusing to dictate further.</p>
<p> Faultfinding being a proverbially bad hat, Mr Bloom thought well to stir, or
try to, the clotted sugar from the bottom and reflected with something
approaching acrimony on the Coffee Palace and its temperance (and lucrative)
work. To be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond yea or nay did a world of
good, shelters such as the present one they were in run on teetotal lines for
vagrants at night, concerts, dramatic evenings and useful lectures (admittance
free) by qualified men for the lower orders. On the other hand, he had a
distinct
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">and
painful</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font> recollection
they paid his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy, who had been prominently associated with it at one time,
<br><font color="green">{u22, 590}</font>
<br> a very modest remuneration indeed for her pianoplaying. The idea, he was
strongly inclined to believe, was to do good and net a profit, there being no
competition to speak of. Sulphate of copper poison SO<sub><small>4</small></sub>
or something in some dried peas he remembered reading of in a cheap eatinghouse
somewhere but he couldn&apos;t remember when it was or where. Anyhow,
<br><font color="green">{u21, 702}</font>
<br> inspection, medical inspection, of all eatables, seemed to him more than
ever necessary which possibly accounted for the vogue of Dr Tibble&apos;s
Vi-Cocoa on account of the medical analysis involved.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Have a shot at it now, he ventured to say of the coffee after being stirred.</p>
<p> Thus prevailed on to at any rate taste it, Stephen lifted the heavy mug from
the brown puddle &mdash; it clopped out of it when taken up &mdash; by the
handle and took a sip of the offending beverage.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Still, it&apos;s solid food, his good genius urged,
I&apos;m a stickler for solid food, his one and only reason being not
gormandising in the least but regular meals as the <i>sine qua non</i> for any
kind of proper work, mental or manual. You ought to eat more solid food. You would feel a different man.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Liquids I can eat, Stephen said. But oblige me by taking
away that knife. I can&apos;t look at the point of it. It reminds me of Roman history.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated article, a
blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly Roman or antique
about it to the
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">lay</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>
eye, observing that the point was the least conspicuous point about it.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Our mutual friend&apos;s stories are like himself, Mr
Bloom,
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">apropos</span></span>
<font color="black"><i>apropos</i></font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>
of knives, remarked to his <i>confidante sotto voce</i>. Do you think they are
genuine? He could spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and lie like old boots. Look at him.</p>
<p> Yet still, though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air, life was full
of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it was quite
within the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire fabrication though at
first blush there was not much inherent probability in all the spoof he got off
his chest being strictly accurate gospel.</p>
<p> He had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him and
Sherlockholmesing him up
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">ever
since he clapped eyes on
him</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>. Though a
wellpreserved man of no little stamina, if a trifle prone to baldness, there was something spurious in the cut of his
<br><font color="green">{u21, 703}</font>
<br> jib that suggested a jail delivery and it required no violent stretch of
imagination to associate such a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill fraternity.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 591}</font>
<br> He might even have done for his man, supposing it was his own case he told,
as people often did about others, namely, that he killed him himself and had
served his four or five goodlooking years in durance vile to say nothing of the
Antonio personage (no relation to the dramatic personage of identical name who
sprang from the pen of our national poet) who expiated his crimes in the
melodramatic manner above described. On the other hand he might be only
bluffing, a pardonable weakness, because meeting unmistakable mugs, Dublin
residents, like those jarvies waiting news from abroad, would tempt any ancient
mariner who sailed the ocean seas to draw the long bow about the schooner
<i>Hesperus</i> and etcetera. And when all was said and done, the lies a fellow
told about himself couldn&apos;t probably hold a proverbial candle to the
wholesale whoppers other fellows coined about him.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Mind you, I&apos;m not saying that it&apos;s all a pure
invention, he resumed. Analogous scenes are occasionally, if not often, met
with. Giants, though, that is rather a far cry, you see once in a way. Marcella,
the midget queen. In those waxworks in Henry street I myself saw some Aztecs, as
they are called, sitting bowlegged. They couldn&apos;t straighten their legs if
you paid them because the muscles here, you see, he proceeded, indicating on his
companion the brief outline, the sinews, or whatever you like to call them,
behind the right knee, were utterly powerless from sitting that way so long
cramped up, being adored as gods. There&apos;s an example again of simple souls.</p>
<p> However, reverting to friend Sinbad and his horrifying adventures (who
reminded him a bit of Ludwig, <i>alias</i> Ledwidge, when he occupied the boards
of the Gaiety when Michael Gunn was identified with the management in the
<i>Flying Dutchman</i>, a stupendous success, and his host of admirers came in
large numbers, everyone simply flocking to hear him
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black"><a name="un4048bh" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4048bh">though
ships of any sort<font color="red"><sup><small>|a</small></sup></font>, phantom
or the reverse,<font color="red"><sup><small>a|</small></sup></font> on the
stage usually fell a bit flat as also did
trains</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>), there
was nothing intrinsically incompatible about it, he conceded. On the contrary, that stab in the
<br><font color="green">{u21, 704}</font>
<br> back touch was quite in keeping with those Italianos, though candidly he
was none the less free to admit those ice creamers and friers in the fish way
not to mention the chip potato variety and so forth over in little Italy there,
near the Coombe, were sober thrifty hardworking fellows except perhaps a bit too
given to pothunting the harmless necessary animal of the feline persuasion of
others at night so as to have a good old succulent tuckin with garlic <i>de
rigueur</i> off him or her next day on the quiet and, he added, on the cheap.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Spaniards, for instance, he continued, passionate temperaments like
<br><font color="green">{u22, 592}</font>
<br> that, impetuous as Old Nick, are given to taking the law into their own
hands and give you your quietus doublequick with those poignards they carry in
the abdomen. It comes from the great heat, climate generally. My wife is, so to
speak, Spanish, half, that is. Point of fact she could actually claim Spanish
nationality if she wanted, having been born in (technically) Spain, i.e.
Gibraltar. She has the Spanish type. Quite dark, regular brunette, black. I, for
one, certainly believe climate accounts for character. That&apos;s why I asked
you if you wrote your poetry in Italian.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The temperaments at the door, Stephen interposed with,
were very passionate about
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">five</span></span>
<font color="black">ten</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>
shillings. <i>Roberto ruba roba sua</i>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Quite so, Mr Bloom dittoed.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Then, Stephen said, staring and rambling on to himself or
some unknown listener somewhere, we have the impetuosity of Dante and the
isosceles triangle, Miss Portinari he fell in love with and Leonardo and san Tommaso Mastino.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It&apos;s in the blood, Mr Bloom acceded at once. All are
washed in the blood of the sun. Coincidence, I just happened to be in the
Kildare Street Museum today, shortly prior to our meeting, if I can so call it,
and I was just looking at those antique statues there. The splendid proportions
of hips, bosom. You simply don&apos;t knock against those kind of women here. An
exception here and there. Handsome, yes, pretty in a way you find, but
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">what</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>
I&apos;m talking about
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">is</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>
the female form. Besides, they have so little taste in dress, most of
them<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">,
which <a name="un4043ah" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4043ah">greatly
enhances</a> a woman&apos;s natural beauty, no matter what you
say</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 705}</font>
<br> Rumpled stockings &mdash; it may be, possibly is, a foible of mine, but
still it&apos;s a thing I simply hate to see.</p>
<p> Interest, however, was starting to flag somewhat all round and the others
got on to talking about accidents at sea, ships lost in a fog, collisions with
icebergs, all that sort of thing. Shipahoy, of course, had his own say to say.
He had doubled the Cape a few odd times and weathered a monsoon, a kind of wind,
in the China seas and through all those perils of the deep there was one thing,
he declared, stood to him, or words to that effect, a pious medal he had that saved him.</p>
<p> So then after that they drifted on to the wreck off Daunt&apos;s rock, wreck
of that illfated Norwegian barque &mdash; nobody could think of her name for the
moment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of Henry Campbell remembered
it, <i>Palme</i>, on Booterstown Strand, that was the talk of the town that year
(Albert William Quill wrote a fine piece of original verse of distinctive merit
<br><font color="green">{u22, 593}</font>
<br> on the topic for the <i>Irish Times</i>), breakers running over her and
crowds and crowds on the shore in commotion petrified with horror. Then someone
said something about the case of the s.s. <i>Lady Cairns</i> of Swansea, run
into by the <i>Mona</i>, which was on an opposite tack, in rather muggyish
weather and lost with all hands on deck. No aid was given. Her master, the
<i>Mona</i>&apos;s, said he was afraid his collision bulkhead would give way.
She had no water, it appears, in her hold.</p>
<p> At this stage an incident happened. It having become necessary for him to
unfurl a reef, the sailor vacated his seat.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Let me cross your bows, mate, he said to his neighbour,
who was just gently dropping off into a peaceful doze.</p>
<p> He made tracks heavily, slowly, with a dumpy sort of a gait to the door,
stepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter and bore due
left. While he was in the act of getting his bearings, Mr Bloom, who noticed
when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ship&apos;s rum sticking
one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his burning interior, saw
him produce a bottle and uncork it, or unscrew, and, applying its nozzle to his
lips, take a good old delectable swig out of it

<font color="black">that the old

had disappeared to all intents and purposes, could, by straining, just perceive
him, when duly refreshed by his rum puncheon exploit, gazing up at the piers and
girders of the Loop Line, rather out of his depth, as of course it was all
radically altered since his last visit and greatly improved. Some person or
persons invisible directed him to the male urinal erected by the cleansing
committee all over the place for the purpose but, after a brief space of time
during which silence reigned supreme, the sailor, evidently giving it a wide
berth, eased himself closer at hand, the noise of his bilgewater some little
time subsequently splashing on the ground where it apparently awoke a horse of the cabrank.</p>

<br> of Morpheus, a truly amazing piece of hard times in its most virulent form
on a fellow most respectably connected and familiarised with decent home
comforts all his life who came in for a cool &pound;100 a year at one time which
of course the doublebarrelled ass proceeded to make general ducks and drakes of.
And there he was at the end of his tether after having often painted the town
tolerably pink, without a beggarly stiver. He drank, needless to be told, and it
pointed only once more a moral when he might quite easily be in a large way of
business if &mdash; a big if, however &mdash; he had contrived to cure himself of his particular partiality.</p>
<p> All, meantime, were loudly lamenting the falling off in Irish shipping,
coastwise and foreign as well, which was all part and parcel of the same thing.
A Palgrave Murphy boat was put off the ways at Alexandra Basin, the only launch
that year. Right enough the harbours were there only no ships ever called.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 707}</font> </p>
<p> There were wrecks and wrecks, the keeper said, who was evidently <i>au fait</i>.</p>
<p> What he wanted to ascertain was why that ship ran bang against the only rock
in Galway Bay when the Galway Harbour scheme was mooted

growled in wouldbe music, but with great vim, some kind of chanty or other in
seconds or thirds. Mr Bloom&apos;s sharp ears heard him then expectorate the
plug probably (which it was), so that he must have lodged it for the time being
in his fist while he did the drinking and making water jobs and found it a bit
sour after the liquid fire in question. Anyhow in he rolled

<p> Skin-the-Goat, assuming he was he, evidently with an axe to grind, was
airing his grievances in a forcible-feeble philippic anent the natural resources
of Ireland, or something of that sort, which he described in his lengthy
dissertation as the richest country bar none on the face of God&apos;s earth,
far and away superior to England, with coal in large quantities, six million
pounds&apos; worth of pork exported every year, ten millions between butter and
eggs, and all the riches drained out of it by England levying taxes on the poor
people that paid through the nose always, and gobbling up the best meat in the market, and a lot more

<br> surplus steam in the same vein. Their conversation accordingly became
general and all agreed that that was a fact. You could grow any mortal thing in
Irish soil, he stated, and there was Colonel Everard down there in Navan growing
tobacco. Where would you find anywhere the like of Irish bacon? But a day of
reckoning, he stated
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black"><i>crescendo</i></font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>
with no uncertain voice &mdash; thoroughly monopolising all the conversation
&mdash; was in store for mighty England, despite her power of pelf on account of
her crimes. There would be a fall and the greatest fall in history. The Germans
and the Japs were going to have their little lookin, he affirmed. The Boers were
the beginning of the end. Brummagem England was toppling already and her
downfall would be Ireland, her Achilles heel, which he explained to them about
the vulnerable point of Achilles, the Greek hero &mdash; a point his auditors at
once seized as he

His advice to every Irishman was: stay in the land of your birth and work for
Ireland and live for Ireland. Ireland, Parnell said, could not spare a single one of her sons.</p>
<p> Silence all round marked the termination of his <i>finale</i>. The

<p class="di">&mdash; Who&apos;s the best troops in the army? the grizzled old

<p class="di">&mdash; That&apos;s right, the old tarpaulin corroborated. The
Irish catholic peasant. He&apos;s the backbone of our empire. You know Jem Mullins?</p>
<p> While allowing him his individual opinions, as every man, the keeper added
he cared nothing for any empire, ours or his, and considered no Irishman worthy
of his salt that served it. Then they began to have a few irascible words, when it waxed hotter, both,

<br> needless to say, appealing to the listeners who followed the passage of
arms with interest so long as they didn&apos;t indulge in recriminations and come to blows.</p>
<p> From inside information extending over a series of years Mr Bloom was rather
inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash for, pending that
consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for, he was fully cognisant of
the fact that their neighbours across the channel, unless they were much bigger
fools than he took them for, rather concealed their strength than the opposite.
It was quite on a par with the quixotic idea in certain quarters that in a
hundred million years the coal seam of the sister island would be played out and
if<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>
as time went
on<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>
that turned out to be how the cat jumped all he could personally say on the
matter was that as a host of contingencies, equally relevant to the issue, might
occur ere then it was highly advisable in the interim to try to make the most of
both countries, even though poles apart. Another little interesting point, the
amours of whores and chummies, to put it in common parlance, reminded him Irish
soldiers had as often fought for England as against her, more so, in fact. And
now, why? So the scene between the pair of them, the licensee of the place,
rumoured to be or have been Fitzharris, the famous invincible, and the other,
obviously bogus, reminded him forcibly as being on all fours with the confidence
trick, supposing, that is, it was prearranged, as the lookeron, a student of the
human soul, if anything, the others seeing least of the game. And as for the
lessee or keeper, who probably wasn&apos;t the other person at all, he (Bloom)
couldn&apos;t help feeling, and most properly, it was better to give people like
that the goby unless you were a blithering idiot altogether and refuse to have
anything to do with them as a golden rule in private life and their
felonsetting, there always being the offchance of a Dannyman coming forward and
turning

now &mdash; like Denis or Peter Carey, an idea he utterly repudiated. Quite
apart from that, he disliked those careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle.
Yet, though such criminal propensities had never been an inmate of his bosom in
any shape or form, he certainly did feel, and no denying it (while inwardly
<br><font color="green">{u21, 710}</font>
<br> remaining what he was), a certain
<br><font color="green">{u22, 597}</font>
<br> kind of admiration for a man who had actually brandished a knife, cold
steel, with the courage of his political convictions (though, personally, he
would never be a party to any such thing),
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">on
all fours with</span></span> <font color="black">off the same bat
as</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font> those love
vendettas of the south &mdash; have her or swing for her &mdash; when the
husband frequently, after some words passed between the two concerning her
relations with the other lucky man (he having had the pair watched), inflicted
fatal injuries on his adored one as a result of an alternative postnuptial
<i>liaison</i> by plunging his knife into her until it just struck him that
Fitz, nicknamed Skin-the-Goat, merely drove the car for the actual perpetrators
of the outrage and so was not, if he was reliably informed, actually party to
the ambush which, in point of fact, was the plea some legal luminary saved his
skin on. In any case that was very ancient history by now and as for our friend,
the pseudo Skin-the-etcetera, he had transparently outlived his welcome. He
ought to have either died naturally or on the scaffold high. Like actresses,
always farewell &mdash; positively last performance &mdash; then come up smiling
again. Generous to a fault, of course, temperamental, no economising or any idea
of the sort, always snapping at the bone for the shadow. So similarly he had a
very shrewd suspicion that Mr Johnny Lever got rid of some &pound;. s. d. in the
course of his perambulations round the docks in the congenial atmosphere of the
<i>Old Ireland</i> tavern, come back to Erin and so on. Then as for the other,
he had heard not so long before the same identical lingo, as he told Stephen how
he simply but effectually silenced the offender.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He took umbrage at something or other, that muchinjured
but on the whole eventempered person declared, I let slip. He called me a jew,
and in a heated fashion, offensively. So I, without deviating from plain facts
in the least, told him his God, I mean Christ, was a jew too, and all his
family, like me, though in reality I&apos;m not. That was one for him. A soft
answer turns away wrath. He hadn&apos;t a word to say for himself as everyone saw. Am I not right?</p>
<p> He turned a long you are wrong gaze on Stephen of timorous dark pride at the
soft impeachment, with a glance also of entreaty for he
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">seem</span></span>
<font color="black">seemed</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>
to glean in a kind of a way that it wasn&apos;t all exactly&nbsp;&hellip;
<br><font color="green">{u21, 711}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>Ex quibus</i>, Stephen mumbled in a noncommital accent,
their two or four eyes conversing, <i>Christus</i> or Bloom his name is, or,
after all, any other, <i>secundum carnem</i>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Of course, Mr Bloom proceeded to stipulate, you must look
at both sides of the question. It is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to right
<br><font color="green">{u22, 598}</font>
<br> and wrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is though
every country, they say, our own distressful included, has the government it
deserves. But with a little goodwill all round. It&apos;s all very fine to boast
of mutual superiority but what about mutual equality? I resent violence and
intolerance in any shape or form. It never reaches anything or stops anything. A
revolution must come on the due instalments plan. It&apos;s a patent absurdity
on the face of it to hate people because they live round the corner and speak another vernacular, so to speak.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Memorable bloody bridge battle and seven minutes&apos;
war, Stephen assented, between Skinner&apos;s alley and Ormond market.</p>
<p> Yes, Mr Bloom thoroughly agreed, entirely endorsing the remark, that was
overwhelmingly right and the whole world was overwhelmingly full of that sort of thing.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You just took the words out of my mouth, he said. A
hocuspocus of conflicting evidence that candidly you couldn&apos;t remotely&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> All those wretched quarrels, in his humble opinion, stirring up bad blood,
from some bump of combativeness or gland of some kind, erroneously supposed to
be about a punctilio of honour and a flag, were very largely a question of the
money question which was at the back of everything, greed and jealousy, people never knowing when to stop.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; They accuse, remarked he audibly.</p>
<p> He turned away from the others, who probably &nbsp;&hellip; and spoke nearer
to, so as the others &nbsp;&hellip; in case they&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Jews, he softly imparted in an aside in Stephen&apos;s
ear, are accused of ruining. Not a vestige of truth in it, I can safely say.
History, &mdash; would you be surprised to learn? &mdash; proves up to the hilt
Spain decayed when the Inquisition hounded the jews out and England prospered
when Cromwell, an uncommonly able ruffian, who, in other respects has
<br><font color="green">{u21, 712}</font>
<br> much to answer for, imported them. Why? Because they are practical and are
proved to be so. I don&apos;t want to indulge in any &nbsp;&hellip; because you
know the standard works on the subject, and then, orthodox as you are
&nbsp;&hellip; But in the economic, not touching religion, domain, the priest
spells poverty. Spain again, you saw in the war, compared with

America. Turks. It&apos;s in the dogma. Because if they didn&apos;t believe
they&apos;d go straight to heaven when they die they&apos;d try to live better
&mdash; at least, so I think. That&apos;s the juggle on which the p.p.&apos;s
raise the wind on false pretences. I&apos;m, he resumed with dramatic force, as
good an Irishman as that rude person I told you about at the outset and I want to see
<br><font color="green">{u22, 599}</font>
<br> everyone, concluded he, all creeds and classes <i>pro rata</i> having a
comfortable tidysized income, in no niggard fashion either, something in the
neighbourhood of &pound;300 per annum. That&apos;s the vital issue at stake and
it&apos;s feasible and would be provocative of friendlier intercourse between
man and man. At least that&apos;s my idea for what it&apos;s worth. I call that
patriotism. <i>Ubi patria</i>, as we learned a small smattering of in our
classical days in <i>Alma Mater</i>, <i>vita bene</i>. Where you can live well, the sense is, if you work.</p>
<p> Over his untastable apology for a cup of coffee, listening to this synopsis
of things in general, Stephen stared at nothing in particular. He could hear, of
course, all kinds of words changing colour like those crabs about Ringsend in
the morning burrowing quickly into all colours of different sorts of the same
sand where they had a home somewhere beneath or seemed to. Then he looked up and
saw the eyes that said or didn&apos;t say the words the voice he heard said &mdash; if you work.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Count me out, he managed to remark, meaning work.</p>
<p> The eyes were surprised at this observation because as he, the person who
owned them pro. tem. observed, or rather his voice speaking did, all must work, have to, together.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I mean, of course, the other hastened to affirm, work in
the widest possible sense. Also literary labour, not merely for the kudos of the
thing. Writing for the newspapers which is the readiest channel nowadays.
That&apos;s work too. Important work. After all, from the little I know of you,
after all the money expended on your education, you are
<br><font color="green">{u21, 714}</font>
<br> entitled to recoup yourself and command your price. You have every bit as
much right to live by your pen in pursuit of your philosophy as the peasant has.
What? You both belong to Ireland, the brain and the brawn. Each is equally important.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You suspect, Stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh,
that I may be important because I belong to the <i>faubourg</i>

<font color="black"><i>Saint-Patrice</i></font><font color="red"><sup><small>s8|</small></sup></font>
called Ireland for short.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I would go a step farther, Mr Bloom insinuated.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; But I suspect, Stephen interrupted, that Ireland must be important because it belongs to me.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What belongs? queried Mr Bloom, bending, fancying he was
perhaps under
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">a</span></span>
<font color="black">some</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>
misapprehension. Excuse me. Unfortunately I didn&apos;t catch the latter portion. What was it you&nbsp;&hellip;?</p>
<p> Stephen, patently crosstempered, repeated and shoved aside his mug of
coffee, or whatever you like to call it, none too politely, adding:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; We can&apos;t change the country. Let us change the subject.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 600}</font> </p>
<p> At this pertinent suggestion Mr Bloom, to change the subject, looked down,
but in a quandary, as he couldn&apos;t tell exactly what construction to put on
belongs to which sounded rather a far cry. The rebuke of some kind was clearer
than the other part. Needless to say, the fumes of his recent orgy spoke then
with some asperity in a curious bitter way foreign to his sober state. Probably
the home life, to which Mr Bloom attached the utmost importance, had not been
all that was needful or he hadn&apos;t been familiarised with the right sort of
people. With a touch of fear for the young man beside him, whom he furtively
scrutinised with an air of some consternation, remembering he had just come back
from Paris, the eyes more especially reminding him forcibly of father and
sister, failing to throw much light on the subject, however, he brought to mind
instances of cultured fellows that promised so brilliantly nipped in the bud of
premature decay, and nobody to blame but themselves. For instance, there was the
case of O&apos;Callaghan, for one, the half crazy faddist, respectably
connected, though of inadequate means, with his mad vagaries, among whose other
gay doings when rotto and making himself a nuisance to everybody
<br><font color="green">{u21, 714}</font>
<br> all round he was in the habit of ostentatiously sporting in public a suit
of brown paper (a fact). And then the usual <i>d&eacute;nouement</i> after the
fun had gone on fast and furious he got landed into hot water and had to be
spirited away by a few friends, after a strong hint
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">to a
blind horse</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font> from
John Mallon of Lower Castle Yard, so as not to be made amenable under section

Briefly, putting two and two together, six sixteen, which he pointedly turned a
deaf ear to, Antonio and so forth, jockeys and esthetes and the tattoo which was
all the go in the seventies or thereabouts, even in the House of Lords, because
early in life the occupant of the throne, then heir apparent, the other members
of the upper ten and other high personages simply following in the footsteps of
the head of the state, he reflected about the errors of notorieties and crowned
heads running counter to morality such as the Cornwall case a number of years
before under their veneer in a way scarcely intended by nature, a thing good Mrs
Grundy, as the law stands, was terribly down on, though not for the reason they
thought they were probably, whatever it was, except women chiefly, who were
always fiddling more or less at one another, it being largely a matter of dress
and all the rest of it. Ladies who like distinctive underclothing should, and every
<br><font color="green">{u22, 601}</font>
<br> welltailored man must, trying to make the gap wider between them by
innuendo and give more of a genuine filip to acts of impropriety between the
two, she unbuttoned his and then he untied her, mind the pin, whereas savages in

several shillings to the bad, having, in fact, let himself in for it. Still, to cultivate the

reflection would amply repay any small&nbsp;&hellip; Intellectual stimulation as
such was, he felt, from time to time a firstrate tonic for the mind. Added to
which was the coincidence of meeting, discussion, dance, row, old salt of the

ways of bringing off a coup. Lovemaking damages. Though that halfbaked Lyons ran
off at a tangent in his impetuosity to get left. Of course gambling eminently
lent itself to that sort of thing though, as the event turned out, the poor fool
hadn&apos;t much reason to congratulate himself on his pick, the forlorn hope.
Guesswork it reduced itself to
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">eventually</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There was every indication they would arrive at that, he, Bloom, said.</p>

coffin they brought over was full of stones. He changed his name to De Wet, the
Boer general. He made a mistake to fight the priests. And so forth and so on.</p>
<p> All the same Bloom (properly so dubbed) was rather surprised at their
memories for in nine cases out of ten it was a case of tarbarrels, and not
singly but in their thousands, and then complete oblivion because it was twenty
odd years. Highly unlikely, of course, there was even a shadow of truth in the
stones and, even supposing, he thought a return highly inadvisable, all things
considered. Something evidently riled them in his death. Either he petered out
too tamely of acute pneumonia just when his various
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">different</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>
political arrangements were
<br><font color="green">{u21, 718}</font>
<br> nearing completion or whether it transpired he owed his death to his having
neglected to change his boots and clothes after a wetting when a cold resulted
and failing to consult a specialist he being confined to his room till he
eventually died of it amid widespread regret before a fortnight was at an end or
quite possibly they were distressed to find the job was taken out of their
hands. Of course nobody being acquainted with his movements even before, there
was absolutely no clue as to his whereabouts
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">which
were decidedly of the <i>Alice, where art thou</i> order even prior to his
starting to go under several aliases such as Fox and
Stewart</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font> so the
<br><font color="green">{u22, 604}</font>
<br> remark which emanated from friend cabby might be within the bounds of
possibility. Naturally then, it would prey on his mind as a born leader of men,
which undoubtedly he was, and a commanding figure, a sixfooter or at any rate
five feet ten or eleven in his stockinged feet, whereas Messrs So-and-So who,
though they weren&apos;t even a patch on the former man, ruled the roost after
their redeeming features were very few and far between. It certainly pointed a
moral, the idol with feet of clay. And then seventytwo of his trusty henchmen
rounding on him with mutual mudslinging. And the identical same with murderers.
You had to come back &mdash; that haunting sense kind of drew you &mdash; to
show the understudy in the title <i>r&ocirc;le</i> how to. He saw him once on
the auspicious occasion when they broke up the type in the <i>Insuppressible</i>
or was it <i>United Ireland</i>, a privilege he keenly appreciated, and, in
point of fact, handed him his silk hat when it was knocked off and he said
<i>Thank you</i>, excited as he undoubtedly was under his frigid expression
notwithstanding the little misadventure mentioned between the cup and the lip
&mdash; what&apos;s bred in the bone. Still, as regards return, you were a lucky
dog if they didn&apos;t set the terrier at you directly you got back. Then a lot
of shillyshally usually followed, Tom for and Dick and Harry against. And then,
number one, you came up against the man in possession and had to produce your
credentials, like the claimant in the Tichborne case, Roger Charles Tichborne,
<i>Bella</i> was the boat&apos;s name to the best of his recollection he, the
heir, went down in, as the evidence went to show, and there was a tattoo mark
too in Indian ink, Lord Bellew, was it? As he might very
<br><font color="green">{u21, 719}</font>
<br> easily have picked up the details from some pal on board ship and
then<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">,
when got up to tally with the description
given,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font> introduce
himself with, <i>Excuse me, my name is So-and-So</i> or some such commonplace
remark. A more prudent course, as Bloom said to the not over
effusive<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>
in fact like the distinguished personage under discussion beside him, would have
been to sound the lie of the land first.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That bitch, that English whore, did for him, the shebeen
proprietor commented. She put the first nail in his coffin.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Fine lump of a woman, all the same, the <i>soi-disant</i>
townclerk Henry Campbell remarked, and plenty of her. I seen her picture in a
barber&apos;s. Her husband was a captain or an officer.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ay, Skin-the-Goat amusingly added. He was, and a cottonball one.</p>
<p> This gratuitous contribution of a humorous character occasioned a fair
amount of laughter among his <i>entourage</i>. As regards Bloom,
he<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">,
without the faintest suspicion of a smile, merely
<a name="s16005as" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16005as">gazed in the
direction of the door</a> and</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font> reflected
<br><font color="green">{u22, 605}</font>
<br> upon the historic story which had aroused extraordinary interest at the
time when the facts, to make matters worse, were made public with the usual
affectionate letters that passed between them, full of sweet nothings. First, it
was strictly platonic till nature intervened and an attachment sprang up between
them, till it bit by bit matters came to a climax and the matter became the talk
of the town till the staggering blow came as a welcome intelligence to not a few
evildisposed, however, who were resolved upon encouraging his downfall though
the thing was public property all along though not to anything like the
sensational extent that it subsequently blossomed into. Since their names were
coupled, though, since he was her declared favourite, where was the particular
necessity to proclaim it to the rank and file from the housetops, the fact,
namely, that he had shared her bedroom, which came out in the witnessbox on oath
when a thrill went through the packed court literally electrifying everybody in
the shape of witnesses swearing to having witnessed him
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">on such
and such a particular
date</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font> in the act of
scrambling out of an upstairs apartment with the assistance of a ladder in night apparel, having gained admittance
<br><font color="green">{u21, 720}</font>
<br> in the same fashion, a fact that the weeklies, addicted to the lubric a
little, simply coined
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">shoals
of</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font> money out of.
Whereas the simple fact of the case was it was simply a case of the husband not
being up to the scratch with nothing in common between them beyond the name and
then a real man arriving on the scene, strong to the verge of weakness, falling
a victim to her
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">siren</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>
charms and forgetting home ties. The usual sequel, to bask in the loved
one&apos;s smiles. The eternal question of the life connubial, needless to say,
cropped up. Can real love, supposing there happens to be another chap in the
case, exist between married folk? Though it was no concern of theirs absolutely
if he regarded her with affection, carried away by a wave of folly. A
magnificent specimen of manhood he was truly, augmented obviously by gifts of a
high order as compared with the other military supernumerary, that is
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">(who
was just the usual everyday <i>farewell, my gallant captain</i> kind of an

peculiar way which she of course, woman, quickly perceived as highly likely to
carve his way to fame, which he almost bid fair to do till the priests and
ministers of the gospel as a whole, his erstwhile staunch adherents and his
beloved evicted tenants for whom he had done yeoman service in the rural parts
of the country by taking up the cudgels on their behalf in a way that exceeded
their most sanguine expectations, very effectually cooked his matrimonial goose, thereby heaping
<br><font color="green">{u22, 606}</font>
<br> coals of fire on his head, much in the same way as the
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">fabled</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>
ass&apos;s kick. Looking back now in a retrospective kind of arrangement, all
seemed a kind of dream. And then coming back was the worst thing you ever did
because it went without saying you would feel out of place as things always
moved with the times. Why, as he reflected, Irishtown Strand, a locality he had
not been in for quite a number of years, looked different somehow since, as it
happened, he went to
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">live</span></span>
<font color="black">reside</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>
on the north side. North or south, however, it was just the wellknown case of
hot passion, pure and simple, upsetting the applecart with a vengeance and just
bore out the very thing he was saying, as she also was Spanish or half so, types
that wouldn&apos;t do things by halves, passionate abandon
<br><font color="green">{u21, 721}</font>
<br> of the south, casting every shred of decency to the winds.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Just bears out what I was saying, he, with glowing bosom
said to Stephen. And, if I don&apos;t greatly mistake, she was Spanish too.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The king of Spain&apos;s daughter, Stephen answered,
adding something or other rather muddled about farewell and adieu to you Spanish
onions and the first land called the Deadman and from Ramhead to Scilly was so and so many&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Was she? Bloom ejaculated, surprised, though not
astonished by any means. I never heard that rumour before. Possible, especially
there, it was, as she lived there. So, Spain.</p>
<p> Carefully avoiding a book in his pocket <i>Sweets of</i>, which reminded him
by the by of that Capel street library book out of date, he took out his
pocketbook and, turning over the various contents rapidly, finally he&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Do you consider, by the by, he said, thoughtfully
selecting a faded photo which he laid on the table, that a Spanish type?</p>

charms on evidence in an open fashion, as she was in the full bloom of
womanhood, in evening dress cut ostentatiously low for the occasion to give a
liberal display of bosom, with more than

of breasts, her full lips parted, and some perfect teeth, standing near,
ostensibly with gravity, a piano, on the rest of which was <i>In Old Madrid</i>,
a ballad, pretty in its way, which was then all the vogue. Her (the lady&apos;s)
eyes, dark, large, looked at Stephen, about to smile about something to be
admired, Lafayette of Westmoreland street, Dublin&apos;s premier photographic

Tweedy, Bloom indicated. Taken a few years since. In or about &apos;96. Very like her then.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 607}</font> </p>
<p> Beside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his legal
wife who, he intimated, was the accomplished daughter of Major Brian Tweedy and
displayed at an early age remarkable proficiency as a singer having even made her bow to the public when
<br><font color="green">{u21, 722}</font>
<br> her years numbered barely sweet sixteen. As for the face, it was a speaking
likeness in expression but it did not do justice to her figure, which came in
for a lot of notice usually and which did not come out to the best advantage in
that getup. She could without difficulty, he said, have posed for the ensemble,
not to dwell on certain opulent curves of
the<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span>
<font color="black">&nbsp;&hellip;</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>
He
dwelt<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">,
being a bit of an artist in his spare
time,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font> on the female
form in general developmentally because, as it so happened, no later than that
afternoon, he had seen those Grecian statues, perfectly developed as works of
art, in the National Museum. Marble could give the original, shoulders, back,
all the symmetry. All the rest, yes, puritanism. It does though, St.
Joseph&apos;s sovereign &nbsp;&hellip; whereas no photo could, because it simply wasn&apos;t art, in a word.</p>
<p> The spirit moving him, he would much have liked to follow Jack Tar&apos;s
good example and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to speak for
itself on the plea he&nbsp;&hellip; so that the other could drink in the beauty
for himself, her stage presence being, frankly, a treat in itself
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black"><a name="un6015dv" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6015dv">which
the camera could not at all do justice
to</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>. But it was
scarcely professional etiquette so, though it was a warm pleasant sort of a
night now yet wonderfully cool for the season considering, for sunshine after
storm&nbsp;&hellip; And he did feel a kind of need there and then to follow suit
like a kind of inward voice and satisfy a possible need by moving a motion.
Nevertheless, he sat tight, just viewing the slightly soiled photo creased by
opulent curves, none the worse for wear, however, and looked away thoughtfully
with the intention of not further increasing the other&apos;s possible
embarrassment while gauging her symmetry of heaving <i>embonpoint</i>. In fact,
the slight soiling was only an added charm, like the case of linen slightly
soiled, good as new, much better, in fact, with the starch out. Suppose she was
gone when he&nbsp;&hellip; I looked for the lamp which she told me came into his
mind but merely as a passing fancy of his because
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">then
he</span></span> <font color="black">he
then</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font> recollected the
morning littered bed etcetera and the book about Ruby with met him pike hoses

<font color="black"><i>sic</i></font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>)
in it which must have fell down sufficiently appropriately beside the

chamberpot with apologies to Lindley Murray.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 723}</font> </p>
<p> The vicinity of the young man he certainly relished, educated,
<i>distingu&eacute;</i>, and impulsive into the bargain, far and away the pick
of the bunch, though you wouldn&apos;t think he had it in him&nbsp;&hellip; yet you would. Besides he said the
<br><font color="green">{u22, 608}</font>
<br> picture was handsome which, say what you like, it was, though at the moment
she was distinctly stouter. And why not? An awful lot of makebelieve went on
about that sort of thing involving a lifelong slur with the usual splash page of
letterpress
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">about
the same old

tangle alleging misconduct with professional golfer or the newest stage
favourite</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font> instead of
being honest and aboveboard about the whole business. How they were fated to
meet and an attachment sprang up between the two so that their names were
coupled in the public eye was told in court with letters containing the habitual
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black"><a name="un4055h" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4055h">mushy</a>
and</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font> compromising
expressions, leaving no loophole, to show that they
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">openly</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>
cohabited
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">two or
three times a week at some wellknown seaside
hotel</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font> and relations,
when the thing ran its normal course, became in due course intimate. Then the
decree <i>nisi</i> and the King&apos;s Proctor to show cause why and, he failing
to quash it, <i>nisi</i> was made absolute. But as for that the two
misdemeanants, wrapped up as they
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">largely</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>
were in one another, could safely afford to ignore it as they very largely did
till the matter was put in the hands of a solicitor
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">who
filed a petition for the party wronged in due
course</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>. He, Bloom,
enjoyed the distinction of being close to Erin&apos;s uncrowned king in the
flesh when the thing occurred on the historic <i>fracas</i> when the fallen
leader&apos;s &mdash; who notoriously stuck to his guns to the last drop even
when clothed in the mantle of adultery &mdash; (leader&apos;s) trusty henchmen
to the number of ten or a dozen or possibly even more than that penetrated into
the printing works of the <i>Insuppressible</i> or no it was <i>United
Ireland</i> (a by no means, by the by appropriate appellative) and broke up the
typecases with hammers or something like that all on account of some scurrilous
effusions from the facile pens of the O&apos;Brienite scribes at the usual
mudslinging occupation, reflecting on the erstwhile tribune&apos;s private
morals. Though palpably a radically altered man, he was still a commanding
figure, though carelessly garbed as usual, with that look of settled purpose
which went a long way with the shillyshallyers till
<br><font color="green">{u21, 724}</font>
<br> they discovered to their vast discomfiture that their idol had feet of clay
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">after
placing him upon a
pedestal</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>, which she,
however, was the first to perceive. As those were particularly hot times in the
general hullaballoo Bloom sustained a minor injury from a nasty prod of some
chap&apos;s elbow in the crowd that of course congregated lodging some place
about the pit of the stomach, fortunately not of a grave character. His hat
(Parnell&apos;s) was inadvertently knocked off and, as a matter of strict
history, Bloom was the man who picked it up in the crush after witnessing the
occurrence meaning to return it to him (and return it to him he did with the utmost
<br><font color="green">{u22, 609}</font>
<br> celerity) who, panting and hatless and whose thoughts were miles away from
his hat at the time, being a gentleman born with a stake in the country, he, as
a matter of fact, having gone into it more for the kudos of the thing than
anything else, what&apos;s bred in the bone, instilled into him in infancy at
his mother&apos;s knee in the shape of knowing what good form was came out at
once because he turned round to the donor and thanked him with perfect
<i>aplomb</i>, saying: <i>Thank you, sir</i>, though in a very different tone of
voice from the ornament of the legal profession whose headgear Bloom also set to
rights earlier in the course of the day, history repeating itself with a
difference, after the burial of a mutual friend when they had left him alone in
his glory after the grim task of having committed
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the</span></span>
<font color="black">his</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font> remains to the grave.</p>
<p> On the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatant jokes of
the cabman and so on, who passed it
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">all</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>
off as a jest, laughing immoderately, pretending to understand everything, the
why and the wherefore, and in reality not knowing their own minds, it being a
case for the two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate husband
happened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter from the usual boy
Jones, who happened to come across them at the crucial moment
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">in a
loving position</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>
locked in one another&apos;s arms, drawing attention to their illicit
proceedings and leading up to a domestic rumpus and the erring fair one begging
forgiveness of her lord and master upon her knees and promising to sever the
connection
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">and not
receive his visits any more if only the aggrieved husband would overlook the

in her eyes though possibly with her tongue in her

cheek at the same time as quite possibly there were
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">several</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>
others. He personally, being of a sceptical bias, believed, and didn&apos;t make

<font color="black">smallest</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>
bones about saying so either, that man, or men in the plural, were always
hanging around on the waiting list about a lady, even supposing she was the best
wife in the world
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">and
they got on
<font color="red"><sup><small>|a</small></sup></font>fairly<font color="red"><sup><small>a|</small></sup></font>

neglecting her
duties,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font> she chose to
be tired of wedded life
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">and was
on for a little flutter in polite
debauchery</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>, to press
their attentions on her with improper intent, the upshot being that her
affections centred on another, the cause of many <i>liaisons</i> between still
attractive married women getting on for fair and forty and younger men, no doubt
as several famous cases of feminine infatuation proved up to the hilt.</p>
<p> It was a thousand pities a young fellow blessed with an allowance of brains,
as his neighbour obviously was, should waste his valuable time with profligate
women<font color="red"><sup><small>|s8</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>s8|</small></sup></font>
who might present him with a nice dose to last him his lifetime. In
<br><font color="green">{u22, 610}</font>
<br> the nature of single blessedness he would one day take unto himself a wife
when Miss Right came on the scene but in the interim ladies&apos; society was a
<i>conditio sine qua non</i> though he had the gravest possible doubts, not that
he wanted in the smallest to pump Stephen about Miss Ferguson
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">(who
was very possibly the particular
<a name="un4033bd" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4033bd">lodestar</a> who
brought him down to Irishtown so early in the
morning)</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>, as to
whether he would find much satisfaction basking in the boy and girl courtship
idea and the company of smirking misses without a penny to their names bi- or
tri-weekly with the orthodox preliminary canter of complimentpaying and walking
out leading up to fond lovers&apos; ways and flowers and chocs. To think of him
house and homeless, rooked by some landlady worse than any stepmother, was
really too bad at his age. The queer suddenly things he popped out with
attracted the elder man who was several years the other&apos;s senior or like
his father. But something substantial he certainly ought to eat, were it only an
eggflip made on unadulterated maternal nutriment or, failing that, the homely Humpty Dumpty boiled.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; At what o&apos;clock did you dine? he questioned of the
slim form and tired though unwrinkled face.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 726}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Some time yesterday, Stephen said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yesterday! exclaimed Bloom till he remembered it was
already tomorrow, Friday. Ah, you mean it&apos;s after twelve!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The day before yesterday, Stephen said, improving on himself.</p>
<p> Literally astounded at this piece of intelligence Bloom reflected. Though
they didn&apos;t see eye to eye in everything, a certain analogy there somehow
was, as if both their minds were travelling, so to speak, in the one train of
thought. At his age when dabbling in politics roughly some score of years
previously when he had been a <i>quasi</i> aspirant to parliamentary honours in
the Buckshot Foster days he too recollected in retrospect (which was a source of
keen satisfaction in itself) he had a sneaking regard for those same ultra
ideas. For instance, when the evicted tenants question, then at its first
inception, bulked largely in people&apos;s mind
though<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">,
it goes without
saying,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font> not
contributing a copper or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums, some of
which wouldn&apos;t exactly hold water, he at the outset in principle, at all
events, was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession, as voicing the trend
of modern opinion,a partiality, however,
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">which,
realising his
mistake,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font> he was
subsequently partially cured of, and even was twitted with going a step further
than Michael Davitt in the striking views he at one time inculcated as a
backtothelander, which was one reason he strongly resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion
<br><font color="green">{u22, 611}</font>
<br> at the gathering of the clans in Barney Kiernan&apos;s so that he, though
often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of mortals, be it
repeated, departed from his customary habit to give him (metaphorically) one in
the gizzard though, so far as politics themselves were concerned, he was only
too conscious of the casualties invariably resulting from propaganda and
displays of mutual animosity and the misery and suffering it entailed as a
foregone conclusion on fine young fellows, chiefly, destruction of the fittest, in a word.</p>
<p> Anyhow, upon weighing up the pros and cons, getting on for one as it was, it
was high time to be retiring for the night. The crux was it was a bit risky to
bring him home as eventualities might possibly ensue
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">(somebody
having a temper of her own sometimes)</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font> and spoil
<br><font color="green">{u21, 727}</font>
<br> the hash altogether as on the night he misguidedly brought home a dog
(breed unknown) with a lame paw,not that the cases were either identical or the
reverse, though he had hurt his hand too, to Ontario Terrace, as he very
distinctly remembered, having been there, so to speak. On the other hand it was
altogether far and away too late for the Sandymount or Sandycove suggestion so
that he was in some perplexity as to which of the two alternatives&nbsp;&hellip;
Everything pointed to the fact that it behoved him to avail himself to the full
of the opportunity, all things considered. His initial impression was that he
was a bit standoffish or not over effusive but it grew on him someway. For one
thing he mightn&apos;t what you call jump at the idea, if approached, and what
mostly worried him was he didn&apos;t know how to lead up to it or word it
exactly, supposing he did entertain the proposal, as it would afford him very
great personal pleasure if he would allow him to help to put coin in his way or
some wardrobe, if found suitable. At all events he wound up by concluding,
eschewing for the nonce hidebound precedent, a cup of Epps&apos;s cocoa and a
shakedown for the night plus the use of a rug or two and overcoat doubled into a
pillow. At least he would be in safe hands and as warm as a toast on a trivet.
He failed to perceive any very vast amount of harm in that always with the
proviso no rumpus of any sort was kicked up. A move had to be made because that
merry old soul, the grasswidower in question who appeared to be glued to the
spot, didn&apos;t appear in any particular hurry to wend his way home to his
dearly beloved Queenstown and it was highly likely some sponger&apos;s
bawdyhouse of retired beauties off Sheriff street lower would be the best clue
to that equivocal character&apos;s whereabouts for a few days to come,
alternately racking their feelings (the mermaids&apos;) with sixchamber revolver
anecdotes verging on the tropical calculated to freeze the marrow of
anybody&apos;s bones and mauling their largesized charms between whiles with rough and tumble gusto
<br><font color="green">{u22, 612}</font>
<br> to the accompaniment of large potations of potheen and the usual blarney
about himself for as to who he in reality was let X equal my right name and
address, as Mr Algebra remarks
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black"><i>passim</i></font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>.
At the same time he inwardly chuckled over his repartee to the blood and ouns
<br><font color="green">{u21, 728}</font>
<br> champion about his God being a jew. People could put up with being bitten
by a wolf but what properly riled them was a bite from a sheep. The most
vulnerable point too of tender Achilles, your God was a jew, because mostly they
appeared to imagine he came from Carrick-on-Shannon or somewhereabouts in the county Sligo.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I propose, our hero eventually suggested, after mature
reflection, while prudently pocketing her photo, as it&apos;s rather stuffy
here, you just come home with me and talk things over. My diggings are quite
close in the vicinity. You can&apos;t drink that stuff. Wait. I&apos;ll just pay this lot.</p>
<p> The best plan clearly being to clear out, the remainder being plain sailing,
he beckoned, while prudently pocketing the photo, to the keeper of the shanty, who didn&apos;t seem to&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, that&apos;s the best, he assured Stephen, to whom for
the matter of that Brazen Head or him or anywhere else was all more or less&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> All kinds of Utopian plans were flashing through his (Bloom&apos;s) busy
brain. Education (the genuine article), literature, journalism, prize titbits,
up to date billing, hydros and concert tours in English watering resorts packed
with theatres, turning money away, duets in Italian with the accent perfectly
true to nature and a quantity of other things, no necessity of course to tell
the world and his wife from the housetops about it, and a slice of luck. An
opening was all was wanted. Because he more than suspected he had his
father&apos;s voice to bank his hopes on which it was quite on the cards he had
so it would be just as well, by the way no harm, to trail the conversation in
the direction of that particular red herring just to&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> The cabby read out of the paper he had got hold of that the former viceroy,

association dinner in London somewhere. Silence with a yawn or two accompanied
this thrilling announcement. Then the old specimen in the corner
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">who
appeared to have some spark of vitality
left</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font> read out that
Sir Anthony MacDonnell had left Euston for the chief secretary&apos;s lodge or
words to that effect. To which absorbing piece of intelligence echo answered why.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Give us a squint at that literature, grandfather, the
ancient mariner put in, manifesting some

impatience.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 729}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And welcome, answered the elderly party thus addressed.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 613}</font> </p>
<p> The sailor lugged out from a case he had a pair of greenish goggles which he
very slowly hooked over his nose and both ears.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Are you bad in the eyes? the sympathetic personage like the townclerk queried.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Why, answered the seafarer with the tartan beard, who
seemingly was a bit of a literary cove in his own small way, staring out of
seagreen portholes as you might well describe them as, I uses goggles reading.

of speaking. <i>The Arabian Nights Entertainment</i> was my favourite and <i>Red as a Rose is She</i>.</p>
<p> Thereupon he pawed the journal open and pored upon Lord only knows what,
found drowned or the exploits of King Willow, Iremonger having made

the keeper was intensely occupied loosening an apparently new or secondhand boot
which manifestly pinched him, as he muttered against whoever it was sold it, all
of them who were sufficiently awake enough to be picked out by their facial
expressions, that is to say, either simply looking on glumly or passing a trivial remark.</p>
<p> To cut a long story short Bloom, grasping the situation, was the first to
rise from his seat so as not to outstay their welcome having first and foremost,
being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for the occasion, taken
the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine host as a parting shot a
scarcely perceptible sign when the others were not looking to the effect that
the amount due was forthcoming, making a grand total of fourpence (the amount he
deposited unobtrusively in four coppers, literally the last of the Mohicans), he
having previously spotted on the printed pricelist for all who ran to read
opposite him in unmistakable figures, coffee 2d, confectionery

<p class="di">&mdash; Come, he counselled, to close the <i>s&eacute;ance</i>.</p>
<p> Seeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear, they left the shelter

the spur of the moment, why they put tables upside down at night, I mean chairs
upside down, on the tables in caf&eacute;s.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 614}</font> </p>
<p> To which impromptu the neverfailing Bloom replied without a moment&apos;s hesitation, saying straight off:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; To sweep the floor in the morning.</p>
<p> So saying he skipped around, nimbly considering, frankly at the same time
apologetic to get on his companion&apos;s right, a habit of his, by the bye, his
right side being, in classical idiom, his tender Achilles. The night air was
certainly now a treat to breathe though Stephen was a bit weak on his pins.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It will (the air) do you good, Bloom said, meaning also
the walk, in a moment. The only thing is to walk then you&apos;ll feel a
different man. It&apos;s not far. Lean on me.</p>
<p> Accordingly he passed his left arm in Stephen&apos;s right and led him on accordingly.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, Stephen said uncertainly, because he thought he felt
a strange kind of flesh of a different man approach him, sinewless and wobbly and all that.</p>
<p> Anyhow, they passed the sentrybox with stones, brazier, etc where the
municipal supernumerary, ex Gumley, was still to all intents and purposes
wrapped in the arms of Murphy, as the adage has it, dreaming of fresh fields and
pastures new. And

in fact a stoning to death on the part of seventytwo out of eighty odd
constituencies that ratted at the time of the split and chiefly the belauded
peasant class, probably the selfsame evicted tenants he had put in their holdings.</p>
<p> So they passed on to chatting about music, a form of art for which Bloom, as
a pure amateur, possessed the greatest love, as they made tracks arm-in-arm
across Beresford Place. Wagnerian music, though confessedly grand in its way, was a bit too heavy for Bloom and hard
<br><font color="green">{u21, 731}</font>
<br> to follow at the first go-off but the music of Mercadante&apos;s
<i>Huguenots</i>, Meyerbeer&apos;s <i>Seven Last Words on the Cross</i>, and
Mozart&apos;s <i>Twelfth Mass</i> he simply revelled in, the <i>Gloria</i> in
that being to his mind the acme of first class music as such, literally knocking
everything else into a cocked hat.
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">He
infinitely preferred the sacred music of the catholic church to anything the
opposite shop could offer in that line such as those Moody and Sankey hymns or

and I will live thy protestant to
be</i></a>.</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font> He also
yielded to none in his admiration of Rossini&apos;s <i>Stabat Mater</i>, a work
simply abounding in immortal numbers, in which his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy,
made a hit, a veritable sensation, he might

say, greatly adding to her other laurels and putting the others totally in the
<br><font color="green">{u22, 615}</font>
<br> shade, in the jesuit fathers&apos; church in upper Gardiner street, the
sacred edifice being thronged to the doors to hear her with virtuosos, or

<font color="black"><i>virtuosi</i></font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>
rather. There was the unanimous opinion that there was none to come up to her
and, suffice it to say in a place of worship for music of a sacred character,
there was a generally voiced desire for an encore. On the whole, though
favouring preferably light opera of the <i>Don Giovanni</i> description, and
<i>Martha</i>, a gem in its line, he had a <i>penchant</i>, though with only a
surface knowledge, for the severe classical school such as Mendelssohn. And
talking of that, taking it for granted he knew all about the old favourites, he
mentioned <i>par excellence</i> Lionel&apos;s air in <i>Martha</i>,
<i>M&apos;appari</i>, which, curiously enough, he heard, or overheard, to be
more accurate, on yesterday, a privilege he keenly appreciated, from the lips of
Stephen&apos;s respected father, sung to perfection, a study of the number, in
fact<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>
which made all the others take a back seat. Stephen, in reply to a politely put
query, said he didn&apos;t but launched out into praises of Shakespeare&apos;s
songs, at least of in or about that period, the lutenist Dowland who lived in
Fetter Lane near Gerard the herbalist, who <i>anno ludendo hausi, Doulandus</i>,
an instrument he was contemplating purchasing from Mr Arnold Dolmetsch, whom
Bloom did not quite recall, though the name certainly sounded familiar, for
sixtyfive guineas and Farnaby and son with their <i>dux</i> and <i>comes</i>
conceits and Byrd (William), who played the virginals, he said, in the Queen&apos;s Chapel or anywhere else he found
<br><font color="green">{u21, 732}</font>
<br> them and one Tomkins who made toys or airs and John Bull.</p>
<p> On the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond the
swingchains a horse, dragging a sweeper, paced on the paven ground, brushing a
long swathe of mire up so that with the noise Bloom was not perfectly certain
whether he had caught aright the allusion to sixtyfive guineas and John Bull. He
inquired if it was John Bull the political celebrity of that ilk, as it struck
him, the two identical names, as a striking coincidence.</p>
<p> By the chains, the horse slowly swerved to turn, which perceiving, Bloom,
who was keeping a sharp lookout as usual, plucked the other&apos;s sleeve gently, jocosely remarking:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Our lives are in peril tonight. Beware of the steamroller.</p>
<p> They thereupon stopped. Bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth
anything like sixtyfive guineas, suddenly in evidence in the dark quite near, so
that it seemed new, a different grouping of bones and even flesh, because
palpably it was a fourwalker, a hipshaker, a blackbuttocker, a taildangler, a
headhanger, putting his hind foot foremost the while the lord of his creation
<br><font color="green">{u22, 616}</font>
<br> sat on the perch, busy with his thoughts. But such a good poor brute, he
was sorry he hadn&apos;t a lump of sugar but, as he wisely reflected, you could
scarcely be prepared for every emergency that might crop up. He was just a big
nervous foolish noodly kind of a horse, without a second care in the world. But
even a dog, he reflected, take that mongrel in Barney Kiernan&apos;s, of the
same size, would be a holy horror to face. But it was no animal&apos;s fault in
particular if he was built that way like the camel, ship of the desert,
distilling grapes into potheen in his hump. Nine tenths of them all could be
caged or trained, nothing beyond the art of man barring the bees; whale with a
harpoon hairpin, alligator, tickle the small of his back and he sees the joke;
chalk a circle for a rooster; tiger, my eagle eye. These timely reflections
anent the brutes
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">of the
field</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font> occupied his
mind, somewhat distracted from Stephen&apos;s words, while the ship of the
street was manoeuvring and Stephen went on about the highly interesting old&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">What

Ah<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>
yes! My wife, he intimated,

have the greatest of pleasure in making your acquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind.</p>
<p> He looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of Stephen, image
of his mother, which was not quite the same as the usual blackguard type they
unquestionably had an indubitable hankering after as he was perhaps not that way built.</p>
<p> Still, supposing he had his father&apos;s gift, as he more than suspected,
it opened up new vistas in his mind, such as Lady Fingall&apos;s Irish
industries concert on the preceding Monday, and aristocracy in general.</p>
<p> Exquisite variations he was now describing on an air <i>Youth here has
End</i> by Jans Pieter Sweelinck, a Dutchman of Amsterdam where the frows come
from. Even more he liked an old German song of Johannes Jeep about the clear sea
and the voices of sirens, sweet murderers of men, which boggled Bloom a bit:</p>
<p class="set"><i>Von der Sirenen Listigkeit</i>
<br> <i>Tun die Poeten dichten.</i></p>
<p> These opening bars he sang and translated <i>extempore</i>. Bloom, nodding,
said he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means, which he did.</p>
<p> A phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that, the rarest of boons, which
Bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out, could easily, if properly
<br><font color="green">{u22, 617}</font>
<br> handled by some recognised authority on voice production such as
Barraclough and being able to read music into the bargain, command its own price
where baritones were ten a penny and procure for its fortunate possessor in the
near future an <i>entr&eacute;e</i> into fashionable houses in the best
residential quarters of financial magnates in a large way of business and titled
people where, with his university degree of B.A. (a huge ad in its way) and
gentlemanly bearing to all the more influence the good impression, he would
infallibly score a distinct success, being blessed with brains
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">which
also could be
<a name="un4030ak" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030ak">utilised</a> for the
purpose</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font> and other
requisites, if his clothes were properly attended
to<font color="red"><sup><small>|s8</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>s8|</small></sup></font>
so as to the better worm his way into their good graces as he, a youthful tyro
in society&apos;s sartorial niceties, hardly understood how a little thing
<br><font color="green">{u21, 734}</font>
<br> like that could militate against you. It was in fact only a matter of
months and he could easily foresee him
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">at</span></span>
<font color="black">participating
in</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font> their musical and
artistic <i>conversaziones</i> during the festivities of the Christmas season,
for choice, causing a slight flutter in the dovecotes of the fair sex and being
made a lot of by ladies out for sensation, cases of which, as he happened to
know, were on record &mdash; in fact, without giving the show away, he himself
once upon a time, if he cared to, could easily have&nbsp;&hellip; Added to
which, of course, would be the pecuniary emolument by no means to be sneezed at,
going hand in hand with his tuition fees. Not, he parenthesised, that for the
sake of filthy lucre he need necessarily embrace the lyric platform as a walk in
life for any lengthy space of time but a step in the required direction it was,
beyond yea or nay, and both monetarily and mentally it contained no reflection
on his dignity in the smallest and it often turned in uncommonly handy to be
handed a cheque at a muchneeded moment when every little helped. Besides, though
taste latterly had deteriorated to a degree, original music like that, different
from the conventional rut, would rapidly have a great vogue, as it would be a
decided novelty for Dublin&apos;s musical world after the usual hackneyed run of
catchy tenor solos
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><font color="black">foisted
on a confiding public by Ivan St Austell and Hilton St Just and their <i>genus
omne</i></font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>. Yes,
beyond a shadow of a doubt, he could, with all the cards in his hand, and he had
a capital opening to make a name for himself and win a high place in the
city&apos;s esteem where he could command a stiff figure and, booking ahead,
give a grand concert for the patrons of the King street house, given a backerup,
if one were forthcoming to kick him upstairs, so to speak, &mdash; a big
<i>if</i>, however &mdash; with some impetus of the goahead sort to obviate the
inevitable procrastination which often tripped up a too much f&ecirc;ted prince
of good fellows and it need not detract from the
<br><font color="green">{u22, 618}</font>
<br> other by one iota as, being his own master, he would have heaps of time to
practise literature in his spare moments when desirous of so doing without its
clashing with his vocal career or containing anything derogatory whatsoever as
it was a matter for himself alone. In fact, he had the ball at his feet and that
was the very reason why the other, possessed of a remarkably sharp nose for
smelling a rat of any sort, hung on to him at all.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 735}</font> </p>
<p> The horse was just then&nbsp;&hellip; and later on, at a propitious
opportunity he purposed (Bloom did), without anyway prying into his private
affairs on the
<font color="red"><sup><small>|8</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">fools
step in where angels</span></span> <font color="black"><i>fools step in where
angels</i></font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>
principle, advising him to sever his connection with a certain budding
practitioner, who, he noticed, was prone to disparage, and even, to a slight
extent, with some hilarious pretext, when not present, deprecate him, or
whatever you like to call it, which, in Bloom&apos;s humble opinion, threw a
nasty sidelight on that side of a person&apos;s character &mdash; no pun intended.</p>
<p> The horse, having reached the end of his tether, so to speak, halted, and,
rearing high a proud feathering tail, added his quota by letting fall on the
floor, which the brush would soon brush up and polish, three smoking globes of
turds. Slowly, three times, one after another, from a full crupper, he mired.
And humanely his driver waited till he (or she) had ended, patient in his scythed car.</p>
<p> Side by side Bloom, profiting by the <i>contretemps</i>, with Stephen passed
through the gap of the chains, divided by the upright, and, stepping over a
strand of mire, went across towards Gardiner street lower, Stephen singing more
boldly, but not loudly, the end of the ballad:</p>
<p class="set"><i>Und alle Schiffe br&uuml;cken</i>.</p>
<p> The driver never said a word, good, bad or indifferent. He merely watched
the two figures,

he sat on his lowbacked
car</i><a target="foot" id="frr0372">&ordm;</a>,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>8|</small></sup></font>
