<p> Preparatory to anything else Mr Bloom brushed off the greater bulk of the
shavings and handed Stephen the hat and ashplant and bucked him up generally in
orthodox <a name="s16005v" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16005v">Samaritan</a>
fashion, which he very badly needed. His (Stephen&apos;s) mind was not exactly
what you would call wandering but a bit unsteady and on his expressed desire for
some beverage to drink Mr Bloom, in view of the hour it was and there being no
pump<a target="foot" id="frr0001">&ordm;</a> of Vartry water available for their
<a name="s16003a" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16003a">ablutions</a>, let
alone drinking purposes,
<a name="s16002at" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002at">hit upon an
expedient</a> by suggesting,
<a name="un4043j" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4043j">off the reel</a>, the
propriety of the cabman&apos;s shelter, as it was called, hardly a stonesthrow
away near Butt Bridge,<a target="foot" id="frr0002">&ordm;</a> where they might
hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk and soda or a
<a name="un5017cp" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5017cp">mineral</a>. But how
to get there was the rub. For the nonce he was rather nonplussed but inasmuch as
the duty plainly devolved upon him
<a name="un6015ca" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6015ca">to take some
measures on the subject</a> he pondered suitable
<a name="un4031cm" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031cm">ways and means</a>
during which Stephen repeatedly yawned. So far as he could see he was rather
<a name="s16001b" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001b">pale in the face</a>
so that <a name="un6015bv" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6015bv">it occurred
to him</a> as highly advisable to get a conveyance of some description which
<a name="un5017bv" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5017bv">would answer</a>
<a name="un4031cp" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031cp">in their then
condition</a>, <a name="un6015bc" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6015bc">both
of them being e.d. ed, particularly Stephen</a>, always assuming that there was
such a thing to be found. Accordingly<a target="foot" id="frr0003">&ordm;</a>
after a few such
<a name="un4031ct" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031ct">preliminaries</a><a target="foot" id="frr0004">&ordm;</a>
as brushing,<a target="foot" id="frr0005">&ordm;</a> in spite of his
<a name="un5018ar" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5018ar">having forgotten</a>
<a name="un7007bk" href="../../ff/unbs/un7all.htm#un7007bk">to take up</a>
<a name="un5018ar" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5018ar">his</a> rather

<a name="un5018ar" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5018ar">handkerchief</a>
after it had done
<a name="un7007aq" href="../../ff/unbs/un7all.htm#un7007aq">yeoman service</a>
in the shaving line,<a target="foot" id="frr0006">&ordm;</a> they both walked
together along Beaver street<a target="foot" id="frr0007">&ordm;</a>, or, more
properly, lane, as far as the farrier&apos;s and the distinctly fetid atmosphere
of the livery stables at the corner of Montgomery street where they made tracks
to the left <a name="un6015ea" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6015ea">from</a>
thence
<a name="un4030ch" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030ch">debouching</a> into
Amiens street<a target="foot" id="frr0008">&ordm;</a> round by the corner of Dan
Bergin&apos;s. But, <a name="s16028q" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16028q">as
he</a> confidently
<a name="s16028q" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16028q">anticipated</a>, there
was not a sign of a
<a name="un4031cl" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031cl">Jehu</a> plying for
hire anywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler, probably engaged by some fellows
inside on the spree, outside the North Star Hotel and there was no symptom of
its budging a quarter of an inch when Mr Bloom, who was
<a name="un6015do" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6015do">anything but</a> a
<a name="un5017bp" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5017bp">professional</a>
<a name="s16003am" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16003am">whistler</a>,
<a name="un4031k" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031k">endeavoured to
hail</a> it by emitting a kind of a whistle,
<a name="un4031k" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031k">holding his arms arched over his head</a>, twice. </p>
<p> This was a quandary but,
<a name="s16002af" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002af">bringing common
sense</a><a target="foot" id="frr0009">&ordm;</a>
<a name="s16002af" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002af">to bear on it</a>,
evidently there was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and
<a name="un5007ba" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5007ba">foot it</a> which
they accordingly did. So, bevelling around by
Mullett&apos;s<a target="foot" id="frr0010">&ordm;</a> and the Signal House,
<a name="un6015du" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6015du">which they shortly
reached</a>, <a name="un4031ae" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031ae">they
proceeded</a>
<a name="un4043cc" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4043cc">perforce</a>
<a name="un4031ae" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031ae">in the direction
of</a> Amiens street<a target="foot" id="frr0011">&ordm;</a> railway terminus,
Mr Bloom being
<a name="s16009h" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16009h">handicapped by the
circumstance</a> that one of the back buttons of his trousers had,
<a name="s16002ae" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002ae">to vary the</a>
timehonoured
<a name="s16002ae" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002ae">adage</a>, gone the
way of all buttons<a target="foot" id="frr0012">&ordm;</a> though,
<a name="un7007u" href="../../ff/unbs/un7all.htm#un7007u">entering thoroughly
into the spirit of the thing</a>, he heroically
<a name="s16001e" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001e">made light of</a> the
mischance. So as
<a name="un6015ba" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6015ba">neither of them
were</a> particularly
<a name="un7008au" href="../../ff/unbs/un7all.htm#un7008au">pressed for
time</a>, as it happened, and the temperature refreshing since it
<a name="un6015da" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6015da">cleared up</a> after
the <a name="un4054ba" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4054ba">recent</a>
<a name="un4043ck" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4043ck">visitation of
Jupiter Pluvius</a>, they
<a name="s15036av" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15036av">dandered</a> along
past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a fare or a jarvey. As it so
happened a Dublin United Tramways Company&apos;s
<a name="un4030el" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030el">sandstrewer
happening to be returning</a><a target="foot" id="frr0013">&ordm;</a> the elder
man recounted to his companion <i>&agrave; propos</i> of the incident his own
truly <a name="un4030ek" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030ek">miraculous
escape</a> of some little while back. They passed the main entrance of the Great
Northern railway station, the starting point for Belfast, where of course all
traffic was suspended at that late hour,
and,<a target="foot" id="frr0014">&ordm;</a> passing the back door of the morgue
(a not very enticing locality, not to say
<a name="s16005o" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16005o">gruesome</a>
<a name="un4042ab" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4042ab">to a degree</a>,
more especially at night),
<a name="un4031bs" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031bs">ultimately</a>
gained the Dock Tavern and in due course turned into Store
street<a target="foot" id="frr0015">&ordm;</a>, famous for its
<a name="s16017bd" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16017bd">C division police
station</a>. Between this point and the high, at present unlit, warehouses of
Beresford Place Stephen thought to think of Ibsen, associated with Baird&apos;s,
the stonecutter&apos;s,<a target="foot" id="frr0016">&ordm;</a> in his mind
somehow in Talbot Place, first turning on the right, while the other, who was
acting as his <i>fidus Achates</i>,<a target="foot" id="frr0017">&ordm;</a>
inhaled with internal satisfaction the smell of James Rourke&apos;s city bakery,
situated quite close to where they were, the very
<a name="s16009al" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16009al">palatable</a> odour
indeed of our daily bread, of all commodities of the public the primary and most
indispensable. Bread, the staff of life, earn your bread, O tell me where is
fancy bread? At Rourke&apos;s the baker&apos;s, it is said.</p>
<p> <a name="s16003t" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16003t"><i>En
route</i></a>, to his taciturn, and, not to put too fine a point on it, not yet
perfectly sober companion, Mr Bloom, who
<a name="un6015ek" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6015ek">at all
events</a><a target="foot" id="frr0018">&ordm;</a> was in complete possession of
his faculties, <a name="s16013v" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16013v">never
more so</a>, in fact
<a name="un4055c" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4055c">disgustingly
sober</a>, spoke <a name="s16011v" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16011v">a
word of caution</a> <i>re</i> the dangers of
<a name="s16027s" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16027s">nighttown</a>,

and <a name="un4042e" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4042e">swell mobsmen</a>,
which, barely permissible once in a while, though
<a name="s16005ag" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16005ag">not as a habitual
practice</a>, was of the nature of a regular deathtrap for young fellows of his
age particularly if they had
<a name="un4055ba" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4055ba">acquired drinking
habits</a> <a name="un4030fa" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030fa">under the
influence of liquor</a> unless you knew a little

when Stephen  was blissfully unconscious that, but for that man in the gap
<a name="un5017df" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5017df">turning up</a>
<a name="un4043av" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4043av">at the eleventh

the bridewell and an appearance in the court next day before Mr Tobias, or, he

meant to say, or Mahony<a target="foot" id="frr0022">&ordm;</a> which
<a name="un4048aj" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4048aj">simply spelt ruin
for</a> a chap when it got bruited about.
<a name="un4043p" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4043p">The reason he
mentioned the fact</a> was that a lot of those policemen, whom he
<a name="un5018ak" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5018ak">cordially
disliked</a>, were admittedly unscrupulous in the service of the Crown and, as
Mr Bloom put it, recalling a case or two in the
<a name="s16017bc" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16017bc">A Division</a> in
Clanbrassil street<a target="foot" id="frr0023">&ordm;</a>, prepared to

example, <a name="un5017ar" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5017ar">the

to protect the upper classes</a>.
<a name="s16021dk" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16021dk">Another thing he
commented on was equipping soldiers with</a>
<a name="un4031ef" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031ef">firearms</a> or

much vexed question of stimulants,<a target="foot" id="frr0027">&ordm;</a> he
relished a glass of
<a name="un6015ad" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6015ad">choice</a> old wine
in season as both nourishing and bloodmaking and possessing aperient virtues
(notably a good burgundy which he was a staunch

of others practically<a target="foot" id="frr0028">&ordm;</a>. Most of all he
commented adversely on the desertion of Stephen by all his

said nothing <a name="un7007i" href="../../ff/unbs/un7all.htm#un7007i">whatsoever</a> of any kind.</p>
<p> Discussing these and kindred topics they
<a name="un4055r" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4055r">made a beeline</a>
across the back of the Customhouse and passed under the Loop Line bridge
where<a target="foot" id="frr0029">&ordm;</a> a brazier of coke burning in front
of a sentrybox, or something like one, attracted their rather lagging footsteps.
Stephen of his own accord stopped for no special reason to look at the heap of
barren cobblestones and by the light emanating from the brazier he could just
make out the darker figure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom of the
sentrybox. He began to remember that this had happened, or had been mentioned as
having happened, before but it cost  him
<a name="s16009bd" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16009bd">no small</a> effort
before he remembered that
<a name="s16016j" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16016j">he recognised</a> in
the sentry a

friend of his father&apos;s, Gumley. To avoid a meeting he drew nearer to the pillars of the railway bridge.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Someone saluted you, Mr Bloom said.</p>

of course, started rather dizzily and stopped to

himself, recognised Corley&apos;s breath redolent of rotten
<a name="s15064t" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15064t">cornjuice</a>.
<a name="s16021bm" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16021bm">Lord John Corley,
some called him, and his genealogy came about in this wise.</a> He was the
eldest son of Inspector Corley of the G Division, lately deceased, who had
married a certain Katherine Brophy, the daughter of a Louth farmer. His
grandfather, Patrick Michael Corley, of New Ross, had married the widow of a
publican there whose maiden name had been Katherine (also) Talbot. Rumour had
it,though not proved, that she descended from
<a name="s16021dd" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16021dd">the house of</a> the
Lords Talbot de Malahide, in whose mansion, really an
<a name="un6015ee" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6015ee">unquestionably</a>
fine residence of its kind and
<a name="un6015dt" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6015dt">well worth
seeing</a>, her mother or aunt or some relative had
<a name="s16001bc" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001bc">enjoyed the
distinction</a> of being
<a name="s16021cf" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16021cf">in service in the
washkitchen</a>. This, therefore, was the reason why the still comparatively
young though dissolute man who now addressed Stephen was spoken of by some with
facetious <a name="s16001an" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001an">proclivities</a> as Lord John Corley.</p>
<p> <a name="s16013ao" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16013ao">Taking Stephen
on one side</a> he had the customary doleful ditty to tell. Not as much as a
farthing to purchase a night&apos;s lodgings. His friends had all deserted him.
Furthermore, he had a row with Lenehan<a target="foot" id="frr0034">&ordm;</a>
and called him to Stephen a mean bloody
<a name="s16025e" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16025e">swab</a>
<a name="un4031dk" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031dk">with a sprinkling of
other uncalledfor expressions</a>.
<a name="s16021cp" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16021cp">He was out of a job
and implored of Stephen to tell him where on God&apos;s earth he could get
something</a>, anything at all,<a target="foot" id="frr0035">&ordm;</a> to do.
No, it was the daughter of the  mother in the washkitchen that was
<a name="s16013cd" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16013cd">fostersister</a> to
the heir of the house or else they were connected through the mother in some
way, both occurrences happening at the same time if the whole thing wasn&apos;t
<a name="un6015dr" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6015dr">a complete
fabrication from start to finish</a>. Anyhow, he was all in.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I wouldn&apos;t ask you, only, pursued he, on my solemn
oath and God knows I&apos;m on the rocks.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="s16021bo" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16021bo">There&apos;ll be a
job tomorrow</a><a target="foot" id="frr0036">&ordm;</a>
<a name="s16021bo" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16021bo">or the next day,
Stephen told him,</a>
<a name="s16021cq" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16021cq">in a boys&apos;
school at Dalkey for a gentleman usher. Mr Garrett Deasy. Try it.</a> You may mention my name.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ah, God, Corley replied, sure I couldn&apos;t teach in a
school, man. I was never one of your bright ones, he added with a half
laugh.<a target="foot" id="frr0037">&ordm;</a> Got stuck twice in the junior at the Christian Brothers.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I have no place to sleep myself, Stephen informed him.</p>
<p> Corley, at the first go-off, was inclined to suspect
<a name="s16005ac" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16005ac">it was something to
do with</a> Stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody tart
off the street.
<a name="s16021ct" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16021ct">There was a
dosshouse in Marlborough street</a><a target="foot" id="frr0038">&ordm;</a>, Mrs
Maloney&apos;s, but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but
M&apos;Conachie told him you got a decent enough do in the Brazen Head over in
Winetavern street<a target="foot" id="frr0039">&ordm;</a> (which was distantly
suggestive to the person addressed of friar Bacon) for a bob. He was starving
too though he hadn&apos;t said a word about it.</p>
<p> Though <a name="s16014ba" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16014ba">this sort
of thing</a> went on every other night or very near it still Stephen&apos;s
feelings got the better of him
<a name="un7007cp" href="../../ff/unbs/un7all.htm#un7007cp">in a sense</a>
though he knew that Corley&apos;s brandnew rigmarole, on a par with the others,
was hardly deserving of much credence. However,
<a name="jn2037e" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2037e"><i>haud ignarus
malorum miseris succurrere disco</i>, etcetera,</a> as the Latin poet remarks,
especially <a name="s16001cs" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001cs">as luck
would have it</a> he
<a name="s16005c" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16005c">got paid</a> his screw
<a name="s16005c" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16005c">after every middle of
the month</a> on the sixteenth which was the date of the month as a matter of
fact though a good bit of the

<a name="un7007af" href="../../ff/unbs/un7all.htm#un7007af">demolished</a>. But
the cream of the joke was nothing would get it out of Corley&apos;s head that he
was living in affluence and hadn&apos;t a thing to do but hand out the needful
&mdash; whereas. He put his hand in a pocket anyhow, not with the idea of
finding any food there, but thinking he might lend him anything up to a bob or
so <a name="un4030db" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030db">in lieu</a> so
that <a name="un4030ai" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030ai">he might
endeavour</a> <a name="un4030b" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030b">at all
events</a> <a name="un4030ai" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030ai">and</a>
<a name="un4031cv" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031cv">get sufficient to
eat</a>. But <a name="s16010m" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16010m">the
result was in the negative</a> for,
<a name="un7007ct" href="../../ff/unbs/un7all.htm#un7007ct">to his chagrin</a>,
he <a name="un4030eq" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030eq">found his cash
missing</a>. A few broken biscuits were all the result of his
<a name="un4043r" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4043r">investigation</a><a target="foot" id="frr0040">&ordm;</a>.
He tried his hardest to
<a name="un4030bh" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030bh">recollect</a> for
the moment whether he had lost, as well he might have, or left, because in that
<a name="un4031bp" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031bp">contingency</a> it
was not a pleasant lookout, very much the reverse, in fact. He was altogether
too <a name="un4030ej" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030ej">fagged out</a>
to institute a thorough search though  he tried to
<a name="un4030bh" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030bh">recollect</a>.
About<a target="foot" id="frr0041">&ordm;</a> biscuits he
<a name="s16005ad" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16005ad">dimly
remembered</a>. Who now exactly gave them, or where was, or did he buy? However,
in another pocket he came across what he surmised in the dark were pennies,
<a name="s16005b" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16005b">erroneously</a>, however, as it turned out.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Those are halfcrowns, man, Corley corrected him.</p>
<p> And so <a name="un4030r" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030r">in point of
fact</a> they turned out to be. Stephen lent him one of them.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Thanks, Corley answered. You&apos;re a gentleman.
I&apos;ll pay you back some time. Who&apos;s that with you? I saw him a few
times <a name="un7040cb" href="../../ff/unbs/un7all.htm#un7040cb">in the
Bleeding Horse in Camden street</a> with Boylan the billsticker. You might put
in a good word for us to get me taken on there. I&apos;d carry a sandwichboard
only the girl in the office told me they&apos;re full up for the next three
weeks, man. God, you&apos;ve to
<a name="un4030ds" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030ds">book ahead</a>, man,
you&apos;d think it was for the Carl Rosa. I don&apos;t give a shite anyway so
long as I get a job,<a target="foot" id="frr0042">&ordm;</a> even as a
<a name="un6018ah" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6018ah">crossing sweeper</a>.</p>
<p> <a name="s16021bq" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16021bq">Subsequently,
being not quite so down in the mouth after the two-and-six he got, he informed
Stephen about a fellow</a> by the name of Bags Comisky that he said Stephen knew
well out of Fullam&apos;s, the shipchandler&apos;s, bookkeeper there, that used
to be often round in
<a name="un4037ba" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4037ba">Nagle&apos;s</a>
back with O&apos;Mara and a little chap with a stutter the name of Tighe.
Anyhow, he was lagged the night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and
disorderly and <a name="s16022f" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16022f">refusing to go with the constable</a>.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the
cobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation
watchman&apos;s sentrybox, who, evidently a
<a name="s16006o" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16006o">glutton for work</a>,
it struck him, was having a quiet forty winks
<a name="un7008at" href="../../ff/unbs/un7all.htm#un7008at">for all intents and
purposes</a> on his own private account while Dublin slept. He threw an odd eye
at the same time now and then at Stephen&apos;s
<a name="un6015do" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6015do">anything but</a>
<a name="un6015ck" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6015ck">immaculately
attired</a>
<a name="un5017cm" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5017cm">interlocutor</a> as
if he had seen that nobleman somewhere or other though where he was
<a name="un7008k" href="../../ff/unbs/un7all.htm#un7008k">not in a position to
truthfully state</a>
<a name="un4036m" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4036m">nor had he the
remotest</a> idea when. Being a
<a name="un4043ak" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4043ak">levelheaded</a>
individual who could
<a name="s16003r" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16003r">give points to</a> not
a few in point of shrewd observation, he also remarked on his very dilapidated
hat and <a name="s16001n" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001n">slouchy</a>
wearing apparel generally, testifying to a
<a name="s16002cd" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002cd">chronic
impecuniosity</a>. Probably he was one of his hangerson but for the matter of
that it was <a name="un4036h" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4036h">merely a
question of</a> one preying on his nextdoor neighbour all round, in every deep,
so to put it, a deeper depth and for the matter of that if
<a name="un4021bo" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4021bo">the man in the
street</a> <a name="un4030fd" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030fd">chanced
to be in the dock himself penal servitude, with or without the option of a
fine,</a><a target="foot" id="frr0043">&ordm;</a>
<a name="un4030fd" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030fd">would be a very
<i>rara avis</i> altogether</a>. In any case he had a consummate amount of cool
assurance  intercepting people at that hour of the night or morning.
<a name="s16004p" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16004p">Pretty thick that</a> was certainly.</p>
<p> The pair parted company and Stephen rejoined Mr Bloom,
who,<a target="foot" id="frr0044">&ordm;</a> with his
<a name="un7007bm" href="../../ff/unbs/un7all.htm#un7007bm">practised</a> eye,
was <a name="s15005p" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15005p">not without</a>
perceiving that he had succumbed to the blandiloquence of the other
<a name="un4030do" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030do">parasite</a>.
Alluding to the encounter he said, laughingly, Stephen,
<a name="s16016o" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16016o">that is</a>:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He&apos;s down on his luck. He asked me to ask you to ask
somebody named Boylan, a billsticker, to give him a job as a sandwichman.</p>
<p> At this intelligence, in which he seemingly
<a name="un5017k" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5017k">evinced little
interest</a>, Mr Bloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so
in the direction of a
<a name="un7008ak" href="../../ff/unbs/un7all.htm#un7008ak">bucketdredger</a><a target="foot" id="frr0045">&ordm;</a><a name="un7008ak" href="../../ff/unbs/un7all.htm#un7008ak">,</a>
rejoicing in the farfamed name of
<a name="un7007cd" href="../../ff/unbs/un7all.htm#un7007cd">Eblana</a>, moored
<a name="s16001bh" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001bh">alongside</a>
Customhouse Quay and quite possibly
<a name="un4043bd" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4043bd">out of repair</a>,
whereupon he observed <a name="s16013u" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16013u">evasively</a>:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="s16017ab" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16017ab">Everybody gets</a>

they say. <a name="s16001aq" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001aq">Now you
mention it</a> his face was familiar to me. But
<a name="s16009ag" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16009ag">leaving that for the

<a name="un4031av" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031av">inquisitive</a>?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Half-a-crown, Stephen responded. I daresay he needs it to sleep somewhere.</p>

<a name="s16004a" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16004a">ejaculated</a>,
<a name="un4030dq" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030dq">professing</a> not
the least surprise at the intelligence, I can quite
<a name="un4055u" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4055u">credit the

in general</a>, where,
<a name="un6015ac" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6015ac">added he with a

and, <a name="s16010bn" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16010bn">even
supposing</a> you did, you won&apos;t get in after what occurred at Westland Row

<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="s16017bl" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16017bl">I believe he is in
Dublin somewhere</a>, Stephen answered unconcernedly. Why?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A gifted man, Mr Bloom said of
<a name="s16013aq" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16013aq">Mr Dedalus
senior</a>, in more respects than one and a born <i>raconteur</i> if ever there
was one. He takes great pride, quite legitimately, out of you. You could go
back, perhaps, he hazarded, still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at
Westland Row terminus when it  was perfectly evident that the other two,
Mulligan, that is, and that English tourist friend of his, who
<a name="un4031n" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031n">eventually</a>
<a name="un5017cr" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5017cr">euchred</a> their

belonged<a target="foot" id="frr0049">&ordm;</a> to them, to give Stephen the
slip in the confusion.<a target="foot" id="frr0050">&ordm;</a></p>
<p> There was no response
<a name="s16001bt" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001bt">forthcoming</a> to
the suggestion, however, such as it was, Stephen&apos;s mind&apos;s eye being
too busily engaged in repicturing his family hearth the last time he saw it,
with <a name="s16017aa" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16017aa">his sister
Dilly sitting by the ingle, her hair hanging down, waiting for some weak
Trinidad shell cocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she

the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells and charred
fish heads and bones on a square of brown

precept of the church to fast and abstain on the days commanded, it being
quarter tense or, if not, ember days or something like that.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; No, Mr Bloom repeated again, I wouldn&apos;t personally
<a name="s16004ai" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16004ai">repose</a> much
trust in that

<a name="un4031bv" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031bv">he never realised
what it is to be without</a> regular meals. Of course you didn&apos;t notice as

pensively, <a name="un4031r" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031r">at the
inward reflection of there being more languages</a>

labelled coffee on the table and a rather antediluvian specimen of a bun, or so
it seemed, after which he beat a retreat to his

good square look at him later on so as not to appear to&nbsp;&hellip; for which
reason he encouraged Stephen to proceed with his eyes while he
<a name="un4031dg" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031dg">did the honours</a>
by surreptitiously pushing the cup of what was temporarily supposed to be called coffee gradually nearer him.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Sounds are impostures, Stephen
said<a target="foot" id="frr0070">&ordm;</a>

<a name="un7007cq" href="../../ff/unbs/un7all.htm#un7007cq">unaffectedly
concurred</a>. Of course. Our name was changed too, he added, pushing the socalled roll across.</p>
<p> The redbearded sailor, who had his weather eye on the newcomers, boarded
Stephen, whom he had
<a name="un4055ap" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4055ap">singled out for
attention</a> in particular, squarely by asking:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And what might your name be?</p>
<p> Just in the nick of time Mr Bloom touched his companion&apos;s boot but
Stephen, apparently disregarding the warm
pressure<a target="foot" id="frr0074">&ordm;</a> from
<a name="un4036i" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4036i">an unexpected quarter</a>, answered:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Dedalus.</p>
<p> The sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes,
<a name="un7008ao" href="../../ff/unbs/un7all.htm#un7008ao">rather bunged up
from excessive</a> use of
<a name="un7008ao" href="../../ff/unbs/un7all.htm#un7008ao">boose</a>, preferably good old Hollands and water.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="s16023e" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16023e">You know Simon Dedalus?</a> he asked at length.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="s16023e" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16023e">I&apos;ve heard of him, Stephen said.</a> </p>
<p> Mr Bloom was <a name="un4048g" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4048g">all

<p class="di">&mdash; He&apos;s Irish, the

affirmed, staring still in much the same way and nodding. All Irish.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; All too Irish, Stephen rejoined.</p>
<p> As for Mr Bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole business and
he was just asking himself what possible connection when the sailor, of his own
accord, turned to the other occupants of the shelter
<a name="un6015cm" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6015cm">with the remark</a>:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards
over his shoulder. The lefthand<a target="foot" id="frr0075">&ordm;</a> dead shot.</p>
<p> <a name="s16021ae" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16021ae">Though he was
slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his gestures being also
clumsy</a> <a name="s16004f" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16004f">as it was</a> still he did his best to explain.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Bottles<a target="foot" id="frr0076">&ordm;</a> out there,
say. Fifty yards measured. Eggs on the bottles. Cocks his gun over his shoulder. Aims.</p>
<p> He turned his body half round, shut up his right eye completely, then he
screwed his features up someway<a target="foot" id="frr0077">&ordm;</a> sideways
and glared out into the night with an
<a name="un4055ad" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4055ad">unprepossessing</a>
<a name="s14038n" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14038n">cast of countenance</a>.</p>

<a name="s16026h" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16026h">Pom</a>!<a target="foot" id="frr0078">&ordm;</a>

<p> The entire audience waited, anticipating an additional detonation, there being still a further egg.</p>

<a name="s16026h" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16026h">Pom</a>!<a target="foot" id="frr0079">&ordm;</a>

<p><a target="foot" id="frr0080">&ordm;</a> Egg two evidently demolished, he

Bloom for agreeableness&apos; sake just felt like asking him whether it was for

<p class="di">&mdash; Beg pardon, the sailor said.</p>

<p> Your washing. Still, candour compelled him to admit that
<a name="s16019g" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16019g">he had washed his

Draper&apos;s marking ink</a> (hers were, that is) if they really loved him,
that is to say. Love me, love my dirty shirt. Still, just then,
<a name="un4037i" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4037i">being on
tenterhooks</a>, he desired the female&apos;s room more than her company so it
came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a rude sign to take herself
off. Round the side of the  <i>Evening Telegraph</i> he just caught a
<a name="un5012aa" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5012aa">fleeting</a> glimpse
of her face round the side of the door with a kind of demented glassy grin
showing that she was not exactly
<a name="un7007bf" href="../../ff/unbs/un7all.htm#un7007bf">all there</a>,
viewing with evident amusement the group of gazers round Skipper Murphy&apos;s
nautical chest and then there was no more of her.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The <a name="s15061cd" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15061cd">gunboat</a>, the keeper said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It beats me, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen, medically I am
speaking, how a wretched creature like that from the Lock Hospital, reeking with
disease, can be
<a name="un4030bg" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030bg">barefaced</a> enough
to solicit or how any man in his sober senses, if he values his health in the
least. Unfortunate creature! Of course, I suppose some man is
<a name="un4031bs" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031bs">ultimately</a>
responsible for her condition. Still
<a name="un5017bu" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5017bu">no matter what the cause is from</a>&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> Stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders, merely remarking:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; In this country people sell much more than she ever had
and do a roaring trade. Fear not them that sell the body but have not power to
buy the soul. She is a bad merchant. She buys dear and sells cheap.</p>

said, and <a name="un5017bj" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5017bj">ventilated
the matter</a> thoroughly would confer a lasting
<a name="un6015ah" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6015ah">boon</a> on everybody concerned.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You, as a good catholic, he observed, talking of body and
soul, believe in the soul. Or do you mean the intelligence, the brainpower as
such, <a name="s16002aj" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002aj">as distinct
from</a> any outside object, the table, let us say, that cup? I believe in that
myself because <a name="un4030an" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030an">it

<a name="un4048j" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4048j">grey matter</a>.
Otherwise we would never have such inventions as X rays, for instance. Do you?</p>
<p> Thus cornered, Stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory
<a name="s16002av" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002av">to try and
concentrate</a> and remember before he could say:<a target="foot" id="frr0140">&ordm;</a></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; They tell me
<a name="s16024c" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16024c">on the best
authority</a> it is a simple substance and therefore incorruptible. It would be
immortal, I understand, but for the possibility of its annihilation by its

from all I can hear, is quite capable of adding that to the number of His other
practical jokes, <i>corruptio per se</i> and <i>corruptio per accidens</i> both being excluded by court etiquette. </p>
<p> Mr Bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the
mystical finesse involved was a bit out of his
<a name="un4030fc" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030fc">sublunary</a> depth
still <a name="un4031t" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031t">he felt bound

<p class="di">&mdash; Simple? I shouldn&apos;t think that is the proper word. Of
course, I grant you, to concede a point, you do knock across a simple soul once
in a blue moon. But what I am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for
instance to invent those rays
R&ouml;ntgen<a target="foot" id="frr0141">&ordm;</a> did, or the telescope like
Edison, though I believe it was before his time, Galileo was the man I mean. The
<a name="s16002ac" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002ac">same applies to</a>
the laws, for example, of a
<a name="s16003af" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16003af">farreaching</a>
natural phenomenon such as electricity but it&apos;s a horse of quite another
colour to say you believe in the
<a name="s15009ap" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15009ap">existence of a supernatural God.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O that, Stephen expostulated, has been proved conclusively

<p> On this knotty point, however, the views of the pair,
<a name="s16007as" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16007as">poles apart</a> as
they were, both in

<a name="s16002c" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002c">sticking to his

out, his mental<a target="foot" id="frr0146">&ordm;</a> organs for the moment refusing to dictate further.</p>
<p> Faultfinding being a proverbially bad hat, Mr Bloom

something approaching acrimony on the

its temperance (and lucrative) work. To be sure it was a

<a name="un7007ai" href="../../ff/unbs/un7all.htm#un7007ai">prominently
associated with</a> it at one time,  a very modest remuneration indeed for her
pianoplaying. The idea, he was strongly inclined to believe, was to
<a name="s16018s" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16018s">do good and net a
profit, there being no competition</a> to speak of.

or something in some dried peas</a> he remembered reading of in a cheap
eatinghouse somewhere but he couldn&apos;t remember when it was or where.
Anyhow, inspection, medical inspection, of all eatables, seemed to him more than
ever necessary which possibly accounted for the vogue of

<p class="di">&mdash; Have a shot at it now, he ventured to say of the coffee after being stirred.</p>
<p> Thus prevailed on to at any rate taste it, Stephen lifted the heavy mug from
the brown puddle &mdash; it clopped out of it when taken up &mdash; by the
handle and took a sip of <a name="un6015am" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6015am">the offending beverage</a>.</p>

Stephen said. But oblige me by taking away that knife.

<p> Mr Bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated article, a

are washed in the blood of the sun. Coincidence, I just happened to be in the
Kildare Street Museum today, shortly prior to our meeting, if I can so call it,
and I was just looking at those antique statues there. The splendid proportions
of hips, bosom. You simply don&apos;t knock against those kind of women here. An
exception here and there. Handsome, yes, pretty in a way you find, but what
I&apos;m talking about is the female form. Besides, they have so little taste in
dress, most of them, which
<a name="un4043ah" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4043ah">greatly enhances</a>
a woman&apos;s natural beauty, no matter what you say.
<a name="s16026ah" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16026ah">Rumpled stockings
&mdash; it may be, possibly is, a foible of mine, but still it&apos;s a thing I simply hate to see.</a></p>
<p> <a name="un5012aq" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5012aq">Interest,
however, was starting to flag</a> somewhat all round and the others got on to
talking about accidents at sea, ships lost in a fog, collisions with icebergs,
<a name="s16014ba" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16014ba">all that sort of
thing</a>. Shipahoy, of course,
<a name="s16013e" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16013e">had his own say</a> to
say. <a name="s16022bi" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16022bi">He had doubled
the Cape a few odd times and weathered a monsoon</a>, a kind of wind, in the

his adored one as a result of an alternative postnuptial <i>liaison</i> by
plunging his knife into her until it just struck him that Fitz, nicknamed
Skin-the-Goat, merely drove the car for the actual

That&apos;s the vital issue at stake and it&apos;s feasible and would be

<p> Over his untastable<a target="foot" id="frr0210">&ordm;</a> apology for a
cup of coffee, listening to this
<a name="s16007at" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16007at">synopsis</a> of
things in general, Stephen stared at nothing in particular.
<a name="s16017ba" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16017ba">He could hear, of

<a name="s16017ba" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16017ba">burrowing quickly
into all colours of different sorts of the same sand where they had a home
somewhere beneath or seemed to.</a> Then he looked up and saw the eyes that said
or didn&apos;t say the words the voice he heard said &mdash; if you work.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Count me out, he managed to remark, meaning<a target="foot" id="frr0212">&ordm;</a> work.</p>
<p> The eyes were surprised at this
observation<a target="foot" id="frr0213">&ordm;</a> because as he, the person
who owned them pro. tem. observed, or
rather<a target="foot" id="frr0214">&ordm;</a> his voice speaking did,

<p class="di">&mdash; I mean, of course, the other hastened to affirm, work in
the widest possible sense. Also literary labour, not merely
<a name="un4030dg" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030dg">for the kudos of the

That&apos;s work too. Important work. After all,

<a name="s16006ae" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16006ae">in pursuit of your

<p class="di">&mdash; You suspect, Stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh,
that I may be important because I belong to the <i>faubourg Saint-Patrice</i> called Ireland for short.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I would go a step farther, Mr Bloom insinuated.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; But I suspect, Stephen interrupted, that Ireland must be important because it belongs to me.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What belongs? queried Mr Bloom, bending, fancying he was
perhaps <a name="un4042u" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4042u">under some
misapprehension</a>.<a target="foot" id="frr0216">&ordm;</a> Excuse me.

<p> Stephen, patently crosstempered, repeated and shoved aside his mug of

you like to call it</a>, none too politely, adding:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; We can&apos;t change the country. Let us change the subject. </p>
<p> At this <a name="s16002s" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002s">pertinent
suggestion</a>, Mr Bloom, to change the subject, looked down, but in a quandary,
<a name="un7008ca" href="../../ff/unbs/un7all.htm#un7008ca">as he couldn&apos;t
tell</a> exactly <a name="s16014h" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16014h">what

<a name="un5012ac" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5012ac">rather a far
cry</a>. The rebuke of some kind was clearer than the other part. Needless to
say, the fumes of his recent orgy spoke then
with<a target="foot" id="frr0218">&ordm;</a> some

would all <a name="un4055aq" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4055aq">to a
man</a> have gone down on their marrowbones to him to come back when he had
<a name="un4042k" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4042k">recovered his
senses</a>. Dead he wasn&apos;t. Simply
<a name="un4043ap" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4043ap">absconded</a>
somewhere. <a name="s16026bf" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16026bf">The
coffin they brought over was full of stones.</a> He changed his name to De Wet,
the Boer general. He made a mistake to fight the priests. And so forth and so on.</p>
<p> All the same Bloom (properly so
<a name="un5017g" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5017g">dubbed</a>) was rather
surprised at their memories for in nine cases out of ten it was a case of
tarbarrels, and <a name="s16009av" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16009av">not
singly but in their thousands</a>, and then complete oblivion because it was
<a name="un4031aj" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031aj">twenty odd
years</a>. Highly unlikely, of course, there was even a shadow of truth in the
stones and, <a name="s16010bn" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16010bn">even
supposing</a>, he thought a return highly inadvisable, all things considered.
Something evidently riled them in his death. Either he

tamely of acute pneumonia just when his various different political arrangements

to <a name="un7007j" href="../../ff/unbs/un7all.htm#un7007j">his having

before a fortnight<a target="foot" id="frr0261">&ordm;</a> was at an end or
quite possibly they were
<a name="un7008bb" href="../../ff/unbs/un7all.htm#un7008bb">distressed to
find</a> the job was taken out of their hands. Of course nobody being
<a name="s16009ad" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16009ad">acquainted with his
movements</a> even before, there was absolutely
<a name="s16001bo" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001bo">no clue as to his
whereabouts</a> which were decidedly of the <i>Alice, where art thou</i> order
even prior to his starting to go under several aliases such as Fox and Stewart,
so the  <a name="s16009an" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16009an">remark which
emanated from</a> friend cabby might be within the bounds of possibility.
Naturally then, it would
<a name="s16007r" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16007r">prey on his mind</a>
as a born <a name="s16009f" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16009f">leader of

mutual mudslinging. And the identical same with murderers. You had to come back

<a name="s16005as" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16005as">gazed in the
direction of the door</a> and reflected  upon the

<p> So saying <a name="s16022v" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16022v">he

<a name="un4048bt" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4048bt">frankly</a><a target="foot" id="frr0335">&ordm;</a>
at the same time apologetic<a target="foot" id="frr0336">&ordm;</a>
<a name="s16022v" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16022v">to get on his

<a name="un4031df" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031df">right side</a>
being, in classical idiom, his tender Achilles. The night air was certainly now
a treat to breathe though Stephen was a bit weak on his pins.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It will (the air) do you good, Bloom said, meaning also
the walk, in a moment. The only thing is to walk then you&apos;ll
<a name="un4055ca" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4055ca">feel a different man</a>. It&apos;s not far. Lean on me.</p>
<p> Accordingly <a name="s16026bu" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16026bu">he
passed his left arm in Stephen&apos;s right</a> and
<a name="s15013cb" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15013cb">led him on accordingly</a>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, Stephen said uncertainly, because he thought
<a name="s16027j" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16027j">he felt a strange kind
of flesh</a> of a different man<a target="foot" id="frr0339">&ordm;</a>
<a name="s16027j" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16027j">approach him, sinewless and wobbly and all that</a>.</p>
<p> Anyhow, they passed the sentrybox with stones, brazier,
etc<a target="foot" id="frr0340">&ordm;</a> where the
<a name="s16006ai" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16006ai">municipal
supernumerary</a>, ex Gumley<a target="foot" id="frr0341">&ordm;</a>, was still
to all intents and purposes wrapped
<a name="un4003h" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4003h">in the arms of
Murphy</a>, as the
<a name="un6015j" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6015j">adage</a> has it,
dreaming of fresh fields and pastures new. And <i>apropos</i> of coffin of
stones, the analogy was not at all bad, as it was in fact a stoning to death on
the part of seventytwo out of
<a name="s16015a" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16015a">eighty odd</a>
constituencies that ratted at the time of the split and chiefly the belauded
peasant class, probably the selfsame evicted tenants he had put in their holdings.</p>
<p> So they passed on to chatting about music, a form of art for which Bloom, as
a pure <a name="un7007df" href="../../ff/unbs/un7all.htm#un7007df">amateur</a>,
possessed the greatest love, as they made tracks arm-in-arm across Beresford
place<a target="foot" id="frr0342">&ordm;</a>. Wagnerian music, though
<a name="un4031el" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031el">confessedly</a>
grand in its way, was a bit too heavy for Bloom and hard to follow at the first
go-off but the music of
<a name="s16022t" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16022t">Mercadante&apos;s
<i>Huguenots</i></a>,
<a name="s16022u" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16022u">Meyerbeer&apos;s

<a name="un4055ag" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4055ag">simply revelled
in</a>, the <i>Gloria</i> in that being to his mind the acme of
<a name="un7007bl" href="../../ff/unbs/un7all.htm#un7007bl">first class

such</a>, literally
<a name="un4042q" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4042q">knocking everything

those Moody and Sankey hymns or
<a name="un5014ba" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5014ba"><i>Bid me to live
and I will live thy protestant to be</i></a>. He also yielded to none in his
admiration of Rossini&apos;s <i>Stabat Mater</i>, a work simply
<a name="un4031dn" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031dn">abounding in
immortal numbers</a>, in which his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy, made a hit, a

desire for an encore. On the whole, though favouring preferably light opera of
the <i>Don Giovanni</i> description, and
<i>Martha</i>,<a target="foot" id="frr0348">&ordm;</a> a gem in its line, he had
a <i>penchant</i>, though with only a
<a name="s16006af" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16006af">surface
knowledge</a>, for the severe classical school such as Mendelssohn. And talking
of that, <a name="s16001be" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001be">taking it
for granted</a> he knew all about the old favourites, he mentioned
<a name="un5012b" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5012b"><i>par

<i>M&apos;appari</i>,<a target="foot" id="frr0349">&ordm;</a> which, curiously
enough, he heard, or overheard, to be more accurate,
<a name="s15065l" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15065l">on yesterday</a>, a
privilege he keenly appreciated, from the lips of Stephen&apos;s respected
father, sung to perfection, a study of the number, in fact, which made all the
others <a name="un5018au" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5018au">take a back
seat</a>. Stephen, in reply to a politely put query, said he
didn&apos;t<a target="foot" id="frr0350">&ordm;</a> but launched out into
praises of Shakespeare&apos;s songs, at least of in or about that period, the
lutenist Dowland who lived in Fetter Lane near Gerard the herbalist, who <i>anno
ludendo hausi, Doulandus</i>, an instrument he was contemplating purchasing from
Mr Arnold Dolmetsch, whom Bloom did not quite recall, though the name certainly
sounded familiar, for sixtyfive guineas and Farnaby and son with their

John Bull. He inquired if it was

because <a name="s16009g" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16009g">palpably</a>
