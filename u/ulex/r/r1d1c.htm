Though it was a warm pleasant sort of night for. And he felt a kind of need then
and there to satisfy a need. Nevertheless he just sat where he was viewing again

was <a name="un4048bj" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4048bj">a thousand

women. In the nature of
<a name="s16013bj" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16013bj">single
blessedness</a> he one day would take unto himself a wife when Miss Right came
on the scene but in the interim ladies&apos; society was a <u>conditio</u>
<a name="un4030u" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030u"><u>sine qua

with the orthodox

to some landlady worse than any stepmother was really too bad at his age. The
sudden <a name="un4030bj" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030bj">queer
things</a> he came out with attracted him rather like his father but something
substantial he certainly ought to eat even if it was only a homely Humpty Dumpty boiled.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; At what o&apos;clock did you dine? he questioned of the
slim form and tired but unwrinkled face.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Some time yesterday, Stephen said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yesterday! exclaimed Bloom till he
remem<a target="foot" id="frz0022">&ordm;</a> it was already tomorrow. Ah, you mean it&apos;s after 12.</p>

<a name="un4037bi" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4037bi">day before</a> yesterday, Stephen said.</p>
<p> Literally astounded at this piece of intelligence Bloom reflected. Though
they didn&apos;t see eye to eye in everything a certain analogy there somehow
was as if both their minds
(<a name="un4030bf" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030bf">though one was
several years the other&apos;s senior</a>) were travelling, so to speak, in the
same train of thought. At his age he too recollected when
<a name="s16005ai" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16005ai">dabbling in
politics</a> in retrospect (which was a source of satisfaction in itself) he had
a sneaking sympathy for those ultra ideas
<a name="s16002bu" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002bu">instilled</a> into
him in infancy for instance when the evicted tenants question bulked
<br><font color="green">{ms, 21}</font>
<br> largely in the public eye, though
<a name="s16001ck" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001ck">not contributing a
copper</a> to the cause or
<a name="s16001cb" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001cb">pinning his faith
to</a> its <a name="s16002p" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002p">dictums</a>
absolutely, he was in principle in sympathy with peasant possession,
<a name="s16001v" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001v">a partiality he had
never been entirely cured of</a>, &amp; even was
<a name="s16002m" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002m">twitted with going</a>
a step farther than Michael Davitt in the views he inculcated which was the
reason he strongly resented the innuendo put on him in so barefaced a fashion by
our friend at his gathering of the clans so that he the least pugnacious of
mortals, <a name="s16015b" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16015b">be it
repeated</a>, departed from his usual custom to give him one in the gizzard
though, so far as politics were concerned, he was only too conscious of the
casualties
<a name="un4031be" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031be">invariably</a>
resulting from propaganda &amp; displays of animosity and the misery &amp;
suffering it entailed as a
<a name="s16006ak" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16006ak">foregone
conclusion</a> on fine young fellows, destruction of the fittest, in a word.</p>
<p> Anyhow, <a name="s16013h" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16013h">upon</a>
weighing up the pros and cons, getting on for one as it was, it was high time to
be retiring for the night. The crux was it was a bit risky to bring him home as
eventualities might possibly ensue as on the night he misguidedly brought home a
Newfoundland dog with a lame paw (not that the cases were either identical or
the reverse though <a name="s16012k" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16012k">he
had hurt his hand</a>) to Ontario Terrace, as he very distinctly remembered. On
the other hand it was altogether too late for the Sandycove suggestion so that
he was in some perplexity as to which of the two alternatives.
<a name="s16014am" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16014am">Everything pointed
to the fact</a> that he ought to avail himself
<a name="s16010g" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16010g">to the full</a> of the
opportunity, all things considered. His
<a name="s16002bc" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002bc">initial
impression</a> was he was a shade standoffish &amp;
<a name="s16013c" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16013c">not over effusive</a>
but it grew on him someway.
<a name="s16002bd" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002bd">For one thing</a> He
mightn&apos;t exactly jump at the idea, if
<a name="s16002be" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002be">approached</a>, and
what worried him was he didn&apos;t know how to lead up to it or word it
exactly, supposing he entertained the proposal as it would
<a name="s16002ai" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002ai">afford him very
great personal pleasure if he would allow him to help</a> to
<a name="s16013af" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16013af">put coin in his way</a> or some wardrobe if found suitable.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 22}</font>
<br> At all events, he wound up by concluding to depart from
<a name="s16002ab" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002ab">hidebound
precedent</a>, a cup of Epps&apos;s cocoa and for the matter of that, a
shakedown for the night where he was at least

&amp; <a name="s16009s" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16009s">as warm as

<a name="s16013d" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16013d">passing a trivial remark</a>.</p>
<p> <a name="s16001ct" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001ct">Bloom was the
first to rise from his seat</a> having first and foremost taken the

society of oilskins and Stephen paused a moment by the door.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; One thing I never understood, he said
<a name="s16001t" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001t">on the spur of the
moment</a>. Why they put the chairs upside down on the table at night in a caf&eacute;.</p>

<a name="s16002cb" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002cb">without a
moment&apos;s hesitation</a> by saying straight off</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; To sweep the floor in the morning.</p>
<p> So saying <a name="s16022v" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16022v">he
skipped round</a> blankly apologetic
<a name="s16022v" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16022v">to get on
Stephen&apos;s right.</a> The night air was certainly a treat to breathe but
Stephen who was still poorly confessed to feeling a bit weak on his pins.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It will do you good in a moment, Bloom said. The only
thing is to walk. Come. It&apos;s not far. Lean on me.</p>
<p> <a name="s16026bu" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16026bu">He passed his
left arm in Stephen&apos;s</a> and <a name="s15013cb" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15013cb">led him on</a>.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, Stephen said uncertainly,
<a name="s16027j" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16027j">feeling a strange kind
of flesh approach him, sinewless rather and ample and all that.</a> They passed
by the sentrybox with its stones and brazier where the
<a name="s16006ai" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16006ai">municipal
supernumerary</a> was still to all intents &amp; purposes wrapped
<a name="un4003h" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4003h">in the arms of
Murphy</a>. And apropos of
<a name="s16026bf" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16026bf">coffin of stones</a>
the analogy was not bad as it was in fact a stoning to death on the part of
seventytwo out of 80 constituencies that ratted at the time of the split
<br><font color="green">{ms, 22v}</font>
<br> and chiefly the belauded peasant class probably the very evicted tenants he had put in their holdings.</p>
<p> They turned on to chatting about music an art for which Bloom, as a simple
<a name="s16006q" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16006q">virtuoso</a>,
possessed the greatest love as they made tracks arm in arm across Beresford
Place. Wagnerian music, though grand in its way, was a trifle too heavy for
Bloom, the music of
<a name="s16022t" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16022t">Mercadante&apos;s
<u>Huguenots</u></a>,
<a name="s16022u" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16022u">Meyerbeer&apos;s
<u>Seven Last Words on the Cross</u></a> and Mozart&apos;s
<u>Twellfh</u><a target="foot" id="frz0024">&ordm;</a> <u>Mass</u>, the
<u>Gloria</u> in that being the acme of musical expression. He also yielded to
none in his admiration of Rossini&apos;s <u>Stabat Mater</u> in which his wife,
Madam Marion Tweedy, made a hit, a veritable sensation
<a name="s16013n" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16013n">he might say</a>,
putting the others totally in the shade in the jesuit church, the
<a name="s16006an" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16006an">sacred edifice</a>
being thronged by
<a name="s16006q" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16006q">virtuosos</a> to hear
her. <a name="un5012cb" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5012cb">Suffice it to
say</a> for music of a sacred character there was a generally expressed desire
for an encore <a name="s16013ad" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16013ad">there
was none to come up to her</a>. On the whole though favouring preferably light
opera like <u>Don Giovanni</u> and Martha he had a penchant for classical
composers though with only a
<a name="s16006af" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16006af">surface
knowledge</a> like Mendelssohn. Talking of that,
<a name="s16001be" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001be">taking it for
granted</a> he knew all about the old favourites, he mentioned Lionel&apos;s air
in <u>Martha M&apos;appari</u> which, curiously enough, he had heard or rather
overheard, to be more accurate
<a name="s15065l" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15065l">on yesterday</a>,
<a name="s16010bg" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16010bg">a privilege he
keenly appreciated</a>, from the lips of Stephen&apos;s own respected father,
sung to perfection, in fact, a
<a name="s16002bk" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002bk">capital</a> study of
the number. Stephen, in reply to a politely put query, said he didn&apos;t sing
it but launched out into praises of the songs of Shakespeare&apos;s time, the
lutenist Dowland, an instrument he was thinking of purchasing from Mr Arnold
Dolmetsch whom Bloom did not recall though the name seemed familiar, for sixty
guineas and <a name="s16022g" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16022g">William
Byrd, who played the virginals in the Queen&apos;s Chapel</a> and out of it, and
<a name="s16022h" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16022h">John Bull</a>.</p>
<p> On the roadway beyond the swingchains which they were approaching, a horse,
dragging a <a name="s16026af" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16026af">sweeper</a>, paced on the
<br><font color="green">{ms, 21v}</font>
<br> <a name="s16027d" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16027d">paven ground</a>,
brushing a long swathe of mire so that with the noise Bloom was not
<a name="s16014aa" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16014aa">perfectly
certain</a> whether he had caught aright the allusion to sixty guineas and
<a name="s16022h" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16022h">John Bull</a>. He
inquired if it was
<a name="s16022h" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16022h">John Bull</a>, the
political celebrity of that ilk. The two names, so like, struck him as a curious coincidence.</p>
<p> By the chains the horse slowly
served<a target="foot" id="frz0025">&ordm;</a> to turn, perceiving which Bloom
plucked Stephen&apos;s sleeve gently, saying jocosely:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;
<a name="s16027n" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16027n">Beware of the
steamroller.</a> Our lives are in peril tonight.</p>
<p> They accordingly halted.
<a name="s16026m" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16026m">Bloom looked at the
head of a beast</a> not worth 60 gns suddenly revealed by darkness, near, new
and strange, a different grouping of bones and even flesh because it was
<a name="s16009g" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16009g">palpably</a> a
fourwalker, a hipshaker, a headhanger
<a name="s16026n" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16026n">putting his hind foot
foremost</a> for the sake of the chariotdriver on the perch. But such a good
poor brute he was sorry he hadn&apos;t
<a name="s16017cd" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16017cd">a lump of sugar</a>
but, as he reflected, you could scarcely be prepared for every
<a name="un4031bo" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031bo">emergency</a> that
might crop up. He was just a big nervous foolish noodly sort of a horse
<a name="s16001ch" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001ch">without a care in
the world</a>. <a name="s16026l" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16026l">But
even a dog, he reflected, take that mongrel in Barney Kiernan&apos;s of the same
size would be a holy horror to face.</a> It was no animal&apos;s fault if he was
built that way, like
<a name="s16026u" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16026u">the camel, ship of the
desert, distilling grapejuice into potheen in his hump</a>. Mostly all could be
tamed and caged, nothing being beyond the art of man barring the bees. Whale
with a harpoon hairpin, alligator tickle the small of his back and he sees the
joke, chalk a circle for a rooster, tiger my eagle eye. These timely reflections
occupied his mind rather distracted from Stephen&apos;s words while the
<br><font color="green">{ms, 20v}</font>
<br> ship of the street was
<a name="s16014ah" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16014ah">manoeuvring</a> and
Stephen was talking of the highly interesting.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; My wife, he
<a name="s16001ce" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001ce">intimated</a>, would
be very much interested to make your acquaintance as he was
<a name="s16027l" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16027l">passionately</a> attached to music of any kind.</p>
<p> He looked sideways in a friendly way at the sideface of Stephen, image of
his mother, which was not quite the same as the usual handsome blackguard type
they had an incurable hankering after as he was perhaps not that way built.</p>
<p> Still <a name="un4031bl" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031bl">it opened
up new vistas</a> in his mind such as Lady Fingall&apos;s recent industrial
concert <a name="s16008e" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16008e">on the
preceding Monday</a> and aristocracy in general.</p>
<p> <a name="s16021v" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16021v">Exquisite
variations he was now talking about on an air <u>Youth has here
and</u></a><a target="foot" id="frz0026">&ordm;</a>
<a name="s16021v" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16021v"><u>end</u> by Jans
Pieter Sweelinck, a Dutchman of Amsterdam where the frous come from. Even more
he liked an old German song of Johannes Jeep</a> in which you saw the clear sea
and heard the wooing voices of the sirens, sweet, false and cruel.</p>
<p class="set"><u>Von der Sirenen Listigkeit</u>
<br> <u>Tun die Po&euml;ten dichten</u></p>
<p> These opening bars he sang and translated. Bloom nodding said he understood
perfectly and begged him to continue which he did.</p>
<p> A <a name="un4031bm" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031bm">phenomenally
beautiful voice</a> like that
<a name="s16002t" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002t">the rarest of
boon</a><a target="foot" id="frz0027">&ordm;</a> which Bloom appreciated

against</a> his
<a name="s16005l" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16005l">debut</a>. Added to
which of course would be the emolument. Not that for the sake of filthy lucre he

need necessarily embrace the concert platform as

<a name="un4030ah" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030ah">for any lengthy
space of time</a>. But
<a name="s16001bg" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001bg">a step in the
required direction</a> it was beyond yea or nay and

and it often turned in uncommonly handy to be handed a cheque at a

<a name="s16025f" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16025f">catchy</a> tenor

for himself &amp;
