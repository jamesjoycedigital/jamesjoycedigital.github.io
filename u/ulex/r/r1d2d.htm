good example and leave the likeness there on the plea he. But it was scarcely
etiquette so. Though it was a warm pleasant sort of a night now for sunshine
after storm. And he did feel a kind of need there and then to satisfy a need.

two so that their names were coupled

expressions leaving no loophole to show that they cohabited and relations, when
the thing <a name="s16009u" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16009u">ran its
normal course</a>, became in due course intimate. Then the decree nisi and the
King&apos;s proctor tries to show cause why and nisi was made absolute. But as
for that the two misdemeanants<a target="foot" id="frz0081">&ordm;</a>, wrapped up as they were in one another, could

afford to ignore it as they very largely did. He, B, enjoyed the distinction of
being close to Erin&apos;s uncrowned king on the historic fracas when the fallen
leader&apos;s, who notoriously stuck to his guns
<a name="un5012al" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5012al">to the last</a>,
trusty henchmen to the number of ten or a dozen, penetrated into the printing
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">offices</span></span> works of
<u>United Ireland</u> (a by no means by the way appropriate appellative) and
broke up the typecases with hammers or something all on account of some
scurrilous effusions from the practised pens of the O&apos;Brienite scribes at
the usual mudslinging occupation reflecting on the
ertswhile<a target="foot" id="frz0083">&ordm;</a> tribune&apos;s private morals.
Though palpably a radically altered man he was still a commanding figure though
carelessly garbed as usual with that look of settled purpose which went a long
way with the shillyshallyers till they discovered to their discomfiture that
their <a name="s16001bv" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001bv">idol had feet
of clay</a> which she, however, was the first to perceive. As those were
particularly hot times in the general hullaballoo Bloom sustained
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><font color="black">a
<a name="s16014k" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16014k">minor injury</a>
from</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font> the prod of
some chap&apos;s elbow lodging in the stomach,
fortunately<a target="foot" id="frz0084">&ordm;</a> not of a grave character.
His hat (Parnell&apos;s) a silk one was inadvertently knocked off and Bloom was
the man who picked it up in the crush and returned it to him with the utmost
celerity who panting and hatless and whose thoughts were miles away from his hat
at the time all the same being a gentleman born with a
<a name="s16005k" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16005k">stake in the
country</a> what&apos;s bred in the bone
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><font color="black">instilled
into him in infancy</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>
came out at once because he turned round to the donor and thanked him saying:
Thank you, sir, though in a very different tone of voice from the ornament of
the legal profession whose headgear Bloom also set to rights, history repeating
itself with a difference, after the burial of a mutual friend when they had left him alone
<br><font color="green">{ms, 042}</font>
<br> in his glory.</p>
<p> On the other had<a target="foot" id="frz0085">&ordm;</a> what incensed him
more inwardly was the blatant jokes of the cabman and so on who passed it off as
a jest pretending to understand everything, the why and the wherefore, and in
reality not knowing their own minds. He personally, being of a sceptical bias,
believed and made no bones about saying so either that man or men in the plural
were always hanging around about a lady when she chose to be tired of wedded
life to press their attentions on her with improper intent,
<a name="s16006al" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16006al">the upshot being
that</a> <a name="s16010be" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16010be">her
affections centred on another</a>, the cause of many liaisons between still
attractive married women and younger men, no doubt.</p>
<p> It was a thousand pities a young fellow,
<a name="s16012j" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16012j">blessed with
brains</a> as his neighbour obviously was, should waste his valuable time with
profligate women. In the nature of single blessedness he would one day take unto
himself a wife when Miss Right came on the scene but in the interim ladies&apos;
society was a <u>conditio sine qua non</u> though he had the gravest possible
doubts as to whether he would find much satisfaction
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">of sm</span></span>
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><font color="black"><a name="s16012i" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16012i">basking</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>
in the company of smirking misses bi or triweekly with the orthodox preliminary
canter <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">and</span></span> of
complimentplaying leading up to fond lovers&apos; ways and flowers and chocs. To
think of him house and homeless, rooked by some landlady worse than any
stepmother was really too bad at his age. The queer suddenly things he popped
out with attracted the elder man who was several years the other&apos;s senior
or like his father but something substantial he
certainly<a target="foot" id="frz0086">&ordm;</a> ought to eat even were it only the homely Humpty
<br><font color="green">{ms, 043}</font>
<br> Dumpty boiled.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; At what o&apos;clock did you dine? he questioned of the
slim form and tired though unwrinkled face.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Some time yesterday, Stephen said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yesterday! exclaimed Bloom till he remembered it was
already tomorrow Friday. Ah, you mean it&apos;s after twelve.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The day before yesterday, Stephen said.</p>
<p> Literally astounded at this piece of intelligence Bloom reflected. Though
they didn&apos;t see eye to eye in everything a certain analogy there somehow
was as if both their minds were travelling, so to speak, in the one train of
thought. At his age when dabbling in politics he too recollected in retrospect
(which was a source of satisfaction in itself) he had a
sneaking<a target="foot" id="frz0087">&ordm;</a> for those same ultra ideas. For
instance when the evicted tenants question bulked largely in people&apos;s mind
though not contributing a copper to the cause or pinning his faith absolutely to
its dictums he in principle
<a name="un6015ek" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6015ek">at all events</a>
was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><font color="black">(a
partiality, however, he was subsequently partially cured
of)</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font> and even was
twitted with going a step farther than Michael Davitt in
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">this</span></span> the views he
inculcated<a target="foot" id="frz0088">&ordm;</a> which was one reason he
strongly resented the
<a name="s16007i" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16007i">innuendo</a> put upon
him in so barefaced a fashion by our friend at the gathering of the clans in
Barney Kiernan&apos;s so that he, the least pugnacious of mortals, be it
repeated, departed from his customary habit to give him metaphorically one in
the gizzard though, so far as politics were concerned, he was only too conscious
of the casualties invariably resulting from propaganda and displays of animosity
and the misery and suffering it entailed
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><font color="black">as a
foregone
conclusion<a target="foot" id="frz0089">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>
on fine young fellows, chiefly, destruction of the fittest, in a word.</p>
<p> Anyhow <a name="s16013i" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16013i">upon</a>
weighing up the pros and cons, getting on for one, as it was, it was high time
<br><font color="green">{ms, 044}</font>
<br> to be retiring for the night. The crux was it was a bit risky to bring him
home as eventualities might possibly ensue as on the night he misguidedly
brought home a dog (breed unknown) with a lame paw (not that the cases were
either <a name="s16003m" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16003m">identical or
the reverse</a> though he had hurt his hand too) to Ontario Terrace as he very
distinctly remembered. On the other hand it was altogether too late for the
Sandymount<a target="foot" id="frz0090">&ordm;</a> or Sandycove suggestion so
that he was in some perplexity as to which of the two alternatives. Everything
pointed to the fact that it behoved him to avail himself to the full of the
opportunity, all things considered. His initial impression was he was a shade
standoffish or not over effusive but it grew on him someway. For one thing he
mightn&apos;t what you call jump at the idea, if approached, and what mostly
worried him was he didn&apos;t know how to lead up to it or word it exactly,
supposing he did entertain the proposal as it would afford him very great
personal pleasure if he would allow him to help to put coin in his way or some
wardrobe, if found suitable. At all events he wound up by concluding, eschewing
for the nonce hidebound precedent, a cup of Epps&apos;s cocoa and a shakedown
for the night with a rug or to and overcoat doubled into a pillow at least he
would be in safe hands and as warm as a toast he failed to perceive any very
vast amount of harm in always with the proviso no rumpus of any sort was kicked
up. A move had to be made because that merry old soul, the grasswidower in
question, didn&apos;t appear in any particular hurry to wend his way home to his
dearly beloved Queenstown and it was highly likely some sponger&apos;s
bawdyhouse of retired beauties off Sheriff street lower would be the best
<br><font color="green">{ms, 045}</font>
<br> <a name="s16001bo" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001bo">clue to</a>
that equivocal character&apos;s
<a name="s16001bo" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001bo">whereabouts</a> for
a few days to come, alternately racking their feelings (the mermaids&apos;) with
six chamber revolver anecdotes verging on the tropical and mauling their
largesized charms between whiles with rough and tumble gusto to the
accompaniment of the usual blarney about himself for as to who he really was let
x equal my right name and address, as Mr Algebra remarks. At the same time he
inwardly chuckled over his gentle repartee to the blood and ouns champion about
his god being a jew. People could put up with being bitten by a wolf but what
properly riled them was a bite from a sheep. The most vulnerable point too of
tender Achilles. Your god was a jew. Because mostly they appeared to imagine he
came from Carrick-on-Shannon or somewhereabouts in the county Sligo.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I propose, he eventually suggested after mature
reflection while prudently pocketing<a target="foot" id="frz0091">&ordm;</a> her
photo, you just come home with me and
<a name="s16013ag" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16013ag">talk things
over</a>. My diggings are quite close in the vicinity. You can&apos;t drink that
stuff. Do you like cocoa? Wait. I&apos;ll just pay this lot.</p>
<p> The best plan clearly being to clear out, the remainder being plain sailing,
he beckoned, while prudently pocketing the photo, to the keeper of the shanty who didn&apos;t seem to.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, that&apos;s the best, he
assured<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span> Stephen to
whom for the matter of that it was all more or less.</p>
<p> All kinds of Utopian plans were flashing through his (B&apos;s) brain,
education (the genuine article), literature, journalism, prize titbits, up to
date billing, hydros and concert tours in English watering resorts packed with
theatres, turning money away, duets in Italian with the accent perfectly true to
nature, no necessity, of course, to tell the world and his wife from the
housetops about it, and a slice of luck. An opening was all was wanted. Because he
<br><font color="green">{ms, 046}</font>
<br> more than suspected he had his father&apos;s voice so it would be just as
well, by the way no harm, to trail the conversation in that direction just to.</p>
<p> The cabby read out of the paper he had got hold of that the former viceroy,
earl Cadogan, had presided at the cabdriver&apos;s association dinner in London
somewhere. Silence with a yawn or two accompanied this thrilling announcement.
Then the old specimen in the corner read out that sir Anthony MacDonnell had
left Euston for the chief secretary&apos;s lodge. To which echo answered why.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Give us a squint at that literature, grandfather, the
ancient mariner put in, manifesting some impatience.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And welcome, answered the old party thus addressed.</p>
<p> The sailor lugged out from a case he had a pair of greenish goggles which he
very slowly hooked over his nose and both ears.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Are you bad in the eyes? the sympathetic personage like the townclerk queried.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Why, answered the seafarer, staring out of seagreen
portholes as you might well describe them as, I uses goggles reading. Sand in
the Red Sea done that. One time I could read a book in the dark, manner of
speaking. <u>The Arabian Nights Entertainment</u> was my favourite and <u>Red as a Rose was she</u>.</p>
<p> Hereupon he pawed the journal open and pored upon Lord only knows what
during which time the keeper was intensely occupied loosening an apparently new
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><font color="black">or
secondhand</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font> boot
which manifestly pinched him as he muttered against whoever it was sold it, all
of them who were awake enough to be picked out by their facial expressions,
either simply looking on or passing a trivial remark.</p>
<p> Bloom was the first to rise
<br><font color="green">{ms, 047}</font>
<br> from his seat having first and foremost taken the wise precaution to motion
to mine host, a scarcely perceptible sign when the others were not looking, to
the effect that the amount due as forthcoming, making a grand total of fourpence
(the amount he deposited unobtrusively in four coppers, literally the last of
the Mohicans), he having previously seen on the printed pricelist for all who
ran to read opposite him in unmistakable figures, coffee 2d, confectionery do, and honestly worth the money.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Come, he counselled to close the <u>s&eacute;ance</u>.</p>
<p> Seeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear they left the shelter or
shanty together and the elite society of oilskins and company. Stephen, who
confessed<a target="foot" id="frz0092">&ordm;</a> to still feeling poorly
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><font color="black">and
<a name="un4030ej" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030ej">fagged
out</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>, paused at the, for a moment, the door.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; One thing I never understood, he said to be original on
the spur of the moment. Why they put chairs upside down at night on the tables in caf&eacute;s.</p>
<p> To which impromptu the neverfailing<a target="foot" id="frz0093">&ordm;</a>
Bloom replied without a moment&apos;s hesitation, saying straight off:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; To sweep the floor in the morning.</p>
<p> So saying he skipped around, nimbly considering,
<a name="un4048bt" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4048bt">frankly</a> at the
same time apologetic to get on his companion&apos;s right, a habit of his,
<a name="un4030dh" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030dh">by the bye</a>. The
night air was certainly now a treat to breathe though Stephen was a bit weak on his pins.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It will (the air) do you good, Bloom said, meaning also
the walk, in a moment. The only thing is to walk. Come. It&apos;s not far. Lean on me.</p>
<p> Accordingly he passed his left arm in Stephen&apos;s right and led him on accordingly.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, Stephen said uncertainly because he thought he felt
a strange kind of flesh approach him, sinewless
<br><font color="green">{ms, 048}</font>
<br> and wobbly and all that. Anyhow they passed the sentrybox with stones,
brazier etc where the municipal
supernumerary<a target="foot" id="frz0094">&ordm;</a>, ex Gumley, was still to
all intents and purposes wrapped in the arms of Murphy, as they say. And apropos
of coffin of stones the analogy was not bad as it was in fact a stoning to death
on the part of seventytwo out of
<a name="s16015a" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16015a">eighty odd</a>
constituencies<a target="foot" id="frz0095">&ordm;</a> that ratted at the time
of the split<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span> and
chiefly the belauded peasant class, probably the selfsame evicted tenants he had put in their holdings.</p>
<p> So they turned on to chatting about music, a form of art for which Bloom
possessed the greatest love, as they made tracks arm in arm across Beresford
place. Wagnerian music, though
<a name="un4031el" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031el">confessedly</a>
grand in its way, was a bit too heavy for Bloom but the music of
Mercadante&apos;s <u>Huguenots</u>, Meyerbeer&apos;s <u>Seven Last Words on the
Cross</u> and Mozart&apos;s <u>Twelfth Mass</u>, the <u>Gloria</u> in that
being, to his mind, the acme of musical expression. He also yielded to none in
his admiration of Rossini&apos;s <u>Stabat Mater</u>, a work simply
<a name="un4031dn" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031dn">abounding in
immortal numbers</a>, in which his wife Madam Marion Tweedy, made a hit, a
veritable sensation, he might even say, putting the others totally in the shade,
in the jesuit
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><font color="black">fathers&apos;</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>
church in upper Gardiner<a target="foot" id="frz0096">&ordm;</a> street, the
sacred edifice being thronged to hear her with virtuosos, or virtuosi rather.
There was the
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">generally
expressed</span></span>
<font color="black">unanimous</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>
opinion that there was none to come up to her and suffice it to say
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><font color="black">in a
<a name="un4030ec" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030ec">place of
worship</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font> for
music of a sacred character there was a generally voiced desire for an encore. On the whole though favouring
<br><font color="green">{ms, 049}</font>
<br> preferably light opera of the <u>Don Giovanni</u> description and
<u>Martha</u>, a gem in its line, he had a <u>penchant</u>, though with only a
surface knowledge, for the severe classical school such as Mendelssohn. And
talking of that, taking it for granted he knew all about the old favourites, he
mentioned Lionel&apos;s air in <u>Martha</u>, <u>M&apos;appari</u>, which,
curiously enough, he heard or overheard, to be more accurate, on yesterday, a
privilege he keenly appreciated, from the lips of Stephen&apos;s respected
father, sung to perfection, a study of the number, in fact. Stephen, in reply to
a politely put query, said he didn&apos;t but launched out into praises of
Shakespeare&apos;s songs, at least of in or about that period, the lutenist
Dowland
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><font color="black">who
lived in Fetter lane near Gerard the herbalist, who <u>anno ludendo hausi,

instrument he was contemplating<a target="foot" id="frz0097">&ordm;</a>
purchasing from Mr Arnold Dolmetsch, whom B. did not quite recall though the
name certainly sounded familiar, for sixtyfive guineas and Farnaby and son
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><font color="black">with
their <u>dux</u> and <u>comes</u>
conceits,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font> and Byrd

anywhere else he found them and

airs,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font> and John Bull.</p>
<p> On the roadway which they were approaching beyond the swingchains a horse,
dragging a sweeper, paced on the paven ground, brushing a long swathe of mire
up, so that with the noise Bloom was not perfectly certain whether he had caught
aright the allusion to sixtyfive guineas and John Bull. He inquired if it was
John Bull, the political celebrity of that ilk, as it struck him, the two identical names, as a striking coincidence.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 050}</font> </p>
<p> By the chains the horse slowly swerved to turn, which perceiving, Bloom
plucked the other&apos;s sleeve gently, jocosely remarking:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Our lives are in peril tonight. Beware of the steamroller.</p>
<p> They thereupon stopped. Bloom looked at a head of a horse not worth
sixtyfive guineas, suddenly in evidence in the dark quite near so that it seemed
new, a different grouping of bones and even flesh because palpably it was a
fourwalker<a target="foot" id="frz0098">&ordm;</a>, a hipshaker, a taildangler,
a headhanger putting his hind foot foremost the while the lord of his creation
sat on the perch, busy with his thoughts. But such a good poor brute he was
sorry he hadn&apos;t a lump of sugar but, as he wisely reflected, you could
scarcely be prepared for every emergency that might crop up. He was just a big
nervous foolish noodly kind of a horse, without a care in the world. But even a
dog, he reflected, take that mongrel in Barney Kiernan&apos;s, of the same size,
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">will</span></span> would be a holy
horror to face. But it was no animal&apos;s fault in particular if he was built
that way, like the camel, ship of the desert, distilling
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext"><font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font></span></span>
<font color="black">grapes</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>
into potheen in his hump. Nine tenths of them all could be caged or trained,
nothing beyond the art of man barring the bees. Whale with a harpoon hairpin,
alligator tickle the small of his back and he sees the joke, chalk a circle for
a rooster, tiger, my eagle eye. These timely reflections
<a name="un4030dk" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030dk">anent</a> the brutes
occupied his mind somewhat distracted from
<br><font color="green">{ms, 051}</font>
<br> Stephen&apos;s words while the ship of the street was manoeuvring and
Stephen went on about the highly interesting old.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; My wife, he intimated, would be very much interested to
make your acquaintance, as she is passionately attached to music of any kind.</p>
<p> He looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of Stephen, image
of his mother, which was not quite the same as the usual handsome blackguard
type they had an insatiable hankering after as he was perhaps not that way built.</p>
<p> Still, supposing he had his father&apos;s gift as he more than suspected, it
opened up new vistas in his mind such as Lady Fingall&apos;s
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><font color="black">Irish</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>
industries, concert on the preceding Monday and aristocracy in general.</p>
<p> Exquisite variations he was now
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><font color="black">describing</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>
on an air <u>Youth here has end</u> by Jans Pieter Sweelinck, a Dutchman of

<p class="set"><u>Von der Sirenen Listigkeit

<p> These opening bars he sang and translated. Bloom, nodding, said he perfectly
understood and begged him to go on
<a name="s16002ba" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002ba">by all means</a> which he did.</p>
<p> A phenomenally beautiful voice like that, the rarest of

emolument. Not, he parenthesised, that for the sake of filthy lucre he need
necessarily embrace the lyric platform as a walk in life for any lengthy
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">period</span></span> space of
time. But a step in the required direction it was beyond yea or nay and both
monetarily and mentally it contained no reflection on his dignity in the
smallest and it often turned in uncommonly handy to be handed a cheque at a
muchneeded moment<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span>
when every little helped. Besides, though taste latterly had deteriorated to a
degree, original music like that, different from the conventional rut, would

<p> The horse was just then. And later on at a propitious opportunity he
purposed (Bloom did), without anyway prying into his private affairs, advising
him to sever his connection with a certain budding practitioner who, he noticed,
was prone to disparage and even
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">deprecate him</span></span> to a

floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish, three smoking globes of

humanely his driver waited till he (or she) had ended, patient in his scythed car.</p>
<p> Side by side Bloom, profiting by the contretemps, with Stephen passed
through the gap of the chains, divided by the upright and, stepping over a strand of mire, went across
