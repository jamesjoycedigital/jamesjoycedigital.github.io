<p> Preparatory to anything else Mr Bloom brushed off the greater bulk of the
shavings and handed Stephen the hat and ashplant and bucked him up generally in
<a name="s16005v" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16005v">good</a>
<a name="s16005v" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16005v">Samaritan</a> fashion,
which he very badly needed. His (Stephen&apos;s) mind was not exactly what you
would call wandering but a bit unsteady and on his expressed desire for
something to drink Mr Bloom, in view of the hour it was and there being no
pump<a target="foot" id="frr0001">&ordm;</a> of Vartry water available for their
<a name="s16003a" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16003a">ablutions</a>, let
alone drinking purposes,
<a name="s16002at" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002at">hit upon an
expedient</a> by suggesting the propriety of the cabman&apos;s shelter, as it
was called, near Butt Bridge. But how to get there was the rub. For the nonce he
was rather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty devolved upon him he pondered
<a name="un4031cm" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031cm">ways and means</a>
during which Stephen repeatedly yawned. So far as he could see he was rather
<a name="s16001b" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001b">pale in the face</a>
so that <a name="un6015bv" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6015bv">it occurred
to him</a> as highly advisable to get a conveyance of some description
<a name="un4031cp" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031cp">in their then
condition</a>, <a name="un6015bc" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6015bc">both
of them being e.d. ed particularly Stephen</a>, always assuming that there was
such a thing to be found. Accordingly<a target="foot" id="frr0003">&ordm;</a>
after a few such
<a name="un4031ct" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031ct">preliminaries</a><a target="foot" id="frr0004">&ordm;</a>
as brushing they both walked together along Beaver
street<a target="foot" id="frr0007">&ordm;</a>, or, more properly, lane, as far
as the farrier&apos;s and the distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables
at the corner of Montgomery street where they made tracks to the left,
<a name="un6015ea" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6015ea">from</a> thence
<a name="un4030ch" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030ch">debouching</a> into
Amiens street<a target="foot" id="frr0008">&ordm;</a> round by  the corner of
Dan Bergin&apos;s. But,
<a name="s16028q" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16028q">as he</a> fully
<a name="s16028q" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16028q">anticipated</a>, there
was not a sign of a
<a name="un4031cl" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031cl">Jehu</a> plying for
hire anywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler, probably engaged by some fellows
inside on the spree, outside the North Star Hotel, and there was no symptom of
its budging an inch when Mr Bloom, who was
<a name="un6015do" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6015do">anything but</a> a
<a name="un5017bp" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5017bp">professional</a>
<a name="s16003am" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16003am">whistler</a>,
<a name="un4031k" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031k">endeavoured to
hail</a> it by emitting a kind of a whistle,
<a name="un4031k" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031k">holding his arms arched over his head</a>, twice.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 570}</font> </p>
<p> This was a quandary but,
<a name="s16002af" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002af">bringing common
sense</a><a target="foot" id="frr0009">&ordm;</a>
<a name="s16002af" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002af">to bear on it</a>,
evidently there was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and
<a name="un5007ba" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5007ba">foot it</a> which
they accordingly did. So, bevelling around by
Mullett&apos;s<a target="foot" id="frr0010">&ordm;</a> and the Signal House,
<a name="un6015du" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6015du">which they shortly
reached</a> <a name="un4031ae" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031ae">they
proceeded</a> <a name="un4031ae" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031ae">in the
direction of</a> Amiens street<a target="foot" id="frr0011">&ordm;</a> railway
terminus, Mr Bloom being
<a name="s16009h" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16009h">handicapped by the
circumstance</a> that one of the back buttons of his trousers had,
<a name="s16002ae" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002ae">to vary the</a>
<a name="s16002ae" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002ae">adage</a>, gone the
way of all buttons<a target="foot" id="frr0012">&ordm;</a> though,
<a name="un7007u" href="../../ff/unbs/un7all.htm#un7007u">entering thoroughly
into the spirit of the thing</a>, he heroically
<a name="s16001e" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001e">made light of</a> the
mischance. So they
<a name="s15036av" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15036av">dandered</a> along
past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a fare or a jarvey. As it so
happened a Dublin United Tramways Company&apos;s
<a name="un4030el" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030el">sandstrewer
happening to be returning</a><a target="foot" id="frr0013">&ordm;</a> the elder
man recounted to his companion a propos of the incident his own truly
<a name="un4030ek" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030ek">miraculous
escape</a> of some little while back. They passed the main entrance of the Great
Northern railway station, the starting point for Belfast, where of course all
traffic was suspended at that late hour, and passing the back door of the morgue
(a not very enticing locality, not to say
<a name="s16005o" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16005o">gruesome</a>, more
especially at night),
<a name="un4031bs" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031bs">ultimately</a>
gained the Dock Tavern and in due course turned into Store
street<a target="foot" id="frr0015">&ordm;</a>, famous for its
<a name="s16017bd" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16017bd">C division police
station</a>. Between this point and the high, at present unlit, warehouses of
Beresford Place Stephen thought to think of Ibsen, associated with Baird&apos;s,
the stonecutter&apos;s in his mind somehow in Talbot Place, first turning on the
right, while the other, who was acting as his <i>fidus Achates</i> inhaled with
internal satisfaction the smell of James Rourke&apos;s city bakery, situated
quite close to where  they were, the very
<a name="s16009al" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16009al">palatable</a> odour
indeed of our daily bread, of all commodities of the public the primary and most
indispensable. Bread, the staff of life, earn your bread, O tell me where is
fancy bread? At Rourke&apos;s the baker&apos;s, it is said.</p>
<p> <a name="s16003t" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16003t">En route</a>, to
his taciturn, and, not to put too fine a point on it, not yet perfectly sober
companion, Mr Bloom, who
<a name="un6015ek" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6015ek">at all
events</a><a target="foot" id="frr0018">&ordm;</a> was in complete possession of
his faculties, <a name="s16013v" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16013v">never
more so</a>, spoke <a name="s16011v" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16011v">a
word of caution</a> <i>re</i> the dangers of
<a name="s16027s" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16027s">nighttown</a>, which,
barely permissible once in a while, though
<a name="s16005ag" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16005ag">not as a habitual
practice</a>, was of the nature of a regular deathtrap for young fellows of his
age particularly. Highly providential was the appearance on the scene of
<a name="s16017cc" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16017cc">Corny Kelleher</a> when Stephen
<br><font color="green">{u22, 571}</font>
<br> was blissfully unconscious that, but for that man in the gap, the finis
might have been the bridewell and an appearance in the court next day before Mr
Tobias, or, he being the solicitor
rather,<a target="foot" id="frr0021">&ordm;</a> old Wall, he meant to say, or
Mahony<a target="foot" id="frr0022">&ordm;</a>. A lot of those policemen were
admittedly unscrupulous and, as Mr Bloom put it, recalling a case or two in the
<a name="s16017bc" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16017bc">A Division</a> in
Clanbrassil street<a target="foot" id="frr0023">&ordm;</a>, prepared to
<a name="s16021u" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16021u">swear a hole through a
ten gallon pot</a>. Never
<a name="s16013ak" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16013ak">on the spot</a> when
wanted <a name="s16026bh" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16026bh">but in quiet
parts of the city</a>, Pembroke road<a target="foot" id="frr0024">&ordm;</a> for
example, <a name="un5017ar" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5017ar">the
guardians of the law</a> were well in evidence, the
<a name="un5012d" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5012d">obvious</a> reason
being <a name="s16026bh" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16026bh">they were paid
to protect the upper classes</a>.
<a name="s16021dk" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16021dk">Another thing he
commented on was equipping soldiers with</a>
<a name="s16021dk" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16021dk">arms</a> of any
kind, <a name="s16021dk" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16021dk">which was
tantamount to inciting them</a> against civilians. You
<a name="un4030cr" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030cr">frittered away your
time</a>, he very sensibly remarked, and health and also character besides
which,<a target="foot" id="frr0026">&ordm;</a>
<a name="s16006t" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16006t">fast women</a> of the
<a name="s16005ah" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16005ah">demimonde</a>
<a name="un4030da" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030da">ran  away with a lot
of</a> <a name="s16010ao" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16010ao">&pound;. s.
d.</a> into the bargain and the greatest danger of all was who you got drunk
with. Most of all he commented adversely on the desertion of Stephen by all his
<a name="un4030cs" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030cs">pubhunting
confr&egrave;res</a> but one,
<a name="s16002ah" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002ah">a most glaring piece
of</a> ratting <a name="s16001av" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001av">under all the circs</a>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And that one was Judas, said Stephen, who up to then had
said nothing <a name="un7007i" href="../../ff/unbs/un7all.htm#un7007i">whatsoever</a> of any kind.</p>
<p> Discussing these and kindred topics they passed under the Loop Line bridge
where<a target="foot" id="frr0029">&ordm;</a> a brazier of coke burning in front
of a sentrybox, or something like one, attracted their rather lagging footsteps.
Stephen stopped for no special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones
and by the light emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker
figure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox. He began
to remember that this had happened, or had been mentioned as having happened, before but it cost
<br><font color="green">{u22, 572}</font>
<br> him <a name="s16009bd" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16009bd">no
small</a> effort before he remembered that
<a name="s16016j" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16016j">he recognised</a> in
the sentry a
<a name="un5017cl" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5017cl"><i>quondam</i></a><a target="foot" id="frr0030">&ordm;</a>
friend of his father&apos;s, Gumley. To avoid a meeting he drew nearer to the pillars of the railway bridge.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Someone saluted you, Mr Bloom said.</p>
<p> <a name="s16021bp" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16021bp">A figure</a>
<a name="s16021bp" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16021bp">on the prowl,
evidently, under the arches saluted again</a>, calling: Night. Stephen, of
course, started rather dizzily and stopped to
<a name="s16005e" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16005e">return the
compliment</a>. Mr Bloom, actuated by motives of delicacy, moved off, but
nevertheless remained on the <i>qui vive</i> with just a shade of anxiety.
Although unusual in Dublin he knew that it was not by any means unknown for
<a name="s16026bt" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16026bt">desperadoes</a> who
had <a name="un4031da" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031da">next to
nothing</a> to live on to be about waylaying
<a name="s16009ab" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16009ab">and generally
terrorising</a> peaceable
<a name="un4030c" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030c">pedestrians</a> by
 <a name="un7007ae" href="../../ff/unbs/un7all.htm#un7007ae">placing a pistol at
their head</a> in some secluded spot outside the city proper, famished loiterers
they might be <a name="s16009p" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16009p">hanging
about there</a> or simply

could at a moment&apos;s notice,
<a name="s16026bt" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16026bt">your money or your life</a>.</p>
<p> Stephen, <a name="s16016o" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16016o">that
is</a> when the accosting figure came to close quarters, though he was not
<a name="s16015ac" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16015ac">in
an</a><a target="foot" id="frr0033">&ordm;</a>
<a name="s16015ac" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16015ac">over sober state</a>
himself, recognised Corly&apos;s breath redolent of rotten
<a name="s15064t" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15064t">cornjuice</a>.
<a name="s16021bm" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16021bm">Lord John Corly,
some called him, and his genealogy came about in this wise.</a> He was the
eldest son of Inspector Corly of the G Division, lately deceased, who had
married a certain Katherine Brophy, the daughter of a Louth farmer. His
grandfather, Patrick Michael Corly, of New Ross, had married the widow of a
publican there whose maiden name had been Katherine (also) Talbot. Rumour had
it,though not proved, that she descended from
<a name="s16021dd" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16021dd">the house of</a> the
Lords Talbot de Malahide, in whose mansion her mother or aunt or some relative
had <a name="s16001bc" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001bc">enjoyed the
distinction</a> of being
<a name="s16021cf" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16021cf">in service in the
washkitchen</a>. This, therefore, was the reason why the still comparatively
young though dissolute man who now addressed Stephen was spoken of by some with
facetious <a name="s16001an" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001an">proclivities</a> as Lord John Corly.</p>
<p> <a name="s16013ao" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16013ao">Taking Stephen
on one side</a> he had the customary doleful ditty to tell. Not as much as a
farthing to purchase a night&apos;s lodgings. His friends had all deserted him.
Furthermore, he had a row with Lenehan<a target="foot" id="frr0034">&ordm;</a>
and called him to Stephen a mean bloody
<a name="s16025e" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16025e">swab</a>
<a name="un4031dk" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031dk">with a sprinkling of
other uncalled-for expressions</a>.
<a name="s16021cp" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16021cp">He was out of a job
and implored of Stephen to tell him where on God&apos;s earth he could get
something</a>, anything at all,<a target="foot" id="frr0035">&ordm;</a> to do. No, it was the daughter of the
<br><font color="green">{u22, 573}</font>
<br> mother in the washkitchen that was
<a name="s16013cd" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16013cd">fostersister</a> to
the heir of the house, both occurrences happening at the same time. Anyhow, he was all in.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I wouldn&apos;t ask you, only, pursued he, on my solemn
oath and  God knows I&apos;m on the rocks.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="s16021bo" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16021bo">There&apos;ll be a
job tomorrow</a><a target="foot" id="frr0036">&ordm;</a>
<a name="s16021bo" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16021bo">or the next day,
Stephen told him,</a>
<a name="s16021cq" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16021cq">in a boys&apos;
school at Dalkey for a gentleman usher. Mr Garrett Deasy. Try it.</a> You may mention my name.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ah, God, Corly replied, sure I couldn&apos;t teach in a
school, man. I was never one of your bright ones, he added with a half
laugh.<a target="foot" id="frr0037">&ordm;</a> Got stuck twice in the junior at the Christian Brothers.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I have no place to sleep myself, Stephen informed him.</p>
<p> Corly, at the first go-off, was inclined to suspect
<a name="s16005ac" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16005ac">it was something to
do with</a> Stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody tart
off the street.
<a name="s16021ct" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16021ct">There was a
dosshouse in Marlborough street</a><a target="foot" id="frr0038">&ordm;</a>, Mrs
Maloney&apos;s, but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but
M&apos;Conachie told him you got a decent enough do in the Brazen Head over in
Winetavern street<a target="foot" id="frr0039">&ordm;</a> for a bob. He was
starving too though he hadn&apos;t said a word about it.</p>
<p> Though <a name="s16014ba" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16014ba">this sort
of thing</a> went on every other night or very near it still Stephen&apos;s
feelings got the better of him though he knew that Corly&apos;s brandnew
rigmarole, on a par with the others, was hardly deserving of much credence.
However, <a name="jn2037e" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2037e"><i>haud
ignarus malorum miseris succurrere disco</i>, etcetera,</a> especially
<a name="s16001cs" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001cs">as luck would have
it</a> he <a name="s16005c" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16005c">got paid</a>

middle of the month</a> on the sixteenth which was the date of the month as a
matter of fact. But the cream of the joke was nothing would get it out of
Corly&apos;s head that he was living in affluence and hadn&apos;t a thing to do
but hand out the needful; whereas. He put his hand in a pocket anyhow, not with
the idea of finding any food there, but thinking he might lend him anything up
to a bob or so <a name="un4030db" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030db">in
lieu</a> so that <a name="un4030ai" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030ai">he

the moment whether he had lost, as well he might have, or left, because in that
<a name="un4031bp" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031bp">contingency</a> it
was not a pleasant lookout, very much the reverse, in fact. He was altogether
too  <a name="un4030ej" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030ej">fagged out</a> to institute a thorough search though

<a name="un4030bh" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030bh">recollect</a>.
About<a target="foot" id="frr0041">&ordm;</a> biscuits he
<a name="s16005ad" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16005ad">dimly
remembered</a>. Who now exactly gave them, or where was, or did he buy? However,
in another pocket he came across what he surmised in the dark were pennies,
<a name="s16005b" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16005b">erroneously</a>, however.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Those are halfcrowns, man, Corly corrected him.</p>
<p> And so <a name="un4030r" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030r">in point of
fact</a> they turned out to be. Stephen lent him one of them.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Thanks, Corly answered. You&apos;re a gentleman. I&apos;ll
pay you back some time. Who&apos;s that with you? I saw him a few times with
Boylan the billsticker. You might put in a good word for us to get me taken on
there. I&apos;d carry a sandwichboard only the girl in the office told me
they&apos;re full up for the next three weeks, man. God, you&apos;ve to
<a name="un4030ds" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030ds">book ahead</a>, man,
you&apos;d think it was for the Carl Rosa. I don&apos;t give a shite anyway so long as I get a job.</p>
<p> <a name="s16021bq" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16021bq">Subsequently,
being not quite so down in the mouth after the two-and-six he got, he informed
Stephen about a fellow</a> by the name of Bags Comisky that he said Stephen knew
well out of Fulham&apos;s, the shipchandler&apos;s, bookkeeper there, that used
to be often round in
<a name="un4037ba" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4037ba">Nagle&apos;s</a>
back with O&apos;Mara and a little chap with a stutter called Tighe. Anyhow, he
was lagged the night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and disorderly
and <a name="s16022f" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16022f">refusing to go with the constable</a>.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the
cobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation
watchman&apos;s sentrybox, who, evidently a
<a name="s16006o" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16006o">glutton for work</a>,
it struck him, was having a quiet forty winks on his own private account while
Dublin slept. He threw an odd eye at the same time now and then at
Stephen&apos;s
<a name="un6015do" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6015do">anything but</a>
<a name="un6015ck" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6015ck">immaculately
attired</a>
<a name="un5017cm" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5017cm">interlocutor</a> as
if he had seen that nobleman somewhere or other. Being a person who could
<a name="s16003r" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16003r">give points to</a> not
a few in point of shrewd observation, he also remarked on his very dilapidated
hat and <a name="s16001n" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001n">slouchy</a>
wearing apparel generally,  testifying to a
<a name="s16002cd" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002cd">chronic
impecuniosity</a>. Probably he was one of his hangers-on but for the matter of
that it was <a name="un4036h" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4036h">merely a
question of</a> one preying on another all round, in every deep, so to put it, a
deeper depth. In any case he had a consummate amount of assurance
<br><font color="green">{u22, 575}</font>
<br> intercepting people at that hour of the night or morning.
<a name="s16004p" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16004p">Pretty thick that</a> was certainly.</p>
<p> The pair parted company and Stephen rejoined Mr Bloom,
who,<a target="foot" id="frr0044">&ordm;</a> with his
<a name="un7007bm" href="../../ff/unbs/un7all.htm#un7007bm">practised</a> eye,
was <a name="s15005p" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15005p">not without</a>
perceiving that he had succumbed to the blandiloquence of the other
<a name="un4030do" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030do">parasite</a>.
Alluding to the encounter he said, laughing, Stephen,
<a name="s16016o" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16016o">that is</a>:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He&apos;s down on his luck. He asked me to ask you to ask
somebody named Boylan, a billsticker, to give him a job as a sandwichman.</p>
<p> At this intelligence Mr Bloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a
second or so in the direction of Burgh Quay, whereupon he observed
<a name="s16013u" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16013u">evasively</a>:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="s16017ab" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16017ab">Everybody gets</a>
<a name="s16017ab" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16017ab">a certain</a>
<a name="s16017ab" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16017ab">ration of luck</a>,
they say. <a name="s16001aq" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001aq">Now you
mention it</a> his face was familiar to me. But
<a name="s16009ag" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16009ag">leaving that for the
moment</a>, how much did you part with, he queried, if I am not too
<a name="un4031av" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031av">inquisitive</a>?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Half-a-crown, Stephen responded. I daresay he needs it to sleep somewhere.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Needs!<a target="foot" id="frr0046">&ordm;</a> Mr Bloom
<a name="s16004a" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16004a">ejaculated</a>,
<a name="un4031bf" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031bf">I guarantee</a> he
<a name="un4031be" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031be">invariably</a> does.
<a name="s16017h" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16017h">Everyone according to
his needs and everyone according to his deeds</a>. Where will you sleep
yourself? Walking to Sandycove is out of the question, and
<a name="s16010bn" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16010bn">even supposing</a>
you did, you won&apos;t get in after what occurred at Westland Row station.
Simply fag out there for nothing. I don&apos;t mean to presume to dictate to you
in the slightest degree but why did you leave your father&apos;s house?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="s16017bm" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16017bm">To seek misfortune,</a> Stephen replied. </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I met
<a name="s16017bl" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16017bl">your respected
father</a> <a name="s16002bp" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002bp">on a
recent occasion</a>, Mr Bloom remarked,
today<a target="foot" id="frr0048">&ordm;</a>, in fact, or,
<a name="un4037cl" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4037cl">to be strictly
accurate</a>, <a name="un4031bc" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031bc">on
yesterday</a>. <a name="s16017bl" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16017bl">Where
does he live at present?</a> I gathered in the course of conversation that he had moved.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="s16017bl" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16017bl">I believe he is in
Dublin somewhere</a>, Stephen answered unconcernedly. Why?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A gifted man, Mr Bloom said of
<a name="s16013aq" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16013aq">Mr Dedalus
senior</a>, in more respects than one. He takes great pride, quite legitimately,
out of you. You could go back, perhaps, he hazarded, still thinking of the very
unpleasant scene at Westland Row terminus when it
<br><font color="green">{u22, 576}</font>
<br> was perfectly evident that the other two, Mulligan, that is, and that
English tourist friend of his were patently trying, as if the whole station
belonged<a target="foot" id="frr0049">&ordm;</a> to them, to give Stephen the
slip in the confusion.<a target="foot" id="frr0050">&ordm;</a></p>
<p> There was no response
<a name="s16001bt" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001bt">forthcoming</a> to
the suggestion, however, such as it was, Stephen&apos;s mind&apos;s eye being
too busily engaged in repicturing his family hearth the last time he saw it,
with <a name="s16017aa" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16017aa">his sister
Dilly sitting by the ingle, her hair hanging down, waiting for some weak
Trinidad shell cocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she
and he could drink it with the oatmeal water for milk after the Friday herrings
they had eaten at two a penny, with an egg apiece for Maggie Boody and Katey,
the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells and charred
fish heads and bones on a square of brown
paper</a>,<a target="foot" id="frr0051">&ordm;</a> in accordance with the third
precept of the church to fast and abstain on the days commanded, it being quarter tense or, if not, ember days.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; No, Mr Bloom repeated again, I wouldn&apos;t personally
<a name="s16004ai" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16004ai">repose</a> much
trust in that
<a name="un6015ah" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6015ah">boon</a> companion
of yours who contributes the
<a name="s16002bl" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002bl">humorous
element</a>, Dr Mulligan, as a
<a name="un4031cw" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031cw">guide, philosopher,
and friend</a>, if I were you. He knows which side his bread is buttered on
though<a target="foot" id="frr0052">&ordm;</a> in all probability
<a name="un4031bv" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031bv">he never realised
what it is to be without</a> regular meals. Of course you didn&apos;t notice as
much as I did, but
<a name="un4030ap" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030ap">it wouldn&apos;t
occasion me the least surprise to learn</a> that
<a name="s15024ap" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15024ap">a pinch of
tobacco</a>  or <a name="un4030ap" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030ap">some
narcotic was put in your drink</a> for some
<a name="un4030au" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030au">ulterior object</a>.</p>
<p> He understood, however, from all he heard, that Dr Mulligan was a
<a name="s16015e" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16015e">versatile</a>
<a name="s16023o" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16023o">allround man</a> who
was <a name="un4031bk" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031bk">rapidly coming
to the fore</a> in his line and, if
<a name="un6015cr" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6015cr">report was
verified</a>, bade fair to enjoy a
<a name="un6015r" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6015r">flourishing
practice</a> in the not too distant future in addition to which
<a name="s16010aj" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16010aj">professional
status</a> his rescue of that man from certain drowning at Skerries, or Malahide
was it?,<a target="foot" id="frr0053">&ordm;</a> was,
<a name="un4031t" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031t">he was bound to
admit</a>, an exceedingly
<a name="un4030bq" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030bq">plucky deed</a>, so
that he was utterly at a loss to fathom
<a name="s16002r" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002r">what earthly
reason</a> could be at the back of it except he put it down to jealousy.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Except he is what they call picking your
<a name="un4031h" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031h">brains</a>, he ventured to say.</p>
<p> The glance of half solicitude, half curiosity,
<a name="s16006n" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16006n">augmented</a> by
friendliness which he gave at Stephen&apos;s at present morose expression of features
<br><font color="green">{u22, 577}</font>
<br> did not throw a flood of light, none at all in fact, on the problem as to
whether he had let himself be badly taken in, to judge by
<a name="s16009as" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16009as">two or three</a>
<a name="s16009as" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16009as">remarks he let
drop</a>, or, on the other hand, saw through the affair, and,
<a name="s16002k" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002k">for some reason or
other best known to himself</a>, allowed matters to more or less. Grinding
poverty did have that effect, and he more than
<a name="un7007cj" href="../../ff/unbs/un7all.htm#un7007cj">conjectured</a>
that, highly educated though he was, he experienced no little difficulty in making both ends meet.</p>
<p> Adjacent to the men&apos;s public urinal
they<a target="foot" id="frr0055">&ordm;</a> perceived an icecream car round
which a group of presumably Italians were getting rid of voluble expressions in
their language in a particularly animated way.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Puttana madonna, che ci dia i quattrini! Ho ragione? Culo rotto!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Intendiamoci. Mezzo sovrano pi&ugrave;&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Dice lui per&ograve;!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Farabutto! Mortacci sui!</p>
<p> Mr Bloom and Stephen entered the cabman&apos;s shelter, an unpretentious
 <a name="s16005r" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16005r">wooden structure</a>,
where, <a name="s16002q" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002q">prior to
then</a>, he had
<a name="s16010af" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16010af">rarely, if ever,</a>
been before; the former having previously whispered to
<a name="s15053ae" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15053ae">the latter</a> a few
hints <a name="un4030dk" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030dk">anent</a> the
keeper of it, said to be the once famous
<a name="s16017al" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16017al">Skin-the-Goat</a>,
Fitzharris, the invincible, though he
wouldn&apos;t<a target="foot" id="frr0059">&ordm;</a> vouch for the actual
facts, which<a target="foot" id="frr0060">&ordm;</a> quite possibly there was
<a name="s16010ap" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16010ap">not one vestige of
truth</a> in. They took their seats in a discreet corner,
only<a target="foot" id="frr0061">&ordm;</a> to be greeted by stares from the
decidedly miscellaneous collection of waifs and strays already there engaged in
eating and drinking, diversified by conversation for whom they
<a name="s16003aj" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16003aj">seemingly</a> formed
<a name="s16003p" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16003p">an object of</a>
<a name="s16003p" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16003p">curiosity</a>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Now
<a name="s16010bj" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16010bj">touching a cup of
coffee</a>, Mr Bloom suggested, and something
<a name="s16001k" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001k">in the shape of solid food</a>, say a roll of some sort.</p>
<p> He ordered these commodities quietly. The jarvies or stevedores, or whatever
they were, turned their eyes,
<a name="s16004d" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16004d">apparently</a>
dissatisfied, away, though one redbearded
<a name="s16002bh" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002bh">bibulous</a>
individual, a sailor, probably, still stared for some appreciable time before
<a name="s16009n" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16009n">transferring his</a>
<a name="s16009n" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16009n">attention</a> to the floor.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom, availing himself of the right of free speech,
<a name="un6015cn" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6015cn">he having just a
bowing acquaintance with the language in
dispute</a>,<a target="foot" id="frr0063">&ordm;</a> though,
<a name="un6015cc" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6015cc">to be sure</a>,
rather <a name="un6015cn" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6015cn">in a quandary

<br><font color="green">{u22, 578}</font>
<br> &agrave; propos of the wrangle in the street which was still raging
<a name="un5018an" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5018an">fast and furious</a>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A beautiful language. I mean for singing purposes. Why do
you not write your

<p> Stephen, who was trying his dead best to yawn, if he could,
<a name="s16010o" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16010o">suffering
from</a><a target="foot" id="frr0068">&ordm;</a>
<a name="s16010o" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16010o">lassitude generally</a>, replied:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="s14001q" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14001q">To fill the ear of a
cow elephant.</a> They were haggling over money.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Is that so? Mr Bloom asked. Of course, he subjoined
pensively, it may be only the southern glamour that surrounds it.</p>
<p> The keeper of the shelter put a boiling swimming cup of a
<a name="s16009bc" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16009bc">concoction</a>
labelled coffee on the table and a rather antediluvian specimen of a bun, or so
it seemed, after which he retreated to his
counter,<a target="foot" id="frr0069">&ordm;</a> Mr Bloom determining to have a
good square look at him later on so as not to appear to, for which reason he
encouraged Stephen to proceed with his eyes while surreptitiously pushing the
cup of what was supposed to be called coffee gradually nearer him.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Sounds are impostures, Stephen
said<a target="foot" id="frr0070">&ordm;</a>. Like
<a name="s12002e" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12002e">names.</a><a target="foot" id="frr0071">&ordm;</a>
<a name="s12002e" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12002e">Cicero, Podmore.

Doyle</a>.<a target="foot" id="frr0073">&ordm;</a> Shakespeares were as common as Murphies. What&apos;s in a name?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Of course, Mr Bloom thoroughly agreed. Of course. Our name
was changed too, he added, pushing the socalled roll across.</p>
<p> The redbearded sailor, who had his eye on the newcomers, boarded Stephen squarely by asking:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And what might your name be?</p>
<p> Just in the nick of time Mr Bloom touched his companion&apos;s boot but
Stephen, apparently disregarding the warm pressure<a target="foot" id="frr0074">&ordm;</a>, answered:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Dedalus.</p>
<p> The sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy eyes.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="s16023e" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16023e">You know Simon Dedalus?</a> he asked at length.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="s16023e" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16023e">I&apos;ve heard of him, Stephen said.</a>
<br><font color="green">{u22, 579}</font> </p>
<p> Mr Bloom was <a name="un4048g" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4048g">all
at sea</a> for a moment, seeing the others evidently listening too.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He&apos;s Irish, the
<a name="s16010bi" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16010bi">seaman</a> affirmed,
staring still in much the same way and nodding. All Irish.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; All too Irish, Stephen rejoined.</p>
<p> As for Mr Bloom he could neither make head or tail of the  business and he
was just asking himself what possible connection when the sailor, of his own
accord, turned to the other occupants of the shelter
<a name="un6015cm" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6015cm">with the remark</a>:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards
over his shoulder. The lefthand<a target="foot" id="frr0075">&ordm;</a> dead shot.</p>
<p> <a name="s16021ae" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16021ae">Though he was
slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his gestures being also
clumsy</a> <a name="s16004f" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16004f">as it
was</a>, still he did his best to explain.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Bottles<a target="foot" id="frr0076">&ordm;</a> out there,
say. Fifty yards measured. Eggs on the bottles. Cocks his gun over his shoulder. Aims.</p>
<p> He turned his body half round, shut up his right eye completely, then he
screwed his features up someway<a target="foot" id="frr0077">&ordm;</a> sideways
and glared out into the night with an
<a name="un4055ad" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4055ad">unprepossessing</a> eye.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="s16026h" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16026h">Pom</a>!<a target="foot" id="frr0078">&ordm;</a>
he then shouted once.</p>
<p> The entire audience waited, anticipating a still further detonation, there being a further egg.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="s16026h" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16026h">Pom</a>!<a target="foot" id="frr0079">&ordm;</a>
he shouted twice.</p>
<p> A silence
<a name="un4030ar" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030ar">ensued</a> till Mr
Bloom for agreeableness&apos; sake just asked him whether it was for a marksmanship competition.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Beg pardon, the sailor said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Long ago? Mr Bloom pursued.</p>

<p> He fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket, which seemed to be
in its way a species of repository, and pushed it along the table. The printed
matter on it stated: Choza de Indios. Beni, Bolivia.</p>
<p> All focussed their attention at a group of savage women in striped

<a name="s16012l" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16012l">by the way</a>, seen
from the side, bore a distant resemblance to Henry Campbell, the townclerk, away
from the <a name="s16004ak" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16004ak">cares of
office</a>, unwashed, of course, and in a seedy getup and
a<a target="foot" id="frr0121">&ordm;</a> strong suspicion of nosepaint.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Why, the sailor answered with a slow puzzled
utterance,<a target="foot" id="frr0122">&ordm;</a> my
son,<a target="foot" id="frr0123">&ordm;</a> Danny? He&apos;d be about eighteen
now, <a name="un4031b" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031b">way I figure it</a>.</p>
<p> He tore open his grey or unclean anyhow shirt with his two hands and
scratched away at his chest on which was to be seen
<a name="s16026ac" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16026ac">an image
tattooed</a> in blue Chinese ink, intended to represent an anchor.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There was lice in that bunk in Bridgwater, he
remarked,<a target="foot" id="frr0125">&ordm;</a>
sure<a target="foot" id="frr0126">&ordm;</a> as nuts.
<a name="s16013bv" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16013bv">I must get a wash
tomorrow or next day.</a> It&apos;s them black lads I object to. I hate those
buggers. Sucks your blood dry, they does.</p>
<p> Seeing they were all looking at his chest, he accomodatingly  dragged his
shirt more open so that, on top of the timehonoured symbol of the mariner&apos;s
hope and rest, they
<a name="un5012u" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5012u">had a full view of</a>
the figure 16 and a young man&apos;s sideface looking frowningly rather.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Tattoo, the exhibitor explained. That was done when we
were lying becalmed off Odessa in the Black Sea under Captain Dalton, the best
bloody man ever scuttled a ship. Fellow the name of Antonio done that. There he is himself, a Greek.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Did it hurt much doing it? one asked the sailor.</p>
<p> <a name="s16003k" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16003k">That worthy</a>,
however, was busily engaged in collecting round the.

<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="s16022cl" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16022cl">See here, he said,

the</a><a target="foot" id="frr0129">&ordm;</a>
<a name="s16022cl" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16022cl">same fellow, pulling

<br><font color="green">{u22, 587}</font> </p>
<p> And <a name="un4030r" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030r">in point of
fact</a> the young man named Antonio&apos;s livid face did actually look like
forced smiling and the curious effect excited the unaffected admiration of
everybody, including Skin-the-Goat,<a target="foot" id="frr0130">&ordm;</a> who this time stretched over.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="s15020af" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15020af">Ay, ay, sighed the
sailor, looking down on his manly chest. He&apos;s gone too. Ate by sharks after. Ay, ay.</a></p>
<p> He let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression of before.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Neat bit of work, one said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And what&apos;s the number for?
<a name="un6015d" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6015d">loafer number two</a> said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Eaten alive? a third.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ay, ay, sighed again the sailor, more cheerily this time,
with some sort of a half smile, for a
<a name="un5012v" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5012v">brief duration</a>
only, in the direction of the questioner about the number. A Greek he was. And
then he added, with rather gallowsbird humour, considering his alleged end. As
bad as old Antonio for he left me on my ownio.</p>
<p> The face of <a name="s16019d" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16019d">a

moment,
<a name="s16011ae" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16011ae">flustered,</a> but
outwardly calm, and,<a target="foot" id="frr0137">&ordm;</a> picking up from the
table the pink sheet of the Abbey street organ which the jarvey, if such he was,
had laid aside, he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though why
pink? His reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round the door the
same face he had caught a
<a name="un5012aa" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5012aa">fleeting glimpse</a>
of that afternoon on Ormond Quay, the

idiotic</a>
<a name="s16004l" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16004l">female</a>, namely, of
the lane, who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you (Mrs B.), and
<a name="s16026aw" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16026aw">begged the chance of
his washing</a>. Also why washing, which seemed rather vague than not.</p>
<p> Your washing. Still, candour compelled him to admit that
<a name="s16019g" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16019g">he had washed his
wife&apos;s undergarments</a> when soiled in Holles
street<a target="foot" id="frr0138">&ordm;</a> and women would and did too a
man&apos;s similar garments if they really loved him, that is to say. Love me,
love my dirty shirt. Still, just then he desired the female&apos;s room more
than her company so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a rude
sign to take herself off. Round the side of the
<br><font color="green">{u22, 588}</font>
<br> <i>Evening Telegraph</i> he just caught a
<a name="un5012aa" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5012aa">fleeting</a> glimpse
of her face round the side of the door with a kind of demented glassy grin
showing that she was not exactly
<a name="un7007bf" href="../../ff/unbs/un7all.htm#un7007bf">all there</a>,
viewing with evident amusement the group of gazers round Skipper Murphy&apos;s
chest and then there was no more of her.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The <a name="s15061cd" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15061cd">gunboat</a>, the keeper said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It beats me, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen, medically I am

to solicit or how any man in his sober senses, if he values his health in the
least. Unfortunate creature! Of course, I suppose some man is
<a name="un4031bs" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031bs">ultimately</a> responsible for her condition.</p>
<p> Stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders, merely remarking:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; In this country people sell much more than she ever had

buy the soul. She is a bad merchant. She buys dear and sells cheap. </p>

<p class="di">&mdash; You, as a good catholic, he subjoined, talking of body and
soul, believe in the soul. Or do you mean the intelligence, the brainpower as
such, <a name="s16002aj" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002aj">as distinct
from</a> any outside object, the table, let us say, that cup? I believe in that
myself because <a name="un4030an" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030an">it
has been explained</a> by
<a name="un7007am" href="../../ff/unbs/un7all.htm#un7007am">competent</a> men as
the convolutions of the brain. Otherwise we would never have such inventions as X rays, for instance. Do you?</p>
<p> Thus cornered, Stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory
<a name="s16002av" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002av">to try to
concentrate</a> and remember before he could say:<a target="foot" id="frr0140">&ordm;</a></p>

<br><font color="green">{u22, 589}</font> </p>
<p> Mr Bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the
mystical finesse involved was a bit <a name="s16016p" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16016p">beyond him</a>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Simple, he demurred. I shouldn&apos;t think that is the
proper word. Of course, I grant you, to concede a point, you do knock across a
simple soul once in a while. But what I am anxious to arrive at is it is one
thing for instance to invent those rays
R&ouml;ntgen<a target="foot" id="frr0141">&ordm;</a> did, or the telescope like
Edison, though I believe it was before his time, Galileo was the man I mean. The
<a name="s16002ac" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002ac">same applies to</a>
the laws, for example, of a
<a name="s16003af" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16003af">far-reaching</a>
natural phenomenon such as electricity but it&apos;s a horse of quite another
colour to say you believe in the
<a name="s15009ap" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15009ap">existence of a supernatural God. </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O that, Stephen expostulated, has been proved conclusively
by several of the bestknown</a><a target="foot" id="frr0142">&ordm;</a>
<a name="s15009ap" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15009ap">passages in Holy

<p> On this knotty point, however, the views of the pair,
<a name="s16007as" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16007as">poles apart</a> as
they were, both in
<a name="s16011m" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16011m">schooling</a> and
everything else, with the

<a name="un4030cj" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030cj">I beg to differ</a>
with you there. <a name="un6015an" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6015an">It

It&apos;s like one of our skipper&apos;s bricks disguised. Still,

something approaching acrimony on the

its temperance (and lucrative) work. To be sure it did a world of good,

<br> a very modest remuneration indeed for her pianoplaying. The idea, he was
strongly inclined to believe, was to

Anyhow,  inspection, medical inspection, of all eatables, seemed to him more than ever necessary.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Have a shot at it now, he ventured to say of the coffee after being stirred.</p>
<p> Thus prevailed on to at any rate taste it, Stephen lifted the heavy mug from
the brown puddle &mdash; it clopped out of it when taken up &mdash; by the handle and took a sip.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Still, it&apos;s solid food, his
<a name="s16013ab" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16013ab">good genius</a>
urged, I&apos;m a
<a name="un4030aj" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030aj">stickler for</a>
solid food, his<a target="foot" id="frr0151">&ordm;</a> one and only reason

Stephen said. But oblige me by taking away that knife.
<a name="un4030ba" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030ba">I can&apos;t look at
the point of it</a>. It reminds me of Roman history.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated article, a
blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing very Roman or antique in it to the
eye, observing that the point was the least conspicuous point about it.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;

<p> Yet still, though his
<a name="un4031ai" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031ai">eyes were thick with
sleep</a> and sea air, life was full of a host of things and coincidences of a
terrible nature and it was quite within the bounds of possibility that it was
not an entire fabrication though at first blush there was not much
<a name="un5012ae" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5012ae">inherent</a>
probability in all he said being <a name="un4037cl" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4037cl">strictly accurate</a>.</p>
<p> He had been

<a name="s16025h" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16025h">taking stock of the

of no little
<a name="un6015h" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6015h">stamina</a>, if a

suggested a <a name="s16017aj" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16017aj">jail

<br> He might even have

man</a>, supposing it was
<a name="s16014s" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16014s">his own case</a> he
told, as people often did about others, namely,
<a name="s16014s" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16014s">that he killed him
himself</a> and had
<a name="un7007ah" href="../../ff/unbs/un7all.htm#un7007ah">served his four or

<a name="un6015dj" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6015dj">in durance vile</a>
to say nothing of the Antonio personage who
<a name="un7007bq" href="../../ff/unbs/un7all.htm#un7007bq">expiated his
crimes</a> in the manner described. On the other hand he might be only bluffing,
a pardonable weakness, because meeting mugs, Dublin residents, like those
jarvies waiting news from abroad, would tempt any ancient mariner to

<a name="s16013an" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16013an">Analogous scenes</a>
are occasionally, if not often, met with. Giants, though, that is

are called, sitting bowlegged. They couldn&apos;t straighten their legs if you

companion the brief outline, the sinews,
<a name="s16006f" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16006f">or whatever you like

<a name="s16012q" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16012q">that stab in the  back

<br> that are given to taking the law into their own hands and give you your

they carry in the abdomen. It comes from the great heat, climate generally. My

<p class="di">&mdash; The temperaments at the door,
<a name="s16014an" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16014an">Stephen interposed
with</a>, were very
<a name="s16027l" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16027l">passionate</a> about
five shillings. Roberto ruba roba sua.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Quite so, Mr Bloom <a name="un7007av" href="../../ff/unbs/un7all.htm#un7007av">dittoed</a>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Then, Stephen said, staring and rambling on to himself or
some unknown listener somewhere, we have the

<a name="s16024a" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16024a">of Dante and</a> the

<a name="s16024a" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16024a">Leonardo and san Tommaso Mastino.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It&apos;s in the blood, Mr Bloom acceded at once.</a> All
are washed in the blood of the sun. Coincidence, I just happened to be in the
Kildare Street Museum today, shortly prior to our meeting, if I can so call it,
and I was just looking at those antique statues there. The splendid proportions
of hips, bosom. You simply don&apos;t knock against those kind of women here. An
exception here and there. Handsome, yes, pretty in a way you find, but I&apos;m
talking about the female form. Besides, they have so little taste in dress, most
of them.  <a name="s16026ah" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16026ah">Rumpled
stockings &mdash; it may be, possibly is, a foible of mine, but still it&apos;s a thing I simply hate to see.</a></p>
<p> <a name="un5012aq" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5012aq">Interest,
however, was beginning to flag</a> somewhat all round and the others got on to
talking about accidents at sea, ships lost in a fog, collisions with icebergs,
<a name="s16014ba" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16014ba">all that sort of
thing</a>. The sailor, of course,
<a name="s16013e" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16013e">had his own say</a> to
say. <a name="s16022bi" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16022bi">He had doubled
the Cape a few odd times and weathered a monsoon</a>, a kind of wind, in the

Something evidently riled them in his death. Either he

<a name="s16002cb" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16002cb">without a
moment&apos;s hesitation</a>, <a name="s16026ao" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16026ao">saying straight off:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; To sweep the floor in the morning.</a></p>
<p> So saying <a name="s16022v" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16022v">he

<a name="s16022v" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16022v">to get on his
companion&apos;s right</a>, a habit of his,
<a name="un4030dh" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030dh">by the bye. The
night air was certainly now a treat to breathe though Stephen was a bit weak on his pins.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It will (the air) do you good, Bloom said, meaning also
the walk, in a moment. The only thing is to walk. It&apos;s not far. Lean on me.</p>
<p> Accordingly <a name="s16026bu" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16026bu">he
passed his left arm in Stephen&apos;s right</a> and
<a name="s15013cb" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15013cb">led him on accordingly</a>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, Stephen said uncertainly, because he thought
<a name="s16027j" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16027j">he felt a strange kind
of flesh</a> <a name="s16027j" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16027j">approach
him, sinewless and wobbly and all that</a>. Anyhow, they passed the sentrybox
with stones, brazier, etc<a target="foot" id="frr0340">&ordm;</a> where the
<a name="s16006ai" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16006ai">municipal
supernumerary</a>, ex Gumley<a target="foot" id="frr0341">&ordm;</a>, was still
to all intents and purposes wrapped
<a name="un4003h" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4003h">in the arms of
Murphy</a>, as the
<a name="un6015j" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6015j">adage</a> has it,
dreaming of fresh fields and pastures new. And apropos of coffin of stones, the
analogy was not bad, as it was in fact a stoning to death on the part of
seventytwo out of
<a name="s16015a" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16015a">eighty odd</a>
constituencies that ratted at the time of the split and chiefly the belauded
peasant class, probably the selfsame evicted tenants he had put in their holdings.</p>
<p> So they passed on to chatting about music, a form of art for which Bloom, as
a pure <a name="un7007df" href="../../ff/unbs/un7all.htm#un7007df">amateur</a>,
possessed the greatest love, as they made tracks arm-in-arm across Beresford
Place. Wagnerian music, though
<a name="un4031el" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031el">confessedly</a>
grand in its way, was a bit too heavy for Bloom but the music of
<a name="s16022t" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16022t">Mercadante&apos;s
<i>Huguenots</i></a>,
<a name="s16022u" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16022u">Meyerbeer&apos;s
<i>Seven Last Words on the Cross</i></a>, and Mozart&apos;s <i>Twelfth
Mass</i><a target="foot" id="frr0343">&ordm;</a>, the <i>Gloria</i> in that
being to his mind the acme of
<a name="un7007bl" href="../../ff/unbs/un7all.htm#un7007bl">first class
music</a>. He also yielded to none in his admiration of Rossini&apos;s <i>Stabat
Mater</i>, a work simply
<a name="un4031dn" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031dn">abounding in
immortal numbers</a>, in which his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy, made a hit, a
veritable sensation,

<a name="s16013ad" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16013ad">there was none to

say</a> in a <a name="un4030ec" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030ec">place
of worship</a> for music of a sacred character, there was a generally voiced
desire for an encore. On the whole, though favouring preferably light opera of
the <i>Don Giovanni</i> description, and
<i>Martha</i>,<a target="foot" id="frr0348">&ordm;</a> a gem in its line, he had
a <i>penchant</i>, though with only a
<a name="s16006af" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16006af">surface
knowledge</a>, for the severe classical school such as Mendelssohn. And talking
of that, <a name="s16001be" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001be">taking it
for granted</a> he knew all about the old favourites, he mentioned Lionel&apos;s
air in <i>Martha</i>,
<i>M&apos;appari</i>,<a target="foot" id="frr0349">&ordm;</a> which, curiously
enough, he heard, or overheard, to be more accurate,
<a name="s15065l" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15065l">on yesterday</a>, a
privilege he keenly appreciated, from the lips of Stephen&apos;s respected
father, sung to perfection, a study of the number, in fact. Stephen, in reply to
a politely put query, said he
didn&apos;t<a target="foot" id="frr0350">&ordm;</a> but launched out into
praises of Shakespeare&apos;s songs, at least of in or about that period, the
lutenist Dowland who lived in Fetter Lane near Gerard the herbalist, who <i>anno
ludendo hausi, Doulandus</i>, an instrument he was contemplating purchasing from
Mr Arnold Dolmetsch, whom Bloom did not quite recall, though the name certainly
sounded familiar, for sixtyfive guineas and Farnaby and son with their
<i>dux</i> and <i>comes</i> conceits, and
<a name="s16022g" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16022g">Byrd (William), who
played the virginals, he said, in the Queen&apos;s Chapel</a> or anywhere else
he found  them and one Tomkins who made
<a name="un4031du" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031du">toys</a> or airs,
and <a name="s16022h" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16022h">John Bull</a>.</p>
<p> On the roadway which they were approaching
<a name="un5012m" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5012m">whilst still
speaking</a> beyond the swingchains<a target="foot" id="frr0351">&ordm;</a> a
horse, dragging a
<a name="s16026af" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16026af">sweeper</a>, paced
on the <a name="s16027d" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16027d">paven
ground</a>, brushing a long swathe of mire up, so that with the noise Bloom was
not <a name="s16014aa" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16014aa">perfectly
certain</a> whether he had caught aright the allusion to sixtyfive guineas and
John Bull. He inquired if it was
<a name="s16022h" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16022h">John Bull</a> the
political celebrity of that ilk, as it struck him, the two identical names, as a striking coincidence.</p>
<p> By the chains, the horse slowly swerved to turn, which perceiving, Bloom
plucked the other&apos;s sleeve gently, jocosely remarking:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Our lives are in peril
tonight<a target="foot" id="frr0353">&ordm;</a>.
<a name="s16027n" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16027n">Beware of the steamroller.</a></p>
<p> They thereupon stopped.
<a name="s16026m" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16026m">Bloom looked at
the</a><a target="foot" id="frr0354">&ordm;</a>
<a name="s16026m" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16026m">head of a horse</a>
not worth sixtyfive guineas, suddenly in evidence in the dark quite near, so
that it seemed new, a different grouping of bones and even flesh, because
<a name="s16009g" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16009g">palpably</a> it was a
fourwalker, a hipshaker, a taildangler, a headhanger,
<a name="s16026n" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16026n">putting his hind foot
foremost</a> the while the lord of his creation
<br><font color="green">{u22, 616}</font>
<br> sat on the perch, busy with his thoughts. But such a good poor brute, he
was sorry he hadn&apos;t
<a name="s16017cd" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16017cd">a lump of sugar</a>
but, as he wisely reflected, you could scarcely be prepared for every
<a name="un4031bo" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031bo">emergency</a> that
might crop up. He was just a big nervous
foolish<a target="foot" id="frr0355">&ordm;</a> noodly kind of a horse,
<a name="s16001ch" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16001ch">without a</a>

dog, he reflected, take that mongrel in Barney Kiernan&apos;s, of the same size,
would be a holy horror to face.</a> But it was no animal&apos;s fault in
particular if he was built that way, like
<a name="s16026u" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16026u">the camel, ship of the
desert, distilling grapes into potheen in his hump</a>. Nine tenths of them all
could be caged or trained, nothing beyond the art of man barring the bees; whale

small of his back</a> and he sees the joke; chalk a circle for a rooster; tiger,
my eagle eye. These timely reflections
<a name="un4030dk" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030dk">anent</a> the brutes
occupied his mind, somewhat distracted from Stephen&apos;s words, while the ship
of the street was
<a name="s16014ah" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16014ah">manoeuvring</a><a target="foot" id="frr0356">&ordm;</a>
and Stephen went on about the highly interesting old.</p>

<a name="s16027l" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16027l">passionately</a> attached to music of any kind.</p>
<p> He looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of Stephen, image
of his mother, which was not quite the same as the usual

<p> Still, supposing he had his father&apos;s gift, as he more than suspected,
it <a name="un4031bl" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031bl">opened up new
vistas</a> in his mind, such as

<br> other in the least as he could, being
<a name="un4030g" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030g">his own master</a>,
practise literature in his spare moments when desirous
<a name="s16003ah" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16003ah">of so doing</a>
<a name="un7007dc" href="../../ff/unbs/un7all.htm#un7007dc">without its clashing
with</a> his vocal career. In fact, he had the
<a name="un4031ce" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031ce">ball at his feet</a>. </p>
<p> The horse was just then, and later on, at a propitious opportunity he
purposed (Bloom did), without anyway
<a name="s16007c" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16007c">prying into</a> his
private affairs,<a target="foot" id="frr0370">&ordm;</a> advising him to
<a name="s16007aj" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16007aj">sever his connection
with</a> a certain budding
<a name="s16006ap" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16006ap">practitioner</a>,
who, he noticed, was prone to
<a name="s16006be" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16006be">disparage</a>, and
even, to a slight extent, with some
<a name="s16006i" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16006i">hilarious</a> pretext,
when not present,
<a name="s16006bf" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16006bf">deprecate him</a>,
<a name="s16006f" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16006f">or whatever you like
to call it</a>; which, in Bloom&apos;s humble opinion,
<a name="s16006d" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16006d">threw a nasty
sidelight</a> on that side of a person&apos;s character &mdash;
<a name="un4030ci" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030ci">no pun intended</a>.</p>
<p> <a name="s16021b" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16021b">The horse, having
reached the end of his tether, so to speak, halted, and, rearing high a proud
feathering tail,</a>
<a name="un4030dw" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4030dw">added his quota</a>
by <a name="s16021b" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16021b">letting fall on the
floor, which the brush would soon brush up and polish, three smoking globes of
turds</a>. Slowly, three times, one after another, from a full
<a name="s16027aa" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16027aa">crupper</a>, he
<a name="s16027e" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16027e">mired. And humanely
his driver waited till he (or she) had ended, patient</a> in his
<a name="s16026af" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16026af">scythed car</a>.</p>
<p> Side by side Bloom, profiting by the contretemps, with Stephen passed
through the gap of the chains, divided by the upright, and, stepping over a
strand of mire, went across towards Gardiner
street<a target="foot" id="frr0371">&ordm;</a> lower, Stephen singing more
boldly, but not loudly, the end of the ballad:</p>
<p class="set"><i>Und alle Schiffe br&uuml;cken</i>.</p>
<p> The driver <a name="s16003ai" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16003ai">never
said a word</a>. He merely
<a name="s16026an" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16026an">watched the two
figures,</a> both black &mdash; one full, one lean &mdash;
<a name="s16026an" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16026an">walk towards the
railway bridge</a>.
<a name="s16026ai" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16026ai">As they walked</a>,
<a name="s16021d" href="../../ff/unbs/s16all.htm#s16021d">they at times stopped
and walked again</a>, continuing their

t&ecirc;te</i></a><a target="foot" id="frr0373">&ordm;</a> (which of course he
was well out of), about sirens, enemies of man&apos;s reason, and a number of
other topics of the same category, usurpers, historical cases of the kind.</p>  </main>
