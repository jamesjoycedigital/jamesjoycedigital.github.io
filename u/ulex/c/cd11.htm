<p> Ineluctable modality of the visible: at least that if no more, thought

their splayed feet sinking in the silted sand. Like me, like Algy, coming down
to our mighty mother. Number one swung lourdily her midwife&apos;s bag, the
other&apos;s gamp poked in the beach. From the liberties, out for the day. Mrs
Florence MacCabe, relict of the late Patk MacCabe, deeply lamented, of Bride
Street. One of her sisterhood lugged me squealing into life. Creation from
nothing. What has she in the bag? A misbirth with a trailing navelcord, hushed
in ruddy wool. The cords of all link back, strandentwining cable of all flesh.
That is why mystic monks. Will you be as gods? Gaze in your omphalos.

my voice and my eyes and a ghostwoman with ashes on her breath. They clasped and

may not will me away or ever. A <i>lex eterna</i> stays about Him. Is that then

Dringdring! And two streets off another locking it into a pyx. Dringadring! And

<p> Cousin Stephen, you will never be a saint. Isle of saints. You were awfully

<p> A point, live dog, grew into sight running across the sweep of sand. Lord,

or their slave. I have my stick. Sit tight. From farther away, walking shoreward
across from the crested tide, figures, two. The two maries. They have tucked it

<p> Galleys of the Lochlanns ran here to beach, in quest of prey, their
bloodbeaked prows riding low on a molten pewter surf. Dane vikings, torcs of
tomahawks aglitter on their breasts when Malachi wore the collar of gold. A
school of turlehide whales stranded in hot noon, spouting, hobbling in the
shallows. Then from the starving cagework city a horde of jerkined dwarfs, my
people, with flayers&apos; knives, running, scaling, hacking in green blubbery
whalemeat. Famine, plague and slaughters. Their blood is in me, their lusts my
waves. I moved among them on the frozen Liffey, that I, a changeling, among the
spluttering resin fires. I spoke to no-one: none to me.</p>
<p> The dog&apos;s bark ran towards him, stopped, ran back. Dog of my enemy. I
just simply stood pale, silent, bayed about. <i>Terribilia meditans</i>. A

<p> Their dog ambled about a bank of dwindling sand, trotting, sniffing on all
sides. Looking for something lost in a past life. Suddenly he made off like a
bounding hare, ears flung back, chasing the shadow of a lowskimming gull. The
man&apos;s shrieked whistle struck his limp ears. He turned, bounded back, came
nearer, trotted on twinkling shanks. On a field tenney a buck, trippant, proper,
unattired. At the lacefringe of the tide he halted with stiff forehoofs,
seawardpointed ears. His snout lifted barked at the wavenoise, herds of
seamorse. They serpented towards his feet, curling, unfurling many crests, every
ninth, breaking, plashing, from far, from farther out, waves and waves.</p>

and, lifting them again, waded out. The dog yelped running to them, reared up
and pawed them, dropping on all fours, again reared up at them with mute bearish
fawning. Unheeded he kept by them as they came towards the drier sand, a rag of
wolf&apos;s tongue redpanting from his jaws. His speckled body ambled ahead of
them and then loped off at a calf&apos;s gallop. The

<p> The cry brought him skulking back to his master and a blunt bootless kick
sent him unscathed across a spit of sand, crouched in flight. He slunk back in a
curve. Doesn&apos;t see me. Along by the edge of the mole he lolloped, dawdled,
smelt a rock and from under a cocked hindleg pissed against it. He trotted
forward and, lifting his hindleg, pissed quick short at an unsmelt rock. The
simple pleasures of the poor. His hindpaws then scattered

sand: then his forepaws dabbled and delved. Something he buried there, his
grandmother. He rooted in the sand, dabbling, delving and stopped to listen to
the air, scraped up the sand again with a fury of his claws, soon ceasing, a
pard, a panther, got in spousebreach, vulturing the dead.</p>

reluctant arms, hising up their petticoats, in whispering water swaying and
upturning coy silver fronds. Day by day: night by night: lifted, flooded and let
fall. Lord, they are weary: and, whispered to, they sigh. Saint Ambrose heard
it, sigh of leaves and waves, waiting, awaiting the fullness of their times,
<i>diebus ac noctibus iniurias patiens ingemiscit</i>. To no end gathered:
vainly then released,

wending back: loom of the moon. Weary too in sight of lovers, lascivious men, a
naked woman shining in her courts, she draws a toil of waters.</p>
<p> Five fathoms out there. Full fathom five thy father lies. At one he said.
Found drowned. High water at Dublin bar. Driving before it a loose drift of
rubble, fanshoals of fishes, silly shells. A corpse rising saltwhite from the
undertow, bobbing landward, a pace a pace a porpoise. There he is. Hook it
quick. Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor.

We have him. Easy now.</p>
<p> Bag of corpsegas sopping in foul brine. A quiver of minnows, fat of a spongy
titbit, flash through the slits of his buttoned trouserfly. God becomes man
becomes fish becomes barnacle goose becomes featherbed mountain. Dead breaths I
living breathe, tread dead dust, devour a urinous offal from all dead. Hauled
stark over the gunwale he breathes upward the stench of his green grave, his leprous nosehole snoring to the sun.</p>
<p> A seachange this, brown eyes saltblue. Seadeath, mildest of all deaths

<br> known to man. Old Father Ocean. <i>Prix de Paris</i>: beware of imitations.
Just you give it a fair trial. We enjoyed ourselves immensely.</p>
<p> Come. I thirst. Clouding over. No black clouds anywhere, are there?
Thunderstorm. Allbright he falls, proud lightning of the intellect, <i>Lucifer,
dico, qui nescit occasum</i>. No. My cockle hat and staff and hismy sandal
shoon. Where? To evening lands. Evening will find itself.</p>
<p> He took the hilt of his ashplant, lunging with it softly, dallying still.
Yes, evening will find itself in me, without me. All days make their end. By the
way next when is

Tuesday will be the longest day. Of all the glad new year, mother, the rum tum
tiddledy tum. Lawn Tennyson, gentleman poet. <i>Gi&agrave;</i>. For the old hag
with the yellow teeth. And Monsieur Drumont, gentleman journalist.
<i>Gi&agrave;</i>. My teeth are very bad. Why, I wonder? Feel. That one is going
too. Shells. Ought I go to a dentist, I wonder, with that money? That one.

Kinch, the superman. Why is that, I wonder, or does it mean something perhaps?</p>
<p> My handkerchief. He threw it. I remember. Did I not take it up?</p>
<p> His hand groped vainly in his pockets. No, I didn&apos;t. Better buy one.</p>
<p> He laid the dry snot picked from his nostril on a ledge of rock, carefully. For the rest let look who will.</p>
<p> Behind. Perhaps there is someone.</p>
<p> He turned his face over a shoulder, rere regardant. Moving through the air
high spars of a threemaster, her sails brailed up on the crosstrees, homing,
upstream, silently moving, a silent ship.</p>  </main>
