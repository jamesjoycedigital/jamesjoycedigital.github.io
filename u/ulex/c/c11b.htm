<p> They came down the steps from Leahy&apos;s terrace prudently. Frauenzimmer.
And flabbily down the shelving shore, their splayed feet sinking in the silted
sand. Like me, like Algy coming down to the mighty mother. One carried her
midwife&apos;s bag, the other a gamp with which she poked and turned over shells
of the beach. <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">What has

<p> Cousin Stephen, you will never be a saint. Isle of saints. You were awfully

<p> The fine sand had gone from under his feet. His boots trod razorsilt, stuck
empty shells, unnumbered pebbles, that on the unnumbered pebbles beats,
waterrusted wood. Cakey damp sandflats waited to suck his treading boots,
breathing upward sewage breath. He coasted them walking warily. On his left a
bottle stood up pitted to its waist in the cakey damp sand. A sentinel. Isle of dreadful
<br><font color="green">{ms, 7}</font>
<br> thirst. Broken hoops farther; and beyond a dark maze of dark cunning nets:
Ringsend: houses of brown sailors and master mariners. Human shells.</p>
<p> He halted. I have passed the way to aunt Dora&apos;s. Am I not going there?
Seems not. No-one about the strand. He turned and crossed the firmer sand towards the Pigeon House.</p>

<p> Patrice, home on furlough, lapped warm milk with me in the bar Minerva. Son

<p> His feet marched in sudden gay rhythm over the sand along by the boulders of
the South Wall. Gold light on the sea, the sand, the boulders. Sewage of my
brain behind me. The sun is there, the slender trees, the lemon houses.</p>
<p> Paris rawly waking, crude sunlight on her lemon streets. Moist pith of farls
of bread, froggreen wormwood, her matin incense court the air. Belluomo rises
from the bed of his wife&apos;s lover&apos;s wife: the kerchiefed housewife is
astir, a saucer of acetic acid in her hand. In Polidor&apos;s Yvonne and
Madeleine, belated, newmake their tumbled beauties, shattering
<br><font color="green">{ms, 9}</font>
<br> with gold teeth <u>chaussons</u> of pastry, their mouths yellowed with the
pus of <u>flan br&eacute;ton</u>. Faces of the Paris men go by, their
wellpleased pleasers, curled <u>conquistadores</u>.</p>
<p> Noon is near. Kevin Egan rolls gunpowder cigarettes through fingers smeared
with printer&apos;s ink, sipping his green fairy as Patrice his white. About us
the hungry fork spiced beans down their
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">throats</span></span> gullets.
<u>Un demi s&eacute;tier</u>. A jet of coffee steam from the burnished cauldron
and around the marble slabbed tables the tangle of wined breaths and grumbling
gorges. His breath hangs over our saucestained plates, the green fairy&apos;s
fang thrusting between his
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">scandalous</span></span> lips.
Ireland, the city of the Dalcassians, hopes, conspiracies. His fustian shirt,
sanguineflowered, trembles its neck tassels at his secrets. Maud Gonne,
Millevoye, F&eacute;lix Faure, licentious men, the fr&ouml;ken who washed and
rubbed his naked body in the bath at Upsala, most licentious custom, bath a most
private thing. I wouldn&apos;t let my brother, not even my own brother, most
lascivious thing. Green eyes, I see you! Fang, I feel. Lascivious thing. The
blue fuse burns deadly between his hands and burns clear. The loose tobacco
shreds catch fire and flame and acrid smoke light our corner. Raw facebones
under his <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Span</span></span>
Spaniard&apos;s hat. Spurned lover. I was a strapping young bouchal
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">then</span></span> at that time.
I&apos;ll show you my likeness one day. Lover, for her love he prowled with
colonel Richard Burke, his
<a name="s19008f" href="../../ff/unbs/s19all.htm#s19008f">tanist</a>, under
Clerkenwell walls and, crouching, saw a flame of vengeance hurl them upwards in
the fog. Shattered glass and toppling masonry. In Paris&apos; multitude
<br><font color="green">{ms, 10}</font>
<br> <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">now</span></span> he hides,
unsought by any save by me. Making his day&apos;s stations, the dim
printingcase, his three taverns, the lair he sleeps short nights in in rue de la
Goutte d&apos;Or, damascened with old cartoons. Loveless, landless, wifeless,
souless. She is all right without her castoff man, madame in rue
Git-le-c&oelig;ur, canary and two lodgers. Geranium cheeks, a skirt, frisky as a
girl&apos;s. Spurned
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">lover</span></span> and
undespairing. <u>Mon fils</u>, soldier of France. I taught him <u>O, the boys of
Kilkenny are stout roaring blades</u>. Do you know that old song? Old Kilkenny.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>O, the boys of Kilkenny</u></p>
<p> They have cast him out and forgotten, not he them, Kevin Egan. Remembering thee, O Sion.</p>
<p> He had come nearer the edge of the sea and wet sand slapped his boots. The
wild air greeted him, singing on wild nerves,
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">fire in</span></span> wind of wild
air of seeds of fire. Here. I am not walking out to the Kish
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">, am I</span></span>? He stood
suddenly, his feet beginning to sink slowly in the quaking soil. Turn back.
Turning he looked southward along the shore, his feet sinking again slowly in
new sockets. The cold domed room of the tower waits. Through the barbacans
shafts of light will move ever, slowly ever as my feet are sinking, creeping
this side that side over the dial floor. Blue dusk, nightfall, deep blue night. In the darkness
<br><font color="green">{ms, 11}</font>
<br> of the dome they wait, their pushed back, my obelisk valise, round
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">an uncleared</span></span> a
table, of abandoned platters. Who would clear it? He has the key. I will not
sleep there when this night comes. A shut door of a silent tower, entombing
their blind bodies, the panthersahib and his gamebeater. Call: no answer. He
lifted his feet from the suck and turned back by the mole of boulders. Take all,
keep all: my soul walks with me. So in the moon&apos;s mid watches I walk by the
path above the rocks, hearing Elsinore&apos;s tempting flood.</p>
<p> The flood is following me. I can watch it flow past from here. Get back then
by the road again to the higher strand behind. He climbed over the
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">greasy weed</span></span> salvage
of weed and sat on a stool of rock, laying his ashplant by him.</p>
<p> The bloated carcase of a dog lay among the oily sedge. Before him the
gunwale of a boat, buried in sand. <u>Un coche ensabl&eacute;</u> Louis Veuillot
called Gautier&apos;s
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">unwieldy</span></span> prose.
These heavy sands are language that tide and wind have silted here. And these
the stoneheaps of dead builders, a warren of weasel rats. Sands and stones. Why
am I angered? A fool&apos;s wrath is heavier than them both. A live dog came
into sight across the sweep of sand. Lord, is he going to attack me? I have my
stick. Sit still. From farther away walking shoreward across from the coming
tide, figures. He is running back to them.</p>
<p> The galleys of the Danes ran here to land, in quest of prey,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 12}</font>
<br> their bloodbeaked prows riding the low waves. A school of turlehide whales
stranded in the noon, spouting, flapping in the shallows. Then from the cobbled
starving city a horde of jerkined dwarfs with flaying knives, running, scaling,
hacking the green blubbery whalemeat. Famine, plague and slaughter. Their blood
is in me, their thoughts are my waves. I was among them on the frozen Liffey,
among the hissing resin fires. I spoke to none: none to me.</p>
<p> The dog&apos;s bark ran towards him, ceased, ran back. For that are you
pining, the bark of their applause? Then live their lives, coward as they. He
saved men from drowning and you shake at the barking of a cur? But the courtiers
who mocked Guido Cavalcanti were in their own house, he meant the house
of&nbsp;&hellip;. We don&apos;t want any more of medieval abstrusiosities. Would
you do what he did? There would be a boat near or a lifebuoy. Ay, of course, put
there for you. Would you or would you not? The man that was drowned last week
off Maiden&apos;s Rock whose body they are waiting. The truth now. I would want
to. I would try. I am not a strong swimmer. Do you see the tide flowing on all
sides <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">swiftly</span></span>
sheeting the stretches of sand? If I had land under my feet. I want his life to
be still his but mine to be mine. A man. His eyes are fixed on me in horror of
death. I&nbsp;&hellip;. With him together&nbsp;&hellip;. I could not save her. Waters: bitter death: lost.</p>
<p> A man and a woman. I see her skirts. Pinned up, I bet.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 13}</font> </p>
<p> The dog ambled about a bank of dwindling sand, trotting, sniffing on all
sides. Looking for something he lost here in a past life. Suddenly he made off
like a bounding hare, ears flung back, chasing the shadow of a lowflying gull.
The man&apos;s shrieked whistle struck his limp ears. He turned, bounded back,
came nearer, trotted on twinkling legs. At the verge of the tides he halted with
stiff forehoofs, seawardpointed ears. His head lifted barked against the noise
of the waves. They came towards his feet, shaking their crests, plashing,
breaking, from farther, from far out, waves and waves.</p>
<p> The man and woman waded
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">in</span></span> a few paces into
the water and, stooping, soused their bags. Cocklepickers. They lifted their
bags from the water and waded out again. The dog yelped and, running to them,
reared up and pawed them<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">:
then</span></span>, falling on all fours, and again reared up with mute bearish
efforts. Unheeded he kept beside them as they came towards the drier sand, a rag
of red tongue lolling from a side of his wolf&apos;s jaws. His speckled body
ambled in front and then set <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">to
gallop</span></span> off forward at a calf&apos;s gallop. The carcase lay on his
path. He stopped, sniffed, stalked round it, nosing closer, went round it
sniffing rapidly like a dog <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">all</span></span> points of the dead dog.</p>
<p class="flush"></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Tatters! Here, you mongrel!</p>
<p> The cry brought him skulking back to his master and a blunt bootless kick
sent him unscathed across a spit of sand, crouched in flight. He ambled back
<br><font color="green">{ms, 14}</font>
<br> in a curve and on by the edge of the
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">moles</span></span> mole, smelt a
rock and from under a heaved hindleg pissed against it. He trotted on and,
heaving again his hindleg, pissed against an unsmelt rock;. His hindpaws then
scattered the sand: then his forepaws dabbled and delved. Something he buried
there. He scraped in the sand, dabbling, delving and stopped to listen to the
air, scraped up the sand again with a fury of his paws, soon ceasing. A
<a name="un1033c" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1033c">pard</a>, a panther,, vulturing the dead.</p>
<p class="flush"></p>
<p> With their bags they passed. His large feet slapped out of turned up
trousers the damp sand, a dull red muffler strangling his unshaven neck. With
shorter steps she followed him: the bully and his strolling mort: her spoils
slung on her back. Loose sand and shellgrit crusted her bare feet and loose her
hang trailed about her windraw face. Behind her lord a helpmeet trudging to
Romeville. When night hides her body&apos;s flaws, calling under her fringed
shawl from an archway where dogs have mired. Her fancyman is treating two
redcoats in O&apos;Loughlin&apos;s of Blackpitts. A shefiend&apos;s whiteness
under her rancid rags. Fumbally&apos;s Lane that night, the tanyard smells. My dimber wapping dell.</p>
<p class="set"><u>White thy fambles, red thy gan

<p> A side eye at my Latin Quarter hat. Walking across the sands of the world,
driven by the sun&apos;s flaming sword, to the west, to evening lands. She
trudges; schlepps, trains, drags, trascines her load. A tide westering,
moondrawn, in her wake. Moondrawn tides within her, a handmaid, winered sea,
myriadislanded. Behold the handmaid of the moon. The wet sign
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">rules her courses</span></span>
visits her. Rise up, according to the word. <u>Omnis caro ad te veniet.</u> He
comes, the pale
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">vampire</span></span>
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">bat</span></span> vampire, through
storm his eyes, his bat sails bloodying the sea, mouth to her mouth&apos;s kiss.</p>
<p> Here. Put a pin in that chap, will you? My tablets. Mouth to her kiss. No,
you must have two of em. Glue em
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">well</span></span> together: Mouth to her mouth&apos;s kiss.</p>
<p> His lips lipped and mouthed fleshless lips of air: Mouth to her

Paper. The banknotes, blast them. Old Deasy&apos;s. Here, tear the blank end
off. Turning his back to the sun he bent across far to a slab of rock and
scribbled the words. That&apos;s twice I forgot to take some slips from the library. So.</p>
<p> His shadow lay dark over the rocks as he bent, ending. Why not endless till the farthest star?
<br><font color="green">{ms, 19}</font>
<br><font color="green">{ms, 15}</font>
<br> I throw an ended shadow from me and call it
back<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span> to me.
Endless, would it be mine? Who watches me here? Who will read ever anywhere
these written words? Signs on a white field. Somewhere to someone in your nicest
voice. For the bishop of Cloyne took the veil of the temple out of his shovel hat, the flat cloth of
<br><font color="green">{ms, 16}</font>
<br> space with signs and emblems hatched on its field. Hold on. Coloured on a
flat: yes; that&apos;s right. She trusts me; the gentle hand softlashed eyes.
Where am I supposed to be bringing her beyond the veil? The ineluctable modality
of ineluctable visuality. She, she, she. Who? Tell that to someone else: ten to
one she wears those curse of God stays suspenders and brown stockings.
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Have you no</span></span> Talk
about apple dumplings. Have you no sense?</p>
<p class="flush"></p>
<p> Touch me. Hand and eyes. Touch me. I am lonely. Touch me. What is that word
that all <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the world</span></span>
men say? <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Will you not? Touch me, touch me.</span></span></p>
<p> Touch me. Soft eyes, soft soft soft hand. I am lonely here
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">alone</span></span>. O, touch me
soon or now! What is that word all others know. I will be quiet to hear alone.
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">O</span></span> sad too. Touch, O
touch me <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">now</span></span>.</p>
<p> He stretched backward at full over the sharp boulders, his hat tilted down
on his eyes, cramming the scribbled note and pencil into a pocket. Under the
leaf he watched through quivering peacock lashes the southing sun. I am caught
in this burning scene. Pan&apos;s hour, the faunal noon. Among gumheavy serpent
plants, milkoozing fruits, where leaves lie wide on water. Pain is far.</p>
<p class="set"><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">And no</span></span>
<br> <u>And no more turn aside and brood</u></p>
<p> Below his feet the water flowing sheeting greengoldenly the wastes of sand, rising,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 17}</font>
<br> flowing. My ashplant will float away. I shall wait. No they are passing on by the low rocks, swirling, passing.</p>
<p> Under the upswelling tide he saw the long weeds lift languidly and sway
reluctant arms, in whispering water sway and upturning coy fronds. Day by day,
night by night lifted, flooded and let fall. Lord, they are weary: and,
whispered to, they sigh. Saint Ambrose heard it sigh of leaves and waves,
waiting, awaiting the fullness of their times, <u>diebus ac noctibus iniurias
patiens ingemiscit</u>. To no end gathered, vainly then released, forthflowing,
wending back: loom of the moon. Weary too, naked before men, naked and unravished, she draws her toil of waters.</p>
<p> At one the boatman said. Five fathoms
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">deep</span></span> there
<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">missing</span></font>
Full fathom five thy father lies. At one, he said. High water at Dublin bar.
Driving before it a loose drift of rubble, fanshoals of fish,
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">loose</span></span> silly
shells<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span>.
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">a</span></span> A
corpse<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span> rising
saltwhite from the undertow, bobbing landward. There it is. Hook it quick. Pull. We have him. Easy now.</p>
<p> Hauled stark over the gunwale the drowned manbundle, bag of corpsegas,
sopping of foul brine. A quiver of minnows, fatfed, flashing through the slits
of his trouserfly. His leprous nosehole fronting the sun.</p>
<p> Hauled stark over the gunwale. A seachange this. Seadeath, mildest of all
deaths. Paris medal awarded: beware of imitations. Just you give it a fair
trial. We enjoyed ourselves <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">immensely</span></span> no end.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 18}</font>
<br> My pilgrim&apos;s staff waits to be picked up.. On then. Where? To evening
lands. Evening will find itself. He took the handle of his ashplant, dallying
with it still. Yes, evening will find itself; in me, without me. All days
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">end</span></span> make their end.
By the way next when will it be Tuesday will be the longest day. Of all the glad
new year, mother, <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">with

<p> He had taken a dry snot from his nostril and, holding it on the crook of his
finger, groped vainly for his handkerchief. Forgot it in the Tower. He laid the
snot carefully on a ledge of rock. For the rest let look who will.</p>
<p> Behind. Perhaps there is someone.</p>
<p> He <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">looked</span></span> turned
