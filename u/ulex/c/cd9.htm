<p> Ineluctable modality of the visible: at least that if no more, thought
through my eyes. Signatures of all things I am here to read, seaspawn and
seawrack, the nearing tide, that rusty boot. Snotgreen, bluesilver, rust:
coloured signs. Limits of the diaphane. But he adds: in bodies. Then he was
aware of them bodies before of them coloured. How? By knocking his sconce
against them, sure. Go easy. Bald he was and a millionaire, <i>maestro di color
che sanno</i>. Limit of the diaphane in. Why in? Diaphane, adiaphane. If you can
put your five fingers through it it is a gate, if not a door. Shut your eyes and see.</p>
<p> Stephen closed his eyes to hear his boots crush crackling wrack and shells.
You are walking through it howsomever. I am, a stride at a time. A very short
space of time through very short times of space. Five, six: the
<i>nacheinander</i>. Exactly: and that is the ineluctable modality of the
audible. Open your eyes. No. Jesus! If I fell over a cliff that beetles
o&apos;er his base, fell through the <i>nebeneinander</i> ineluctably. I am
getting on nicely in the dark. My ash sword hangs at my side. Tap with it: they
do. My two feet in his boots are at the ends of his legs, <i>nebeneinander</i>.
Sounds solid: made by the mallet of Los <i>demiurgos</i>. Am I walking into
eternity along Sandymount strand? Crush, crack, crick, crick. Wild sea money. Dominie Deasy kens them a&apos;.</p>
<p class="set"><i>Won&apos;t you come to Sandymount,
<br> Madeline the mare?</i></p>
<p> Rhythm begins, you see. I hear. A catalectic tetrameter of iambs marching. No, agallop: <i>deline the mare</i>.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 43}</font>
<br><font color="green">{u22, 38}</font> </p>
<p> Open your eyes now. I will. One moment. Has all vanished since? If I open
and am for ever in the black adiaphane. <i>Basta!</i> I will see if I can see.</p>
<p> See now. There all the time without you: and ever shall be, world without end.</p>
<p> They came down the steps from Leahy&apos;s terrace prudently,
<i>Frauenzimmer</i>: and down the shelving shore flabbily, their splayed feet
sinking in the silted sand. Like me, like Algy, coming down to our mighty
mother. Number one swung lourdily her midwife&apos;s bag, the other&apos;s gamp
poked in the beach. From the liberties, out for the day. Mrs Florence MacCabe,
relict of the late Patk MacCabe, deeply lamented, of Bride Street. One of her
sisterhood lugged me squealing into life. Creation from nothing. What has she in
the bag? A misbirth with a trailing navelcord, hushed in ruddy wool. The cords
of all link back, strandentwining cable of all flesh. That is why mystic monks.
Will you be as gods? Gaze in your omphalos. Hello! Kinch here. Put me on to
Edenville. Aleph, alpha: nought, nought, one.</p>
<p> Spouse and helpmate of Adam Kadmon: Heva, naked Eve. She had no navel. Gaze.
Belly without blemish, bulging big, a buckler of taut vellum, no, whiteheaped
corn, orient and immortal, standing from everlasting to everlasting. Womb of sin.</p>
<p> Wombed in sin darkness I was too, made not begotten. By them, the man with
my voice and my eyes and a ghostwoman with ashes on her breath. They clasped and
sundered, did the coupler&apos;s will. From before the ages He willed me and now
may not will me away or ever. A <i>lex eterna</i> stays about Him. Is that then
the divine substance wherein Father and Son are consubstantial? Where is poor
dear Arius to try conclusions? Warring his life long on the
contransmagnificandjewbangtantiality. Illstarred heresiarch! In a Greek
watercloset he breathed his last: euthanasia. With beaded mitre and with
crozier, stalled upon his throne, widower of a widowed see, with upstiffed omophorion, with clotted hinderparts.</p>
<p> Airs romped around him, nipping and eager airs. They are coming, waves. The
whitemaned seahorses, champing, brightwindbridled, the steeds of Mananaan.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 44}</font> </p>
<p> I mustn&apos;t forget his letter for the press. And after? The Ship, half
twelve. By the way go easy with that money like a good young imbecile. Yes, I must.</p>
<p> His pace slackened. Here. Am I going to aunt Sara&apos;s or not? My
consubstantial father&apos;s voice. Did you see anything of your artist brother
<br><font color="green">{u22, 39}</font>
<br> Stephen lately? No? Sure he&apos;s not down in Strasburg terrace with his
aunt Sally? Couldn&apos;t he fly a bit higher than that, eh? And and and and
tell us, Stephen, how is uncle Si? O, weeping God, the things I married into! De
boys up in de hayloft. The drunken little costdrawer and his brother, the cornet
player. Highly respectable gondoliers! And skeweyed Walter sirring his father,
no less. Sir. Yes, sir. No, sir. Jesus wept: and no wonder, by Christ!</p>
<p> I pull the wheezy bell of their shuttered cottage: and wait. They take me
for a dun, peer out from a coign of vantage.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It&apos;s Stephen, sir.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Let him in. Let Stephen in.</p>
<p> A bolt drawn back and Walter welcomes me.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; We thought you were someone else.</p>
<p> In his broad bed nuncle Richie, pillowed and blanketed, extends over the
hillock of his knees a sturdy forearm. Cleanchested. He has washed the upper moiety.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Morrow, nephew.</p>
<p> He lays aside the lapboard whereon he drafts his bills of costs for the eyes
of Master Goff and Master Shapland Tandy, filing consents and common searches
and a writ of <i>Duces Tecum</i>. A bogoak frame over his bald head:
Wilde&apos;s <i>Requiescat</i>. The drone of his misleading whistle brings Walter back.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, sir?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Malt for Richie and Stephen, tell mother. Where is she?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Bathing Crissie, sir.</p>
<p> Papa&apos;s little bedpal. Lump of love.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; No, uncle Richie&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Call me Richie. Damn your lithia water. It lowers. Whusky!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Uncle Richie, really&nbsp;&hellip;
<br><font color="green">{u21, 45}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Sit down or by the law Harry I&apos;ll knock you down.</p>
<p> Walter squints vainly for a chair.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He has nothing to sit down on, sir.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He has nowhere to put it, you mug. Bring in our
Chippendale chair. Would you like a bite of something? None of your damned
lawdeedaw airs here; the rich of a rasher fried with a herring? Sure? So much
the better. We have nothing in the house but backache pills.</p>
<p> <i>All&apos;erta!</i></p>
<p> He drones bars of Ferrando&apos;s <i>aria di sortita</i>. The grandest number, Stephen, in the whole opera. Listen.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 40}</font> </p>
<p> His tuneful whistle sounds again, finely shaded, with rushes of the air, his
fists bigdrumming on his padded knees.</p>
<p> This wind is sweeter.</p>
<p> Houses of decay, mine, his and all. You told the Clongowes gentry you had an
uncle a judge and an uncle a general in the army. Come out of them, Stephen.
Beauty is not there. Nor in the stagnant bay of Marsh&apos;s library where you
read the fading prophecies of Joachim Abbas. For whom? The hundredheaded rabble
of the cathedral close. A hater of his kind ran from them to the wood of
madness, his mane foaming in the moon, his eyeballs stars. Houyhnhnm,
horsenostrilled. The oval equine faces, Temple, Buck Mulligan, Foxy Campbell,
Lanternjaws. Abbas father, furious dean, what offence laid fire to their brains?
Paff! <i>Descende, calve, ut ne amplius decalveris</i>. A garland of grey hair
on his comminated head see him me clambering down to the footpace
(<i>descende</i>), clutching a monstrance, basiliskeyed. Get down, baldpoll! A
choir gives back menace and echo, assisting about the altar&apos;s horns, the
snorted Latin of jackpriests moving burly in their albs, tonsured and oiled and
gelded, fat with the fat of kidneys of wheat.</p>
<p> And at the same instant perhaps a priest round the corner is elevating it.
Dringdring! And two streets off another locking it into a pyx. Dringadring! And
in a ladychapel another taking housel all to his own cheek. Dringdring! Down,
up, forward, back. Dan Occam thought of that, invincible doctor. A misty English
morning the imp hypostasis tickled his brain. Bringing his host down and kneeling he
<br><font color="green">{u21, 46}</font>
<br> heard twine with his second bell the first bell in the transept (he is
lifting his) and, rising, heard (now I am lifting) their two bells (he is kneeling) twang in diphthong.</p>
<p> Cousin Stephen, you will never be a saint. Isle of saints. You were awfully
holy, weren&apos;t you? You prayed to the Blessed Virgin that you might not have
a red nose. You prayed to the devil in Serpentine avenue that the fubsy widow in
front might lift her clothes still more from the wet street. <i>O si, certo!</i>
Sell your soul for that, do, dyed rags pinned round a squaw. More tell me, more
still! On the top of the Howth tram alone crying to the rain: <i>naked women! naked women!</i> What about that, eh?</p>
<p> What about what? What else were they invented for?</p>
<p> Reading two pages apiece of seven books every night, eh? I was young. You
bowed to yourself in the mirror, stepping forward to applause earnestly,
striking face. Hurray for the Goddamned idiot! Hray! No-one saw: tell no-one.
Books you were going to write with letters for titles. Have you read his
<br><font color="green">{u22, 41}</font>
<br> F? O yes, but I prefer Q. Yes, but W is wonderful. O yes, W. Remember your
epiphanies on green oval leaves, deeply deep, copies to be sent if you died to
all the great libraries of the world, including Alexandria? Someone was to read
them there after a few thousand years, a mahamanvantara. Pico della Mirandola
like. Ay, very like a whale. When one reads these strange pages of one long gone
one feels that one is at one with one who once&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> The grainy sand had gone from under his feet. His boots trod again a damp
crackling mast, razorshells, squeaking pebbles, that on the unnumbered pebbles
beats, wood sieved by the shipworm, lost Armada. Unwholesome sandflats waited to
suck his treading soles, breathing upward sewage breath. He coasted them,
walking warily. A porterbottle stood up, stogged to its waist, in the cakey sand
dough. A sentinel: isle of dreadful thirst. Broken hoops on the shore; at the
land a maze of dark cunning nets; farther away chalkscrawled backdoors and on
the higher beach a dryingline with two crucified shirts. Ringsend: wigwams of
brown steersmen and master mariners. Human shells.</p>
<p> He halted. I have passed the way to aunt Sara&apos;s. Am I not going
<br><font color="green">{u21, 47}</font>
<br> there? Seems not. No-one about. He turned northeast and crossed the firmer sand towards the Pigeonhouse.</p>

<p> His feet marched in sudden proud rhythm over the sand furrows, along by the
boulders of the south wall. He stared at them proudly, piled stone mammoth
skulls. Gold light on sea, on sand, on boulders. The sun is there, the slender trees, the lemon houses.</p>
<p> Paris rawly waking, crude sunlight on her lemon streets. Moist pith of farls
of bread, the froggreen wormwood, her matin incense, court the air. Belluomo
rises from the bed of his wife&apos;s lover&apos;s wife, the kerchiefed
housewife is astir, a saucer of acetic acid in her hand. In Rodot&apos;s Yvonne

<p> Noon slumbers. Kevin Egan rolls gunpowder cigarettes through fingers smeared
with printer&apos;s ink, sipping his green fairy as Patrice his white. About us
gobblers fork spiced beans down their gullets. <i>Un demi s&eacute;tier!</i> A
jet of coffee steam from the burnished caldron. She serves me at his beck. <i>Il
est irlandais. Hollandais? Non fromage. Deux irlandais, nous, Irlande, vous
savez? Ah, oui!</i> She thought you wanted a cheese <i>hollandais</i>. Your

<br><font color="green">{u21, 49}</font>
<br> tables the tangle of wined breaths and grumbling gorges. His breath hangs
over our saucestained plates, the green fairy&apos;s fang thrusting between his
lips. Of Ireland, the Dalcassians, of hopes, conspiracies, of Arthur Griffith
now. To yoke me as his yokefellow, our crimes our common cause. You&apos;re your
father&apos;s son. I know the voice. His fustian shirt, sanguineflowered,
trembles its Spanish tassels at his secrets. M. Drumont, famous journalist,
Drumont, know what he called queen Victoria? Old hag with the yellow teeth.
<i>Vieille ogresse</i> with the <i>dents jaunes</i>. Maud Gonne, beautiful

most lascivious thing. Green eyes, I see you. Fang, I feel. Lascivious people.</p>
<p> The blue fuse burns deadly between hands and burns clear. Loose tobacco
shreds catch fire: a flame and acrid smoke light our corner. Raw facebones under
his peep of day boy&apos;s hat. How the head centre got away, authentic version.

prowled with colonel Richard Burke, tanist of his sept, under the walls of
Clerkenwell and, crouching, saw a flame of vengeance hurl them upward in the
fog. Shattered glass and toppling masonry. In gay Paree he hides, Egan of Paris,
unsought by any save by me. Making his day&apos;s stations, the dingy
printingcase, his three taverns, the Montmartre lair he sleeps short night in,
rue de la Goutte-d&apos;Or, damascened with flyblown faces of the gone.
Loveless, landless, wifeless. She is quite nicey comfy without her outcast man, madame in rue G&icirc;t-le-C&oelig;ur,

<i>Mon fils</i>, soldier of France. I taught him to sing <i>The boys of Kilkenny

Kilkenny: saint Canice, Strongbow&apos;s castle on the Nore. Goes like this.
<i>O, O</i>. He takes me, Napper Tandy, by the hand.</p>
<p class="set"><i>O, O the boys of</i>

<p> Weak wasting hand on mine. They have forgotten Kevin Egan, not he them. Remembering thee, O Sion.</p>
<p> He had come nearer the edge of the sea and wet sand slapped his boots. The
new air greeted him, harping in wild nerves, wind of wild air of seeds of
brightness. Here, I am not walking out to the Kish lightship, am I? He stood
suddenly, his feet beginning to sink slowly in the quaking soil. Turn back.</p>
<p> Turning, he scanned the shore south, his feet sinking again slowly in new
sockets. The cold domed room of the tower waits. Through the barbacans the
shafts of light are moving ever, slowly ever as my feet are sinking, creeping
duskward over the dial floor. Blue dusk, nightfall, deep blue night. In the
darkness of the dome they wait, their pushedback chairs, my obelisk valise,
around a board of abandoned platters. Who to clear it? He has the key. I will
not sleep there when this night comes. A shut door of a silent tower, entombing
their blind bodies, the panthersahib and his pointer. Call: no answer. He lifted
his feet up from the suck and turned back by the mole of boulders. Take all,
keep all. My soul walks with me, form of forms. So in the moon&apos;s midwatches
I pace the path above the rocks, in sable silvered, hearing Elsinore&apos;s tempting flood.</p>
<p> The flood is following me. I can watch it flow past from here. Get back then
by the Poolbeg road to the strand there. He climbed over the sedge and eely
oarweeds and sat on a stool of rock, resting his ashplant in a grike.</p>
<p> A bloated carcase of a dog lay lolled on bladderwrack. Before him the
gunwale of a boat, sunk in sand. <i>Un coche ensabl&eacute;</i> Louis Veuillot
<br><font color="green">{u21, 51}</font>
<br> called Gautier&apos;s prose. These heavy sands are language tide and wind
have silted here. And these, the stoneheaps of dead builders, a warren of weasel
rats. Hide gold there. Try it. You have some. Sands and stones. Heavy of the
past. Sir Lout&apos;s toys. Mind you don&apos;t get one bang on the ear. I&apos;m the bloody well gigant rolls all

<br> them bloody well boulders, bones for my steppingstones. Feefawfum. I zmellz de bloodz odz an Iridzman.</p>
<p> A point, live dog, grew into sight running across the sweep of sand. Lord,
is he going to attack me? Respect his liberty. You will not be master of others
or their slave. I have my stick. Sit tight. From farther away, walking shoreward
across from the crested tide, figures, two. The two maries. They have tucked it
safe mong the bulrushes. Peekaboo. I see you. No, the dog. He is running back to them. Who?</p>
<p> Galleys of the Lochlanns ran here to beach, in quest of prey, their
bloodbeaked prows riding low on a molten pewter surf. Dane vikings, torcs of
tomahawks aglitter on their breasts when Malachi wore the collar of gold. A
school of turlehide whales stranded in hot noon, spouting, hobbling in the
shallows. Then from the starving cagework city a horde of jerkined dwarfs, my
people, with flayers&apos; knives, running, scaling, hacking in green blubbery
whalemeat. Famine, plague and slaughters. Their blood is in me, their lusts my
waves. I moved among them on the frozen Liffey, that I, a changeling, among the
spluttering resin fires. I spoke to no-one: none to me.</p>
<p> The dog&apos;s bark ran towards him, stopped, ran back. Dog of my enemy. I
just simply stood pale, silent, bayed about. <i>Terribilia meditans</i>. A
primrose doublet, fortune&apos;s knave, smiled on my fear. For that are you
pining, the bark of their applause? Pretenders: live their lives. The
Bruce&apos;s brother, Thomas Fitzgerald, silken knight, Perkin Warbeck,
York&apos;s false scion, in breeches of silk of whiterose ivory, wonder of a
day, and Lambert Simnel, with a tail of nans and sutlers, a scullion crowned.
All kings&apos; sons. Paradise of pretenders then and now. He saved men from
drowning and you shake at a cur&apos;s yelping. But the courtiers who mocked
Guido in Or san Michele were in their own house. House of&nbsp;&hellip; We don&apos;t want any of your medieval

The man that was drowned nine days ago off Maiden&apos;s rock. They are waiting
for him now. The truth, spit it out. I would want to. I would try. I am not a
strong swimmer. Water cold soft. When I put my face into it in the basin at
Clongowes. Can&apos;t see! Who&apos;s behind me? Out quickly, quickly! Do you
see the tide flowing quickly in on all sides, sheeting the lows of sand quickly,
shellcocoacoloured? If I had land under my feet. I want his life still to be
his, mine to be mine. A drowning man. His human eyes scream to me out of horror
of his death. I&nbsp;&hellip; With him together down&nbsp;&hellip; I could not save her. Waters: bitter death: lost.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 46}</font> </p>
<p> A woman and a man. I see her skirties. Pinned up, I bet.</p>
<p> Their dog ambled about a bank of dwindling sand, trotting, sniffing on all
sides. Looking for something lost in a past life. Suddenly he made off like a
bounding hare, ears flung back, chasing the shadow of a lowskimming gull. The
man&apos;s shrieked whistle struck his limp ears. He turned, bounded back, came
nearer, trotted on twinkling shanks. On a field tenney a buck, trippant, proper,
unattired. At the lacefringe of the tide he halted with stiff forehoofs,
seawardpointed ears. His snout lifted barked at the wavenoise, herds of
seamorse. They serpented towards his feet, curling, unfurling many crests, every
ninth, breaking, plashing, from far, from farther out, waves and waves.</p>
<p> Cocklepickers. They waded a little way in the water and, stooping, soused
their bags and, lifting them again, waded out. The dog yelped running to them,
reared up and pawed them, dropping on all fours, again reared up at them with
mute bearish fawning. Unheeded he kept by them as they came towards the drier
sand, a rag of wolf&apos;s tongue redpanting from his jaws. His speckled body
ambled ahead of them and then loped off at a calf&apos;s gallop. The carcase lay
on his path. He stopped, sniffed, stalked round it, brother, nosing closer, went
round it, sniffing rapidly like a dog all over the dead dog&apos;s bedraggled
fell. Dogskull, dogsniff, eyes on the ground, moves to one great goal. Ah, poor
dogsbody! Here lies poor dogsbody&apos;s body.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Tatters! Out of that, you mongrel!
<br><font color="green">{u21, 53}</font> </p>
<p> The cry brought him skulking back to his master and a blunt bootless kick
sent him unscathed across a spit of sand, crouched in flight. He slunk back in a
curve. Doesn&apos;t see me. Along by the edge of the mole he lolloped, dawdled,
smelt a rock and from under a cocked hindleg pissed against it. He trotted
forward and, lifting his hindleg, pissed quick short at an unsmelt rock. The
simple pleasures of the poor. His hindpaws then scattered the sand: then his
forepaws dabbled and delved. Something he buried there, his grandmother. He
rooted in the sand, dabbling, delving and stopped to listen to the air, scraped
up the sand again with a fury of his claws, soon ceasing, a pard, a panther, got
in spousebreach, vulturing the dead.</p>
<p> After he woke me up last night same dream or was it? Wait. Open hallway.
Street of harlots. Remember. Haroun al Raschid. I am almosting it. That man led
me, spoke. I was not afraid. The melon he had he held against my face. Smiled:

<br><font color="green">{u22, 47}</font> </p>
<p> Shouldering their bags they trudged, the red Egyptians. His blued feet out
of turnedup trousers slapped the clammy sand, a dull brick muffler strangling
his unshaven neck. With woman steps she followed: the ruffian and his strolling
mort. Spoils slung at her back. Loose sand and shellgrit crusted her bare feet.
About her windraw face her hair trailed. Behind her lord his helpmate, bing
awast to Romeville. When night hides her body&apos;s flaws calling under her
brown shawl from an archway where dogs have mired. Her fancyman is treating two
Royal Dublins in O&apos;Loughlin&apos;s of Blackpitts. Buss her, wap in
rogues&apos; rum lingo, for, O, my dimber wapping dell! A shefiend&apos;s

<p> Passing now.</p>
<p> A side-eye at my Hamlet hat. If I were suddenly naked here as I sit? I am
not. Across the sands of all the world, followed by the sun&apos;s flaming
sword, to the west, trekking to evening lands. She trudges, schlepps, trains,
drags, trascines her load. A tide westering, moondrawn, in her wake. Tides,
myriadislanded, within her, blood not mine, <i>oinopa ponton</i>, a winedark
sea. Behold the handmaid of the moon. In sleep the wet sign calls her hour, bids

Must be two of em. Glue em well. Mouth to her mouth&apos;s kiss.</p>

cataractic planets, globed, blazing, roaring wayawayawayawayawayaway. Paper. The
banknotes, blast them. Old Deasy&apos;s letter. Here. Thanking you for the
hospitality tear the blank end off. Turning his back to the
<br><font color="green">{u22, 48}</font>
<br> sun he bent over far to a table of rock and scribbled words. That&apos;s
twice I forgot to take slips from the library counter.</p>
<p> His shadow lay over the rocks as he bent, ending. Why not endless till the
farthest star? Darkly they are there behind this light, darkness shining in the
brightness, delta of Cassiopeia, worlds. Me sits there with his augur&apos;s rod
of ash, in borrowed sandals, by day beside a livid sea, unbeheld, in violet
night walking beneath a reign of uncouth stars. I throw this ended shadow from
me, manshape ineluctable, call it back. Endless, would it be mine, form of my
form? Who watches me here? Who ever anywhere will read these written words?
Signs on a white field. Somewhere to someone in your flutiest voice. The good
bishop of Cloyne took the veil of the temple out of his shovel hat: veil of space
<br><font color="green">{u21, 55}</font>
<br> with coloured emblems hatched on its field. Hold hard. Coloured on a flat:
yes, that&apos;s right. Flat I see, then think distance, near, far, flat I see,
east, back. Ah, see now! Falls back suddenly, frozen in stereoscope. Click does
the trick. You find my words dark. Darkness is in our souls, do you not think?
Flutier. Our souls, shamewounded by our sins, cling to us yet more, a woman to
her lover clinging, the more the more.</p>
<p> She trusts me, her hand gentle, the longlashed eyes. Now where the blue hell
am I bringing her beyond the veil? Into the ineluctable modality of the
ineluctable visuality. She, she, she. What she? The virgin at Hodges
Figgis&apos; window on Monday looking in for one of the alphabet books you were
going to write. Keen glance you gave her. Wrist through the braided jesse of her
sunshade. She lives in Leeson park with a grief and kickshaws, a lady of
letters. Talk that to someone else, Stevie: a pickmeup. Bet she wears those
curse of God stays suspenders and yellow stockings, darned with lumpy wool. Talk
about apple dumplings, <i>piuttosto</i>. Where are your wits?</p>
<p> Touch me. Soft eyes. Soft soft soft hand. I am lonely here. O, touch me
soon, now. What is that word known to all men? I am quiet here alone. Sad too. Touch, touch me.</p>
<p> He lay back at full stretch over the sharp rocks, cramming the scribbled
note and pencil into a pocket, his hat tilted down on his eyes. That is Kevin
Egan&apos;s movement I made, nodding for his nap, sabbath sleep. <i>Et vidit
Deus. Et erant valde bona</i>. Hlo! <i>Bonjour</i>. Welcome as the flowers in
May. Under its leaf he watched through peacocktwittering lashes the southing
sun. I am caught in this burning scene. Pan&apos;s hour, the faunal noon. Among
gumheavy serpentplants, milkoozing fruits, where on the tawny waters leaves lie wide. Pain is far.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 49}</font> </p>
<p class="set"><i>And no more turn aside and brood.</i></p>
<p> His gaze brooded on his broadtoed boots, a buck&apos;s castoffs,
<i>nebeneinander</i>. He counted the creases of rucked leather wherein
another&apos;s foot had nested warm. The foot that beat the ground in tripudium,
foot I dislove. But you were delighted when Esther Osvalt&apos;s shoe went on
you: girl I knew in Paris. <i>Tiens, quel petit pied!</i> Staunch
<br><font color="green">{u21, 56}</font>
<br> friend, a brother soul: Wilde&apos;s love that dare not speak its name. He
now will leave me. And the blame? As I am. As I am. All or not at all.</p>
<p> In long lassoes from the Cock lake the water flowed full, covering
greengoldenly lagoons of sand, rising, flowing. My ashplant will float away. I
shall wait. No, they will pass on, passing, chafing against the low rocks,
swirling, passing. Better get this job over quick. Listen: a fourworded
wavespeech: seesoo, hrss, rsseeiss, ooos. Vehement breath of waters amid
seasnakes, rearing horses, rocks. In cups of rocks it slops: flop, slop, slap:
bounded in barrels. And, spent, its speech ceases. It flows purling, widely
flowing, floating foampool, flower unfurling.</p>
<p> Under the upswelling tide he saw the writhing weeds lift languidly and sway
reluctant arms, hising up their petticoats, in whispering water swaying and
upturning coy silver fronds. Day by day: night by night: lifted, flooded and let
fall. Lord, they are weary: and, whispered to, they sigh. Saint Ambrose heard
it, sigh of leaves and waves, waiting, awaiting the fullness of their times,
<i>diebus ac noctibus iniurias patiens ingemiscit</i>. To no end gathered:
vainly then released, forthflowing, wending back: loom of the moon. Weary too in
sight of lovers, lascivious men, a naked woman shining in her courts, she draws a toil of waters.</p>
<p> Five fathoms out there. Full fathom five thy father lies. At one he said.
Found drowned. High water at Dublin bar. Driving before it a loose drift of
rubble, fanshoals of fishes, silly shells. A corpse rising saltwhite from the
undertow, bobbing landward, a pace a pace a porpoise. There he is. Hook it
quick. Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor. Pull. We have him. Easy now.</p>
<p> Bag of corpsegas sopping in foul brine. A quiver of minnows, fat of a spongy
titbit, flash through the slits of his buttoned trouserfly. God becomes man
becomes fish becomes barnacle goose becomes featherbed mountain. Dead breaths I
living breathe, tread dead dust, devour a urinous offal from all dead. Hauled
stark over the gunwale he breathes upward the stench of his green grave, his leprous nosehole snoring to the sun.</p>
<p> A seachange this, brown eyes saltblue. Seadeath, mildest of all
<br><font color="green">{u21, 57}</font>
<br> deaths
<br><font color="green">{u22, 50}</font>
<br> known to man. Old Father Ocean. <i>Prix de Paris</i>: beware of imitations.
Just you give it a fair trial. We enjoyed ourselves immensely.</p>
<p> Come. I thirst. Clouding over. No black clouds anywhere, are there?
Thunderstorm. Allbright he falls, proud lightning of the intellect, <i>Lucifer,
dico, qui nescit occasum</i>. No. My cockle hat and staff and hismy sandal
shoon. Where? To evening lands. Evening will find itself.</p>
<p> He took the hilt of his ashplant, lunging with it softly, dallying still.
Yes, evening will find itself in me, without me. All days make their end. By the
way next when is it Tuesday will be the longest day. Of all the glad new year,
mother, the rum tum tiddledy tum. Lawn Tennyson, gentleman poet.
<i>Gi&agrave;</i>. For the old hag with the yellow teeth. And Monsieur Drumont,
gentleman journalist. <i>Gi&agrave;</i>. My teeth are very bad. Why, I wonder?
Feel. That one is going too. Shells. Ought I go to a dentist, I wonder, with
that money? That one. This. Toothless Kinch, the superman. Why is that, I wonder, or does it mean something perhaps?</p>
<p> My handkerchief. He threw it. I remember. Did I not take it up?</p>
<p> His hand groped vainly in his pockets. No, I didn&apos;t. Better buy one.</p>
<p> He laid the dry snot picked from his nostril on a ledge of rock, carefully. For the rest let look who will.</p>
<p> Behind. Perhaps there is someone.</p>
<p> He turned his face over a shoulder, rere regardant. Moving through the air
high spars of a threemaster, her sails brailed up on the crosstrees, homing,
upstream, silently moving, a silent ship.</p>  </main>
