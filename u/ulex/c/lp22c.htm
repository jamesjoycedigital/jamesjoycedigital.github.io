<p> Ineluctable modality of the visible: at least that if no more, thought
through my eyes. Signatures of all things I am here to read, seaspawn and
seawrack, the nearing tide, that rusty boot. Snotgreen, bluesilver, rust:

was aware of them bodies before of them coloured. How? By knocking his sconce
against them, sure. Go easy. Bald he was and a millionaire, <i>maestro di color

put your five fingers throught<a target="foot" id="fcc0002">&ordm;</a>
it,<a target="foot" id="fcc0003">&ordm;</a> it is a gate, if not a door. Shut your eyes and see.</p>
<p> Stephen closed his eyes to hear his boots crush crackling wrack and shells.
You are walking through it howsomever. I am, a stride at a time. A very short
space of time through very short times of space. Five, six: the

<p> See now. There all the time without you: and ever shall be, world without end.</p>

<a target="foot" id="fcc0011">&ordm;</a> their splayed feet sinking in the

swung lourdily her midwife&apos;s bag, the other&apos;s gamp poked in the beach.
From the liberties, out for the day. Mrs Florence MacCabe, relict of the late
Patk MacCabe, deeply lamented, of Bride Street. One of her sisterhood lugged me
squealing into life. Creation from nothing. What has she in the bag? A misbirth
with a trailing navelcord, hushed in ruddy wool. The cords of all link back,

heard (now I am lifting) their two bells (he is kneeling) twang in diphthong.</p>
<p> Cousin Stephen, you will never be a saint. Isle of saints. You were awfully
holy, weren&apos;t you? You prayed to the Blessed Virgin that you might not have
a red nose. You prayed to the devil in Serpentine avenue that the

<p> Reading two pages apiece of seven books every night, eh? I was young. You
bowed to yourself in the mirror, stepping forward to applause earnestly,

<p> The grainy sand had gone from under his feet. His boots trod again a damp
crackling mast, razorshells, squeaking pebbles, that on the unnumbered pebbles
beats, wood sieved by the shipworm, lost Armada. Unwholesome sandflats waited to
suck his treading soles, breathing upward sewage
breath.<a target="foot" id="fcc0038">&ordm;</a> He coasted them, walking warily.
A porterbottle stood up, stogged to its waist, in the cakey sand dough. A
sentinel: isle of dreadful thirst. Broken hoops on the shore; at the land a maze
of dark cunning nets; farther away chalkscrawled backdoors and on the higher
beach a dryingline with two crucified shirts. Ringsend: wigwams of brown
steersmen and master mariners. Human shells.</p>
<p> He halted. I have passed the way to aunt Sara&apos;s. Am I not going there?

Egan of Paris, unsought by any save by me. Making his day&apos;s stations, the
dingy printingcase, his three taverns, the Montmartre lair he sleeps short night
in, rue de la Goutte-d&apos;Or, damascened with flyblown faces of the gone.

<p> He had come nearer the edge of the sea and wet sand slapped his boots. The
new air greeted him, harping in wild nerves, wind of wild air of seeds of
brightness. Here, I am not walking out to the Kish lightship, am I? He stood
suddenly, his feet beginning to sink slowly in the quaking soil. Turn back.</p>
<p> Turning, he scanned the shore south, his feet sinking again slowly in new
sockets. The cold domed room of the tower waits. Through the
barbacans<a target="foot" id="fcc0065">&ordm;</a> the shafts of light are moving
ever, slowly ever as my feet are sinking, creeping duskward over the dial floor.
Blue dusk, nightfall, deep blue night. In the darkness of the dome they wait,
their pushedback chairs, my obelisk valise, around a board of abandoned
platters. Who to clear it? He has the key. I will not sleep there when this
night comes. A shut door of a silent tower
<a target="foot" id="fcc0066">&ordm;</a> entombing their blind bodies, the
panthersahib and his pointer. Call: no answer. He lifted his feet up from the
suck and turned back by the mole of boulders. Take all, keep all. My soul walks
with me, <a name="jn1004b" href="../../ff/unbs/jn1all.htm#jn1004b">form of

sable silvered, hearing Elsinore&apos;s tempting flood.</p>
<p> The flood is following me. I can watch it flow past from here. Get back then
by the Poolbeg road to the strand there. He climbed over the sedge and eely

<p> Galleys of the Lochlanns ran here to beach, in quest of prey, their

<p> Cocklepickers. They waded a little way in the water and, stooping, soused
their bags,<a target="foot" id="fcc0072">&ordm;</a> and, lifting them again,
waded out. The dog yelped running to them, reared up and pawed them, dropping on
all fours, again reared up at them with mute bearish fawning. Unheeded he kept
by them as they came towards the drier sand, a rag of wolf&apos;s tongue
redpanting from his jaws. His speckled body ambled ahead of them and then loped
off at a calf&apos;s gallop. The carcase<a target="foot" id="fcc0073">&ordm;</a>
lay on his path. He stopped, sniffed, stalked round it, brother, nosing closer,
went round it, sniffling<a target="foot" id="fcc0074">&ordm;</a> rapidly like a

sent him unscathed across a spit of sand, crouched in flight. He slunk back in a

with a fury of his claws, soon ceasing, a

evening lands. She trudges, schlepps, trains, drags, trascines her load. A tide
westering, moondrawn, in her wake. Tides, myriadislanded, within her, blood not
mine, <i>oinopa ponton</i>, a winedark sea. Behold the handmaid of the moon. In
sleep the wet sign calls her hour, bids her rise. Bridebed, childbed, bed of
death, ghostcandled. <i>Omnis caro ad te veniet</i>. He comes, pale vampire,
through storm his eyes, his bat sails bloodying the sea, mouth to her mouth&apos;s kiss.</p>
<p> Here. Put a pin in that chap, will you? My tablets. Mouth to her kiss. No.

<p> His lips lipped and mouthed fleshless lips of air: mouth to her
womb.<a target="foot" id="fcc0083">&ordm;</a> Oomb, allwombing tomb. His mouth
moulded issuing breath, unspeeched: ooeeehah: roar of cataractic planets,
globed, blazing, roaring wayawayawayawayawayaway. Paper. The banknotes, blast

rock and scribbled words. That&apos;s twice I forgot to take slips from the library counter.</p>
<p> His shadow lay over the rocks as he bent, ending. Why not endless till the
farthest star? Darkly they are there behind this light, darkness shining in the
brightness, delta of Cassiopeia, worlds. Me sits there with his augur&apos;s rod
of ash, in borrowed sandals, by day beside a livid sea, unbeheld, in violet
night walking beneath a reign of uncouth stars. I throw this ended shadow from

ineluctable,</a> call it back. Endless, would it be mine, form of my form? Who
watches me here? Who ever anywhere will read these written words? Signs on a
white field. Somewhere to someone in your flutiest voice. The good bishop of
Cloyne took the veil of the temple out of his shovel hat: veil of space with
coloured emblems
<a name="un1032d" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1032d">hatched</a> on its

think distance, near, far, flat I see, east, back. Ah, see
now:<a target="foot" id="fcc0086">&ordm;</a> Falls back suddenly, frozen in
stereoscope. Click does the trick. You find my words dark. Darkness is in our
souls, do you not think? Flutier. Our souls, shamewounded by our sins, cling to
us yet more, a woman to her lover clinging, the more the more.</p>
<p> She trusts me, her hand gentle, the longlashed eyes. Now where the blue hell
am I bringing her beyond the veil? Into the ineluctable modality of the
ineluctable visuality. She, she, she. What she? The virgin at Hodges
Figgis&apos; window on Monday looking in for one of the alphabet books you were
going to write. Keen glance you gave her. Wrist through the braided jesse of her
sunshade. She lives in Leeson park, with<a target="foot" id="fcc0087">&ordm;</a>

Talk that to some one<a target="foot" id="fcc0088">&ordm;</a> else, Stevie: a

<p> He lay back at full stretch over the sharp rocks, cramming the scribbled
note and pencil into a pocket, his hat tilted down on his eyes.

<a target="foot" id="fcc0094">&ordm;</a> <i>nebeneinander</i>. He counted the
creases of rucked leather wherein another&apos;s foot had nested warm. The foot
that beat the ground in tripudium, foot I dislove. But you were delighted when
Esther Osvalt&apos;s shoe went on you: girl I knew in Paris. <i>Tiens, quel

<p> In long lassoes from the Cock lake the water flowed full, covering
greengoldenly lagoons of sand, rising, flowing. My ashplant will float away. I
shall wait. No, they will pass on, passing
<a target="foot" id="fcc0096">&ordm;</a>
chafing<a target="foot" id="fcc0097">&ordm;</a> against the low rocks, swirling,
passing. Better get this job over quick. Listen: a fourworded wavespeech:
seesoo, hrss, rsseeiss <a target="foot" id="fcc0098">&ordm;</a> ooos. Vehement
breath of waters amid seasnakes, rearing horses, rocks. In cups of rocks it
slops: flop, slop, slap: bounded in barrels. And, spent, its speech ceases. It
flows purling, widely flowing, floating foampool, flower unfurling.</p>
<p> Under the upswelling tide he saw the writhing weeds lift languidly and sway
reluctant arms, hising up their petticoats, in whispering water swaying and
upturning coy silver fronds. Day by day: night by night: lifted, flooded and let
fall. Lord, they are weary: and, whispered to, they sigh. Saint Ambrose heard
it, sigh of leaves and waves, waiting, awaiting the fullness of their times,
<i>diebus ac noctibus iniurias patiens ingemiscit</i>. To no end gathered:
vainly then released, forth flowing<a target="foot" id="fcc0099">&ordm;</a>,
wending back: loom of the moon. Weary too in sight of lovers, lascivious men, a
naked woman shining in her courts, she draws a toil of waters.</p>
