<p> Ineluctable modality of the visible: at least that if no more, thought
through my eyes. Signatures of all things I am here to read, seaspawn and
seawrack, the nearing tide, that rusty boot. Snotgreen, bluesilver, rust:
coloured signs. Limits of the diaphane. But he adds: in bodies. Then he was
aware of them bodies before of them coloured. How? By knocking his sconce
against them, sure. Go easy. Bald he was and a millionaire, <u>maestro di color
che sanno</u>. Limit of the diaphane in. Why in? Diaphane, adiaphane. If you can
put your five fingers through it it is a gate, if not a door. Shut your eyes and see.</p>
<p> Stephen closed his eyes to hear his boots crush crackling wrack and shells.
You are walking through it howsomever. I am, a stride at a time. A very short
space of time through very short times of space. Five, six: the
<u>Nacheinander</u>. Exactly: and that is the ineluctable modality of the
audible. Open your eyes. No. Jesus! If I fell over a cliff that beetles
o&apos;er his base, fell through the <u>Nebeneinander</u> ineluctably! I am
getting on nicely in the dark. My ash sword hangs at my side. Tap with it: they
do. My two feet in his boots are at the ends of my two legs,
<u>nebeneinander</u>. Sounds
solid<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span>: made by the
mallet of Los <u>demiurgos</u>. Am I walking into eternity along Sandymount
strand? Crush, crack, crick, crick. Wild sea money. Dominie Deasy kens them a&apos;.</p>
<p class="set"><u>Won&apos;t you come to Sandymount,</u>
<br> <u>Madeline the mare?</u></p>
<p> Rhythm begins, you see. I hear. A
catalectic<a target="foot" id="fcz0022">&ordm;</a> tetrameter of iambs marching. No, agallop: deline the mare.</p>
<p> Open your eyes now. I will. One moment. Has all vanished since? If I open
and am for ever in the black adiaphane. <u>Basta.</u> I will see if I can see.</p>
<p> See now. There all the time

lourdily her midwife&apos;s bag, the other a gamp poking in the beach. From the

MacCabe, deeply lamented, of Bride Street. One of her sisterhood lugged me
squealing into life. Creation from nothing. What has she in the bag? A misbirth
with a trailing navelcord, hushed in ruddy wool. The cords of all link back,

day, and Lambert Simnel, a scullion crowned. All kings&apos; sons. Paradise of
pretenders then and now. He saved men from drowning and you shake at a
cur&apos;s yelping. But the courtiers who mocked Guido in Or san Michele were in
their own house. House of&nbsp;&hellip; We don&apos;t want any of your medieval
abstrusiosities. Would you do what he did? A boat would be near, a lifebuoy.
<u>Natuerlich</u>, put there for you. Would you or would you not? The man that
was drowned nine days ago off Maiden&apos;s rock. They are waiting for him now.
The truth, spit it out. I would want to. I would try. I am not a strong swimmer.
Water cold soft. When I put my face into it in the basin at Clongowes. Out
quickly, quickly! Do you see the tide flowing quickly in on all sides, sheeting
the beds of sand quickly, shellcocoacoloured? If I had land under my feet. I
want his life still to

his, mine to be mine. A drowning man. His human eyes scream to me out of horror
of his death. I&nbsp;&hellip; With him together down&nbsp;&hellip;. I could not
save her. Waters: bitter death: lost.</p>
<p> A

<font color="black">woman</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>
and a man. I see her skirties. Pinned up, I bet.</p>
<p> Their dog ambled about a bank of dwindling sand, trotting, sniffing on all
sides. Looking for something lost in a past life. Suddenly he made off like a bounding
<br><font color="green">{ms, 013}</font>
<br> hare, ears flung back, chasing the shadow of a lowskimming gull. The
man&apos;s shrieked whistle struck his limp ears. He turned, bounded back, came
nearer, trotted on twinkling shanks. On a field tenney a buck, trippant, proper,
unattired. At the lacefringe of the tide he halted with stiff forehoofs,
seawardpointed ears. His snout lifted barked at the wavenoise. They serpented
towards his feet, curling, unfurling many crests, every ninth, breaking,
plashing, from far, from farther out, waves and waves.</p>
<p> Cocklepickers. They waded a little way in the water and, stooping, soused
their bags<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span> and,
lifting them again, waded out. The dog yelped running to them, reared up and
pawed them, dropping on all fours, again reared up at them with mute bearish
fawning. Unheeded he kept by them as they came towards the drier sand, a rag of
wolf&apos;s tongue redpanting<a target="foot" id="fcz0034">&ordm;</a> from his
jaws. His speckled body ambled ahead of them and then set off at a calf&apos;s
gallop. The carcase lay on his path. He stopped, sniffed, stalked round it,
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><font color="black">brother,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>
nosing closer, went round it, sniffling rapidly like a dog all over the dead
dog&apos;s bedraggled fell. Dogskull, dogsniff, eyes on the ground, moves to one
great goal. Ah, poor dogsbody! Here lies dogsbody&apos;s body.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Tatters! Outofthat, you mongrel!</p>
<p> The cry brought him skulking back to his master and a blunt bootless kick
sent him unscathed across a spit of sand, crouched in flight. He
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">ambled</span></span>
<font color="black">slunk</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>
back in a curve. Doesn&apos;t see me. Along by the edge of the mole he dawdled,
smelt a rock and from under a cocked hindleg pissed against it. He trotted
forward and, lifting again his hindleg, pissed
<br><font color="green">{ms, 014}</font>
<br> quick short at an unsmelt rock. The simple pleasures of the poor. His
hindpaws then scattered the sand: then his forepaws dabbled and delved.
Something he buried there, his grandmother. He rooted in the sand, dabbling,
delving and stopped to listen to the air, scraped up the sand again with a fury
of his claws, soon ceasing, a pard, a panther, got in spousebreach, vulturing the dead.</p>

Wait. Open hallway. Street of harlots. Remember. I am almosting it. That man led
me, spoke. I was not afraid. The melon he had he held against my face. Smiled:
creamfruit smell. That was the rule said. In. Come. Red carpet spread. You will see who.</p>
<p> Shouldering their bags they passed. His blued feet out of
turned-up<a target="foot" id="fcz0035">&ordm;</a> trousers slapped the clammy
sand, a dull red muffler strangling his unshaven neck. With woman steps she
followed: the ruffian and his strolling
mort<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span>, spoils slung
at her back. Loose sand and shellgrit crusted her bare feet. About her windraw
face hair trailed. Behind her lord his helpmate, trudging to

When night hides her body&apos;s flaws calling under her brown shawl from an
archway where dogs have mired. Her fancyman is treating two Royal Dublins in
O&apos;Loughlin&apos;s of Blackpitts. Buss her, wap in rogues&apos; rum lingo,
for, O, my dimber wapping dell! A shefiend&apos;s whiteness under her rancid
rags. Fumbally&apos;s lane that night: the tanyard smells.</p>

eye at my Hamlet hat. If I were suddenly naked here as I sit? I am not. Across
the sands of all the world, followed by the sun&apos;s flaming sword, to the
west, to evening lands. She trudges, schlepps, trains, drags, trascines her
load. A tide westering, moondrawn, in her wake. Tides, myriadislanded, within
her, blood not mine, <u>oinopa ponton</u>, a winedark sea. Behold the handmaid
of the moon. In sleep the wet sign calls her hour, bids her rise. Bridebed,
childbed, bed of death, ghostcandled. <u>Omnis caro ad te veniet.</u> He comes,
pale vampire, through storm his eyes, his bat sails bloodying the sea, mouth to her mouth&apos;s kiss.</p>
<p> Here. Put a pin in that chap, will you? My tablets. Mouth to her kiss. No.
Must be two of em. Glue em well. Mouth to her mouth&apos;s kiss.</p>
<p> His lips lipped and mouthed fleshless lips of air: mouth to her moomb. Oomb,
allwombing tomb. His mouth moulded issuing breath, unspeeched: ooeeehah: roar of
cataractic planets, globed, blazing, roaring wayawayawayawayaway. Paper. The
banknotes, blast them. Old Deasy&apos;s letter. Here. Thanking you for the
hospitality tear the blank end off. Turning his back to the sun he bent over far
to a table of rock and scribbled words. That&apos;s twice I forgot to take slips from the library counter.</p>
<p> His shadow lay over the
<br><font color="green">{ms, 016}</font>
<br> rocks as he bent, ending. Why not endless till the farthest star? Darkly
they are there behind this light, darkness shining in the brightness, delta of
Cassiopeia, worlds. Me sits there with his augur&apos;s rod of ash, in borrowed
sandals, by day beside a livid sea, unbeheld, in violet night walking beneath a
reign of uncouth stars. I throw this ended shadow from me, call it back.
Endless, would it be mine, form of my form? Who watches me here? Who ever
anywhere will read these written words? Signs on a white field. Somewhere to
someone in your flutiest voice. The good bishop of Cloyne took the veil of the
temple out of his shovel hat: veil of space with coloured emblems hatched on its
field. Hold hard. Coloured on a flat: yes, that&apos;s right. Flat I see, then
think distance, near, far, flat I see, east, back. Ah, see now! Falls back
suddenly, frozen in stereoscope. Click does the trick. You find my words

<font color="black">dark</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>.
Darkness is in our souls do you not think? Flutier. Our souls, shamewounded by
our sins, cling to us yet more, a woman to her lover clinging, the more the more.</p>
<p> She trusts me, her hand gentle, the longlashed eyes. Now where the blue hell
am I bringing her beyond the veil? Into the ineluctable modality of the
ineluctable visuality. She, she, she. What she? The virgin at Hodges
Figgis&apos; window on Monday looking in for one of the alphabet books you were
going to write. Keen glance you gave her.

through the braided jesse of her sunshade. She lives in Leeson park, a lady of letters.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 017}</font>
<br> Talk that to someone else, Stevie: a pickmeup. Bet she wears those curse of
God stays suspenders and yellow stockings, darned with lumpy wool. Talk about
apple dumplings, <u>piuttosto</u>. Where are your wits?</p>
<p> Touch me. Soft eyes. Soft soft soft hand. I am lonely here. O, touch me
soon, now. What is that word known to all men? I am quiet here alone. Sad too. Touch, touch me.</p>
<p> He lay back at full stretch over the sharp rocks, cramming the scribbled
note and pencil into a pocket, his hat tilted down on his eyes. That is Kevin
Egan&apos;s movement I
made<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><font color="black">,
nodding for his nap</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>.
Hlo! <u>Bonjour.</u> Under its leaf he watched through peacocktwittering lashes
the southing sun. I am caught in this burning scene. Pan&apos;s hour, the faunal
noon. Among gumheavy serpentplants,
milk-oozing<a target="foot" id="fcz0036">&ordm;</a> fruits, where on the tawny waters leaves lie wide. Pain is far.</p>
<p class="set"><u>And no more turn aside and brood.</u></p>
<p> His gaze brooded on his broadtoed boots, a buck&apos;s castoffs,
<u>nebeneinander</u>. He counted the creases of rucked leather wherein
another&apos;s foot had nested warm. The foot that beat the ground in tripudium,
foot I dislove. But you were delighted when Esther Osvalt&apos;s shoe went on

<p> In long lassos from the Cock lake the water flowed full, covering greengoldenly lagoons
<br><font color="green">{ms, 018}</font>
<br> of sand, rising, flowing. My ashplant will float away. I shall wait. No,
they will pass on, passing, chafing against the low rocks, swirling, passing.
Better get this job over quick. Listen: a

In cups of rocks it slops: flop, slop,
slap:<a target="foot" id="fcz0039">&ordm;</a> bounded in barrels. And, spent,
its speech ceases. It flows purling, widely flowing, floating foampool, flower unfurling.</p>
<p> Under the upswelling tide he saw the writhing weeds lift languidly and sway
reluctant arms, hising up their petticoats, in whispering water swaying and
upturning coy silver fronds. Day by day: night by night: lifted, flooded and let
fall. Lord, they are weary; and, whispered to, they sigh. Saint Ambrose heard
it, sigh of leaves and waves, waiting, awaiting the fulness of their times,
<u>diebus ac noctibus iniurias patiens ingemiscit</u>. To no end gathered;
vainly then released, forthflowing, wending back, loom of the moon. Weary too in

<p> Five fathoms out there. Full fathom five thy father lies. At one, he said.
High water at Dublin bar. Driving before it a loose drift of rubble, fanshoals
of fishes, silly shells. A corpse rising saltwhite from the undertow, bobbing
landward. There he is. Hook it quick. Pull. We have him. Easy now<a target="foot" id="fcz0040">&ordm;</a></p>

God becomes man becomes fish becomes barnacle goose becomes featherbed mountain.

his green grave, his leprous nosehole snoring to the sun.</p>
<p> A seachange this. Seadeath, mildest of all deaths known to man. <u>Prix de

staff and hismy sandal shoon. Where? To evening lands. Evening will find itself.</p>
<p> He took the hilt of his ashplant, lunging with it softly, dallying still.
Yes, evening will find itself in me, without me. All days make their end. By the
way next when

Toothless Kinch, the superman. Why is that, I wonder, or does it mean something perhaps?</p>

<p> His hand groped vainly in his pockets. No, I didn&apos;t.

<br> Better buy one. He laid the dry snot picked from his nostril on a ledge of
rock, carefully. For the rest let look who will.</p>
<p> Behind. Perhaps there is someone.</p>
<p> He turned his face over a shoulder, rere regardant. Moving through the air
high spars of a threemaster, her sails brailed up on the crosstrees, homing,
silently moving, a silent ship.</p> </p>  </main>
