chairs, my valise round the uncleared table. Who would clear it? Through the
barbacans the shafts of light will move ever, slowly, creeping this side that
side on their dial. Blue dusk, nightfall, night. He has the key. I took up my
bed and walked I will not sleep there. Shut door of a silent tower entombing
their sleeping bodies, the panthersahib and gamekeeper beater. Call: no answer.

bloated dog&apos;s carcase, the gunwale of a boat, sunk in sand. <u>Un coche

dog ambled about, trotting, sniffing on all sides. Looking for something he lost
in a past life.</a> Suddenly he made off like a bounding hare, ears flung back,
chasing on the sand the shadow of a lowflying gull. His
master<a target="foot" id="fcz0001">&ordm;</a> shrill whistle stopped his
course. He turned, bounded back, came nearer, trotted on twinkling legs. He
halted near the verge of the tide with stiff forehoofs and seawardpointed ears.
His head lifted barked against the noise of the waves. brawling They came
nearer, shaking their crests, plashing, breaking, from farther, from far out, many,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 2}</font>
<br> many.</p>
<p> The cocklepickers lifted their washed bags up from the water and waded out.
Their dog yelped and running to them, reared up and pawed them, falling on all
fours and again reared up with mute bearish efforts. Unheeded he kept on beside
them as they came towards the drier sand near the rocks, a rag of red tongue
hanging sideways out of his wolf&apos;s jaws. The carcase lay on his path. He
stopped, sniffed it, went round it, nosing it closer. Called to, he still went
round it sniffing rapidly like a dog all points of the dead dog.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Tatters! Here, you mongrel!</p>
<p> The cry brought him skulking up to his master and a blunt kick sent him
unscathed across a stretch of the strand, crouched in flight. He ambled again by
the side of the wall, smelt a rock, and from under a
<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font>
lifted hindleg pissed against it. He trotted on and lifting his hindleg again,
pissed for an instant against an unsmelt rock. His hindpaws then scattered the
sand: &amp; then his forepaws dabbled and delved. Looking for something he
buried here. He scraped in the sand, dabbling, delving, and stopped to listen to
the air and scraped up again the sand with a fury of his paws, soon ceasing.</p>
