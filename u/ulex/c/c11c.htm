<p> They came down the steps from Leahy&apos;s terrace prudently. Frauenzimmer.
And down the shelving shore flabbily, their splayed feet sinking in the silted
sand. Like me, like Algy coming down to the mighty mother. Number One carried
her midwife&apos;s bag, the other after her a gamp with which she poked and
turned over shells of the beach. From the liberties, out for the day. Mrs
Florence MacCabe, relict of the late lamented Patk MacCabe of Bride Street. One
of her sisterhood lugged me squealing into life. Creation out of nothing. What
has she in the bag? A misbirth with a trailing navelcord, hushed in ruddy wool.
The cords of all link back, stranded entwining cables of all flesh. That is why

<p> Wombed in darkness I was too, made not begotten: by them, the man with my

sundered, did the coupler&apos;s will. From before all ages. He willed me and
now may not will me away or ever. A <u>lex eterna</u> stays about Him. Is that

Warring his life long upon the contransmagnificandjewbangtantiality. Illstarred

crozier and with beaded mitre stalled upon his throne, widower of a widowed see,
with upstiffed omophorion, with clotted hinder parts.</p>
<p> Sea airs romped around him, nipping and eager airs. They are coming: waves.
The whitemaned sea horses, tossing, brightwindbridled.</p>

<p> His pace slackened. Here. Am I going to Aunt Sara&apos;s or not? My
consubstantial father&apos;s voice. Did you see anything of your brother Stephen
lately? No? Sure, he&apos;s not down in Strasburg terrace with his aunt Sally?
Couldn&apos;t he find something better than that eh? And and and and tell us,
Stephen, and how is uncle Si? O, weeping God! The things I married into. The
drunken little costdrawer and his brother the cornetplayer De boys in de
hayloft: highly respectable gondoliers. And Skeweyed Walter sirring his da, no
less. Sir. Yes, sir. No, sir. Jesus wept: and no wonder, by Christ.</p>
<p> I pull the rusty bell of their shuttered cottage: and wait. Twice. They take
me for a dun, peer out from a coign of vantage.</p>

of his knees a sturdy forearm. Cleanchested. He has washed the upper moiety.</p>

<p> He lays aside the lapboard whereon he drafts his bill of costs for the eyes
of master Goff and master Tandy, filing consents and common searches and a writ
of <u>Duces Tecum</u>. Above his bald head on the wall the little bogoak frame
round Wilde&apos;s verse: <u>Requiescat</u>. The drone of his misleading whistle brings Walter back.</p>

<p class="pdi">&mdash; He has nowhere to put it, you mug. Bring our Chippendale chair.

<p> He drones bars of Fernando&apos;s <u>aria di Sortita</u>. The grandest
number, Stephen, in the whole opera. Listen.</p>
<p> His tuneful whistle sounds again, finely shaded and with rushes of the air,
his fists bigdrumming on his padded knees.</p>
<p> This air is sweeter.<a target="foot" id="fcz0008">&ordm;</a></p>

<p> You are a highly intellectual fellow, with your Oxford manner. Reading two
pages apiece of ten books every night. I was young. You bowed to yourself in the
mirror, stepping forward seriously, striking looking. Hurray for the God damned

for their titles. Have you read F? O yes, but I prefer Q. Yes but W is
wonderful. O yes, W. And your epiphanies, written on green oval leaves, so
deeply deep, copies to be sent to all the great libraries of the world if you
died, including Alexandria. Someone was to read them there after

<p> The grainy sand had gone from under his feet. His boots trod the damp
crackling mast, razorshells, stuck empty shells, squeaking pebbles, that on the
unnumbered pebbles beats, wood sieved by the Shipworm, lost Armada. Unwholesome
sandflats waited to suck his treading soles, breathing upward sewage breath. He
coasted them walking warily. On his left a porter bottle stood up pitted to its
waist in the cakey sand dough. A sentinel. Isle of dreadful
<br><font color="green">{ms, 7}</font>
<br> thirst. Broken hoops on the shore; at the land&apos;s end a maze of dark
cunning nets: and farther away chalkscrawled backdoors and on a clothesline two
crucified shirts. Ringsend: wigwams of brown steersmen and master mariners. Human shells.</p>
<p> He halted. I have passed the way to aunt Sara&apos;s. Am I not going there?
Seems not. No-one about the strand. He turned and crossed the firmer sand towards the Pigeon House.</p>

<p> His feet marched in sudden proud rhythm over the sand furrows along by the
boulders of the South Wall. He stared at them, piled stone mammoth skulls. Gold
light on the sea, the sand, the boulders. The sun is there, the slender trees, the lemon houses.</p>
<p> Paris rawly waking, crude sunlight on her lemon streets. Moist pith of farls
of bread, froggreen wormwood, her matin incense court the air. Belluomo rises
from the bed of his wife&apos;s lover&apos;s wife: the kerchiefed housewife is

There was a fellow I knew in Barcelona used to call it his postprandial. Well;

breaths and grumbling gorges. His breath hangs over our saucestained plates, the
green fairy&apos;s fang thrusting between his lips. Of Ireland, the Dalcassians,
of hopes, conspiracies. Of lost leaders, Of Arthur Griffith now. To yoke me his
yokefellow, Our crimes our common cause. His fustian shirt, sanguineflowered,

wild air greeted him, harping on wild nerves, wind of wild air of seeds of fire.
Here. I am not walking out to the Kish light? He stood suddenly, his feet
beginning to sink slowly in the quaking soil. Turn back. Turning he scanned the
shore southward, his feet sinking again slowly in new sockets. The cold domed
room of the tower waits. Through the barbacans the shafts of light are moving
ever, slowly ever as my feet are sinking, creeping this side that side over the
dial floor. Blue dusk, nightfall, deep blue night. In the darkness

their blind bodies, the panthersahib and his pointer. Call: no answer. He lifted
his feet from the suck and turned back by the mole of boulders. Take all, keep

eely oarweeds and sat on a stool of rock, resting his ashplant by him.</p>
<p> The bloated carcase of a dog lay among the oily sedge. Before him the
gunwale of a boat, buried in sand. <u>Un coche ensabl&eacute;</u> Louis Veuillot
called Gautier&apos;s prose. These heavy sands are language that tide and wind
have silted here. And these the stoneheaps of dead builders, a warren of weasel
rats. Sands and stones. Why am I angered? because disdained. A fool&apos;s wrath
is heavier than them both. A live dog came into sight across the sweep of sand.
Lord, is he going to attack me? Respect his liberty, you will not be master and
will not serve. I have my stick. Sit still. From farther away walking shoreward
across from the coming tide, figures. The two? They have laid it among the
bulrushes. Peekaboo, I see you. No, the dog. He is running back to them.</p>
<p> The galleys of the Lochlanns ran here to beach, in quest of prey,

<br> their bloodbeaked prows riding the low molten pewter surf. Vikings the
torcs of tomahawks aglitter on their breasts, when Malachi wore the collar of

the shallows. Then from the cobbled cagework starving city a horde of jerkined
dwarfs (my people) with flayers&apos; knives, running, scaling, hacking green
blubbery whalemeat. Famine, plague and slaughter. Their blood is in me, their

the verge of the tides he halted with stiff forehoofs, seawardpointed ears. His
head lifted barked against the noise of the waves. They came towards his feet,
curling?, unfurling many crests, breaking, plashing, from farther, from far out, waves and waves.</p>
<p> The man and woman waded a few paces into the water and, stooping, soused
their bags. Cocklepickers. They lifted their bags from the water and waded out
again. The dog yelped and, running to them, reared up and pawed them, falling on
all fours, and again reared up with mute bearish fawning. Unheeded he kept
beside them as they came towards the drier sand, a rag of red tongue lolling
from a side of his wolf&apos;s jaws. His speckled body ambled in front and then
set off forward at a calf&apos;s gallop. The carcase lay on his path. He
stopped, sniffed, stalked round it, nosing closer, went round it sniffing
rapidly like a dog points of the dead dog&apos;s bedraggled fell. Dogskull,
dogsniff, moves to one great goal. Ah, poor dogsbody! Here lies dogsbody&apos;s body.</p>

<p> The cry brought him skulking back to his master and a blunt bootless kick
sent him unscathed across a spit of sand, crouched in flight. He ambled back

<br> in a curve and on by the edge of the mole, smelt a rock and from under a
heaved hindleg pissed against it. He trotted on and, heaving again his hindleg,
pissed at an unsmelt rock; simple pleasures of the Poor. His hindpaws then
scattered the sand: then his forepaws dabbled and delved. Something he buried
there: his grandmother. He rooted in the sand, dabbling, delving and stopped to
listen to the air, scraped up the sand again with a fury of his claws, soon
ceasing. A <a name="un1033c" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1033c">pard</a>, a

face. Behind her lord his helpmate trudging to Romeville. When night hides her

the trick. She trusts me; touch of her hand, gentle, her softlashed eyes. Where
am I supposed to be bringing her beyond the veil? The ineluctable modality of
ineluctable visuality. She, she, she. What she? The girl stood outside Hodges
Figgis on Monday looking for one of the alphabet books you were going to write.
Keen glance you gave her. Hand through the braided jesse of her sunshade,

on his eyes, cramming the scribbled note and pencil into a pocket.

<p> His feet shod in a buck&apos;s castoff boots drew his brooding gaze,

In cups of rocks it slops; flop, slop, slap; bounded in barrels. And, spent, its
speech ceases: it flows purling, wideflowing, floating foampool, flower unfurling.</p>
<p> Under the upswelling tide he saw the writhing weeds lift languidly and sway
reluctant arms, in whispering water swaying, hising up their petticoats,
upturning their coy fronds. Day by day, night by night lifted, flooded and let
fall. Lord, they are weary: and, whispered to, they sigh. Saint Ambrose heard it
sigh of leaves and waves, waiting, awaiting the fullness of their times,
