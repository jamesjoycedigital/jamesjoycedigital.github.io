the uncleared table. Who would clear it? Through the barbacans the shafts of

nightfall, night. He has the key.

<p class="spfl">His eyes wandered over the strand, a bottleneck sticking up, the
gunwale of a boat, sunk in sand. <u>Un coche ensabl&eacute;</u> Louis Veuillot
calls Gautier&apos;s prose angrily. Heavy as the sand is all language which tide
and wind have silted up, heavy the stoneheaps of past builders where now a
weasel lurks: but a fool&apos;s wrath is heavier than them both.</p>

dog ambled about, trotting, sniffing on all sides. Looking for something he lost
in a past life.</a> Suddenly he made off like a bounding hare, ears flung back,
chasing <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">a

master<a target="foot" id="fcz0001">&ordm;</a> shrill whistle stopped his
course. He turned, bounded back, came nearer, trotted on twinkling legs. He
halted near the verge of the tide with stiff forefeet and seawardpointed ears.
His head lifted barked against the noise of the waves. |xbrawling|x* They came
nearer, shaking their crests, plashing, breaking, from farther, from far out, many,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 2}</font>
<br> many.</p>
<p> The cocklepickers lifted their washed bags up from the water and waded out.
Their dog yelped and running to them, reared up and pawed them, falling on all
fours and again reared up with mute bearish efforts. Unheeded he kept on beside
them as they came towards the drier sand near the rocks, a rag of red tongue
hanging out of the side of his wolf&apos;s jaws. The carcase lay on his path. He
stopped, sniffed it, went round it, nosing it closer. Called to, he still went
round it sniffing rapidly like a dog all points of the dead dog.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Tatters! Here, you
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">mongel</span></span> mongrel!</p>
<p> The cry brought him skulking up to his master and a blunt kick sent him
unscathed across a stretch of the strand, crouched in flight. He ambled again by
the side of the wall, smelt a rock, lifted a hindleg and pissed against it. He
trotted on and lifting his hindleg again, pissed for an instant against an
unsmelt rock. His hindpaws then scattered the sand: his forepaws dabbled and
delved. Looking for something he buried here. He
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">scrat</span></span> scraped in the
sand, dabbling, delving, and stopped to listen to the air and scraped up again
the sand with a fury of his paws, soon ceasing.</p>
