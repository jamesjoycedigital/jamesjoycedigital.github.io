<p class="pStDir">The superior, the very reverend John Conmee S.J. reset his
smooth watch in his interior pocket as he came down the presbytery steps. Five
to three. Just nice time to walk to Artane. What was that boy&apos;s name again?
Dignam. Yes. <u>Vere dignum et iustum est.</u> Brother Swan was the person to
see. Mr Cunningham&apos;s letter. Yes. Oblige him, if possible. Good practical catholic: useful at mission time.</p>
<p> A onelegged sailor, swinging himself onward by lazy jerks of his crutches,
growled some notes. He jerked short before the convent of the sisters of charity
and held out a peaked cap for alms towards the very reverend John Conmee S.J.
Father Conmee blessed him in the sun for his purse held, he knew, one silver crown.</p>
<p> Father Conmee crossed to Mountjoy square. He thought, but not for long, of
soldiers and sailors whose legs were shot off by cannonballs, of cardinal
Wolsey&apos;s words: If I had served my God as I have served my King He would
not not have abandoned me in my old days. He walked by the treeshade of
sunnywinking leaves: and towards him came the wife of Mr David Sheehy MP.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Very well, indeed, father. And you, father?</p>
<p> Father Conmee was wonderfully well indeed. He would go to Buxton probably
for the waters. And her boys, were they getting on well at Belvedere? Was that
so? Father Conmee was very glad indeed to hear that. And Mr Sheehy himself?
Still in London. The house was still sitting, to be sure it was. Beautiful
weather it was, delightful indeed. Yes, it was very probable that Father Bernard
Vaughan would come again to preach. O, yes: a very great success. A wonderful man really.</p>
<p> Father Conmee was very glad to see the wife of Mr David Sheehy M.P. looking
so well and he begged to be remembered to Mr David Sheehy M.P. Yes, he would certainly call.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Good afternoon, Mrs Sheehy.</p>
<p> Father Conmee doffed his silk hat and smiled, as he took leave, at the jet
beads of her mantilla inkshining in the sun. And smiled yet again, in going. He
had cleaned his teeth, he knew, with arecanut paste.</p>
<p> Father Conmee walked and, walking, smiled for he thought on Father Bernard
Vaughan&apos;s droll eyes and cockney voice.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Pilate! Wy don&apos;t you hold back
<br><font color="green">{ms, 2}</font>
<br> that owlin mob?</p>
<p> A zealous man, however. Really he was. And really did great good in his way.
Beyond a doubt. Of good family too would one think it? Welsh, were they not?</p>
<p> O, lest he forget. That letter to Father provincial.</p>
<p> Father Conmee stopped three little schoolboys at the corner of Mountjoy
square. Yes: they were from Belvedere. The little house. Aha. And were they good
boys at school? O. That was very good now. And what was his name? Jack Sohan.
And his name? Ger. Gallaher. And the other little man? His name was Brunny
Lynam. O, that was a very nice name to have.</p>
<p> Father Conmee gave a letter from his breast to Master Jack Sohan and pointed
to the red pillarbox at the corner of Fitzgibbon street.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But mind you don&apos;t post yourself into the box, little man, he said.</p>
<p> The boys sixeyed Father Conmee and laughed:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, sir.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, let me see if you can post a letter, Father Conmee said.</p>
<p> Master Brunny Lynam ran across the road and put Father Conmee letter to
Father provincial into the mouth of the bright red letterbox, Father Conmee
smiled and nodded and smiled and walked along Mountjoy square east.</p>
<p> Was that not Mrs Magennis?</p>
<p> Mrs Magennis, stately, silverhaired, bowed to Father Conmee from the farther
footpath along which she sailed. And Father Conmee smiled and saluted.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; How do you do?</p>
<p> A fine carriage she has. Like Mary, queen of Scots, something. And to think
that she is a pawnbroker! Well, now! Such a&nbsp;&hellip; what should he say?&nbsp;&hellip;. such a queenly mien.</p>
<p> Father Conmee walked down Great Charles street and glanced at the shutup
free church on his left. The reverend T.R. Greene B.A. The incumbent they call
him. He feels it incumbent on him to say a few words. But one should be
charitable. Invincible ignorance. They acted according to their lights.</p>
<p> Father Conmee turned the corner and walked along the North Circular road. It was a
<br><font color="green">{ms, 3}</font>
<br> wonder that there was no tram line in such an important thoroughfare. Surely, there ought to be.</p>
<p> A band of satchelled schoolboyss crosed from Richmond street. All raised
untidy caps. Father Conmee greeted them more than once benignly. Christian brother boys.</p>
<p> Father Conmee smelt incense on his right hand as he walked. Saint
Joseph&apos;s church, Portland row. For aged and virtuous females. Father Conmee
raised his hat to the Blessed Sacrament. Virtuous: but occasionally they were also badtempered.</p>
<p> Near Aldborough house Father Conmee thought of that spendthrift nobleman. And now it was an office or something.</p>
<p> Father Conmee began to walk along the North Strand road and was saluted by
Mr Peter Gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop. Father Conmee saluted
Mr Peter Gallagher and perceived the odours that came from baconflitches and
ample cools of butter. He passed Grogan&apos;s the tobacconist against which
newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful catastrophe in New York. In America
those things were continually happening. Unfortunate people to die like that,
unprepared. Still, an act of perfect contrition.</p>
<p> Father Conmee went by Daniel Bergin&apos;s publichouse against the window of
which two unlabouring men lounged. They saluted him and were saluted.</p>
<p> He Father Conmee passed H.J. O&apos;Neill&apos;s funeral establishment where
Corny Kelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of hay. A
constable on his beat saluted Father Conmee and Father Conmee saluted the
constable. In Youkstetter&apos;s, the porkbutcher&apos;s, Father Conmee
pigs&apos; puddings, white, and black and red, lie neatly curled in tubes.
Moored under the trees of Charleville Mall Father Conmee saw a turfbarge, a
towhorse with pendent head, a bargeman with a hat of dirty straw seated
amidships, smoking and staring at a branch of elm above him. It was idyllic: and
Father Conmee reflected on the providence of the Creator who had made turf to be
in bogs whence men might dig it out and bring it to make fires in the houses of poor people.</p>
<p> On Newcomen bridge the very reverend John Conmee S.J. of St Francis
Xavier&apos;s church, upper Gardiner Street stepped on to an outward bound tram.</p>
<p> Off an inward bound tram stepped the reverend Nicholas Dudley C.C. of Saint
Agatha&apos;s church, north William Street, on the Newcomen bridge</p>
<p> At Newcomen bridge Father Conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for he
disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past mud island.</p>
<p> Father Conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar, a blue ticket tucked with care
in the eye of one plump kid glove, while four shillings, a sixpence and five
pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into his purse
<br><font color="green">{ms, 4}</font> </p>
<p> It was a peaceful day. The gentleman with the glasses opposite Father Conmee
had finished explaining and looked down. His wife, Father Conmee supposed.</p>
<p> A tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman with the glasses.
She raised her small gloved fist, yawned ever so gently, tiptapping her small gloved fist on her opening mouth.</p>
<p> Father Conmee perceived her perfume in the car. He perceived also that the
awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge of the seat.</p>
<p> Father Conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the mouth
of the awkward old man who had the shaky head.</p>
<p> At Newcomen bridge the tram halted and, when it was about to go, an old
woman rose suddenly from her place to alight. The conductor pulled the bellstrap
to stay the car for her. She passed out with her basket and a marketnet: and
Father Conmee saw the conductor help her and net and basket down: and Father
Conmee thought that she was one of those good souls who had always to be told
twice bless you, my child, that they have been absolved, pray for me. But they
had so many worries in life, so many cares, poor creatures.</p>
<p> From the hoardings Mr Eugene Stratton grimaced with thick nigger lips at Father Conmee.</p>
<p> Father Conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men and of
his sermon on saint Peter Claver S.J. and the African mission and of the
propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brown and yellow souls
that had not received the baptism of water. That book by the Belgian jesuit,
<u>Le Nombre des Elus</u>, seemed to Father Conmee a reasonable plea. Those were
millions of human souls created by God in His Own likeness to whom the faith had
not been brought. But they were God&apos;s souls, created by God. It seemed to
Father Conmee a pity that they should all be lost, a waste, if one might say.</p>
<p> At the Howith road stop Father Conmee alighted, was saluted by the conductor and saluted in his turn.</p>
<p> The Malahide road was quiet. It pleased Father
<br><font color="green">{ms, 5}</font>
<br> Conmee, road and name. The joybells were ringing in gay Malahide. Those
were old worldish days, loyal times, in joyous townlands, old times in the barony.</p>
<p> Father Conmee, walking, thought of his little book <u>Old Times in the
Barony</u> and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and of Ellen, first countess of Belvedere.</p>
<p> A listless lady, no more young, walked alone the shore of lough Owel, Ellen,
first countess of Belvedere, listlessly walking in the evening, not startled
when an otter plunged. Who could know the truth? Not the jealous lord Belvedere,
And Not her confessor if she had not committed adultery fully, <u>eiaculatio
seminis intra vas</u> mulieris, with her husband&apos;s brother? She would half
confess if she had not all sinned as women did. Only God knew and she and he, her husband&apos;s brother.</p>
<p> Father Conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence, needed however for
man&apos;s race on the earth, and of the ways of God which were not our ways.</p>
<p> Don John Conmee walked and moved in times of yore. He was humane and
honoured there. He bore in mind secrets confessed and he smiled at smiling noble
faces in a beeswaxed drawingroom, ceiled with full fruit clusters. And the hands
of a bride and of a bridegroom, noble to noble, were impalmed by Don John Conmee.</p>
<p> It was a charming day.</p>
<p> The lychgate of a field showed Father Conmee breadths of cabbages,
curtseying to him with ample underleaves. The sky showed him a flock of small
white clouds going slowly down the wind. <u>Moutonner</u>, the French said. A just and homely word.</p>
<p> Father Conmee, reading his office, watched a flock of muttoning clouds over
<br><font color="green">{ms, 6}</font>
<br> Rathcoffey. His thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of Clongowes
field. He walked there, reading in the evening, and heard the cries of the
boys&apos; lines at their play, young cries in the quiet evening. He was their rector: his reign was mild.</p>
<p> Father Conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out. An ivory bookmark told him the page.</p>
<p> Nones. He should have read that before lunch. But lady Maxwell had come.</p>
<p> Father Conmee read in secret <u>Pater</u> and <u>Ave</u> and crossed his breast. <u>Deus in adiutorium.</u></p>
<p> He walked calmly and read mutely the nones, walking and reading till he came to Res in Beati immaculati:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Principium verborum tuorum veritas: in eternum omnia iudicia iustitiae tuae.</p>
<p> A flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came a young
woman with wild nodding daisies in her hand. The young man raised his cap
abruptly: the young woman abruptly bent and with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig.</p>
<p> Father Conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his breviary. Sin:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Principes persecuti sunt me gratis: et a verbis tuis formidavit cor meum.</p>
<p class="headline">&lowast;&lowast;&lowast;</p>
<p> Corny Kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with his drooping eye at
a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner. He pulled himself erect, went to it and,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 7}</font>
<br> spinning it on its axle, viewed its shape. Chewing his blade of hay he laid
the coffinlid by and came to the doorway. There he tilted his hatbrim to give
shade to his eyes and leaned against the doorcase, looking idly out. Father John
Conmee stepped into the Dollymount tram on Newcomen bridge.</p>
<p> Corny Kelleher locked his largefooted boots and gazed, his hat downtilted, chewing his blade of hay.</p>
<p> Constable 57 C, on his beat, stood to pass the time of day.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That&apos;s a fine day, Mr Kelleher.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ay, Corny Kelleher said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It&apos;s very close, the constable said.</p>
<p> Corny Kelleher sped a silent jet of hayjuice arching from his mouth while a
generous white arm from a window in Eccles street flung forth a coin.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What&apos;s the best news? he asked.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I seen that particular party last evening, the constable said with bated breath.</p>
<p class="headline">&lowast;&lowast;&lowast;</p>
<p> A onelegged sailor crutched himself round MacConnell&apos;s corner, skirting
Rabaiotti&apos;s icecream car, and jerked himself up Eccles&apos; street.
Towards Larry O&apos;Rourke, in shirtsleeves in his doorway, he growled unamiably:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>For England,</u></p>
<p> He swung himself violently forward past Katie and Boody Dedalus, halted and growled:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>home and beauty.</u></p>
<p> J.J. O&apos;Molloy&apos;s white careworn face was told that Mr Lambert was in the warehouse with a visitor.</p>
<p> A stout lady stopped, took a copper coin from her purse and dropped it into
the cap held out to her. He grumbled thanks, glanced sourly at the unheeding
windows, sank his head and swung himself forward four strides.</p>
<p> He halted and growled angrily:
<br><font color="green">{ms, 8}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>For England</u>,</p>
<p> Two barefoot urchins, sucking long liquorice laces, halted near him, gaping
at his stump with their yellow slobbered mouths.</p>
<p> He swung himself forward in vigorous jerks, halted, lifted his head towards a window and bayed deeply.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>home and beauty</u></p>
<p> The gay sweet whistling within went on a bar or two, ceased. The blind of
the window was drawn aside. A plump bare generous arm shone was seen, held forth
from a white petticoatbodice and taut shiftstraps. A woman&apos;s hand flung
forth a coin over the area railings. It fell on the path.</p>
<p> One of the urchins ran to it picked it up and dropped it into the minstrel&apos;s cap, saying:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; There, sir.</p>
<p class="headline">&lowast;&lowast;&lowast;</p>
<p> Katie and Boody Dedalus shoved in the door of the close steaming kitchen.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Did you put in the books? Boody asked.</p>
<p> Maggie at the range rammed down a greyish mass beneath bubbling suds twice with her potstick and wiped her brow.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; They wouldn&apos;t give anything on them, she said.</p>
<p> Father Conmee walked through Clongowes fields, his thinsocked ankles tickled by stubble.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Where did you try? Boody asked.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Magennis&apos;s.</p>
<p> Boody stamped her foot
<br><font color="green">{ms, 9}</font>
<br> and threw her satchel on the table.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Bad cess to her big face! she cried.</p>
<p> Katie went to the range and peered with squinting eyes.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What&apos;s in the pot? she asked.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Shirts, Maggie said.</p>
<p> Boody cried angrily:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Crickey, is there nothing for us to eat?</p>
<p> Katie, lifting the kettlelid in a pad of her stained skirt, asked:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And what&apos;s in this?</p>
<p> A heavy fume gushed in answer.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Peasoup, Maggie said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Where did you get it? Katie asked.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Sister Mary Patrick, Maggie said.</p>
<p> The lacquey rang his bell.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Barang!</p>
<p> Boody sat down at the table and said hungrily:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Give us it here.</p>
<p> Maggie poured yellow thick soup from the kettle into a bowl. Katie, sitting opposite Boody, said quietly:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A good job we have that much. Where&apos;s Dilly?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Gone to meet father, Maggie said.</p>
<p> Boody, breaking big chunks of bread into the yellow soup, added:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Our father who art not in heaven.</p>
<p> Maggie, pouring yellow soup in Katie&apos;s bowl, exclaimed:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Boody! For shame!</p>
<p> A skiff, a crumpled throwaway, Elijah is coming, rode lightly down the
Liffey, under Loopline bridge, sailing eastward past hulls and anchorchains,
between the Customhouse old dock and Georges quay.</p>
<p class="headline">&lowast;&lowast;&lowast;</p>
<p> The blond girl in Thornton&apos;s bedded the wicker basket with rustling
fibre. Blazes Boylan handed her the bottle swathed in pink tissue paper and a small jar.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Put these in first, will you? he sad.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 10}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, sir, the blond girl said, And the fruit on top.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That&apos;ll do, game ball, Blazes Boylan said.</p>
<p> She bestowed fat pears neatly, head by tail, and among them ripe shamefaced peaches.</p>
<p> Blazes Boylan walked here and there in new tan shoes about the fruitsmelling
shop, lifting fruits, sniffing smells.</p>
<p> H.E.L.Y.S filed before him,
tallwhitehatted<a target="foot" id="flz0001">&ordm;</a>, past Tangier lane, plodding towards their goal.</p>
<p> He turned suddenly from a chip of strawberries,
<a name="jn2042b" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2042b">drew a gold watch from
his fob and held it at its chain&apos;s length</a>.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Can you send them by tram? Now?</p>
<p> A darkbacked figure under Merchant&apos;s arch scanned books on the hawker&apos;s cart.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Certainly, sir. Is it in the city?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, yes, Blazes Boylan said &mdash; Ten minutes.</p>
<p> The blond girl handed him a docket and pencil.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Will you write the address, sir?</p>
<p> Blazes Boylan at the counter wrote and pushed the docket to her.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Send it at once, will you? he said. It&apos;s for an invalid.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, sir. I will, sir.</p>
<p> Blazes Boylan rattled merry money in his trousers&apos; pocket.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What&apos;s the damage? he asked.</p>
<p> The blond girl&apos;s slim fingers reckoned the fruits.</p>
<p> Blazes Boylan looked into the cut of her blouse. A young pullet. He took a
red carnation from the tall stemglass.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; This for me? he asked gallantly.</p>
<p> The blond girl glanced sideways up, blushing.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, sir, she said.</p>
<p> Bending archly she reckoned again fat pears and blushing peaches.</p>
<p> Blazes Boylan looked in her blouse with more favour, the stalk of the red flower between his smiling teeth.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; May I say a word to your
<br><font color="green">{ms, 11}</font>
<br> telephone missy,? he asked roguishly.</p>
<p class="headline">&lowast;&lowast;&lowast;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Ma!</u> Almidano Artifoni said.</p>
<p> He gazed over Stephen&apos;s shoulder at Goldsmith&apos;s knobby poll.</p>
<p> Two carfuls of tourists passed slowly, their women sitting fore, gripping
the handrests. Palefaces. Men&apos;s arms frankly round their stunted forms.
They looked from Trinity to the blind columned porch of the bank of Ireland where pigeons roocoocooed.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Anch&apos;io ho avuto di queste idee</u>, Almidano
Artifoni said, <u>quand&apos; ero giovine come Lei. Eppoi mi sono convinto che
il mondo &egrave; una bestia. E peccato. Perche la tua voce&nbsp;&hellip;.
sarebbe un cespite di rendita, via. Invece, Lei si sacrifica.</u></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Sacrifizio incruento</u>, Stephen said smiling.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Speriamo</u>, the round mustachioed face said
pleasantly. <u>Ma, dia: retta a me. Ci rifletta.</u></p>
<p> By the stern stone hand of Grattan, bidding halt, an Inchicore tram unloaded
straggling Highland soldiers of a band.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Ci rifletter&ograve;</u>, Stephen said, glancing down the solid trouserleg.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Ma, sul serio, ueh?</u><a target="foot" id="flz0002">&ordm;</a> Almidano Artifoni said</p>
<p> His heavy hand took Stephen&apos;s firmly. Human eyes. They gazed curiously
an instant and turned quickly towards a Dalkey tram.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Eccolo</u>, Almidano Artifoni said in friendly haste.
<u>Venga a trovarmi e ci pensi. Addio, caro.</u></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Arrivederla, maestro</u>, Stephen said, raising his hat when his hand was freed. E grazie.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Di che? Almidano Artifoni said. Scusi, eh?</p>
<p>
<br><font color="green">{ms, 12}</font>
<br></p>
<p> Almidano Artifoni, holding up a baton of rolled music as a signal, trotted
on stout trousers after the Dalkey tram. In vain he trotted, signalling in vain
among the rout of barekneed gillies smuggling implements of music through Trinity gates.</p>
<p class="headline">&lowast;&lowast;&lowast;</p>
<p> Miss Dunne hid the Capel street library copy of <u>The Woman in White</u>
far back in her drawer and rolled a sheet of gaudy notepaper into her typewriter.</p>
<p> Too much mystery business in it? Is he in love with that one, Marion? Change
it and get another by Mary Cecil Haye.</p>
<p> The disk shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased and ogled them: six.</p>
<p> Miss Dunne clicked on the keyboard:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; 16 June 1904.</p>
<p> Five tallwhitehatted sandwichmen between Monypeny&apos;s corner and the slab
where Wolfe Tone&apos;s statue was not, eeled themselves turning H.E.L.Y.S and plodded back as they had come.</p>
<p> Then she stared at the large poster of Marie Kendal, charming soubrette.
Mustard hair and dauby cheeks. She&apos;s not nicelooking, is she? The way
she&apos;s holding up her bit of a skirt. Wonder will that fellow be at the band
tonight. If I could get that dressmaker to make a concertina skirt like Susy
Nagle&apos;s. They kick out grand. Shannon and all the boatclub swells never
took his eyes off her. Hope to goodness he won&apos;t keep me here till seven.</p>
<p> The telephone rang rudely by her ear.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Hello. Yes, sir. No, sir. Yes, sir. I&apos;ll ring them
up after five. Only those two, sir, for Belfast
<br><font color="green">{ms, 13}</font>
<br> and Liverpool. All right, sir. Then I can go after six if you&apos;re not
back. A quarter after. Yes, sir. Twentyseven and six. I&apos;ll tell him. Ye: one, seven, six.</p>
<p> She scribbled three figures on an envelope.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Mr Boylan! Hello! That gentleman from <u>Sport</u> was in
looking for you, Mr Lenehan, yes. He said he&apos;ll be in the Ormond. No, sir.
Yes, sir. I&apos;ll ring them up after five.</p>
<p class="headline">&lowast;&lowast;&lowast;</p>
<p> Two pink faces turned in the flare of the tiny torch.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Who&apos;s that? Ned Lambert asked. Is that Crotty?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ringabella and Crosshaven, a voice replied groping for foothold.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Hello, Jack, is that yourself? Ned Lambert said, raising
in salute his pliant lath among the flickering arches. Come on. Mind your steps there.</p>
<p> The vesta in the clergyman&apos;s uplifted hand consumed itself in a long
soft flame and was let fall. At their feet its red speck died: and mouldy air closed round them.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; How interesting! a refined accent said in the gloom.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, sir, Ned Lambert said heartily. We are standing in
the historic council chamber of
<a name="un2002c" href="../../ff/unbs/un2all.htm#un2002c">saint Mary&apos;s
abbey</a> where <a name="un2002d" href="../../ff/unbs/un2all.htm#un2002d">silken
Thomas</a> proclaimed himself a rebel. You were never down here before, Jack, were you?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, Ned.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He rode down through Dame walk, the refined accent said,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 14}</font>
<br> if my memory serves me. The mansion of the Kildares was in Thomas court.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That&apos;s right, Ned Lambert said. That&apos;s quite right.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; If you will be so kind then, the clergyman said, the next
time to allow me perhaps&nbsp;&hellip;.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Certainly, Ned Lambert said. Bring the camera whenever
you like. I&apos;ll get those bags cleared away from the windows. You can take it from here or from here.</p>
<p> In the still faint light he moved about, tapping with his lath the piled
seedbags and points of vantage on the floor.</p>
<p> From a long face a beard and gaze hung on a chessboard.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I&apos;m deeply obliged, Mr Lambert, the clergyman said.
I won&apos;t trespass on your valuable time&nbsp;&hellip;.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You&apos;re welcome, sir, Ned Lambert said. Drop in
whenever you like. Next week, say. Can you see?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, yes. Good afternoon, Mr Lambert. Very pleased to have met you.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Pleasure is mine, sir, Ned Lambert answered.</p>
<p> He followed his guest to the outlet and then whirled his lath away among the
pillars. With J.J. O&apos;Molloy he came forth slowly into Mary&apos;s abbey where draymen were loading floats.</p>
<p> He stood to read the card in his hand.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The reverend Hugh C Love, the vicarage, Rathcoffey. Nice
young chap he is. He&apos;s writing a book about the Fitzgeralds he told me. He&apos;s well up in history, faith.</p>
<p> The young woman with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I thought you were at a new gunpowder plot, J.J. O&apos;Molloy said.</p>
<p> Ned Lambert cracked his fingers in the air.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; God! he cried. I forgot to tell him
<br><font color="green">{ms, 15}</font>
<br> that one about the earl of Kildare after he set fire to Cashel cathedral.
You know that one? <u>I&apos;m bloody sorry I did it</u>, says he, <u>but I
declare to God I thought the archbishop was inside.</u> He mightn&apos;t like
it, though. What? God, I&apos;ll tell him anyhow. That was the great earl, the
Fitzgerald Mor. Hot members they were all of them, the Geraldines.</p>
<p> The horses he passed started nervously under their slack harness. He slapped
a piebald haunch quivering near him and cried:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Woa, sonny!</p>
<p> He turned to J.J. O&apos;Molloy and asked:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, Jack. What is it? What&apos;s the trouble? Wait awhile. Hold hard.</p>
<p> With gaping mouth and head far back he stood still and, after an instant, sneezed loudly.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Chow! he said. Blast you!</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The dust from those sacks, J.J. O&apos;Molloy said politely.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, Ned Lambert gasped, I caught a&nbsp;&hellip;. cold
night before&nbsp;&hellip;. blast your soul&nbsp;&hellip; night before
last&nbsp;&hellip; and there was a hell of a lot of draught&nbsp;&hellip;.</p>
<p> He held his handkerchief ready for the coming&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I was&nbsp;&hellip;. Glasnevin this morning&nbsp;&hellip;
poor little&nbsp;&hellip; what do you call him&nbsp;&hellip; Chow!&nbsp;&hellip; Holy Moses!</p>
<p class="headline">&lowast;&lowast;&lowast;</p>
<p> Tom Rochford took the top disk from the pile he clasped against his claret waistcoat.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; See? he said. Say it&apos;s turn six. In here see. Turn Now On.</p>
<p> He slid it into the left slot for them. It shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased, ogling them: six.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 16}</font> </p>
<p> Lawyers of the past, haughty, pleading beheld pass to Nisi Plius court
Richie Goulding carrying the costbag of Goulding Colles and Ward</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; See? he said. See now the last one I put in is over here:
Turns Over. The impact. Leverage, see?</p>
<p> He showed them the rising column of disks on the right.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Smart idea, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling. So a fellow
coming in late can see what turn is on and what turns are over.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; See? Tom Rochford said.</p>
<p> He slid in a disk for himself: and watched it shoot, wobble, ogle, stop: four. Turn Now On.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I&apos;ll see him now in the Ormond, Lenehan said, and
sound him. One good turn deserves another.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do, Tom Rochford said. Tell him I&apos;m Boylan with impatience.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Goodnight, M<sup><small>c</small></sup>Coy said abruptly, when you two begin&nbsp;&hellip;..</p>
<p> Nosey Flynn stooped towards the lever, snuffling at it.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But how does it work here, Tommy? he asked</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Tooraloo, Lenehan said. See you later.</p>
<p> He followed M<sup><small>c</small></sup>Coy out across the tiny square of Crampton court.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He&apos;s a hero, he said simply.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I know, M<sup><small>c</small></sup>Coy said. The drain, you mean.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Drain? Lenehan said. It was down a manhole.</p>
<p> They passed Dan Lowry&apos;s musichall where Marie Kendall, charming
soubrette, smiled on them from a poster a dauby smile.</p>
<p> Going down the path of Sycamore street Lenehan showed
M<sup><small>c</small></sup>Coy how the whole thing was. One of those manholes
like a bloody gaspipe and there was the poor devil stuck down in it, half choked
with sewer gas. Down went Tom Rochford anyhow, booky&apos;s vest and all, with
the rope round him. And be damned but he got the rope round the poor devil and they two were hauled up.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The act of a hero, he said.</p>
<p> At the Dolphin he halted.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; This way, he said, walking to the right. I want to pop in
<br><font color="green">{ms, 17}</font>
<br> Lynam&apos;s to see Sceptre&apos;s starting price. What&apos;s the time by your gold watch and chain?</p>
<p> M<sup><small>c</small></sup>Coy peered into Marcus Tertius Moses sombre
office, then at O&apos;Neill&apos;s clock.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; After three, he said. Who&apos;s riding her?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O Madden, Lenehan said. And a game filly she is.</p>
<p> While he waited in Temple bar M<sup><small>c</small></sup>Coy dodged a
banana peel with gentle pushes of his toe from the path to the gutter. Fellow
might damn easy get a nasty fall there coming along tight in the dark.</p>
<p> The gates of the drive opened wide to give egress to the viceregal cavalcade.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Even money, Lenehan said returning. Bantam Lyons was in
there going to back a bloody horse someone gave him that hasn&apos;t an earthly. Through here</p>
<p> They went up the steps and under Merchants&apos; arch. A darkbacked figure
scanned books on the hawker&apos;s cart.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; There he is, Lenehan said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Wonder what he&apos;s buying, M<sup><small>c</small></sup>Coy said, glancing behind.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Leopoldo or the Bloom is on the Rye, Lenehan said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He&apos;s dead nuts on sales,
M<sup><small>c</small></sup>Coy said. I was with him one day and he bought a
book from an old one in Liffey street for two bob. There were fine plates in it
worth double the money, the stars and the moon and comets with long tails. Astronomy it was about.</p>
<p> Lenehan laughed.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I&apos;ll tell you a damn good one about comet&apos;s tails, he said. Come over in the sun.</p>
<p> They crossed to the metal bridge and went along Wellington quay by the river wall.</p>
<p> Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam came out of Mangan&apos;s late
Fehrenbach&apos;s counter carrying a pound and a half of porksteaks.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; There was a big<a target="foot" id="flz0003">&ordm;</a>
spread out at Glencree reformatory, Lenehan said eagerly. The annual dinner, you
know. The lord mayor was there, Val Dillon it was, and sir Charles Cameron and
Dan Dawson spoke and there was music. Bartell d&apos;Arcy sang and Benjamin Dollard&nbsp;&hellip;..</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I know, M<sup><small>c</small></sup>Coy broke in. My missus sang there once.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Did she? Lenehan said.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 18}</font> </p>
<p> He checked his tale a moment but broke out in a wheezy laugh.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But wait till I tell you, he said, Delahunt of Camden
street had the catering and yours truly was chief bottlewasher. Bloom and the
wife were there. Lashings of stuff we put up: port wine and sherry and curacoa.
Cold joints galore and mince pies&nbsp;&hellip;.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I know, M<sup><small>c</small></sup>Coy said. The year the missus was there&nbsp;&hellip;..</p>
<p> Lenehan linked his arm warmly.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But wait till I tell you, he said. We had a midnight
lunch after it too and when we sallied forth it was blue o&apos;clock in the
morning. Coming home it was a gorgeous winter&apos;s night on the featherbed
mountain. Bloom and Chris Callanan were on one side of the car and I was with
the wife on the other. We started singing glees and duets: <u>Lo, the early beam
of morning</u>. She was well primed with a good load of Delahunt&apos;s port
under her bellyband. Every jolt the bloody car gave I had her bumping up against
me. Hell&apos;s delights! She has a fine pair, God bless her. Like that.</p>
<p> He held his caved hands a cubit from his, frowning:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I was tucking the rug under her and settling her boa all the time. Know what I mean?</p>
<p> His hands moulded ample curves of the air. He shut his eyes tight in
delight, his body shrinking, and blew a sweet chirp from his lips.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The lad stood to attention anyhow, he said with a sigh.
She&apos;s a gamey mare and no mistake. Bloom was pointing out all the stars and
the comets in the heavens to Chris Callanan and the jarvey: the Great bear and
Hercules and the dragon<a target="foot" id="flz0004">&ordm;</a> and the whole
jingbang lot. But, by God, I was lost, so to speak, in the milky way. He knew
them all, faith. At last she spotted a weeny one miles away. <u>And what star is
that, Poldy?</u> says she. By God, she had Bloom cornered. <u>That one, is it?</u> says
<br><font color="green">{ms, 19}</font>
<br> Chris Callanan, <u>sure that&apos;s only what you might call a
pinprick.</u> By God, he wasn&apos;t far wide of the mark.</p>
<p> Lenehan stopped and leaned on the riverwall, panting with soft laughter.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I&apos;m weak, he gasped.</p>
<p> M<sup><small>c</small></sup>Coy&apos;s white face smiled about it at
instants and grew grave. Lenehan walked on again. He lifted his yachtingcap and
scratched his hindhead rapidly. He glanced sideways in the sunlight at M<sup><small>c</small></sup>Coy.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He&apos;s a cultured chap, Bloom is, he said seriously.
He&apos;s not one of your common or garden&nbsp;&hellip; you know&nbsp;&hellip;
There&apos;s a touch of the artist about Bloom.</p>
<p class="headline">&lowast;&lowast;&lowast;</p>
<p> Mr Bloom turned over idly pages of <u>Maria Monk</u>, then of
Aristotle&apos;s <u>Master piece</u>. Crooked botched print. Plates: infants
cuddled in a ball in bloodred wombs like livers of slaughtered cows. Lots of
them like that at this moment all over the world. All butting with their skulls
to get out of it. Child born every minute somewhere. Mrs Purefoy.</p>
<p> He laid both books aside and glanced at the third: <u>Tales of the Ghetto</u> by Sacher Masoch.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That I had, he said, pushing it by.</p>
<p> The shopman let two volumes fall on the counter.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Them are two good ones, he said.</p>
<p> Onions of his breath came across the counter out of his ruined mouth. He
bent to make a bundle of the other books, hugged them against his unbuttoned
waistcoat and bore them off behind the dingy curtain.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom, alone, looked at the titles. <u>Fair Tyrants</u> by James
<br><font color="green">{ms, 20}</font>
<br> Lovebirch. Know the kind that is.</p>
<p> He opened it. Thought so.</p>
<p> A woman&apos;s voice behind the dingy curtain. Listen: the man</p>
<p> No: she wouldn&apos;t like that much. Got her one once.</p>
<p> He read the other title: <u>Sweets of Sin</u>. More in her line. Let us see.</p>
<p> He read where his finger opened.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; All the dollarbills her husband gave her were spent in
the stores on wondrous gowns and costliest frillies. For him! For Raoul!</p>
<p> Yes. This. Here. Try.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Her mouth glued on his in a luscious voluptuous kiss
while his hands felt for the opulent curves inside her deshabille.</p>
<p> Yes. Take this. The end.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You are late, he spoke hoarsely, eyeing her with a suspicious glare.</p>
<p> The beautiful woman threw off her sabletrimmed wrap, displaying her queenly
shoulders and heaving embonpoint. An imperceptible smile played round her perfect lips as she turned to him calmly.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom read again: The beautiful woman&nbsp;&hellip;.</p>
<p> Warmth showered gently over him, cowing his flesh. Flesh yielded amply amid
rumpled clothes: whites of eyes swooning up. His nostrils arched themselves for
prey. Melting breast ointments (for him! for Raoul!). Armpits&apos; oniony
sweat. Fishgluey slime. (her heaving embonpoint!) Feel! Press! Chrished! Sulphur dung of lions!</p>
<p> Young! Young!</p>
<p> Phlegmy coughs shook the air of the bookshop, bulging out the dingy
curtains. The shopman&apos;s uncombed grey head came out and his unshaven
reddened face, coughing. He raked his throat rudely, puked phlegm on the floor.
He put his boot on what he had spat, wiping his sole along it, and bent, showing a rawskinned crown, scantily haired.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 21}</font> </p>
<p> Mr Bloom beheld it.</p>
<p> Mastering his troubled breath, he said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I&apos;ll take this one.</p>
<p> The shopman lifted eyes bleared with old rheum.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Sweets of Sin</u>, he said, tapping on it. That&apos;s a good one.</p>
<p class="headline">&lowast;&lowast;&lowast;</p>
<p> The lacquey by the door of Dillon&apos;s auctionrooms shook his handbell
twice again and viewed himself in the chalked mirror of the cabinet.</p>
<p> Dilly Dedalus, loitering by the curbstone, heard the beats of the bells, the
cries of the auctioneer within. Four and nine. Those lovely curtains. Five
shillings. Cosy curtains. Selling new at two guineas. Any advance on five shillings? Going for five shillings.</p>
<p> The lacquey lifted his handbell and shook it:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Barang!</p>
<p> Bang of the lastlap bell spurred the halfmile wheelmen to their sprint. J.A.
Jackson, W.E. Wylie, A. Munro and H.T. Gahan, their stretched necks wagging
negotiated the curve by the College library.</p>
<p> Mr Dedalus, tugging a long moustache, came round from William&apos;s row. He halted near his daughter.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It&apos;s time for you, she said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Stand up straight for the love of the lord Jesus, Mr
Dedalus said. Are you trying to imitate your uncle John, the cornetplayer, head upon shoulder?</p>
<p> Dilly shrugged her shoulders. Mr Dedalus placed his hands on them and held them back.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Stand up straight, girl, he said. You&apos;ll get
curvature of the spine. Do you know what you look like?</p>
<p> He let his head sink suddenly down and forward, hunching his shoulders and dropping his underjaw.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Give it up, father, Dilly said. All the people are looking at you.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 22}</font> </p>
<p> Mr Dedalus drew himself upright and tugged again at his moustache.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Did you get any money? Dilly asked.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Where would I get money? Mr Dedalus said. There is no-one in Dublin would lend me fourpence.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You got some, Dilly said, looking in his eyes.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; How do you know that? Mr Dedalus asked, his tongue in his cheek.</p>
<p> Mr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked, walked boldly along Thomas street.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I know you did, Dilly answered. Were you in the Scotch house now?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I was not, then, Mr Dedalus said, smiling. Was it the
little nuns taught you to be so saucy? Here.</p>
<p> He handed her a shilling.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; See if you can do anything with that, he said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I suppose you got five, Dilly said. Give me more than that.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Wait awhile, Mr Dedalus said threateningly. You&apos;re
like the rest of them, are you? An insolent pack of little bitches since your
poor mother died. But wait awhile. You&apos;ll all get a short shrift and a long day from me.</p>
<p> He left her and walked on. Dilly followed quickly and pulled his coat.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, what is it? he said, stopping.</p>
<p> The lacquey rang his bell behind their backs.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Barang!</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Curse your bloody blatant soul, Mr Dedalus cried, turning on him.</p>
<p> The lacquey, aware of comment, shook the lolling clapper of his bell: but feebly:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Bang!</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You got more than that, father, Dilly said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I&apos;m going to show you a little trick, Mr Dedalus
said. I&apos;ll leave you all where Jesus left the jews. Look, there&apos;s all I have. I got two shillings
<br><font color="green">{ms, 23}</font>
<br> from Jack Power and I spent twopence for a shave for the funeral.</p>
<p> He drew forth a handful of copper coins, nervously:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Can&apos;t you look for some money somewhere? Dilly said.</p>
<p> Mr Dedalus thought and nodded.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I will, he said gravely. I looked all along the gutter in
O&apos;Connell street. I&apos;ll try this one now.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You&apos;re very funny, Dilly said, grinning.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Here, Mr Dedalus said, handing her two pennies. Get a
glass of milk for yourself and a bun or a something. I&apos;ll be home shortly.</p>
<p> He put the other coins in his pocket and started to walk on.</p>
<p> The viceregal cavalcade passed, greeted by obsequious policemen, out of parkgate.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I&apos;m sure you have another shilling, Dilly said.</p>
<p> The lacquey banged loudly.</p>
<p> Mr Dedalus amid the din walked off, murmuring to himself with a pursing mincing mouth gently:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The little nuns! Nice little things! O, sure they
wouldn&apos;t do anything! O, sure they wouldn&apos;t really! Is it little sister Monica!</p>
<p class="headline">&lowast;&lowast;&lowast;</p>
<p> From the sundial towards James&apos;s gate walked Mr Kernan, pleased with
the order he had booked for Pulbrook Robertson, boldly along James&apos;s
street. Got round him all right. How do you do, Mr Crimmins? First rate, sir.
How are things going? Just keeping alive. Lovely weather we&apos;re having. Yes,
indeed. Good for the country. I&apos;ll just take a thimbleful of your best gin,
Mr Crimmins. A small gin, sir. Yes, sir. Terrible affair that
<a name="un2007b" href="../../ff/unbs/un2all.htm#un2007b"><u>General

<a name="un2007g" href="../../ff/unbs/un2all.htm#un2007g">how the inspectors
ever allowed a boat like that&nbsp;&hellip;.</a> Now, you&apos;re talking
straight, Mr Crimmins. You know why?
<a name="jn1039l" href="../../ff/unbs/jn1all.htm#jn1039l">Palm oil</a>. Is that
a fact? Without a doubt. Well now, look at that. And America they say is the
land of the free. I thought we were bad here.</p>
<p> I smiled at him. America, I said quietly, just like that. What is it? The
sweepings of every country including our own. Isn&apos;t that true? That&apos;s a fact.</p>
<p> Graft, my dear sir. Well, of course, where&apos;s there&apos;s money going
there&apos;s always someone to pick it up.</p>
<p> Saw him looking at my frockcoat. Dress does it. Nothing like a dressy appearance. Bowls them over.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered.</p>
<p> Mr Kernan halted and preened himself before the sloping mirror of Peter
Kennedy, hairdresser<a target="foot" id="flz0005">&ordm;</a>. Stylish coat, you
know. Scott of Dawson street. Well worth the half sovereign I gave Neary for it.
Never built under three guineas. Fits me down to the ground. Some Kildare street club toff had it probably.</p>
<p> Aham! Must dress the character for those fellows. Gentleman. And now, Mr
Crimmins, may we have the honour of your custom again, sir. The cup that cheers
but not inebriates, as the old saying has it.</p>
<p></p>
<p> North wall and sir John Rogerson&apos;s quay, with hulls and anchor chains,
sailing westward, sailed by a skiff, a crumpled throwaway, rocked on the ferrywash, Elijah is coming.</p>
<p> Mr Kernan glanced in farewell at his image. High
<br><font color="green">{ms, 25}</font>
<br> colour, of course. Grizzled moustache. Returned Indian officer. Bravely he
bore his stumpy body forward on spatted feet, squaring his shoulders.</p>
<p> Aham! Hot spirit of juniper juice warmed his vitals and his breath. Good
drop of gin, that was. His frock&apos;s tails winked in bright sunshine to his fat strut.</p>
<p> Down there Emmet was hanged, drawn and quartered. Greasy black rope. Dogs
licking the blood off the street when the lord lieutenant&apos;s wife drove by in her noddy.</p>
<p> Bad times those were. Well, well. Over and done with. Great topers too. Fourbottle men.</p>
<p> Let me see. Is he buried in saint Michan&apos;s? or no there was a midnight
burial in Glasnevin. Corpse brought in through a secret door in the wall. Dignam
is there now. Went out in a puff. Well, well. Better turn down here.</p>
<p> Mr Kernan turned and walked down the slope of Watling street. Denis Breen
with his tomes, weary of having waited an hour in John Henry Menton&apos;s
office, led his wife over O&apos;Connell bridge, bound for the office of Messrs Collis and Ward.</p>
<p> Times of the troubles. Must ask Ned Lambert to lend me those reminiscences
of sir Jonah Barrington. When you look back on it all now in a kind of
retrospective arrangement. Gaming at Daly&apos;s. No cardsharping then. One of
those fellows got his hand nailed to the table by a dagger.</p>
<p> Somewhere here lord Edward Fitzgerald escaped from major Sirr. Island street. Stables behind Moira house.</p>
<p> Damn good gin that was.</p>
<p> Fine dashing young nobleman. Good stock, of course. That ruffian, that sham
squire, with his violet gloves gave him away. Course they were on the wrong
side. They rose in dark and evil days. Fine poem that is: Ingram. They were
gentlemen. Ben Dollard does sing that ballad touchingly. Masterly rendition.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 26}</font> </p>
<p> <u>At the siege of Ross did my father fall</u></p>
<p> A cavalcade in easy trot along Pembroke quay passed, outriders leaping
gracefully in their saddles. Frockcoats. Cream sunshades.</p>
<p> Mr Kernan hurried forward, blowing pursily.</p>
<p> His Excellency! Too bad! Just missed that by a hair. Damn it! What a pity!</p>
<p class="headline">&lowast;&lowast;&lowast;</p>
<p> Stephen Dedalus watched through the webbed window the lapidary&apos;s
fingers prove a timedulled chain. Dust webbed the window, dust darkened the
toiling fingers with their vulture nails. Dust slept on dull coils of bronze and
silver, lozenges of cinnabar, on rubies, leprous and winedark stones.</p>
<p> Born all in the dark wormy earth, cold specks of fire, evil, lights shining
in the darkness. Muddy swinesnouts, hands, root and root, gripe and wrest them.</p>
<p> She dances in a foul gloom where gum burns with garlic. A sailorman,
rustbearded sips from a beaker rum and eyes her. A long and seafed silent rut.
She dances, capers, wagging her sowish haunches and her hips, on her gross belly flapping a ruby egg.</p>
<p> Old Russell with a smeared shamy rag burnished again his gem, turned it and
held it at the point of his Moses&apos; beard. Grandfather ape gloating on a stolen hoard.</p>

<p> Two old women from their whiff of the briny trudged through Irishtown along
London bridge road, one with a sanded tired umbrella, one with a midwife&apos;s bag in which eleven cockles rolled.</p>
<p> The whirr of flapping leathern bands and hum of dynamos from the powerhouse
urged Stephen to be on. Beingless beings. Stop! Throb always without you and the
throb always within. Your heart you sing of. I between them. Where? Between two
roaring worlds I where they swirl. Shatter them, one and both. But stun myself

<p> Yes, quite true. Very large and wonderful and keeps famous time. You say
right, sir. A Monday morning. Twas so, indeed.</p>
<p> Stephen went down Bedford row. In Clohisey&apos;s window a faded print of
<a name="un2013f" href="../../ff/unbs/un2all.htm#un2013f">Heenan boxing
Sayers</a> held his eye. Staring backers with square hats stood round the
ropering. The heavyweights in tight
loincloths<a target="foot" id="flz0006">&ordm;</a> proposed gently each to other
his bulbous fists. And they are throbbing: heros&apos; hearts.</p>
<p> He turned and halted by the slanted bookcart.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Twopence each, the huckster said. Four for sixpence.</p>
<p> Tattered pages. <u>The Irish Beekeeper</u>. <u>Life and Miracles of the
Cur&eacute; of Ars</u>. <u>Pocket Guide to Killarney</u>.</p>
<p> I might find here one of my pawned schoolprizes. <u>Stephano Dedalo, alumno optimo, palmam ferenti.</u></p>
<p> Father Conmee having read his little hours walked through the hamlet of Donnycarney, murmuring vespers.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 28}</font> </p>
<p> Binding too good probably. What is this? Eighth and ninth book of Moses,
secret of all secrets. Seal of King David. Thumbed pages: read and read. Who has
passed here before me? How to soften chapped hands. Recipe for white wine
vinegar. How to win a woman&apos;s love. For me this. Say the following talisman three times with hands folded:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Se el yilo nebrakada femininum! Amor me solo! Sanktus! Amen.</u></p>
<p> Who wrote this? Charms and invocations of the most blessed abbot Peter
Salanka to all true believers divulged. As good as any other abbot&apos;s
charms, as mumbling Joachim&apos;s. Down, baldynoddle, or we&apos;ll wool your wool.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What are you doing here, Stephen?</p>
<p> Dilly&apos;s high shoulders and shabby dress.</p>
<p> Shut the book quick. Don&apos;t let see.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What are you doing? Stephen said.</p>
<p> A Stuart face of nonesuch Charles, lank locks falling at its sides. It
glowed as she crouched feeding the fire with broken boots. I told her of Paris.
Late lie abed under a quilt of old overcoats, fingering a pinchbeck bracelet,
Dan Kelly&apos;s token. <u>Nebrakada femininum.</u></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What have you there? Stephen asked</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I bought it from the other cart for a penny, Dilly said, laughing nervously. Is it any good?</p>
<p> My eyes they say she has. Do others see me so? Quick, far and daring. Shadow of my mind.</p>
<p> He took the coverless book from her hand. Bu&eacute;&apos;s French primer.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What did you buy that for? he asked. To learn French?</p>
<p> She nodded, reddening and closing tight her lips.</p>
<p> Show no surprise. Quite natural.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Here, Stephen said. It&apos;s all right. Mind Maggie
doesn&apos;t pawn it on you. I suppose all my books are gone.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 29}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Some, Dilly said. We had to.</p>
<p> She is drowning. Save her. All against us. She will drown me with her, eyes
and hair. Lank coils of seaweed hair around me, my heart, my soul. Salt green death.</p>
<p> We.</p>
<p> Misery! Misery!</p>
<p class="headline">&lowast;&lowast;&lowast;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.</p>
<p> They clasped handed loudly outside Reddy and Daughter&apos;s. Father Cowley
brushed his moustache often downward with a scooping hand.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What&apos;s the best news? Mr Dedalus said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Why then not much, Father Cowley said. I&apos;m
barricaded up, Simon, with two men prowling around the house trying to effect an entrance.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Jolly, Mr Dedalus said. Who is it?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, Father Cowley said. A certain gombeen man of our acquaintance.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; With a broken back, is it? Mr Dedalus asked.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The same, Simon, Father Cowley answered. Reuben of that
ilk. I&apos;m just waiting for Ben Dollard. He&apos;s going to say a word to
long John to get him to take those two men off. All I want is a little time.</p>
<p> He looked with vague hope up and down the quay, a big apple bulging in his neck.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I know, Mr Dedalus said, nodding. Poor old bockedy Ben!
He&apos;s always doing a good turn for someone. Hold hard!</p>
<p> He put on his glasses and gazed towards the metal bridge an instant.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 30}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Here he is, by God, he said, arse and pockets.</p>
<p> Ben Dollard&apos;s loose blue cutaway and square hat above large slops
crossed the quay in full gait from the metal bridge. He came towards them at an
amble, scratching actively behind his coattails.</p>
<p> As he came near Mr Dedalus greeted:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Hold that fellow with the bad trousers.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Hold him now, Ben Dollard said.</p>
<p> He stood beside them beaming, on them first and on his roomy clothes from
points of which Mr Dedalus flicked fluff, saying:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; They were made for a man in his health.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Bad luck to the jewman that made them, Ben Dollard said.
Thanks be to God he&apos;s not paid yet.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And how is that <u>basso profondo</u>, Benjamin, Father Cowley asked.</p>
<p> Cashel Boyle O&apos;Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, murmuring,
glassyeyed strode past the Kildare street club.</p>
<p> Ben Dollard frowned and, making suddenly a chanter&apos;s mouth, gave forth a deep note.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Aw! he said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That&apos;s the style, Mr Dedalus said, nodding to its drone.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What about that? Ben Dollard said. Not too dusty? What?</p>
<p> He turned to both.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That&apos;ll do, Father Cowley said, nodding also.</p>
<p> The reverend Hugh. C. Love walked from the old chapterhouse of saint
Mary&apos;s abbey past James and Charles Kennedy, rectifiers, attended by
Geraldines tall and personable towards the Tholesell beyond ford of hurdles.</p>
<p> Ben Dollard with a heavy list towards the shopfronts led them forward, his joyful fingers in the air.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Come along with me to the subsheriff&apos;s office, he
said. I saw John Henry Menton in the Bodega. We&apos;re on the right lay, Bob, believe you me.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; For a few days tell him, Father Cowley said anxiously.</p>
<p> Ben Dollard halted and stared, his loud orifice open.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What few days? he boomed.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 31}</font>
<br> Hasn&apos;t your landlord distrained for rent.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He has, Father Cowley said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Then our friend&apos;s writ is not worth the paper
it&apos;s printed on, Ben Dollard said. The landlord has the prior claim.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Are you sure of that?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You can tell Barabbas from me, Ben Dollard said, that he
can put that writ where Jacko put the nuts.</p>
<p> He led Father Cowley boldly forward, linked to his bulk.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Filberts I believe they were, Mr Dedalus said, as he
dropped his glasses on his coatfront, following them.</p>

<p class="pdi">&mdash; The<a target="foot" id="flz0007">&ordm;</a> youngster
will be all right, Martin Cunningham said, as they passed out of the Castle Yard gate.</p>
<p> The policeman touched his forehead.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; God bless you, Martin Cunningham said, cheerily.</p>
<p> He signed to the waiting jarvey who chucked at the reins and set on towards Lord Edward Street.</p>
<p> Bronze by gold, Miss Kennedy&apos;s head with Miss Douce&apos;s head,
appeared above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, Martin Cunningham said. I wrote to Father Conmee and laid the whole case before him.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You could try our friend, Mr Power suggested backward.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Boyd? Martin Cunningham said shortly. Touch me not.</p>
<p> John Wyse Nolan, lagging behind, reading the list, came after them quickly down Cork Hill.</p>
<p> On the steps of the City Hall Councillor Nannetti descending, hailed Alderman Cowley and Councillor
<br><font color="green">{ms, 33}</font>
<br> Abraham Lyon ascending.</p>
<p> The castle car wheeled empty into Upper Exchange Street.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Look here Martin, John Wyse Nolan said, overtaking them
at the Mail office. I see Bloom put his name down for five shillings.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Quite right, Martin Cunningham said, taking the list. And put down the five shillings too.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Without a second word either, Mr Power said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Strange but true, Martin Cunningham added.</p>
<p> John Wyse Nolan opened wide eyes.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I&apos;ll say there is much kindness in the Jew, he quoted, elegantly.</p>
<p> They went down Parliament Street.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; There&apos;s Jimmy Henry, Mr Power said, just heading for Kavanagh&apos;s.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Righto, Martin Cunningham said. Here goes.</p>
<p> Outside la Maison Claire Blazes Boylan waylaid Jack Mooney&apos;s
brother-in-law, humpy, tight, making for the liberties.</p>
<p> John Wyse Nolan fell back with Mr Power, while Martin Cunningham took the
elbow of a little man in a shower of hail suit, who walked uncertainly, with
hasty steps, past Micky Anderson&apos;s watches.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 34}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The assistant town clerk&apos;s corns are giving him some
trouble, John Wyse Nolan told Mr Power.</p>
<p> They followed round the corner towards James Kavanagh&apos;s winerooms. The
empty castle car fronted them at rest in Essex gate. Martin Cunningham, speaking
always, showed often the list at which Jimmy Henry did not glance.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And long John Fanning is here too, John Wyse Nolan said, as large as life.</p>
<p> The tall form of long John Fanning filled the doorway where he stood.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Good day, Mr Sheriff, Martin Cunningham said, as all halted and greeted.</p>
<p> Long John Fanning made no way for them. He removed his large Henry Clay
decisively, and his large fierce eyes scowled intelligently over all their faces.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Are the conscript fathers pursuing their peaceful
deliberations? he said, with rich acrid utterance, to the assistant town clerk.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Hell open to Christians they were having, Jimmy Henry
said pettishly, about their damned Irish language. Where was the marshal, he wanted to know
<br><font color="green">{ms, 35}</font>
<br> to keep order in the council chamber. And old Barlow the macebearer laid up
with asthma and Harrington in Llandudno and little Lorcan Sherlock doing locum
tenens for him. Damned Irish language, language of our forefathers.</p>
<p> Long John Fanning blew a plume of smoke from his lips.</p>
<p> Martin Cunningham spoke by turns to the assistant town clerk and the
subsheriff, while John Wyse Nolan held his peace.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What Dignam was that? Long John Fanning asked.</p>
<p> Jimmy Henry made a grimace and lifted his left foot.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, my corns! he said plaintively. Come upstairs for
goodness' sake till I sit down somewhere. Uff! Ooo! Mind!</p>
<p> Testily he made room for himself beside long John Fanning&apos;s flank and passed in and up the stairs.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Come on up, Martin Cunningham said to the subsheriff. I
don&apos;t think you knew him, or perhaps you did though.</p>
<p> With John Wyse Nolan, Mr Power followed them in.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Decent little soul he was, Mr Power said to the stalwart
back of Long John Fanning, ascending towards Long John Fanning in the mirror.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Rather lowsized. Dignam of Menton&apos;s office that was, Martin Cunningham said.</p>
<p> Long John Fanning could not remember him.</p>
<p> Clatter of horsehoofs sounded from the air.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What&apos;s that? Martin Cunningham said.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 36}</font> </p>
<p> All turned where they stood; John
wyce<a target="foot" id="flz0008">&ordm;</a> Nolan came down again. From the
cool shadow of the doorway he saw the horses pass Parliament Street, harness and
glossy pastens in sunlight shimmering. Gaily they went past before his cool unfriendly eyes, not quickly.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What was it? Martin Cunningham asked, as they went on up the staircase.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of
Ireland, John Wyse Nolan answered from the stairfoot.</p>
<p class="headline">&lowast;&lowast;&lowast;</p>
<p> As they trod across the thick carpet Buck Mulligan whispered behind his hat to Haines.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Parnell&apos;s brother. There in the corner.</p>
<p> They chose a small table near the window, opposite a longfaced man whose
beard and gaze hung intently down on a chessboard.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is that he? Haines asked, twisting round in his seat.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, Mulligan said. That&apos;s John Howard, his brother, our city marshal.</p>
<p> John Howard Parnell translated a white bishop quietly, and his grey claw went
<br><font color="green">{ms, 37}</font>
<br> up again to his forehead whereat it rested.</p>
<p> An instant after, under its screen, his eyes looked quickly, ghostbright, at
his foe and fell once more upon a working corner.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I&apos;ll take a m&eacute;lange, Haines said to the waitress.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Two m&eacute;langes, Buck Mulligan said. And bring us
some scones and butter, and some cakes as well.</p>
<p> When she had gone he said, laughing:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; We call it
<a name="un1015f" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1015f">D.B.C. because they
have damn bad cakes</a>. O, but you missed Dedalus on <u>Hamlet</u>.</p>
<p> Haines opened his newbought book.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I&apos;m sorry, he said. Shakespeare is the happy hunting
ground of all minds that have lost their balance.</p>
<p> The onelegged sailor growled at the area of 17 Nelson street:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; England expects.</p>
<p> Buck Mulligan&apos;s primrose waistcoat shook gaily to his laughter.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You should see him, he said, when his body loses its balance. Wandering Aengus I call him.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I am sure he has an <u>id&eacute;e fixe</u>, Haines said,
pinching his chin thoughtfully with thumb and forefinger. Now I am speculating
what it would be likely to be. Such persons always have.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 38}</font> </p>
<p> Buck Mulligan bent across the table gravely.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; They drove his wits astray, he said, by visions of hell.
He will never capture the attic note. The note of Swinburne, of all poets, the
white death and the ruddy birth. That is his tragedy. He can never be a poet. The joy of creation&nbsp;&hellip;.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Eternal punishment, Haines said, nodding curtly. I see. I
tackled him this morning on belief. There was something on his mind, I saw.
It&apos;s rather interesting because
<a name="un1016n" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1016n">Professor Pokorny of
Vienna</a> makes an interesting point out of that.</p>
<p> Buck Mulligan&apos;s watchful eyes saw the waitress come. He helped her to unload her tray.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;
<a name="un1016n" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1016n">He can find no trace
of hell in ancient Irish myth</a>, Haines said, amid the cheerful cups. The
moral idea seems lacking, the sense of destiny, of retribution. Rather strange
he should have just that fixed idea. Does he write anything for your movement?</p>
<p> He sank two lumps of sugar deftly longwise through the whipped cream. Buck
Mulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered butter over its smoking pith. He bit off a soft piece hungrily.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ten years, he said, chewing and laughing. He is going to
write something in ten years<a target="foot" id="flz0009">&ordm;</a>
<br><font color="green">{ms, 39}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Seems a long way off, Haines said, thoughtfully lifting
his spoon. Still, I shouldn&apos;t wonder if he did, after all.</p>
<p> He tasted a spoonful from the creamy cone of his cup.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; This is real Irish cream I take it, he said, with
forbearance. I don&apos;t want to be imposed on.</p>
<p> Elijah, skiff, light crumpled throwaway, sailed Eastward by flanks of ships

<p> Almidano Artifoni walked past Holles Street, past Sewell&apos;s yard. Behind
him Cashel Boyle O&apos;Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell with
stickumbrelladustcoat<a target="foot" id="flz0010">&ordm;</a> dangling, shunned
the lamp before Wilde&apos;s house and walked along Merrion Square. Distantly
behind him, a blind stripling tapped his way by the wall of College Park.</p>
<p> Cashel Boyle O&apos;Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell walked as far as Mr
Lewis Werner&apos;s cheerful windows, then turned and strode back along Merrion
Square, his stickumbrelladustcoat dangling.</p>
<p> At the corner of Wilde&apos;s house he halted, frowned at Elijah&apos;s name
announced on the Metropolitan Hall, frowned at the distant pleasance of
duke&apos;s lawn. His eyeglass flashed frowning in the sun.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 40}</font>
<br> With ratsteeth bared he muttered:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Coactus volui</u></p>
<p> He strode on for Clare Street, grinding his fierce word.</p>
<p> As he strode past Mr Bloom&apos;s dental windows the sway of his dustcoat
brushed rudely from its angle a slender tapping cane and swept onwards, having
buffeted a thewless body. The blind stripling turned his sickly face after the
striding form<a target="foot" id="flz0011">&ordm;</a></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; God&apos;s curse on you, he said, sourly, whoever you
are! You&apos;re blinder nor I am, you bitch&apos;s bastard!</p>
<p class="headline">&lowast;&lowast;&lowast;</p>
<p> Opposite Ruggy O&apos;Donohoe&apos;s Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam, pawing
the pound and a half of Mangan&apos;s, late Fehrenbach&apos;s, porksteaks he had
been sent for, went along warm Wicklow Street, dawdling. It was too blooming
dull, sitting in the parlour with Mrs Stoer and Mrs Quigly and ma and the blind
down and they all at their sniffles and sipping sups of the superior old sherry
uncle Barney brought from Tunney&apos;s. And they eating crumbs of the cottage
fruitcake, jawing the whole blooming time and sighing. After Wicklow lane the
window of Madame Doyle court dress<a target="foot" id="flz0012">&ordm;</a> milliner stopped him.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 41}</font>
<br> He stood looking in at the two puckers stripped to their pelts and putting
up their props. From the sidemirrors two mourning Masters Dignam gaped silently.
Myler Keogh, Dublin&apos;s pet lamb, will meet Sergeantmajor Bennett, the
Portobello bruiser, for a purse of twelve sovereigns. Gob, that&apos;d be a good
pucking match to see. Myler Keogh, that&apos;s the chap sparring out to him with
the green sash. Two bar entrance, soldiers half price. I could easy do a bunk on
ma. Master Dignam on his left turned as he turned. That&apos;s me in mourning.
When is it? May the twentysecond. Sure, the blooming thing is all over. He
turned to the right and on his right Master Dignam turned, his cap awry, his
collar sticking up. Buttoning it down, his chin lifted, he saw the image of
Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, beside the two puckers. One of them mots that
do be in the packets of fags Stoer smokes that his old fellow welted hell out of him for one time he found out.</p>
<p> Master Dignam got his collar down and dawdled on. The best pucker going for
strength was Fitzsimons. One puck in the wind from that fellow would knock you into the middle of next week, man.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 42}</font>
<br> But the best pucker for science was Jem Corbet before Fitzsimons knocked
the stuffings out of him, dodging and all.</p>
<p> In Grafton Street Master Dignam saw a red flower in a toff&apos;s mouth and
a swell pair of kicks on him and he listening to what the drunk was telling him and grinning all the time.</p>
<p> No Sandymount tram.</p>
<p> Master Dignam walked along Nassau Street, shifted the porksteaks to his
other hand. His collar sprang up again and he tugged it down. The blooming stud
was too small for the buttonhole of the shirt, blooming end to it. He met
schoolboys with satchels. I&apos;m not going tomorrow either, stay away till
Monday. He met other schoolboys. Do they notice I&apos;m in mourning? Uncle
Barney said he&apos;d get it into the paper tonight. Then they&apos;ll all see
it in the paper and read my name printed, and pa&apos;s name.</p>
<p> His face got all grey instead of being red like it was and there was a fly
walking over it up to his eye. The scrunch that was when they were screwing the
screws into the coffin: and the bumps when they were bringing it downstairs.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 43}</font> </p>
<p> Pa was inside it and ma crying in the parlour and uncle Barney telling the
men how to get it round the bend. A big coffin it was, and high and
heavylooking. How was that? The last night pa was boosed he was standing on the
landing there bawling out for his boots to go out to Tunney&apos;s for to boose
more and he looked butty and short in his shirt. Never see him again. Death,
that is. Pa is dead. My father is dead. He told me to be a good son to ma. I
couldn&apos;t hear the other things he said but I saw his tongue and his teeth
trying to say it better. Poor pa. That was Mr Dignam, my father. I hope
he&apos;s in purgatory now because he went to confession to father Conroy on Saturday night.</p>
<p class="headline">&lowast;&lowast;&lowast;</p>
<p> William Humble, earl of Dudley; and Lady Dudley, accompanied by
lieutenant-colonel Haseltine, drove out after luncheon from the viceregal lodge. In the following
<br><font color="green">{ms, 44}</font>
<br> carriage were the honourable Mrs Paget, Miss de Courcy and the honourable Gerald Ward A.D.C. in attendance.</p>
<p> The cavalcade passed out by the lower gate of Phoenix Park saluted by
obsequious policemen and proceeded along the northern quays. The viceroy was
most cordially greeted on his way through the metropolis. At bloody bridge Mr
Thomas Kernan, beyond the river greeted him vainly from afar. In the porch of
four courts Richie Goulding with the costsbag of Goulding Colles and Ward saw
him with surprise. From<a target="foot" id="flz0013">&ordm;</a> its sluice in
Wood quay wall under Tom Devon&apos;s office Poddle river hung out in fealty a
tongue of liquid sewage. Above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel, bronze by
gold, Miss Kennedy&apos;s head by Miss Douce&apos;s head watched and admired. On
Ormond Quay Mr Simon Dedalus, on his way from the greenhouse to the
subsheriff&apos;s office, stood still in midstreet and brought his hat low. His
Excellency graciously returned Mr Dedalus&apos; greeting. From Cahill&apos;s
corner the reverend Hugh C. Love made obeisance unperceived, mindful of lords
deputies whose hands benignant had held of yore rich advowsons. On Grattan
bridge Lenehan and M<sup><small>c</small></sup>Coy, taking leave
<br><font color="green">{ms, 45}</font>
<br> of each other, watched the carriage go by. From the shaded door of
Kavanagh&apos;s winerooms John Wyse Nolan smiled with unseen coldness towards
the lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland. Over against Dame
Gate Tom Rochford and Nosey Flynn watched the approach of the cavalcade. Tom
Rochford, seeing the eyes of lady Dudley fixed on him, took his thumbs quickly
out of the pockets of his claret waistcoat and doffed his cap to her.
A<a target="foot" id="flz0014">&ordm;</a> charming <u>soubrette</u>, great Marie
Kendall, with dauby cheeks and lifted skirt, smiled daubily from her poster upon
William Humble, earl of Dudley, and upon lieutenant colonel H.&nbsp;G.
Hesseltine, and also upon the honourable
<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font>
Ward
<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font>
From the window of the D.B.C. Buck Mulligan gaily, and Haines gravely, gazed
down on the viceregal carriages over the shoulders of eager guests, whose mass
of forms darkened the chessboard whereon John Howard Parnell looked intently.
<br> In Fownes&apos;s street, Dilly Dedalus, straining upward from
Bu&eacute;&apos;s first french primer, saw sunshades spanned and wheelspokes
spinning in the glare. John Henry Menton, filling the doorway of Commercial
Buildings, stared from winebig oyster eyes. Where the foreleg of King
Billy&apos;s pawed the air Mrs Breen plucked her hastening husband back from
under the hoofs of the outriders. She shouted in his ear
<br><font color="green">{ms, 46}</font>
<br> the tidings. Understanding, he shifted his tomes to his left breast and
saluted the second carriage. The honourable Gerald Ward A.D.C., agreeably
surprised, made haste to reply. At Ponsonby&apos;s Corner a jaded white flagon
H. halted and four tallhatted white flagons halted behind him, E.L.Y.S. while
outriders pranced past and carriages. By the provost&apos;s wall came jauntily
Blazes Boylan, stepping in tanned shoes and socks with skyblue clocks to the
refrain of <u>My girl&apos;s a Yorkshire girl</u>. Blazes Boylan presented to
the leaders&apos; skyblue frontlets and high action a skyblue tie, a widebrimmed
straw hat at a rakish angle and a suit of indigo serge. His hands in his jacket
pockets forgot to salute but he offered to the three ladies the bold admiration
of his eyes and the red flower between his lips. As they drove along Nassau
Street his Excellency drew the attention of his bowing consort to the programme
of music which was being discoursed in College park. Unseen brazen highland
laddies blared and drumthumped after the cort&egrave;ge:</p>
<p class="set"><u>But though she&apos;s a factory lass</u>
<br> <u>And wears no fancy clothes</u>
