<p class="di">&mdash; You, Cochrane, what city sent for him?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Tarentum, sir.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Very good.<a target="foot" id="fbb0001">&ordm;</a> Well?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There was a battle, sir.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Very good. Where?</p>
<p> The boy&apos;s blank face asked the blank window.</p>
<p> Fabled by the daughters of memory. And yet it was in some way if not as
memory fabled it. A phrase, then, of impatience, thud of Blake&apos;s wings of
excess. I hear the ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling masonry, and
time one livid final flame. What&apos;s left us then?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I forget the place, sir. 279 <span style="font-variant:small-caps">b.c.</span></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Asculum, Stephen said, glancing at the name and
date<a target="foot" id="fbb0002">&ordm;</a> in the gorescarred book.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, sir. And he said: <i>Another victory like that and we are done for</i>.</p>
<p> That phrase the world had remembered. A dull ease of the mind. From a hill
above a corpsestrewn plain a general speaking to his officers, leaned upon his
spear. Any general to any officers. They lend ear.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You, Armstrong, Stephen said. What was the end of Pyrrhus?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; End of Pyrrhus, sir?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I know, sir. Ask me, sir, Comyn said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Wait. You, Armstrong. Do you know anything about Pyrrhus?</p>
<p> A bag of figrolls lay snugly in Armstrong&apos;s satchel. He curled them
between his palms at whiles and swallowed them softly. Crumbs adhered to the
tissues of his lips. A sweetened boy&apos;s breath. Welloff people, proud that
their eldest son was in the navy. Vico Road, Dalkey. </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Pyrrhus, sir? Pyrrhus, a pier.</p>
<p> All laughed. Mirthless high malicious laughter. Armstrong looked round
<br><font color="green">{u22, 25}</font>
<br> at his classmates, silly glee in profile. In a moment they will laugh more
loudly, aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Tell me now, Stephen said, poking the boy&apos;s shoulder with the book, what is a pier.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A pier, sir, Armstrong said. A thing out in the waves. A kind of bridge. Kingstown pier, sir.</p>
<p> Some laughed again: mirthless but with meaning. Two in the back bench
whispered. Yes. They knew: had never learned nor ever been innocent. All. With
envy he watched their faces:<a target="foot" id="fbb0003">&ordm;</a> Edith,
Ethel, Gerty, Lily. Their likes: their breaths, too, sweetened with tea and jam,
their bracelets tittering in the struggle.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Kingstown pier, Stephen said. Yes, a disappointed bridge.</p>
<p> The words troubled their gaze.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; How, sir? Comyn asked. A bridge is<a target="foot" id="fbb0004">&ordm;</a> across a river.</p>
<p> For Haines&apos;s chapbook. No-one here to hear. Tonight deftly amid wild
drink and talk, to pierce the polished mail of his mind. What then? A jester at
the court of his master, indulged and disesteemed, winning a clement
master&apos;s praise. Why had they chosen all that part? Not wholly for the
smooth caress. For them too history was a tale like any other too often heard, their land a pawnshop.</p>
<p> Had Pyrrhus not fallen by a beldam&apos;s hand in Argos or Julius Caesar not
been knifed to death. They are not to be thought away. Time has branded them and
fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite possibilities they have
ousted. But can those have been possible seeing that they never were? Or was
that only possible which came to pass? Weave, weaver of the wind.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Tell us a story, sir.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O,<a target="foot" id="fbb0005">&ordm;</a> do, sir. A ghoststory.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Where do you begin in this? Stephen asked, opening another book.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>Weep no more</i>, Comyn said. </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Go on then, Talbot.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And the story,<a target="foot" id="fbb0006">&ordm;</a> sir?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; After, Stephen said. Go on, Talbot.</p>
<p> A swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork of
his satchel. He recited jerks of verse with odd glances at the text.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 26}</font> </p>
<p class="diset">&mdash; <i>Weep no more, woful shepherds,</i><a target="foot" id="fbb0007">&ordm;</a> <i>weep no more
<br> For Lycidas, your sorrow, is not dead,</i>
<br> <i>Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor</i>&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> <a name="jn1012i" href="../../ff/unbs/jn1all.htm#jn1012i">It must be a
movement then, an actuality of the possible as possible</a>. Aristotle&apos;s
phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated out into the studious
silence of the library of Saint Genevieve where he had read, sheltered from the
sin of Paris, night by night. By his elbow a delicate Siamese conned a handbook
of strategy. Fed and feeding brains about me: under glowlamps,
<a name="un4027i" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4027i">impaled, with faintly
beating feelers</a>: and in my mind&apos;s darkness a sloth of the underworld,
reluctant, shy of brightness, shifting her dragon scaly folds.
<a name="jn1012j" href="../../ff/unbs/jn1all.htm#jn1012j">Thought is the thought
of thought</a>. Tranquil brightness.
<a name="jn1004c" href="../../ff/unbs/jn1all.htm#jn1004c">The soul is in a
manner all that is</a>:
<a name="jn1004b" href="../../ff/unbs/jn1all.htm#jn1004b">the soul is the form
of forms</a>. Tranquility<a target="foot" id="fbb0008">&ordm;</a> sudden, vast, candescent: form of forms.</p>
<p> Talbot repeated:</p>
<p class="diset">&mdash; <i>Through the dear might of Him that walked the waves,
<br> Through the dear might</i>&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Turn over, Stephen said quietly. I don&apos;t see anything.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What, sir? Talbot asked simply, bending forward.</p>
<p> His hand turned the page over. He leaned back and went on
again,<a target="foot" id="fbb0009">&ordm;</a> having just remembered. Of
Him<a target="foot" id="fbb0010">&ordm;</a> that walked the waves. Here also
over these craven hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffer&apos;s heart and
lips and on mine. It lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of the
tribute. To Caesar what is Caesar&apos;s, to God what is God&apos;s. A long look
from dark eyes, a riddling sentence to be woven and woven on the church&apos;s looms. Ay.</p>
<p class="set"><i>Riddle me, riddle me, randy ro.
<br> My father gave me seeds to sow.</i> </p>
<p> Talbot slid his closed book into his satchel.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Have I heard all? Stephen asked.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, sir. Hockey at ten, sir.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Half day, sir. Thursday.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who can answer a riddle? Stephen asked.</p>
<p> They bundled their books away, pencils clacking, pages rustling. Crowding
together they strapped and buckled their satchels, all gabbling gaily:
<br><font color="green">{u22, 27}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A riddle, sir. Ask me, sir.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O, ask me, sir.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A hard one, sir.</p>
<p class="diset">&mdash; This is the riddle, Stephen said:
<br> <i>The cock crew,</i><a target="foot" id="fbb0012">&ordm;</a>
<br> <i>The sky was blue:
<br> The bells in heaven
<br> Were striking eleven.
<br> &apos;Tis time for this poor soul
<br> To go to heaven.</i></p>
<p class="flush">What<a target="foot" id="fbb0013">&ordm;</a> is that?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What, sir?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Again, sir. We didn&apos;t hear.</p>
<p> Their eyes grew bigger as the lines were repeated. After a silence Cochrane said:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What is it, sir? We give it up.</p>
<p> Stephen, his throat itching, answered:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush.</p>
<p> He stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their cries echoed dismay.</p>
<p> A stick struck the door and a voice in the corridor called:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Hockey!</p>
<p> They broke asunder, sidling out of their benches, leaping them. Quickly they
were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and clamour of their boots and tongues.</p>
<p> Sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly, showing  an open
copybook. His tangled<a target="foot" id="fbb0014">&ordm;</a> hair and scraggy
neck gave witness of unreadiness and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked
up pleading. On his cheek, dull and bloodless, a soft stain of ink lay,
dateshaped, recent and damp as a snail&apos;s bed.</p>
<p> He held out his copybook. The word <i>Sums</i> was written on the headline.
Beneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with
<a name="un1032as" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1032as">blind loops</a> and
a blot. Cyril Sargent: his name and seal.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Mr Deasy told me to write them out all again, he said, and show them to you, sir.</p>
<p> Stephen touched the edges of the book. Futility.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 28}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Do you understand how to do them now? he asked.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Numbers eleven to fifteen, Sargent answered. Mr Deasy said
I was to copy them off the board, sir.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Can you do them yourself? Stephen asked.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; No, sir.</p>
<p> Ugly and futile: lean neck and thick<a target="foot" id="fbb0015">&ordm;</a>
hair and a stain of ink, a snail&apos;s bed. Yet someone had loved him, borne
him in her arms and in her heart. But for her the race of the world would have
trampled him underfoot,<a target="foot" id="fbb0016">&ordm;</a> a squashed
boneless snail. She had loved his weak watery blood drained from her own. Was
that then real? The only true thing in life?
<a name="un4025ab" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4025ab">His mother&apos;s
prostrate body the fiery Columbanus in holy zeal bestrode.</a> She was no more:
the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in the fire, an odour of rosewood and
wetted ashes. She had saved him from being trampled
underfoot<a target="foot" id="fbb0017">&ordm;</a> and had gone, scarcely having
been. A poor soul gone to heaven: and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox,
red reek of rapine in his fur, with merciless bright eyes scraped in the earth,
listened, scraped up the earth, listened, scraped and scraped.</p>
<p> Sitting at his side Stephen solved out the problem. He proves by algebra
that Shakespeare&apos;s ghost is Hamlet&apos;s grandfather. Sargent peered
askance through his slanted glasses. Hockeysticks rattled in the lumberroom: the
hollow knock of a ball and calls from the field.</p>
<p> Across the page the symbols moved in grave morrice, in the mummery of their
letters, wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes. Give hands, traverse, bow to
partner: so: imps of fancy of the Moors.  Gone too from the world, Averroes and
Moses Maimonides, dark men in mien and movement, flashing in their mocking
mirrors the obscure soul of the world, a darkness shining in brightness which brightness could not comprehend.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Do you understand now? Can you work the second for yourself?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, sir.</p>
<p> In long shaky strokes Sargent copied the data. Waiting always for a word of
help his hand moved faithfully the unsteady symbols, a faint hue of shame
flickering behind his dull skin. <i>Amor matris</i>: subjective and objective
genitive. With her weak blood and wheysour milk she had fed him and hid from
sight of others his swaddlingbands<a target="foot" id="fbb0018">&ordm;</a>.</p>
<p> Like him was I, these sloping shoulders, this gracelessness. My childhood
bends beside me. Too far for me to lay a hand of
comfort<a target="foot" id="fbb0019">&ordm;</a>
there<a target="foot" id="fbb0020">&ordm;</a> once or lightly. Mine is far and
his secret as our eyes. Secrets, silent, stony<a target="foot" id="fbb0021">&ordm;</a> sit in the dark palaces of both
<br><font color="green">{u22, 29}</font>
<br> our hearts: secrets weary of their tyranny: tyrants willing to be dethroned.</p>
<p> The sum was done.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It is very simple, Stephen said as he stood up.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, sir. Thanks, Sargent answered.</p>
<p> He dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his copybook back to his desk.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You had better get your stick and go out to the others,
Stephen said as he followed towards the door the boy&apos;s graceless form.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, sir.</p>
<p> In the corridor his name was heard, called from the playfield.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Sargent!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Run on, Stephen said. Mr Deasy is calling you.</p>
<p> He stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards the scrappy
field where sharp voices were in strife. They were sorted in teams and Mr Deasy
came stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet. When he had reached the
schoolhouse voices again contending called to him. He turned his angry white moustache.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What is it now? he cried continually without listening.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Cochrane and Halliday are on the same side, sir, Stephen
said<a target="foot" id="fbb0022">&ordm;</a>. </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Will you wait in my study for a moment, Mr Deasy said, till I restore order here.</p>
<p> And as he stepped fussily back across the field his old man&apos;s voice cried sternly:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What is the matter? What is it now?</p>
<p> Their sharp voices cried about him on all sides: their many forms closed
round him, the garish sunshine<a target="foot" id="fbb0023">&ordm;</a> bleaching the honey of his illdyed head.</p>
<p> Stale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abraded leather of
its chairs. As on the first day he bargained with me here. As it was in the
beginning, is now. On the sideboard the tray of Stuart coins, base treasure of a
bog: and ever shall be. And snug in their spooncase of purple plush, faded, the
twelve apostles having preached to all the gentiles: world without end.</p>
<p> A hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor. Blowing out his rare
moustache Mr Deasy halted at the table.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; First, our little financial settlement, he said.</p>
<p> He brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong. It slapped
open and he took from it two notes, one of joined halves, and laid them
carefully on the table.<a target="foot" id="fbb0024">&ordm;</a>
<br><font color="green">{u22, 30}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Two, he said, strapping and stowing his pocketbook away.</p>
<p> And now his strongroom for the gold. Stephen&apos;s embarrassed hand moved
over the shells heaped in the cold stone mortar: whelks and money cowries and
leopard shells: and this,
<a name="un1032aq" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1032aq">whorled</a> as an
emir&apos;s turban, and this, the scallop of
saint<a target="foot" id="fbb0025">&ordm;</a> James. An old pilgrim&apos;s hoard, dead treasure, hollow shells.</p>
<p> A sovereign fell, bright and new, on the soft pile of the tablecloth.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Three, Mr Deasy said, turning his little savingsbox about
in his hand. These are handy things to have. See. This is for sovereigns. This
is for shillings. Sixpences,<a target="foot" id="fbb0026">&ordm;</a> halfcrowns. And here crowns. See.</p>
<p> He shot from it two crowns and two shillings.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Three twelve, he said. I think you&apos;ll find that&apos;s right.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Thank you, sir, Stephen said, gathering the money together
with shy haste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers. </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; No thanks at all, Mr Deasy said.
<a name="un4027d" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4027d">You have earned it.</a></p>
<p> Stephen&apos;s hand, free again, went back to the hollow shells. Symbols too
of beauty and of power. A lump in my pocket. Symbols soiled by greed and misery.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Don&apos;t carry it like that, Mr Deasy said. You&apos;ll
pull it out somewhere and lose it. You just buy one of these machines. You&apos;ll find them very handy.</p>
<p> Answer something.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Mine would be often empty, Stephen said.</p>
<p> The same room and hour, the same wisdom: and I the same. Three times now.
Three nooses round me here. Well?<a target="foot" id="fbb0027">&ordm;</a> I can
break them in this instant if I will.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Because you don&apos;t save, Mr Deasy said, pointing his
finger. You don&apos;t know yet what money is. Money is power.
When<a target="foot" id="fbb0028">&ordm;</a> you have lived as long as I have. I
know, I know. If youth but knew. But what does Shakespeare say? <i>Put but money in thy purse</i>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Iago, Stephen murmured.</p>
<p> He lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old man&apos;s stare.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He knew what money was, Mr Deasy said. He made money. A
poet, yes,<a target="foot" id="fbb0029">&ordm;</a> but an Englishman too. Do you
know what is the pride of the English? Do you know what is the proudest word you
will ever hear from an Englishman&apos;s mouth?</p>
<p> The seas&apos; ruler. His seacold eyes looked
on<a target="foot" id="fbb0030">&ordm;</a> the empty bay: it
seems<a target="foot" id="fbb0031">&ordm;</a> history is to blame: on me and on my words, unhating.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That on his empire, Stephen said, the sun never sets.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 31}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ba! Mr Deasy cried. That&apos;s not English. A French Celt said that.</p>
<p> He tapped his savingsbox against his thumbnail.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I will tell you, he said solemnly, what is his proudest boast. <i>I paid my way</i>.</p>
<p> Good<a target="foot" id="fbb0032">&ordm;</a> man, good man.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>I paid my way. I never borrowed a shilling in my
life</i>. Can you feel that? <i>I owe nothing</i>. Can you?</p>
<p> Mulligan, nine pounds, three pairs of socks, one pair brogues, ties. Curran,
ten guineas. McCann, one guinea. Fred Ryan, two shillings. Temple, two lunches.
Russell, one guinea, Cousins, ten shillings, Bob  Reynolds, half a guinea,
K&ouml;hler, three guineas, Mrs McKernan, five weeks&apos;
board.<a target="foot" id="fbb0033">&ordm;</a> The lump I have is useless.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; For the moment, no, Stephen answered.</p>
<p> Mr Deasy laughed with rich delight, putting back his savingsbox.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I knew you couldn&apos;t, he said joyously. But one day
you must feel it. We are a generous people but we must also be just.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I fear those big words, Stephen said, which make us so unhappy.</p>
<p> Mr Deasy stared sternly for some moments over the mantelpiece at the shapely
bulk of a man in tartan fillibegs: Albert Edward, Prince of Wales.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You think me an old fogey and an old tory, his thoughtful
voice said. I saw three generations since O&apos;Connell&apos;s time. I remember
the famine in &apos;46<a target="foot" id="fbb0035">&ordm;</a>. Do you know that
the orange lodges agitated for repeal of the union twenty years before
O&apos;Connell did or before the prelates of your communion denounced him as a
demagogue? You fenians forget some things.</p>
<p> Glorious, <a name="un4027g" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4027g">pious
and immortal memory</a>.
<a name="un4027h" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4027h">The lodge of Diamond
in Armagh the splendid behung with corpses of papishes.</a> Hoarse, masked and
armed, the planters covenant. The black
north<a target="foot" id="fbb0037">&ordm;</a> and true blue bible. Croppies lie
down!<a target="foot" id="fbb0038">&ordm;</a></p>
<p> Stephen sketched a brief gesture.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I have rebel blood in me too, Mr Deasy said. On the
spindle side. But I am descended from sir John Blackwood who voted
<a name="un4027c" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4027c">for</a> the union. We are all Irish, all kings&apos; sons.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Alas, Stephen said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>Per vias rectas</i>, Mr Deasy said firmly, was his
motto. He voted
<a name="un4027c" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4027c">for</a> it and put on
his topboots to ride to Dublin from the Ards of Down to do so.</p>
<p class="set"><i>Lal the ral the ra</i>
<br> <i>The rocky road to Dublin.</i>
<br><font color="green">{u22, 32}</font> </p>
<p> A gruff squire on horseback with shiny topboots. Soft day, sir John.
Soft<a target="foot" id="fbb0039">&ordm;</a> day, your honour&nbsp;&hellip;
Day&nbsp;&hellip; Day&nbsp;&hellip; Two topboots jog dangling on to Dublin. Lal
the ral the ra, lal the ral the raddy. </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That reminds me, Mr Deasy said. You can do me a favour, Mr
Dedalus, with some of your literary friends. I have a letter here for the press.
Sit down a moment. I have just to copy the end.</p>
<p> He went to the desk near the window, pulled in his chair twice and read off
some words from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Sit down. Excuse me, he said over his shoulder, <i>the
dictates of common sense</i>. Just a moment.</p>
<p> He peered from under his shaggy brows at the manuscript by his elbow and,
muttering, began to prod the stiff buttons of the keyboard slowly,
sometimes<a target="foot" id="fbb0040">&ordm;</a> blowing as he screwed up the drum to erase an error.</p>
<p> Stephen seated himself noiselessly before the princely presence. Framed
around the walls images of vanished horses stood in homage, their meek heads
poised in air: lord Hastings&apos;
<i>Repulse</i><a target="foot" id="fbb0041">&ordm;</a>, the duke of
Westminster&apos;s <i>Shotover</i><a target="foot" id="fbb0042">&ordm;</a>, the
duke of Beaufort&apos;s <i>Ceylon</i><a target="foot" id="fbb0043">&ordm;</a>,
<i>prix de Paris</i>, 1866. Elfin riders sat them, watchful of a sign. He saw
their speeds, <a name="un4027f" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4027f">backing
king&apos;s colours</a>, and shouted with the shouts of vanished crowds.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Full stop, Mr Deasy bade his keys. <i>But prompt
ventilation of this allimportant</i><a target="foot" id="fbb0044">&ordm;</a>
<i>question</i><a target="foot" id="fbb0045">&ordm;</a>&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> Where Cranly led me to get rich quick, hunting his winners among the
mudsplashed brakes, amid the bawls of bookies
<a name="un4029i" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4029i">on their pitches</a>
and reek of the canteen, over the motley
slush.<a target="foot" id="fbb0046">&ordm;</a> Even money <i>Fair
Rebel</i><a target="foot" id="fbb0047">&ordm;</a>: ten to one the field. Dicers
and thimbleriggers we hurried by after the hoofs, the vying caps and jackets and
past the meatfaced woman, a butcher&apos;s dame, nuzzling thirstily her clove of orange.</p>
<p> Shouts rang shrill from the boys&apos; playfield and a whirring whistle.</p>
<p> Again: a goal. I am among them, among their battling bodies in a medley, the
joust of life. You mean that knockkneed mother&apos;s darling who seems to be
slightly crawsick? Jousts. Time shocked rebounds, shock by shock. Jousts, slush
and uproar of battles, the frozen deathspew of the slain, a shout of
spearspikes<a target="foot" id="fbb0048">&ordm;</a> baited with men&apos;s bloodied guts.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Now then, Mr Deasy said, rising.</p>
<p> He came to the table, pinning together his sheets. Stephen stood up.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I have put the matter into a nutshell, Mr Deasy said.
It&apos;s about  the foot and mouth disease. Just look through it. There can be no two opinions on the matter.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 33}</font> </p>
<p> May I trespass on your valuable space. That doctrine of <i>laissez faire</i>
which so often in our history. Our cattle trade. The way of all our old
industries. Liverpool ring which jockeyed the Galway harbour scheme. European
conflagration. Grain supplies through the narrow waters of the channel. The
pluterperfect imperturbability of the department of agriculture. Pardoned a
classical allusion. Cassandra. By a woman who was no better than she should be. To come to the point at issue.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I don&apos;t mince words, do I? Mr Deasy asked as Stephen read on.</p>
<p> Foot and mouth disease. Known as Koch&apos;s preparation. Serum and virus.
Percentage of salted horses.
<a name="un1028b" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1028b">Rinderpest</a>.
Emperor&apos;s horses at M&uuml;rzsteg, lower Austria. Veterinary surgeons. Mr
Henry Blackwood Price. Courteous offer a fair trial. Dictates of common sense.
Allimportant question. In every sense of the word take the bull by the horns.
Thanking you for the hospitality of your columns.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I<a target="foot" id="fbb0049">&ordm;</a> want that to be
printed and read, Mr Deasy said. You will see at the next outbreak they will put
an embargo on Irish cattle. And it can be cured. It is cured. My cousin,
Blackwood Price, writes to me it is regularly treated and cured in Austria by
cattledoctors there. They offer to come over here. I am trying to work up
influence with the department. Now I&apos;m going to try publicity. I am
surrounded by difficulties, by&nbsp;&hellip; intrigues by&nbsp;&hellip;
<a name="un4027e" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4027e">backstairs</a> influence by&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> He raised his forefinger and beat the air oldly before his voice spoke.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Mark my words, Mr Dedalus, he said. England is in the
hands of the jews. In all the highest places: her finance, her press. And they
are the signs of a nation&apos;s decay. Wherever they gather they eat up the
nation&apos;s vital strength. I have seen it coming these years. As sure as we
are standing here the jew merchants are already at their work of destruction. Old England is dying.</p>
<p> He stepped swiftly off, his eyes coming to blue life as they passed a broad
sunbeam. He faced about and back again. </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Dying, he said, if not dead by now.</p>
<p class="set"><i>The harlot&apos;s cry from street to street
<br> Shall weave old England&apos;s windingsheet.</i><a target="foot" id="fbb0050">&ordm;</a></p>
<p> His eyes open wide in vision stared sternly across the sunbeam in which he halted.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 34}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A merchant, Stephen said, is one who buys cheap and sells dear, jew or gentile, is he not?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; They sinned against the light, Mr Deasy said gravely. And
you can see the darkness in their eyes. And that is why they are wanderers on the earth to this day.</p>
<p> On the steps of the Paris stock
exchange<a target="foot" id="fbb0051">&ordm;</a> the goldskinned men quoting
prices on their gemmed fingers. Gabble of geese. They swarmed loud,
uncouth,<a target="foot" id="fbb0052">&ordm;</a> about the temple, their heads
thickplotting under maladroit silk hats. Not theirs: these clothes, this speech,
these gestures. Their full slow eyes
belied<a target="foot" id="fbb0053">&ordm;</a> the words, the gestures eager and
unoffending, but knew the rancours massed about them and knew their zeal was
vain. Vain patience to heap and hoard. Time surely would scatter all. A hoard
heaped by the roadside: plundered and passing on. Their eyes knew
the<a target="foot" id="fbb0054">&ordm;</a> years of wandering and, patient, knew the dishonours of their flesh.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who has not? Stephen said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What do you mean? Mr Deasy asked.</p>
<p> He came forward a pace and stood by the table. His underjaw fell sideways
open uncertainly. Is this old wisdom? He waits to hear from me.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; History, Stephen said, is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.</p>
<p> From the playfield the boys raised a shout. A whirring whistle: goal.
<a name="un4027b" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4027b">What if that nightmare
gave</a><a target="foot" id="fbb0055">&ordm;</a>
<a name="un4027b" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4027b">you a back kick?</a></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The ways of the Creator are not our ways, Mr Deasy said.
All history<a target="foot" id="fbb0056">&ordm;</a> moves towards one great goal, the manifestation of God.</p>
<p> Stephen<a target="foot" id="fbb0057">&ordm;</a> jerked his thumb towards the window, saying:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That is God. </p>
<p> Hooray! Ay! Whrrwhee!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What? Mr Deasy asked.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A shout in the street, Stephen answered, shrugging his shoulders.</p>
<p> Mr Deasy looked down and held for a while the wings of his nose tweaked
between his fingers. Looking up again he set them free.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I am happier than you are, he said. We have committed many
errors and many sins. A woman brought sin into the world. For a woman who was no
better than she should be, Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus, ten years the
Greeks made war on Troy. A faithless wife first brought the strangers to our
shore here, MacMurrough&apos;s wife and her
leman,<a target="foot" id="fbb0058">&ordm;</a> O&apos;Rourke, prince of Breffni.
A woman too brought Parnell low. Many errors, many failures but
<br><font color="green">{u22, 35}</font>
<br> not the one sin. I am a struggler now at the end of my days. But I will fight for the right till the end.</p>
<p class="set"><i>For Ulster will fight
<br> And Ulster will be right.</i></p>
<p> Stephen raised the sheets in his hand.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Well, sir, he began&nbsp;&hellip;<a target="foot" id="fbb0059">&ordm;</a></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I foresee, Mr Deasy said, that you will not remain here
very long at this work. You were not born to be a teacher, I think. Perhaps I am wrong.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A learner rather, Stephen said.</p>
<p> And<a target="foot" id="fbb0060">&ordm;</a> here what will you learn more?</p>
<p> Mr Deasy shook his head.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who knows? he said. To learn one must be humble. But life is the great teacher.</p>
<p> Stephen rustled the sheets again.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; As regards these, he began&nbsp;&hellip;<a target="foot" id="fbb0061">&ordm;</a></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, Mr Deasy said. You have two copies there. If you can have them published at once.</p>
<p> Telegraph. Irish Homestead.<a target="foot" id="fbb0062">&ordm;</a></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I will try, Stephen said, and let you know tomorrow. I know two editors slightly.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That will do, Mr Deasy said briskly. I wrote last night to
Mr  Field, M.P. There is a meeting of the cattletraders&apos; association today
at the City Arms Hotel. I asked him to lay my letter before the meeting. You see
if you can get it into your two papers. What are they?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The<a target="foot" id="fbb0063">&ordm;</a> <i>Evening Telegraph</i>&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That will do, Mr Deasy said. There is no time to lose. Now
I have to answer that letter from my cousin.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Good morning, sir, Stephen said, putting the sheets in his pocket. Thank you.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Not at all, Mr Deasy said as he searched the papers on his
desk. I like to break a lance with you, old as I am.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Good morning, sir, Stephen said again, bowing to his bent back.</p>
<p> He went out by the open porch and down the gravel path under the trees,
hearing the cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield. The lions
couchant on the pillars as he passed out through the gate:<a target="foot" id="fbb0064">&ordm;</a> toothless
<br><font color="green">{u22, 36}</font>
<br> terrors. Still I will help him in his fight. Mulligan will dub me a new name: the bullockbefriending bard.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Mr Dedalus!</p>
<p> Running after me. No more letters, I hope.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Just one moment.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, sir, Stephen said, turning back at the gate.</p>
<p> Mr Deasy halted, breathing hard and swallowing his breath.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I just wanted to say, he said. Ireland, they say, has the
honour of being the only country which never persecuted the jews. Do you know that? No. And do you know why?</p>
<p> He frowned sternly on the bright air.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Why, sir, Stephen asked, beginning to smile.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Because she never let them in, Mr Deasy said solemnly.</p>
<p> A coughball of laughter leaped from his throat dragging after it a rattling
chain of phlegm. He turned back quickly, coughing, laughing, his lifted arms waving to the air.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; She never let them in, he cried again through his laughter
as he stamped on gaitered feet over the gravel of the path. That&apos;s why.</p>
<p> On his wise shoulders through the checkerwork of leaves the sun flung spangles, dancing coins.</p>  </main>
