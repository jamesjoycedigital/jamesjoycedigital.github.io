<p class="pStDir">Miss Douse&apos;s and Miss Kennedy&apos;s head, bronze and
bronze, over the blind of the Ormond Hotel saw the viceregal cavalcade go by.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is that her? Miss Kennedy said</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, Miss Douse said, that&apos;s her sitting beside his
ex. Mother-of-pearl grey and strawberry.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And is that her? Miss Kennedy said. Exquisite contrast, isn&apos;t it, the grey and the pink.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Look at the fellow in the carriage after, Miss Douse. Do you see? In the tall silk.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Who? Where? Who is he? Miss Kennedy asked.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Look at him, Miss Douse said, laughing in the sun.
He&apos;s killed looking back. Bye bye. Look, I declare to God he&apos;s looking back. Mind till I see.</p>
<p> She ran to the far corner of the window, flattening her face sideways
against the pane in a halo of her excited breath. </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It&apos;s them have the fine times, Miss Kennedy said. All the clothes they have.</p>
<p> The boots came across from the hall and laid his tray on the counter</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; There&apos;s your teas, he said</p>
<p> Miss Kennedy conveyed the tray into a cosy nook behind.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What is it? the boots asked</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Find out, Miss Douce answered with disdain as she left her spyingpoint.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Your master?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">If you give
me any more of your</span></span> I&apos;ll complain to Mr Tallon, Miss Douse answered haughtily, if I hear any
<br><font color="green">{ms, 2}</font>
<br> more<a target="foot" id="fmz0007">&ordm;</a> of your impertinent insolence
<br><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">&mdash; Imthnthnthnthnthnthn, the boots&apos;s</span></span></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Imperthnthnthnthnthn, the boots&apos;s
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">snouting</span></span> snouted
lips said mockingly as he went out as he had come.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That fellow is going beyond the beyonds, Miss Douse said.
Little brat. I&apos;ll box his ears well for him.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Take no notice
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">of him</span></span>, Miss Kennedy said.</p>
<p> She poured <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the</span></span> a
little of the tea into a cup and back into the pot. In their nook
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">they</span></span> under the
counter they sat on the low stools till it should draw properly.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Am I much burned? Miss Douse asked, showing her neck.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, Miss Kennedy said.
<a name="un1007e" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1007e">It gets brown after.
Did you try the cherry laurel water and borax</a>?</p>
<p> Miss Douse, viewing her skin sideways in the mirror behind the hock and claret glasses, asked again:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But am I too red?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Why don&apos;t you try that with the
<a name="un1007d" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1007d">glycerine</a>? Miss Kennedy said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ah, those things only bring out a rash on you, Miss Douse
said. I asked that old fellow in Boyd&apos;s for something.</p>
<p> Miss Kennedy, pouring tea,
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">said</span></span> made a grimace, saying:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, don&apos;t remind me of him for goodness&apos; sake.</p>
<p> Miss Douse said gaily:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But wait till I tell you.</p>
<p> Miss Kennedy put her little fingers into her ears, saying:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, I won&apos;t listen.</p>
<p> Miss Douse said in a snuffy voice</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>For your what?</u> he said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, don&apos;t let me think of him, Miss
<br><font color="green">{ms, 3}</font>
<br> Kennedy<a target="foot" id="fmz0008">&ordm;</a> said, or I&apos;ll kick.
That awful old wretch. Do you remember the day you were buying the
<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font></p>
<p> She drank distastefully from her cup.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Here he was, Miss Douse said, leaning sideways and ruffling her nose. Huf! Huf!</p>
<p> A high shriek of laughter came from Miss Kennedy&apos;s throat while Miss
Douse continued to blow through nostrils that quivered like a snout</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, Miss Kennedy cried, will you ever forget his goggle eyes?</p>
<p> Without answering Miss Douse burst into loud laughter</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The greasy little man! she said.</p>
<p> Their unresisting voices blended in a peal of laughter. Then they threw
their heads back to let their laughter free, signalling to each other by high
piercing notes. Panting and sighing their mirth died down. Miss Kennedy took her
cup again and had drunk a mouthful when Miss Douse bent over the teatray and,
ruffling her nose again, began to roll droll fattened eyes. Miss Kennedy
spluttered into her teacup and, convulsed with laughter and coughing,
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">said</span></span> cried:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, greasy eyes! Imagine being married to a thing like that!</p>
<p> Miss Douse gave a woman&apos;s scream of delight and indignation</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Married to the greasy nose! she said</p>
<p> They broke again into high and deep laughter, urging each other to peal
after peal: and then <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">lay against
the</span></span> laid their shaken heads against the
<br><font color="green">{ms, 4}</font>
<br> counter<a target="foot" id="fmz0009">&ordm;</a> ledge, flushed, panting, sweated.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Lord, Miss Douse sighed to the trembling rose on her
bosom. I wish I hadn&apos;t
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the</span></span> laughed so much. I&apos;m wringing wet.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, you horrid thing, Miss Kennedy said, flushing more.</p>
<p> Mr Dedalus came into the bar idly
<a name="un1001e" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1001e">picking chips off one of his rocky thumbnails</a>.
<br><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">&mdash;How do you do, Miss Douse</span></span></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, how do you do, Miss Douse, he said
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">dropping his</span></span> agreeably. Back again.</p>
<p> Miss Douse shook his hand.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And how did you enjoy your holidays?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Tiptop, Miss Douse said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I hope you had nice weather in Rostrevor.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Gorgeous, Miss Douse said. Look at the show I am from
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">I was</span></span> lying out on the rocks half the day.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">You
naughty</span></span> That was very naughty of you, Mr Dedalus, shaking his head indulgently. Tempting poor sinners.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, go away out of that, Miss Douse said, pulling back her
satined arm. I&apos;m sure you&apos;re very innocent.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well now I am, Mr Dedalus said. I looked so simple when I
was a child that they christened me Simon. So they tell me, at least.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I don&apos;t think, Miss Douse said. And what may I have the pleasure&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Whatever you say yourself, Mr Dedalus answered. Well
I&apos;ll just take. Let me see now. I&apos;ll take a&nbsp;&hellip; No, I think
I&apos;ll <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">have</span></span>
trouble you for some water and a half glass of whisky.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;
<a name="un1032eh" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1032eh">With the greatest alacrity</a>, Miss Douse said.</p>
<p> She turned towards the glass before the mirror and drew off the measure
<br><font color="green">{ms, 5}</font>
<br> Mr<a target="foot" id="fmz0010">&ordm;</a> Dedalus took forth pipe and
pouch from the skirt
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">pocket</span></span> of his coat
and blew a husky whistle down the pipeshank.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; By Jove, he said.
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Rostrevor. Well now I
am</span></span> I often wanted to see Rostrevor. But a long threatening comes at last, they say. Yes, yes.</p>
<p> He fingered tobacco into the bowl nodding as the drink was set before him.
Miss Douse began to polish a glass, humming:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>O, Idolores, queen of the eastern sea</u></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Was Mr Lidwell in today?</p>
<p> Lenehan entered the bar and looked about him.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He was in at lunchtime, Miss Kennedy said, patting her
mouth with her handkerchief and making a sign to Miss Douse
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">who sat down to her tea</span></span></p>
<p> She came down to the beerpull and stood flicking crumbs
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">from</span></span> off her tulle front.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Has Mr Boylan been looking for me? Lenehan said coming to the counter.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, Mr Lenehan, Miss Kennedy said. Was Mr Boylan in while I was upstairs, Miss Douse?</p>
<p> Miss Douse, seated at her crate, answered without looking up from the book:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">I didn&apos;t</span></span> No, he was not.</p>
<p> Lenehan craned his short body round the sandwich bell towards her voice, saying:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Peep! Who spoke?</p>
<p> <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">As she d</span></span> Unrewarded by a glance, he said to her:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;
<a name="un1032ea" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1032ea">Be sure to read only the black ones</a>.</p>
<p> He greeted Mr Dedalus who nodded slightly</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ah me, O my, he said.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 6}</font>
<br> &apos;Twas<a target="foot" id="fmz0011">&ordm;</a> ever thus. And how is your famous son, Mr Dedalus?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Whose son? Mr Dedalus asked</p>
<p> Lenehan opened his arms genially.
|x<a name="un5014as" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5014as">cigarette chewed</a>|x*</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Can you ask? he said. Stephen, son of the tribe of Dedalus.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, I see, Mr Dedalus said, laying down his pipe. I
didn&apos;t recognise him for the moment. I believe he is keeping very select
company lately. I haven&apos;t had the pleasure of seeing him for some time. Are you a friend of his?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">have</span></span> quaffed the
winecup of friendship with him, Lenehan said to Miss Kennedy&apos;s waiting
eyes, today. In Mooney&apos;s sur Mer. The wise ones of Ireland hung on his
lips. Professor MacHugh, Dublin&apos;s darling editor and
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">O&apos;Madden Burke the
bard</span></span> that sweet minstrel known to the muses as O&apos;Madden Burke.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Indeed, Mr Dedalus said. That must have been very interesting. I see.</p>
<p> He lifted his glass and drank. Then, glancing towards the inner saloon, he said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I see you have moved the piano.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The tuner was in this morning, Miss Kennedy said. He played it exquisitely.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is that a fact? Mr Dedalus said</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Didn&apos;t he, Miss Douse? Miss Kennedy said. Real
classical, you know. And the poor fellow blind too. Not twenty years old.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is that so, Mr Dedalus said</p>
<p> He saundered off towards the open saloon door.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; So sad to look at his face, Miss Douse
<br><font color="green">{ms, 7}</font>
<br> said.<a target="foot" id="fmz0012">&ordm;</a></p>
<p> A diner&apos;s bell tinkled in the restaurant to her compassion.
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">She went out by the end of the
bar.</span></span> The bardoor <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">She
went out into the restaurant.</span></span> Lenehan eyed what he could see of
Miss Douse&apos;s
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">reading</span></span> gold hair,
reading. In drowsy silence came
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">th</span></span> from the saloon
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the buzz</span></span> a pure
sound, long in dying: and once more,
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">as Mr Dedalus struck</span></span>
as the tuningfork Mr Dedalus struck and held lightly on the pianocase sang
sweetly with its buzzing prongs. On the keys under his fingers, twinkling in
chords of <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">harpings</span></span>
harping starrily, sang of <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">his youth</span></span> youth&apos;s morn:</p>
<p class="set"><u>The bright stars fade, the morn is breaking</u></p>
<p> Lenehan&apos;s lips blew over the counter a soft whistle of decoy</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But look this way, he said. Rose of Castile</p>
<p> Miss Douse turned a page, dreamily.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Does she feel as if she felt? Lenehan asked. What is the name of it?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Nothing for you, Miss Douse said,
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">rising</span></span></p>
<p> Blazes Boylan&apos;s spruce figure entered.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; See the conquering hero comes, Lenehan said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I heard you were round, Blazes Boylan said. What is it?</p>
<p> He touched the slanted rim
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">to</span></span> of his straw hat
to Miss Douse who preened herself at her leisure, amiably. </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What&apos;s your cry? Blazes Boylan asked. A half one?
Give us a half one, Miss D, and a sloe gin, please. Is the wire in yet?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Not yet, Lenehan said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Here&apos;s fortune, Blazes Boylan said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What&apos;s the time? Blazes Boylan said. Half three. I
met <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">that</span></span> Bantam Lyons in
<br><font color="green">{ms, 8}</font>
<br> Grafton<a target="foot" id="fmz0014">&ordm;</a> street. He was going to plunge on Zinfandel.</p>
<p> He was talking about some <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">fi</span></span> horse&nbsp;&hellip;..</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Sceptre will win, hands down, Lenehan said, taking his glass to him.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I put a bit on her, Blazes Boylan. Not for my own fancy, you know. Friend of mine.</p>
<p> Lenehan sipped, smiling finely at the tilted gold he drank.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Here&apos;s fortune, Blazes Boylan said.</p>
<p> He drank half and placed a coin on the counter smartly. A clockface clacked its tongue.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Half three is it? he said, glancing among the gaudy
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">glasses</span></span> reflections.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That clock&apos;s fast, Lenehan said. Isn&apos;t it, Miss Douse?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Fivepence, Miss Douse said demurely, handing change.</p>
<p> Lenehan pulled the cocca of Blazes Boylan&apos;s coat, his eyes hungering on her face.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Let&apos;s hear the time, he said. He has an appointment he can&apos;t miss.</p>
<p> Miss Douse {sunny} eyes glanced archly at the slanted straw hat for an instant.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Go on, Lenehan said urgently. He never heard that.</p>
<p> Miss Douse glanced again at Blazes Boylan&apos;s bold eyes and tie.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Go on, Lenehan said
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">pleading with the returning chords from the saloon</span></span>.</p>
<p> His voice pleaded with the song&apos;s soft chords of avowal:
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">I could not leave thee though I said</span></span></p>
<p class="set"><u>I could not leave thee</u>&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Go on, he said. <u>Sonnez la cloche!</u> Do.</p>
<p> Miss Douse bent suddenly and nipped her dress at the knee. The chords from
the chord strayed from the air shakily, feeling for it again, shaking. The two
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">li</span></span> kindled faces
watched her bend. Her eyes taunted them an instant still. Then ere she released,
the warm smack of her garter smacked her thigh.</p>
<p>
<br><font color="green">{ms, 9}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>La</u><a target="foot" id="fmz0015">&ordm;</a>
<u>cloche!</u> Lenehan cried, content. I taught her that. Trained by owner.</p>
<p> Blazes Boylan raised the dainty chalice and
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">tasted</span></span> swallowed the
sloe gin at his ease, his eyes following Miss Douse&apos;s figure. It moved to
the end of the bar and concerted, gold with bronze, with Miss Kennedy&apos;s over the diner&apos;s bill, whispering.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No flies, Lenehan said. Eh?</p>
<p class="set">&hellip;. <u>sweetheart, goodbye.</u></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I&apos;m off, Blazes Boylan said brusquely</p>
<p> He sucked the dregs of his sloe gin, slid his glass away and gathered the change up.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Where? Lenehan said, taking his glass up. Wait a minute. What way are you going?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Come on, damn you, Blazes Boylan said. I can&apos;t wait, curse you.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; As bad as that? Lenehan said.</p>
<p> He followed the loud creaking shoes out, standing by as a bulky and a
slender form crossed the threshold, to salute:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Good day,</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; How do you do, Mr Dollard?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Eh? God bless you! Ben Dollard said vaguely, turning his
voice a moment from Father Cowley&apos;s ear. He won&apos;t give you any
trouble. I know long John. We&apos;ll put a barleystraw in
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">that</span></span> Antichrist&apos;s ear, I tell you.</p>
<p> Sighing, Mr Dedalus came towards the door of the saloon, a finger soothing his eyelid.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, we will, Ben Dollard said. Come on, Simon. Where&apos;s the piano? I heard you coming in.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What&apos;s that? Mr Dedalus said. I was only struming.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Come on, come on, Ben Dollard cheerily. Begone dull care. Come in, Bob.</p>
<p> He ambled before them into the saloon and, plumping himself heavily on the stool, his big gouty hands struck
<br><font color="green">{ms, 10}</font>
<br> off<a target="foot" id="fmz0016">&ordm;</a> chords.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Love and War</u>, Mr Dedalus said. God be with the past, Ben.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I was the pianist that night, Father Cowley said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And a nice hash he made of it! Mr Dedalus said. A symposium of his own.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I remember, Father Cowley said.
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">What became of that</span></span>
Marie <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Fallon</span></span> Powell
sang too. What became of her, Simon? I never see her name. Is she alive?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Alive and kicking, Mr Dedalus
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">said</span></span> began.
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">She married</span></span>
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Yes</span></span></p>
<p> Ben Dollard thundered over their voices with {strong} chords:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>When love absorbs my ardent soul</u>.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; War! War! Father Cowley said, turning to him.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, so I am, Ben Dollard said, stopping</p>
<p> He shook his laughing face and huge beard over his error.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Sure, you&apos;d burst the tympanum of her ear, man, Mr
Dedalus said, with an organ like yours.</p>
<p> Ben Dollard shook in fat bass laughter over the keys.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Another
mem</span></span> To say nothing of another membrane, Father Cowley added. Get up, Ben, a moment. Let me there.</p>
<p class="pchar">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p> Mr Bloom watched in silence the liquid eyeball at gaze calm and pitiless
under its narrowed lid and saw its fence of lashes. At each slow heave of her
bosom (her heaving embonpoint) the red rose rose and sank with satin and all her
tiny foils trembled of maidenhair. She knows I&apos;m looking, knows without
looking. Heat and spices of drinks floated round her. On the jutting beerpull
lay (?) her hand lightly, plumply, white as the enamel: and to and fro (she
knows I&apos;m looking) over the
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">h</span></span> polished knob her
thumb and finger
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">slid</span></span> passed,
repassed, gently touching and then slid smoothly, slowly down, as
<br><font color="green">{ms, 11}</font>
<br> cool<a target="foot" id="fmz0017">&ordm;</a> firm baton
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">then</span></span> white protruding out of thin sliding ring.</p>
<p> A vision was given her. She pulled a full pull down, down, and pulled it down. Ale gushed, gushed &amp; foamed.</p>
<p class="pchar">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; There<a target="foot" id="fmz0018">&ordm;</a> was an
arrangement between them, Father Cowley said. About ten she&apos;d telephone
down to the husband about the child and if Bloom had won anything he was off
<a name="un5007aq" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5007aq">in a brace of
shakes</a>. There was nothing wrong with the child. But old Mat Dillon spotted the game.</p>
<p class="pchar">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; To hear that fellow croaking, is it, Mr Dedalus said,
with a <a name="un5014at" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5014at">belly on him like a poisoned pup</a></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He&apos;d want a stiff glass of grog to
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">coo</span></span> keep his pecker up, Ben Dollard said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He has a fair share
<a name="un5014au" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5014au">concealed about his
person</a>, if you ask me, Mr Dedalus said.</p>
<p class="pchar">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p> Mr Bloom heard the voice in lamentation. Martha, Martha, ah return, love.
Her name. Strange. I am waiting here. Lovely voice he has. For thee. Co-ome,
thou lost one. Cruel it is people get fond of each. Thou dear one. Then tear
them asunder. Alone. Canst com. Fort me. Human life that is. And she
<br><font color="green">{ms, 12}</font>
<br> one<a target="foot" id="fmz0019">&ordm;</a> day with him. And I. Ah Martha.
All. Asunder. Despair. <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Tuurn</span></span> Turn tooooooo me.</p>
<p class="pchar">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ay, Father Cowley said, he used to do something in
hanging clothes line too when they lived in Holles street. The wife used to buy

<p class="pdi">&mdash; I used to hear them as a boy in Queenstown, Mr Dedalus
said, walking along in the moonlight with those earthquake hats on their ears
and they used to blend their voices together.</p>
<p> He held a phalange of hand shielding his singing lips and sang a nightcall and its echo blended.</p>
<p class="pchar">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p> Mr Bloom observed the drawn face before him. He&apos;s going too. Backache
pills. Taking matches from counters to save. Then spending half a sovereign,
standing drinks. But you can&apos;t touch them for money. Never have a cent. Queer people. Contradictions.</p>

wrote him a hell of a letter
