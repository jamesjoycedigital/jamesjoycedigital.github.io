<p> Bronze<a target="foot" id="fmz0033">&ordm;</a> by gold Miss Douce&apos;s
head by Miss Kennedy&apos;s head, over the crossblind of the bar, heard the viceregal hoofs go by, ringing steel.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is that her? Miss Kennedy said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, Miss Douce said, sitting beside his ex. Pearl grey and crushed strawberry.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Exquisite contrast, miss Kennedy said. Cream &amp; eau de Nil.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Look at the fellow in the tall silk, Miss Douce said eagerly (all agog)</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Who? Where? Who is he? miss Kennedy asked all eagerness</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; In the second carriage, Miss Douce said, her wet lips
laughing in the sun. He&apos;s looking. Mind till I see.</p>
<p> She dashed to the farther corner (of the window), flattening her face
against the pane in a halo of her hurried breath.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He&apos;s killed looking back, she tittered gaily. O wept! Aren&apos;t men frightful idiots?</p>
<p> Miss Kennedy sauntered sadly from the light, twining a loose air behind an
ear. Sauntering sadly, gold no more, she twisted twined a hair. Sadly she twined
in sauntering, her hair behind a curving ear.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It&apos;s them has the fine times, sadly then she said.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom went by Moulang&apos;s pipes by Wine&apos;s antiques, by
Carroll&apos;s dusky battered plate, bearing in his breastpocket, sweets of sin,
in his memory bearing sweet tempting words. For Raoul.</p>
<p> The boots came from the hall and banged on the counter his tray of chattering china.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; There&apos;s your teas, he said.</p>
<p> Miss Kennedy with manners transposed the teatray to rest on a upturned lithia crate, low, safe from eyes.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What is it? the loud boots asked unmannerly</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Find out, Miss Douce retorted, leaving her spyingpoint.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Your beau is it?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I&apos;ll complain to Mrs de Massey on you, haughty
bronze Miss Douce replied, if I hear any more of your impertinent insolence</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Imperthnththnththn, the boots&apos;s snout sniffed rudely, as he retreated as he had come.</p>
<p> And Miss Douce said frowning on her flower</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; most aggravating That fellow is. Young
<br><font color="green">{ms, 2}</font>
<br> brat.<a target="foot" id="fmz0034">&ordm;</a> If he doesn&apos;t conduct
himself I&apos;ll wring his ear a yard long for him if he puts.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Take no notice, Miss Kennedy rejoined</p>
<p> She poured tea in a teacup then tea back in the teapot. They cowered under
the reef of the counter, sitting on footstools, waiting for their tea to draw.
<a name="un1015i" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1015i">They pawed their
blouses, two and nine a yard</a>, waiting for their tea to draw, and
<a name="un1015i" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1015i">two and seven</a>.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Am I awfully sunburned? Miss Douce unbloused her neck.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, said miss Kennedy. It gets brown after. Did you try
the cherry laurel water with the borax?</p>
<p> She touched a dimpling nook of her lips</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I have a little, she said. Listerine She said nought</p>
<p> Miss Douce half stood to see her skin askance in the mirror where shimmered
hock and claret glasses and in their midst a shell.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And leave it to my hands, she said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Why don&apos;t you try that with the glycerine? asked Miss Kennedy.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Those things only bring out a rash, miss Douce said,
bidding her neck and hands adieu and sitting. I asked that old bagpipes in Boyd&apos;s for something for my skin.</p>
<p> Miss Kennedy, pouring fulldrawn tea, grimaced and prayed:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, don&apos;t remind me of him for mercy&apos; sake.</p>
<p> Miss Douce entreated:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But wait till I tell you.</p>
<p> Sweettea Miss Kennedy, having poured her fulldrawn tea and milk, plugged both two ears with little fingers.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, don&apos;t, she cried.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I won&apos;t listen, she cried.</p>
<p> Miss Douce grunted in a snuffy voice:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; For your what? says he</p>
<p> Miss Kennedy uncorked her ear to speak, to hear but said but prayed again:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Don&apos;t let me think of him or I&apos;ll expire. The
awful old wretch. That night in the Antient Concert Rooms.</p>
<p> She sipped distastefully her brew, hot tea, a sip she sipped, sweet tea.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Here he was, Miss Douce said, cocking her
<br><font color="green">{ms, 3}</font>
<br> bronze<a target="foot" id="fmz0035">&ordm;</a> head three quarters, ruffling her nosewings: Huf! Huf!</p>
<p> A shrill shriek of laughter flew from Miss Kennedy&apos;s throat, shrieking
still while Miss Douce snorted ever through her nostrils quivering like a snout in quest.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, Miss Kennedy cried, shrieking. Will you ever forget his goggle eye?</p>
<p> Miss Douce chimed in with deep bronze and laughter, shouting:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And your other eye!</p>
<p> Mr Bloom&apos;s dark eyes read Aaron Figatner&apos;s name (Why do I think
always Figather? Gathering figs I think) and Prosper Lor&eacute;&apos;s huguenot
name. by Bassi&apos;s blessed virgins, His dark eyes went by comely, whiterobed,
come to me. God they believe she is that calls them goddess. Goddess would be
naked. Those I saw. That fellow spoke to me, student he was. That brings the
fellows in, the rakes, her white By went his dark eyes. Sweets of sin. Sweet are the sweets. Sweets to the sweet.</p>
<p> In a giggling peal their young unbridled voices blended. They threw their
heads back, bronze and gold, to let free fly their laughter, screaming signals to each other, high piercing notes.</p>
<p> Panting, sighing, sighing fordone, their mirth died down.</p>
<p> Miss Kennedy fingered her cup again, raised, drank a mouthful when miss
Douce, bending over the teatray, ruffled her nose and rolled droll fattened
eyes. Miss Kennedy, stooping her pinnacles of fair hair until her tortoiseshell
napecomb showed, spluttered with her mouth her tea, choking in tea and laughter, coughing with choking, crying:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O greasy eyes! Imagine being married to a man like that! she cried The bit of beard!</p>
<p> Miss Douce gave vent to a splendid yell, a full woman&apos;s
<br><font color="green">{ms, 4}</font>
<br> yell,<a target="foot" id="fmz0036">&ordm;</a> delight, joy, indignation.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Married to the greasy nose! she yelled</p>
<p> Shrill with deep laughter, gold after bronze, they urged each other to peal
after peal, bronzegold, goldbronze, rang the changes shrill, deep, to laughter
after laughter. Then laughed more, exhausted, breathless, their shaken heads,
braided and pinnacled, glossycombed against the counter ledge. All flushed, (O!
panting, sweating (O!), all breathless.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O Lord, Miss Douce said, sighed to her jumping rose. I
wish I hadn&apos;t laughed so much. O Lord! I feel all wet.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, Miss Douce! Miss Kennedy protested. O you horrid thing!</p>
<p> And flushed yet more (you horrid!), more goldenly.</p>
<p> By Cantwell&apos;s offices walked Mr Bloom, by Ceppi&apos;s virgins, bright
with oils. Nannetti&apos;s father sold those things, wheedling ways. Religion
pays. Stillorgan Dundrum Must see him for that par. Eat first. I want. Not yet.
At four she said. Time ever passing. Clockhands turning. On. Where eat? The
Clarence, Dolphin. Walk on. For Raoul. Eat. If I make five pounds. Those ads. Not yet. The sweets of sin.</p>
<p> More goldenly.</p>
<p> Mr Dedalus strolled into the bar. Chips, picking chips off one of his rocky thumbnails. Chips. He strolled.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, how do you do, Miss Douce?</p>
<p> He held her hand genteelly over the counter.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Back again. And how did you enjoy your holidays?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Tiptop. The greasy nose. For Raoul.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I hope you had nice weather in Rostrevor.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Gorgeous, Miss Douce said. Look at the holy show I am. Lying out on the strand all day.</p>
<p> Comely, come. That brings the fellows in. The rakes. Her white.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 5}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That<a target="foot" id="fmz0037">&ordm;</a> was very
naughty of you Mr Dedalus said, shaking his head indulgently. Tempting us poor simple males.</p>
<p> Miss Douce pulled back her satin arm</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, go away, she said. I&apos;m sure you&apos;re very simple.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well now I am, Mr Dedalus mused. I looked so simple in
the cradle that they christened me simple Simon. So
<a name="un4016g" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4016g">I was told</a> (tolled) at all events.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, I don&apos;t think, Miss Douce made answer. And what did the doctor order today?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Whatever you say yourself, Mr Dedalus said. I&apos;ll
take. Well, let me see now. I&apos;ll take an. No, I think I&apos;ll trouble you
for some fresh water and a half glass of whisky.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; With the greatest alacrity, Miss Douce agreed.</p>
<p> With grace of alacrity she toward the mirror turned herself and tapped a
bright measure of gold whisky from the crystal keg. Mr Dedalus took forth from
the skirt of his coat pouch and pipe and blew through the flue two husky fifenotes.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; By Jove, he said. I often wanted to see Rostrevor. Must
be a great tonic the air down there the
<a name="un4018dr" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4018dr">ozone</a> But a long
threatening comes at last, they say. Yes, Yes.</p>
<p> He fingered navy cut into the bowl nodding as she set his drink before him.
Miss Douce polishing a glass, trilled:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>O, Idolores, queen of the eastern seas</u></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Was Mr Lidwell in today?</p>
<p> In came Lenehan. Round him looked Lenehan. Mr Bloom reached Essex bridge. Mr
Bloom crossed bridge of Essex. To Martha I must. Paper buy. Daly&apos;s. The
girl there. Civil. Bloom. Old Bloom. Blue bloom is on the rye.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He was in at lunchtime, miss Douce said</p>
<p> Lenehan came forward
<br><font color="green">{ms, 6}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Was Mr<a target="foot" id="fmz0038">&ordm;</a> Boylan looking for me?</p>
<p> He asked. She answered:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, Mr Lenehan. Miss Kennedy, was Mr Boylan here while I was upstairs?</p>
<p> She asked. Miss Kennedy answered, her poised teacup in her hands, her gaze upon her page:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, he was not.</p>
<p> Miss Douce composed her white tulle front. Miss Kennedy, heard, not seen,
read on. Lenehan wound his short body round the sandwich bell, saying to her voice:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Peep! Who&apos;s in the corner?</p>
<p> No glance rewarding him, he made still more overtures to her To mind her
stops. Mocking he bade her read only the black ones, round o and crooked ess he bade her read.</p>
<p> She read, unglancing gold. He read to her by rote a solfa fable, plappering flatly.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ah fox met ah stork. Said thee fox to thee stork:</p>
<p> Adown the shank a note flew clear, free flew.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Will you put down your bill into my troth and pull up ah bone?</p>
<p> He droned in vain. Miss Douce turned aside. He sighed aside:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ah me! O my!</p>
<p> He greeted Mr Dedalus who nodded.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Greetings from the famous son of a famous father.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Who may he be? Mr Dedalus asked</p>
<p> Lenehan opened his arms most genially.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Can you ask? he asked. Stephen the bard.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I see, Mr Dedalus said, laying down his filled pipe. I didn&apos;t recognise
<br><font color="green">{ms, 7}</font>
<br> him<a target="foot" id="fmz0039">&ordm;</a> for the moment. I hear he is
keeping very select company. Are you a friend of his?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I quaffed the nectarbowl with him this very day, Lenehan
said, in Mooney&apos;s en ville and in Mooney&apos;s sur mer. He had received
the rhino for the labour of his muse and he did the thing on a large scale.</p>
<p> He smiled to Miss Douce&apos;s listening eyes, and lips:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The &eacute;lite of Erin hung upon his lips. The pundit
profound, Hugh MacHugh, Dublin&apos;s most brilliant editor and that minstrel
boy of the wild wet west known to the muses by the euphonious name (appellative) as O&apos;Madden Burke.</p>
<p> After an interval of cool silence Mr Dedalus lifted his glass &amp; drank</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That must have been highly diverting, Mr Dedalus said. I see.</p>
<p> He looked towards the saloon door:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You have moved the piano, he said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The tuner was in today, Miss Douce replied, tuning it for
the smoking concert. And I never heard such an exquisite player.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is that a fact? Mr Dedalus said</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Didn&apos;t he, miss Kennedy? The real classical. And
blind too, the poor fellow. Not twenty years old I&apos;m sure he was</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is that a fact, Mr Dedalus said.</p>
<p> He strayed away</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; So sad to look at his face, Miss Douce condoled.</p>
<p> Tink to her pity cried a diner&apos;s bell. To the door of the diningroom
came old bald Pat, the waiter. Lager for diner. Lager without alacrity she served.</p>
<p> damping thickness of felt action Mr Dedalus, holding the piano open, gazed
in the coffin at the oblique triple strings, and pressed a triple of keys, to see the muffled hammers fall.</p>
<p>
<br><font color="green">{ms, 8}</font>
<br> Two<a target="foot" id="fmz0040">&ordm;</a> sheets of notepaper and two
envelopes Mr Bloom bought in Daly&apos;s and beyond the poster of a waveswayed
smoking mermaid he saw a hat on Essex bridge riding a jaunting car. Again.
Funeral. Museum. Third. Coincidence Jingling, it jaunted from the bridge to
Ormond quay. Again. Follow. Risk it. Follow. Go quick. Four, she said. BB&apos;s flower</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A penny, sir, the shopgirl dared to say.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Of course&nbsp;&hellip; I was forgetting&nbsp;&hellip; Excuse.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And five.</p>
<p> She winsome smiled. Bloo smi qui go. You&apos;re the only pebble on the
beach. Does that to all. Swing her streaming hair, lovebraid, for men, a man</p>
<p> In drowsy silence gold bent on her page.</p>
<p> From the saloon a call came, long in dying: a call again, from the
tuningfork struck again by Mr Dedalus. Poised lightly on the pianocase it purely
throbbed, softly, and softlier, its buzzing prongs. Longer in dying call.</p>
<p> Pat paid for diner&apos;s lager. Over the tray and glass bottle with Miss
Douce he whispered in the diningroom door.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>The bright stars fade,</u>&nbsp;&hellip;.</p>
<p> A voiceless song sang from within, singing:</p>
<p class="deep">&nbsp;&hellip; <u>the morn is breaking</u></p>
<p> A duodene of birdnotes chirruped bright treble answerunder sensitive hands.
Brightly, the keys all twinkling, linked, all harpsichording, called to a voice
to sing the strains of dewy morn, of youth, of love&apos;s leavetaking, the
strains of life&apos;s, love&apos;s, morning</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>The dewdrops pearl</u>&nbsp;&hellip;.</p>
<p> Lenehan&apos;s lips over the counter blew a low whistle of decoy</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But look this way, he said. Rose of Castile.</p>
<p> Jinglejaunted by the curb and halted.</p>
<p> Fretted, forlorn, She rose and closed her reading. Rose of Castile: dreamily looked on her bosom&apos;s rose.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Did she fall or was she pushed? she was asked by Lenehan.</p>
<p> She answered, slighting him:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ask no questions and you&apos;ll hear no lies
<br><font color="green">{ms, 9}</font> </p>
<p> Blazes<a target="foot" id="fmz0041">&ordm;</a> Boylan&apos;s smart tan shoes
creaked on the barfloor as he strode. Lenehan heard and knew and hailed them:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; See the conquering hero comes</p>
<p> Between the car and the barwindow went Mr Bloom, catwalking. See me. He
might. The seat he sat on. Warm. Towards Richie Goulding&apos;s legal bag lifted aloft saluting.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>And if from thee</u>&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I heard you were round, Blazes Boylan said. What is it?</p>
<p> He touched to Miss Kennedy the slanted rim of his strawhat, she smiled up on
him, her reading closed and far, preening her hair, her bosom and its rose.</p>
<p> Blazes Boylan smartly bespake their potions.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What&apos;s your cry? Glass of bitter? Glass of bitter,
please, and a sloe gin for me. Wire in yet?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Not yet, said Lenehan.</p>
<p> Father Cowley in the sheriff&apos;s doorway. Avoid. Goulding a chance.
Hello. Where are you off to? Something to eat Where? Ormond. Diningroom.
Can&apos;t see me there. Sit tight. Still be near and hear. Hear. At four. I&apos;ll join you. Come along.</p>
<p> Miss Douce reached high to take a flagon, stretching her arm, her bust</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O! O! jerked Lenehan gasping at every reach. O. O</p>
<p> But easily she seized her prey and led it low in triumph.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Why don&apos;t you grow? said Blazes Boylan.</p>
<p> Miss Douce, dealing from her oblique jar thick syrupy liquor for his lips,
looked as it flowed and syrupped with her winsome voice:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Fine goods in small parcels. </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Here&apos;s fortune, Blazes Boylan said.</p>
<p> He pitched a broad crown on
<br><font color="green">{ms, 10}</font>
<br> counter.<a target="foot" id="fmz0042">&ordm;</a></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Hold on, said Lenehan, till I&nbsp;&hellip;.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Fortune, he said, lifting his bubbled ale.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Sceptre will win hands down, he said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I plunged a bit, Blazes Boylan said. Not for my own fancy. Friend of mine.</p>
<p> Lenehan still drank and smiled at the tilted ale. Miss Douce&apos;s shut
lips all but hummed, the eastern oceansong her lips had trilled. Idolores. Eastern seas.</p>
<p> Clockface clacked.</p>
<p> She took the coin, struck the cash register. It clanged. Fair one of Egypt.
She teased and sorted in the still. Look to the west, she hummed. And handed
Blazes Boylan ringing coins in change. For me.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What time is it? asked Blazes Boylan, drinking. Four?</p>
<p> Lenehan, his eyes hungering on Miss Douce&apos;s humming bust hungering
tugged Blazes Boylan&apos;s cocca of his coat.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Let&apos;s hear the time, he said</p>
<p> The legal bag of Richie Goulding Colles Ward led Bloom by rye blooms
flowered tables. Aimless he chose with agitated aim a table near the bardoor. He
sat with Richie Goulding. Near. At four. Is he not? Forgotten. Perhaps a trick
they have. Not come. Whet desire. I couldn&apos;t do that Wait. Pat, waiter, came to wait.</p>
<p> Miss Douce&apos;s sparkling eyes eyed Blazes&apos; slanting hat</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Go on, pressed Lenehan. He never heard it.</p>
<p class="deep">&hellip;. <u>to Flora&apos;s lips did hie</u></p>
<p> High, the high note pealed in the treble clear</p>
<p> Miss Douce, communing with
<br><font color="green">{ms, 11}</font>
<br> her<a target="foot" id="fmz0043">&ordm;</a> rose that fell and rose, sought
Blazes Boylan&apos;s bold blue bow and eyes.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Please, please.</p>
<p> He pleaded over returning phrases of avowal.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>I could not leave thee</u>&nbsp;&hellip;.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Afterwits, Miss Douce said coyly.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, now, urged Lenehan. <u>Sonnez la cloche!</u> O do.
There&apos;s no-one. Miss Kennedy out of earshot</p>
<p> Sudden she bent. Two kindling faces watched her bend.</p>
<p> Quavering the chords of the piano strayed from the air, found it again lost chord and lost, and found it</p>
<p> She nipped a peak of skirt above her knee (O do! please do. <u>Sonnez!</u>),
taunted them still with wilful eyes, delaying.</p>
<p> Smack. She set free smartly her elastic garter smack in rebound against a woman&apos;s warmhosed thigh.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>La cloche!</u> cried Lenehan, kindled, gleeful. I
taught her. Trained by owner. No sawdust there.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You&apos;re the essence of vulgarity, she said, turning her supercilious gaze.</p>
<p> Boylan tossed to fat lips his tiny chalice, sucking the last thick violet
syrupy drops. Tossed off his chalice tiny His spellbound eyes went after her,
her gliding head where it went down the bar by mirrors and hock and claret
glasses, where it concerted, bronze with gold, with sad Miss Kennedy, whispering.</p>
<p class="deep">&nbsp;&hellip;.. <u>sweetheart, goodbye!</u></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I&apos;m off, said Blazes Boylan. Bye bye</p>
<p> He slid his glass away and gathered change.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Where? said Lenehan, drinking quickly. Got the horn? Wait a shake. I&apos;m coming.</p>
<p> He gulped his all.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Come on to blazes! Blazes Boylan said.</p>
<p> He went.</p>
<p> Lenehan followed the hasty creaking shoes but stood by neatly as a bulky and a slender form
<br><font color="green">{ms, 12}</font>
<br> crossed<a target="foot" id="fmz0044">&ordm;</a> the dark threshold to salute:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; How do you do, Mr Dollard?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Eh? How do? How do? Ben Dollard&apos;s vague bass
answered, turning an instant from Father Cowley&apos;s trouble. He won&apos;t
give you any trouble Bob. I know long John. We&apos;ll put a barleystraw in Judas&apos; ear this time.</p>
<p> Sighing, Mr Dedalus came through the saloon, a finger soothing an eyelid.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Hoho, we will, Ben Dollard yodled jollily. Come on,
Simon. Give us a ditty. We heard the piano.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What&apos;s that? Mr Dedalus said. I was only vamping.</p>
<p> Bald Pat in the diners&apos; doorway called for a cider and a glass of
Power, to gold. Still musing, to bronze by the window watching</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Come on, come on, Ben Dollard called. Begone, dull care. Come, Bob!</p>
<p> He ambled in advance to the saloon. He plumped himself upon the stool. His
gouty paws plumped all heavy chords. abrupt He stopped.</p>
<p> A jingle tinkle jaunted. Bloom heard: the little sound: he heard: a sob of
soft breath on the narcissus. He&apos;s gone. Jingling it jaunted. Hear.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Love and War, Mr Dedalus said. God be with the past, Ben.</p>
<p> Miss Douce&apos;s brave eyes, unregarded, turned, smitten by sunlight. Gone.
Smiling (who knows?), smitten (the light is strong) she lowered the blind. She
drew down, smiling, about their bronze and gold, slow cool seagreen depth of shadow, eau de Nil.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Poor old Goodwin was the pianist that night, Father
Cowley remembered. There was a slight difference of opinion between himself and the piano.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A symposium all his own, Mr Dedalus said. The devil
wouldn&apos;t stop. He was a crotchety old fellow in the primary stage of drink.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; God, do you remember? Ben Dollard said, turning from the
keyboard. And, by Japers, I had no wedding garment</p>
<p> They laughed all three. He had
<br><font color="green">{ms, 13}</font>
<br> no<a target="foot" id="fmz0045">&ordm;</a> wedd. They laughed. No wedding garment.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Bloom turned in handy that night, Mr Dedalus said. Where&apos;s my pipe, by the way?</p>
<p> He wandered back to the bar. Father Cowley laughed again</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, I saved the situation, Ben, what? he said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You did, Ben Dollard averred. By God, I remember that.
And those tight trousers too. By God, that was a brilliant idea of yours, Bob.</p>
<p> Father Cowley&apos;s face blushed und his purply lobes.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I knew he was hard up, he explained. She used to play the
piano in the coffee palace. The waiter in the Grosvenor gave us the tip. You
remember? We had to search all Holles Street. Old clo&apos;, what?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; By God she had some splendid things there, I remember,
Ben Dollard said, his broad face wondering.</p>
<p> Mr Dedalus, pipe in hand, wandered back.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Merrion square. Opera cloaks and balldresses. I remember
he wouldn&apos;t take any money. And court dresses.</p>
<p> Mr Dedalus nodded.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ay, ay, he said. Mrs Marion Bloom has left off clothes of all descriptions.</p>
<p> Jingle jaunted up the quays Blazes sprawled on bounding tyres.</p>
<p> Liver and bacon, steak and kidney pie bald Pat the waiter served them.</p>
<p> Mrs Marion. Met him pike hoses. Smell of burn. Of Paul de Kock. Nice name he.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What&apos;s this her name was? a buxom piece. Marion&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Tweedy.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is she alive?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And kicking.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; She&apos;s a daughter of&nbsp;&hellip; who&apos;s this?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Daughter of the regiment.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, begad. I remember the old drum major.</p>
<p> Mr Dedalus lit and puffed savoury puff after.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Irish? I don&apos;t know, faith. Is she Simon?</p>
<p> Puff after stiff puff, a

What? Bit rusty.</a> O, she is. My Irish Molly, O.</p>
<p> He puffed a pungent plumy blast.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; From the rock of Gibraltar. All the way.</p>
<p> They pined in depth of ocean shadow, bronze by the beerpull, gold near
maraschino, thoughtful all two, Lidia Kennedy, 4 Lismore terrace, Drumcondra with Idolores, a queen, silent.</p>
<p> Leopold cut liver slices, streaky bacon. As said before he ate with relish
the inner organs, nutty gizzards, fried cods&apos; roes while Richie Goulding,
Colles, Ward ate steak and kidney, steak then kidney, bite by bite of pie he ate Bloom ate they ate.</p>
<p> Bloom with Goulding, married in silence, ate.</p>
<p> By Bachelor&apos;s walk jogjaunty jingled Blazes Boylan, bachelor: in sun,
in heat, mare&apos;s glossy rump atrot, with flick of whip, on bounding tyres,
sprawled, warmseated, ardentsouled, boldsouled. Horn. Have you the? Horn. Have you the? Haw haw horn.</p>
<p> Over their voices Ben Dollard&apos;s bassooned bass louder attack with bombarding crashing chords:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>When love absorbs my ardent soul.</u></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; War! war! declared Father Cowley. You&apos;re the warrior.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; So I am, Ben Dollard cried.</p>
<p> He stopped. He wagged his huge beard, huge face over his blunder huge.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Sure, you&apos;d burst the tympanum of her ear, man, Mr
Dedalus said amid smoke aroma, with an organ like yours.</p>
<p> In abundant laughter Dollard shook upon keyboard. He would.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Not to mention another membrane, Father Cowley added. Half time, Ben, Amoroso ma non troppo.

<br> Let<a target="foot" id="fmz0047">&ordm;</a> me there.</p>
<p> Miss Kennedy served two cold tankards to two gentlemen. She passed the
remark about the weather: that it was beautiful. Beautiful indeed, one gentleman
said. Did she know where the lord lieutenant was going? Was there a? No, she
didn&apos;t know. It must be in the paper. O, she need not trouble. He drank
from her tankard. No trouble. She waved about the outspread <u>Independent</u>
searching, her pinnacles of fair hair slowmoving. Too much trouble. O, not at
all. Way he looked that time. Beautiful indeed. Bronze by gold, Miss
Douce&apos;s head by Miss Kennedy&apos;s heard hoofs go by, the ringing steel.</p>
<p class="deep">my ardent soul</p>
<p class="flush">I care not for the morrow</p>
<p> <u>Love and War</u> someone is playing. in liver gravy Mr Bloom mashed
mashed potatoes. Ben Dollard&apos;s famous. Night he ran round to us to borrow
the suit for that concert. Trousers tight as a drum on him. All Molly laughed
when he went out. Threw herself back across the bed, screaming, kicking. With
all his belongings on show. O saints above, I&apos;m drenched! O, I never
laughed so much! Well, of course, that&apos;s what gives him the base
barreltone. For instance eunuchs. Wonder who&apos;s playing. Nice touch. Must be
Cowley. Musical. Knows what note you play. Bad breath he has, poor chap. Always
liked the way he sits at the piano. Like one instrument. Mutual understanding.
Tiresome shapers scraping fiddles, sawing the cello. Remind you of toothache.
Night we were in the box, the orchestra under, puffing, blowing, unscrewing,
emptying out spittle. But the harp was lovely, glowering gold light. Girl
touching it. Poop of a lovely golden ship. Erin. The harp that once. Cool hands.
We are harps. Conductor&apos;s legs, bags trousers jigging. The rill the rill
the rillledy rill. Do right to hide them. Stopped.</p>
<p> Miss Douce, engaging, bowed to suave George Lidwell, entering gentleman.
Good afternoon. She gave her moist (a lady&apos;s) hand to his firm handclasp. Afternoon.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Your friends are inside, Mr Lidwell.</p>
<p> George Lidwell held her soliciting hand</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ah, I couldn&apos;t, man, Mr Dedalus said, shy and listless.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Go on, blast you! Ben Dollard growled. Get it out in bits.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>M&apos;appari</u>, Simon, Father Cowley said.</p>
<p> down stage He strode for some paces gravely, tall in affliction, his arms
outheld. Hoarsely, the apple of his throat, sang softly. Softly he sang to the
dusty seascape there: <u>A Last Farewell</u>. A headland, a ship a sail upon the
billows, farewell, a lovely girl waving her veil upon the headland height, wild wind around her. Cowley sang:</p>
<p class="pdiset">&mdash; <u>M&apos;appari tutt&apos; amor</u>
<br> <u>Il mio sguardo</u>&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> She waved, unhearing, him, her veil, to one departing,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 16}</font>
<br> dear<a target="foot" id="fmz0048">&ordm;</a> one, love, return.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Go on, Simon.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ah, sure, my dancing days are done, Ben&nbsp;&hellip;&nbsp;&hellip; Well.</p>
<p> Mr Dedalus laid his pipe to rest upon the piano ledge and, sitting, vamped on the obedient keys.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, Simon, Father Cowley said, turning. Play it in the original. One flat.</p>
<p> The keys, obedient, rose higher, told, faltered, confessed, confused. </p>
<p> Up stage strode Father Cowley</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Here, Simon, I&apos;ll accompany you, he said. Get up.</p>
<p> By Graham Lemon&apos;s jingle jogged, by Elvery&apos;s elephant house.</p>
<p> Steak and kidney. Power. <u>Sonambula.</u> Most beautiful tenor air ever
written. <u>All is lost now.</u> He heard Joe Maas one night sing. Lyrical
tenor. Never would he forget M&apos;Guckin? Couldn&apos;t hold a candle to him.
O yes. Yes. But that choirboy style. No. Joe Maas was the boy. McGuck. Joe Maas. Massboy, choirboy.</p>
<p> Bloom tenderly over liverless bacon saw the suffering face before him.
Backache. Not making much hand of that pie. Best value in Dublin.
<a name="un5011ae" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5011ae">Characteristic</a>
of him. Bright&apos;s disease. Next item on the programme. Voice too. <u>Down
among the Dead men.</u> Appropriate. Powdered bread pills. Worth a guinea a box.
Stave it off awhile. Power. So particular about his drink. Fecking matches from
counters to save then squander a sovereign in dribs and drabs. not as much as
would dust a fiddle when he&apos;s wanted! Queer types.</p>
<p> Never would Richie Goulding forget that night. As long as he lived, never.
He was in the gallery of the old Royal with little Peake. And when the first note. Speech paused on his lips.</p>
<p> Coming out with a whopper now. Rhapsodies about damn all Greatest liar
unhung. Believes them himself. Does really.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Which air is that? Mr Bloom asked.</p>
<p> Richie Goulding cocked his lips apout. A low incipient note sweet murmured:
all. A thrush. A throstle. His breath, sweet, good teeth he has for all that,
fluted with plaintive woe. Is lost now. All is lost. Mournful he pleaded, surrender,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 17}</font>
<br> fall,<a target="foot" id="fmz0049">&ordm;</a> is lost.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom bent ear, turning a fringe of doyley down under the breadtray.
Order. All now lost. In sleep she went to him. Innocent sleep. Still hold her
back. Wake her. no giddiness They do not know how near. Too late. Jauntyjingle.
She longed to go. That&apos;s why she went. A woman. Stop the sea. Yes. All is lost.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A beautiful air, Mr Bloom said and drank cider. I know it.</p>
<p> Never in all his life had Richie Goulding.</p>
<p> He knows it too or feels. Wise child that knows her father. Sharp man that Dedalus is. And me?</p>
<p> Bloom askance over liverless bacon saw the suffering face before him.
Rollicking Richie once. His old stale jokes. Wagging his ear. Napkin ring in eye</p>
<p> Piano again. Sounds better than last time. Tuned probably. Stopped.</p>
<p> Dollard and Cowley still urged the lingering singer out with it.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Out with it, Simon.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; it, Simon I am most deeply obliged by your kind
solicitations. I have money but if you will lend me your attention I shall
endeavour to sing to you I will sing you of a heart bowed down.</p>
<p> By the sandwich bell in screening shadow Mina Douce, her bronze and rose, a
lady&apos;s grace, gave and withheld: and in cool seaglaucous by the tankards
Lydia Kennedy {sunned} her pinnacles of gold.</p>
<p> The harping chords of prelude closed: a chord, longdrawn, expectant, drew the voice its way.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>When first I saw that form endearing</u></p>
<p> Richie Goulding turned:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Si Dedalus&apos; voice, he said</p>
<p> Mr Bloom signed to bald Pat to set the door of the bar ajar. So. Right: so.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Sorrow from me seemed to depart</u></p>
<p> Through the hush of air a voice sang to them, low, not rain, not leaves in
murmur, like no voice of strings or reeds or what do you call them dulcimers
touching their still ears, still hearts, remembered lives. It was good to hear:
sorrow from them seemed to depart when first they heard: when first they
<br><font color="green">{ms, 18}</font>
<br> saw<a target="foot" id="fmz0050">&ordm;</a> mercy of beauty, and heard her first merciful a lovesoft word.</p>
<p> Love that is singing. Love&apos;s old sweet song Mr Bloom unwound slowly the
elastic band of his packet Love&apos;s old sweet song and wound it in a skein
round four &mdash; fingers and stretched it and relaxed and wound it round his
troubled (?) double and in fourfold, in octave and
<a name="un4037h" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4037h">gyved</a> them fast.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Full of hope and all delighted</u></p>
<p> Tenors get women by the score. But He can&apos;t sing for nuts. Your head it
simply swurls. Perfumed for him. What perfume does your wife. I want to know.
Jingle, jingle, jingle. Stop. Knock. Last Look at mirror: always before she
answers, the door. The hall. There? Kiss? how do you do? I do well. Phial of
<a name="un1032fe" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1032fe">kissing comfits</a>
she has: sweetens the breath. Hand felt for the opulent.</p>
<p> Alas! The voice rose sighing in modulation shining loud, full, proud.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Alas &apos;twas idle dreaming</u>&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> Glorious voice he has still. Wore out his wife: now sings Silly man! He
could have made his oceans of money. All like that. If he doesn&apos;t break
down overstrung nerves: drink. Must be abstemious singer.</p>
<p> It welled its tenderness, slow swelling, full and throbbed. Give all! Take!
Throb, a throb, a throb, pulsing, proud, erect.</p>
<p> It&apos;s not the words. It&apos;s the thing behind. Bloom looped unlooped, noded disnoded.</p>
<p> A flood of warm sweet secretness flowed out in music, in desire, the dark
invisible sinful invading. Tup. From pores dilated. Tup. From sluices pouring
gushes. Pour, flood, gush, flow, throb again. Language of love. A ray of hope is
beaming. Lydia for Lidwell unsqueaked a cork.</p>
<p> Martha it is. Coincidence. Must write. Can&apos;t write. Accept my little
pres. Lionel&apos;s song. The Lovely name you have. She&apos;s a silly. I called
you naughty boy. Still the name. Martha. How strange.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 19}</font> </p>
<p> The<a target="foot" id="fmz0051">&ordm;</a> voice returned. Weaker but
unwearied it sang again how first it saw that form endearing, how sorrow then
departed, how look and form and word charmed him and won his heart</p>
<p> First night at Mat Dillon&apos;s I saw her. Yellow and black lace, she wore.
Her voice. Then musical chairs. We two the last. After her. Round and round.
Slow. Quick. And round. Halt. She sat. Her eyes. <u>Waiting</u> she sang. I
turned her music. Full voice of sun vines and flowers, something like oleander.
bosom I saw, both full, throat warbling. When first I saw. She thanked me. Spanish eyes. Luring. Ah, alluring.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Martha! Ah, Martha!</u></p>
<p> Quitting all languor He cried in grief, in passion to love to return, with
deepening and rising chords of harmony. In loneliness that she should know,
should feel. For her he waited. Where? Somewhere.</p>
<p> Wish I could see his face. Explain better. Why that barber last time always
looked in the glass when I spoke. His face, my face</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Co-ome, thou lost one! Co-ome, thou dear one!</p>
<p> Alone one love, one hope, one comfort. Martha! Chestnote Don&apos;t spin it
out too long. Long breath he has. Breath of long life.</p>
<p> It soared a silver orb, a bird, it held its flight, Sustained speeding a
swift pure cry, highsoaring, leaped serene high resplendent, crowned and aflame
high in the effulgence symbolistic, high, of the etherial bosom, high, of the
vast irradiation everywhere all all soaring, round about the all, her the endlessnessnessness.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; To me.</p>
<p> Consumed.</p>
<p> Come. Well sung. All clapped. She ought to. Come. To me, to him, to her, you too, me, us.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Bravo. Clapclap. Good man, Simon. Clappyclapclap. Encore.
Clapclipclapclap. Sound as a bell, Simon. Bravo, Simon. Clopclopclap. Encore.
Enclap, said, cried, clapped all, Ben Dollard, Lydia Kennedy, Father Cowley,
Mina Douce, Lydia Kennedy, two gentlemen with two tankards, Ben Dollard, George
Lidwell, first gent with tank and bronze Miss Douce and gold miss Kennedy.</p>
<p> Blazes Boylan&apos;s smart tan
<br><font color="green">{ms, 20}</font>
<br> shoes<a target="foot" id="fmz0052">&ordm;</a> creaked on the barfloor as he
strode, as said before. Jingle by monuments of sir John Gray, of admiral Horatio
Nelson, of Father Theobald Matthew, jaunted, as said before. Atrot, in heat,
warmseated. Cloche. Sonnez la. Cloche. Sonnez la. Slower the mare went up the
hill by the Rotunda, Rutland square. Too slow for Boylan, Blazes Boylan, impatience Boylan jogged the mare.</p>
<p> An afterclang of chords closed, died on the air made richer.</p>
<p> And Richie Goulding drank his Power and Bloom his cider drank and Lidwell
drank his Jameson and the second gentleman under miss Douce&apos;s eyes said
they would partake of two two of miss Kennedy&apos;s tankards if she would not
mind. She smirked with coral lips, disserving, at first and second gentleman. She did not mind.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A week in gaol, Ben Dollard said, on bread and water.
Then you&apos;d sing, Simon like a garden thrush Simon.</p>
<p> The singer Simon laughed. Father Cowley played. Mina Kennedy served. The
second gentleman paid. Tom Kernan strutted in. Miss Douce, admired, admired.</p>
<p> Richie, admiring, descanted on th that man&apos;s glorious voice. He
remembered one night. He would never forget that night. Si sang <u>&apos;Twas
rank and fame</u> In Lambert &apos;twas Good God, he never heard in all his life
a note like that he never did then false one we had better part so clear so God
he never heard since love lives not a clinking voice lives not ask Lambert he will tell you too.</p>
<p> Richie Goulding, a flush struggling in his pale, told Mr Bloom face of the
night Si in Ned Lambert&apos;s house Dedalus
<br><font color="green">{ms, 21}</font>
<br> sang<a target="foot" id="fmz0053">&ordm;</a> <u>&apos;Twas Rank and Fame</u>.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom listened while Richie Goulding told him, Mr Bloom, of the night,
he, Richie Goulding, heard him, Si Dedalus, sing <u>&apos;Twas Rank and Fame</u> in his, Ned Lambert&apos;s, house.</p>
<p> Brothers-in-law. Relations Rift in the lute at present. Treats him with
contempt. See. He admires him all the more. The night Si sang. Wonderful it is
human voice, more than all others. Two tiny chords.</p>
<p> That voice was a lamentation. Her name too. And I am waiting. Calmer now.
It&apos;s in the silence after that you feel. Vibrations. Now silent air.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom
<a name="un4037h" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4037h">ungyved</a> his
crisscrossed hands and, with slack fingers, plucked the slender catgut thong. It
buzzed. He spanned and plucked. It twanged. While Richie Goulding talked of
Barraclough&apos;s of voice production. While Tom Kernan harking back in a kind
of retrospective arrangement talked to Father Cowley, who played a voluntary,
who nodded as he played. While big Ben Dollard talked with Simon Dedalus who nodded as he smoked, who smoked.</p>
<p> Thou lost one. All songs are about that. Yet more he stretched. Twang. It
snapped. Cruel it seems. Yet too much happy bores. Let people get fond of each
other lure them on. Then tear them asunder. Death. Explosion. Knock on the head.
Outohelloutofthat. Human life that is. Dignam. Five bob I gave. And I. And one
day she with. Suffer then. Snivel. Big eyes. Looking at nothing. Hair uncombed.</p>
<p> Jingle into Dorset street jinglejingled.</p>
<p> Miss Douce withdrew her satiny arm, reproachful, pleased.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Don&apos;t make half so free, she said, till we&apos;re better acquainted.</p>
<p> A tankard gentleman told gold Miss Kennedy: she asked him was that so. He
told her it was so. His friend told her also it was so. She asked him was it so.</p>
<p> Better write it here. Quills in the postoffice all chewed and crooked.</p>
<p> Bald Pat, at a sign, drew nigh. A pen and ink. He went. A pad to blot. Lot of ground he must cover in the day</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, Mr Bloom said, teasing the curling catgut band. It
certainly is. Few lines will do. My present. All that Italian music is. Who is
this wrote? Know the name you know better. Take out sheet notepaper envelope.
Unconcerned. It&apos;s so <a name="un5011ae" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5011ae">characteristic</a>.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The grandest number in the whole
<br><font color="green">{ms, 22}</font>
<br> opera,<a target="foot" id="fmz0054">&ordm;</a> Richie Goulding said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It is, said Mr Bloom.</p>
<p> Numbers it is. All the sounds when you come to think. Two multiplied by two
divided by half. Two is twice one. The vibrations. Chords. Those are one plus
two plus six is seven. Can do anything with figures, juggle them about, always
find out this equal to that the symmetry of the cemetery. And you think
you&apos;re listening to the etherial. But suppose you said it like seven times
nine minus x is thirtyfive thousand. Fall quite flat. It&apos;s on account of the sound.</p>
<p> Instance he&apos;s playing now. Might be what you like till you hear the
words. Want to listen sharp every note. Hard. Begin: then hear chords somewhere
else: get kind of lost.
<a name="un5011f" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5011f">The time makes the

said he, you&apos;ll sing no more lovesongs. Sir Tom did) the accompanist wove
music slow, ceasing could not. She held it to his ear. He hears. He heard.
Wonderful. She held it to her own. And gold Miss approached to hear.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom, through the open door, saw a shell held at their ears and heard
more faintly that they heard, each for herself alone, then each for other,
hearing, the plash of waves, loudly, a silent roar.</p>
<p> Bronze by a weary gold they listened paled(?) in the sifted light.</p>
<p> Her ear too is a shell, the peeping lobe there. Hair braided over. Shell
with seaweed. Why do they hide their ears with hair. Turks Find the way in. A
cave. No admittance except on business.</p>
<p> The sea they think they hear. Singing and a roar. The blood it is. Singing
in the ears sometimes. Blood is a sea, sea with purple islands.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 25}</font> </p>
<p> Wonderful<a target="foot" id="fmz0058">&ordm;</a> really. So clear. Again
George Lidwell held its murmur, hearing, and laid it most gently by.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What are the wild waves saying? he asked her, smiling.</p>
<p> Charming and smiling and unanswering Lydia on Lidwell smiled.</p>
<p> By Larry, my bold Larry, by Larry O&apos;Rourke&apos;s went Boylan.</p>
<p> From the abandoned shell Miss Kennedy glided to tankards waiting. Miss Douce
was not so lonely, archly her arching head let Lidwell know. It was exquisite
walking in the moonlight by the sea. With whom? he asked her. Not alone? No,
nobly she denied. With a gentleman friend.</p>
<p> Bob Cowley&apos;s twinkling fingers in the treble played again. The landlord
has the prior claim. a little time. Long John. Big Ben. He played lightly a
light bright tinkling measure, for tripping ladies, arch and smiling, and for
their gallants, gentlemen friends. One: one, one, one, one, one: two, one, three, four.</p>
<p> Sea, wind, leaves, thunder, water, cows lowing, the cattle market, bleating,
cocks, hens, birds, hens no snakes hiss. There&apos;s music everywhere.
Ruttledge&apos;s door: ee, cree. That&apos;s only noise. Minuet of <u>Don
Giovanni</u> he&apos;s playing. Nice that is. Ree: ree, ree, ree, ree, ree: tareedarum.</p>
<p> Joy: I can feel it is. Never have written though. Other joy, my joy. Still
both joy all. Mere fact of music shows. Often thought she was in the dumps. Then
she began to lilt. Only when you are. Minuet in a musicroom: misery outside. Green starving peasants</p>
<p> Jigjog stopped. A dandy tan shoe of dandy Boylan descended lightly dandily.</p>
<p> Chamber music. Course you could make a joke. &apos;Tis a kind of music I
often thought when she. Acoustics, that is. Tinkling Because the acoustic the
resonance changes according as the. Like those rhapsodies of Liszt&apos;s:
Hungarian. Pearls. Drops. Rain. Diddleiddle addleaddle ooddleooddle. Lum lum. Hiss. Maybe now.

<p> The voice of warning, of solemnity, told them the youth had entered that
lonely hall, how solemn sounded his footfall there, told them the gloomy
chamber, told them the priest vested in an oaken chair.</p>
<p> Decent soul bit addled in the head. Bass. Thinks he&apos;ll win a prize in

<p> Listen. Bloom listened, Richie Goulding listened to Ben Dollard. Deaf Pat listened by the door again.</p>

<p> The voice of penance and grief came slow

<p> Latin. That holds them fast. The priest this morning with the communion
things. The priest in the mortuary. Belly like a posioned pup. With his

<p> They listened. The false priest. The tankards and miss Kennedy. George

<p> The sighing voice of sorrow sang. Ben&apos;s

She&apos;s lost in pity. To, fro, to, fro over the polished knob (she knows my

<p> By deaf straining ear in the doorway Mr Bloom passed out.</p>
<p> At Geneva barrack he died, that young man. At Passage was his body laid. The
voice of the mournful chanter called to prayer.</p>
<p> By rose, by satin bosom, by the fondling hand, by slops, by empties, by
popped corks, greeting in going, past eyes and maidenhair, bronze and faint
gold, went Bloom, soft Bloom, I feel so lonely Bloom.</p>
<p> Pray for him, still prayed the voice of Dollard. You who hear in peace.
Breathe a prayer for him, drop a tear. Good men, good people. He was the croppy boy.</p>
<p> Bloom in the hallway heard the growls and roars of bravo and fat
backclapping, heard the treading of their feet. Going in all for a swill to wash it down. Just avoided that</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Come on, Ben, Mr Dedalus said. By Christ, you&apos;re as good as ever you were.</p>

<p> Miss Kennedy approached her lips near to the nearer ear of tankard one.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Mr Dollard, her Lydia lips whispered low.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Dollard, the tankard murmured.</p>
<p> He murmured that he knew the name. The name was familiar to him, that is to
say. That was to say he had heard the name of. Dollard, was it? Dollard, yes.
Yes, her lips said more loudly Mr Dollard. He sang that song lovely, Lydia said.
Dollard. And The <u>Last Rose of Summer</u> was a lovely one. Lydia loved that. Tankard loved it.</p>

All ears. Not lose a quaver. Eyes shut. Head nodding in time. Dotty Always

<p> Under the sandwich bell on a bier of bread lay one lost lonely. Bloom alone.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Very, he stared. The lower register for choice.</p>
<p> Bloom went by Barry&apos;s. Wish I could. Wait. Twentyfour solicitors in
that house. Counted them. Overcrowded. Litigation. Love one another. Parchment.</p>
<p> But for example the chap that wallop the big drum. His vocation in life.
Mickey Rooney&apos;s band Wonder how it first struck him. Sitting at home with
it in an armchair after dinner. Pom. Pompedy. Pom. Jolly for the wife.
Asses&apos; skins. Welt them black and blue through life, then after death. Pom.
Wallop. Seems to be bocksheesh or I mean kismet. Instruments. Even a comb and
tissue paper you can. Molly in her shift in Lombard street west, hair down. Girl still she was then. Time.</p>

know. Wait. Towncrier or a bailiff. You can hear the music all the same only it&apos;s all one pom pom pompedy note.</p>

Cheap. Let her pass. Course everything is dear if you don&apos;t want it.
That&apos;s what good salesman is. Makes you buy what you don&apos;t want.</p>
<p> Looking, Mr Bloom earnestly viewed a gallant hero in Lionel Marks&apos;s
