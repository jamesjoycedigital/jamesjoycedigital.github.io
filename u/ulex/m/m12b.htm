<p> Bronze<a target="foot" id="fmz0033">&ordm;</a> by gold Miss Douce&apos;s
head by Miss Kennedy&apos;s head, over the crossblind of the bar, heard the viceregal hoofs go by, ringing steel.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is that her? Miss Kennedy said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, Miss Douce said, sitting beside his ex. Pearl grey and crushed strawberry.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Exquisite contrast, miss Kennedy said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Look at the fellow in the tall silk, Miss Douce said eagerly (all agog)</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Who? Where? Who is he? miss Kennedy asked</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; In the second carriage, Miss Douce said, her wet lips
laughing in the sun. He&apos;s looking. Mind till I see.</p>
<p> She ran (?) to the farther corner (of the window), flattening her face
against the pane in a halo of her <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">ho</span></span> hurried breath.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He&apos;s killed looking back, she said gaily. O wept! Aren&apos;t men frightful idiots?</p>
<p> Miss Kennedy sauntered sadly from the light, curving a loose air behind an
ear. Sauntering sadly, gold no more, she twined a hair. Sadly she twined sauntering her hair behind her ear.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It&apos;s them has the fine times, sadly she said.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom went by &mdash; bearing in his breastpocket, sweets of sin, bearing
in his memory sweet sinful words. For Raoul.</p>
<p> The boots came from the hall and planked his tray of quivering china.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; There&apos;s your teas, he said.</p>
<p> Miss Kennedy with grace transposed the teatray
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">down</span></span> to rest on an
upturned lithia crate, safe from eyes.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What is it? the boots asked unmannerly</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Find out, Miss Douce retorted, leaving her spyingpoint.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Your beau is it?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I&apos;ll complain to Mrs de Massey on you, haughty
bronze Miss Douce replied, if I hear any more of your impertinent insolence</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Imperthnththnththn, the boots&apos;s snout sniffed rudely, as he retreated as he had come.</p>
<p> And Miss Douce said</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That fellow is most aggravating. Little
<br><font color="green">{ms, 2}</font>
<br> brat.<a target="foot" id="fmz0034">&ordm;</a> If he doesn&apos;t conduct
himself I&apos;ll wring his ear a yard long.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Take no notice, Miss Kennedy rejoined</p>
<p> She poured tea in a teacup then back in the teapot. They cowered under the
reef of the counter, on footstools, waiting for the tea to draw.
<a name="un1015i" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1015i">They pawed their
blouses, two and nine a yard</a>, waiting for their tea to draw, and
<a name="un1015i" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1015i">two and seven</a>.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Am I much sunburned? Miss Douce unbloused her neck.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, said miss Kennedy. It gets brown after. Did you try
the cherry laurel water with the borax?</p>
<p> Miss Douce half stood to see her skin askance in the mirror where hock and
claret glasses shimmered and in their midst a shell.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And leave it to my hands, she said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Why don&apos;t you try that with the glycerine? Miss Kennedy asked.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Those things only bring out a rash, miss Douce said,
bidding adieu to her images and sitting. I asked that old bagpipes in Boyd&apos;s for something for my skin.</p>
<p> Miss Kennedy, pouring fulldrawn tea, grimaced and prayed:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, don&apos;t remind me of him for mercy&apos; sake.</p>
<p> Miss Douce entreated:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But wait till I tell you.</p>
<p> Sweettea Miss Kennedy, having poured fulldrawn tea and milk, plugged both two ears with little fingers.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, don&apos;t, she cried.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I won&apos;t listen, she cried.</p>
<p> Miss Douce grunted in a snuffy voice:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; For your what? says he</p>
<p> Miss Kennedy uncorked her ear to speak, to hear but said but prayed again:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Don&apos;t let me think of him or I&apos;ll expire. The
awful old wretch. That night in the Antient Concert Rooms.</p>
<p> She sipped distastefully her brew, hot tea, a sip she sipped, sweet tea.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Here he was, Miss Douce said, cocking her
<br><font color="green">{ms, 3}</font>
<br> bronze<a target="foot" id="fmz0035">&ordm;</a> head three quarters, ruffling her nostrils: Huf! Huf!</p>
<p> A high shriek of laughter flew from Miss Kennedy&apos;s throat, shrieking
still while Miss Douce
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">blew</span></span> snorted ever
through her nostrils quivering like a snout in quest.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, Miss Kennedy cried, shrieking. Will you ever forget his goggle eye?</p>
<p> Miss Douce stifled with laugh and laughter, shouting:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And your other eye!</p>
<p> Mr Bloom&apos;s dark eyes read Aaron Figatner&apos;s name (Why do I think
always Figather? Gathering figs
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">because</span></span>) and Prosper
Lor&eacute;&apos;s huguenot. His dark eyes went by by Bassi&apos;s blessed
virgins, comely and whiterobed, come to me. By went his dark eyes. Sweets of
sin. Sweet are the sweets. Sweets to the sweet.</p>
<p> In a giggling peal their young unbridled voices blended. They threw their
heads back, bronze and gold, to let free fly their laughter, screaming signals to each other, high piercing notes.</p>
<p> Panting, sighing, sighing fordone, their mirth died down.</p>
<p> Miss Kennedy took her cup again, raised, drank a mouthful when miss Douce,
bending over the teatray, ruffled her nose and rolled droll fattened eyes. Miss
Kennedy, stooping her pinnacles of fair hair until her tortoiseshell napecomb
showed, spluttered with her mouth her tea, choking in tea and laughter, coughing with choking, crying:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O greasy
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">nose</span></span> eyes! Imagine
being married to a man like that! The bit of beard!</p>
<p> Miss Douce gave vent to a splendid yell, a full woman&apos;s
<br><font color="green">{ms, 4}</font>
<br> yell,<a target="foot" id="fmz0036">&ordm;</a> delight, joy, indignation.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Married to the greasy nose! she yelled</p>
<p> <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Hi</span></span> Shrill with
deep laughter, gold
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">with</span></span> after bronze,
they urged each other to peal after peal, bronzegold, goldbronze, shrill, deep,
to laughter after laughter. Then laughed more, exhausted, breathless, their
shaken heads, braided and pinnacled, glossycombed against the counter ledge. All
flushed, (O! panting, sweating, breathless.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O Lord, Miss Douce said, sighed to her jumping rose. I
wish I hadn&apos;t laughed so much. O Lord! I feel all wet.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, Miss Douce! Miss Kennedy protested. O you horrid thing!</p>
<p> And flushed yet more (you horrid!), more goldenly.</p>
<p> By Cantwell&apos;s offices walked Mr Bloom, by Ceppi&apos;s virgins, bright
with oils. Nannetti&apos;s father sold those things, wheedling ways. Religion
pays. Must see him for that par. Eat first. I want. Not yet. At four she said.
Where eat? The Clarence, Dolphin.
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">O</span></span> Walk on. For
Raoul. Eat. If I make five pounds. Those ads. Not yet. The sweets of sin.</p>
<p> More goldenly.</p>
<p> Mr Dedalus <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">came</span></span>
strolled into the bar chips, picking chips off one of his rocky thumbnails. Chips. He strolled.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, how do you do, Miss Douce?</p>
<p> He held her hand genteelly over the counter.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Back again. And how did you enjoy your holidays?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Tiptop.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I hope you had nice weather in Rostrevor.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Gorgeous, Miss Douce said. Look at the holy show I am. Lying out on the strand every day.</p>
<p> Comely, come. That brings the fellows in. The rakes. Her white.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 5}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That<a target="foot" id="fmz0037">&ordm;</a> was very
naughty of you Mr Dedalus said, shaking his head indulgently. Tempting us poor simple men.</p>
<p> Miss Douce pulled back her satin arm</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, go away, she said. I&apos;m sure you&apos;re very simple.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well now I am, Mr Dedalus mused. I looked so simple in
the cradle that they christened me simple Simon. So
<a name="un4016g" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4016g">I was told</a> at all events.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, I don&apos;t think, Miss Douce made answer. And what did the doctor order today?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Whatever you say yourself, Mr Dedalus said. I&apos;ll
take. Well, let me see now. No, I think I&apos;ll trouble you for some fresh water and a half glass of whisky.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; With the greatest alacrity, Miss Douce agreed.</p>
<p> With grace of alacrity she turned herself toward the mirror and tapped a
bright measure of gold whisky from the crystal keg. Mr Dedalus took forth pouch
and pipe and blew through the flue two husky fifenotes.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; By Jove, he said. I often wanted to see Rostrevor. But a
long threatening comes at last, they say. Yes, Yes.</p>
<p> He fingered navy cut into the bowl nodding as she set his drink before him.
Miss Douce polishing a glass, trilled:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>O, Idolores, queen of the eastern seas</u></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Was Mr Lidwell in today?</p>
<p> In came Lenehan. Round him looked Lenehan. Mr Bloom reached Essex bridge. Mr
Bloom crossed Essex bridge. Bloom. Old Bloom. The bloom is on the rye.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He was in at lunchtime, miss Douce said</p>
<p> Lenehan came forward
<br><font color="green">{ms, 6}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Has Mr<a target="foot" id="fmz0038">&ordm;</a> Boylan been looking for me?</p>
<p> He asked. She answered:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, Mr Lenehan. Miss Kennedy, was Mr Boylan here while I was upstairs?</p>
<p> She asked. She answered, her poised teacup in her hands, her gaze
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">on what she read</span></span> upon her page:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, he was not.</p>
<p> Miss Douce <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">flick</span></span>
composed her white tulle front. Miss Kennedy, heard, not seen, read on. Lenehan
wound his short body round the sandwich bell, saying to her voice:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Peep! Who&apos;s in the <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">p</span></span> corner?</p>
<p> No glance rewarding him, he bade her mind her stops. Mocking he bade her
read only the black ones, round o and crooked ess.</p>
<p> She read, unglancing. He read to her by rote a solfa fable, plappering flatly.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ah fox met ah stork. Said thee fox to thee
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">f</span></span> stork:</p>
<p> Adown the shank a note flew clear and free.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Will you put down your bill into my troth and pull up ah bone?</p>
<p> He droned in vain. Miss Douce turned aside. He sighed:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ah me! O my!</p>
<p> He greeted Mr Dedalus who nodded.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Greetings to the famous son of a famous father.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Who may he be? Mr Dedalus asked</p>
<p> Lenehan opened his arms most genially.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Can you ask? he asked. Stephen the bard.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I see, Mr Dedalus said, laying down his filled pipe. I didn&apos;t recognise
<br><font color="green">{ms, 7}</font>
<br> him<a target="foot" id="fmz0039">&ordm;</a> for the moment. I hear he is
keeping very select company. Are you a friend of his?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I quaffed the nectarbowl with him this very day, Lenehan
said, in Mooney&apos;s en ville and in Mooney&apos;s sur mer. He had received the rhino for the labour of his muse.</p>
<p> He <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">laughed</span></span>
smiled to Miss Douce&apos;s listening eyes, and lips:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The &eacute;lite of Erin hung upon his lips. The pundit
profound, Hugh <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">mac</span></span>
MacHugh, Dublin&apos;s most brilliant editor and that minstrel boy of the wild
wet west known to the muses as O&apos;Madden Burke.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That must have been highly diverting, Mr Dedalus said. I see.</p>
<p> He lifted his glass and drank. He looked towards the saloon door:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You have moved the piano, he said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The tuner was in today, Miss Douce replied, tuning it for
the smoking concert. And I never heard such an exquisite player.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is that a fact? Mr Dedalus said</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Didn&apos;t he, miss Kennedy? The real classical. And
blind too, the poor fellow. Not twenty years old I&apos;m sure he was</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is that a fact, Mr Dedalus said.</p>
<p> He strayed away</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; So sad to look at his face, Miss Douce condoled.</p>
<p> Tink to her pity cried a diner&apos;s bell.
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">She went to</span></span> To the
door of the diningroom came bald Pat, the waiter.
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">The diner wanted
lager.</span></span> Lager for diner. Lager without alacrity she served.</p>
<p> <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">In Tobin&apos;s Mr Bloom bought</span></span>
<br><font color="green">{ms, 8}</font>
<br> Two<a target="foot" id="fmz0040">&ordm;</a> sheets of notepaper and two
envelopes Mr Bloom bought in Tobin&apos;s and beyond the poster of a swaying
smoking mermaid he saw a hat on Essex bridge riding a jaunting car. Jingling, it
jaunted from the bridge to Ormond quay. Again. Follow. Risk it. Follow. Four, she said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A penny, the shopgirl
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">said</span></span> dared to say.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Of course&nbsp;&hellip; I was forgetting&nbsp;&hellip; Excuse.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And five.</p>
<p> In drowsy silence gold bent on her page.</p>
<p> From the saloon a call came, long in dying: a call again,
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">longer in dying</span></span> from
the tuningfork struck again by Mr Dedalus. Poised lightly on the pianocase it
purely throbbed, softer and softlier, its buzzing prongs. Longer in dying call.</p>
<p> Pat paid for diner&apos;s lager. Over the tray and bottle with Miss Douce he whispered in the diningroom door.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>The bright stars fade,</u>&nbsp;&hellip;.</p>
<p> A voiceless song sang from within, singing:</p>
<p class="deep">&nbsp;&hellip; <u>the morn is breaking</u></p>
<p> A duodene of birdnotes chirruped bright answer. Brightly, the keys all
twinkling, linked, all harpsichording, called to a voice to sing the strains of
dewy morn, of youth, of love&apos;s leavetaking, of dewy morning</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>The dewdrops pearl</u>&nbsp;&hellip;.</p>
<p> Lenehan&apos;s lips over the counter blew a low whistle of decoy</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But look this way, he said. Rose of Castile.</p>
<p> She rose and closed her reading. Rose of Castile:
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">she</span></span> looked dreamily on her bosom&apos;s rose.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Did she fall or was she pushed? asked Lenehan.</p>
<p> She answered, slighting him:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ask no questions and you&apos;ll hear no lies
<br><font color="green">{ms, 9}</font> </p>
<p> Blazes<a target="foot" id="fmz0041">&ordm;</a> Boylan&apos;s tan shoes
creaked on the barfloor as he strode. knew and hailed him:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; See the conquering hero comes</p>
<p> Between the car and the barwindow went Mr Bloom, catwalking. See me he
might. The seat he sat on. Warm. Towards Richie Goulding&apos;s legal bag lifted aloft saluting.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>And if from thee</u>&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I heard you were round, Blazes Boylan said. What is it?</p>
<p> He touched to Miss Kennedy the slanted rim of his strawhat, she smiled up on
him, her reading closed and far, preening her hair, her bosom and her rose.</p>
<p> Blazes Boylan smartly bespake their potions.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What&apos;s your cry? Glass of bitter? Glass of bitter,
please, and a sloe gin for me. Wire in yet?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Not yet, said Lenehan.</p>
<p> Father Cowley in the sheriff&apos;s doorway. Avoid. Goulding a chance.
Hello. Where are you off to? Where? Ormond. Diningroom. Can&apos;t see me there.
Sit tight. Still be near and hear. At four. I&apos;ll join you. Come along.</p>
<p> Miss Douce reached high to take a flagon, stretching her arm, her bust</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O! O! cried Lenehan at every reach. O. O</p>
<p> <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Bust</span></span> But easily
she seized her prey and led it low in triumph.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Why don&apos;t you grow? said Lenehan.</p>
<p> Miss Douce, dealing from her oblique jar thick syrupy
liquor<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">, archly</span></span> for
his lips, looked as it flowed and syrupped with her voice:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Fine goods in small parcels.
<br><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">&mdash; Here&apos;s fortune,
Blazes <font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font></span></span></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Here&apos;s fortune, Blazes Boylan said.</p>
<p> He pitched a broad crown on
<br><font color="green">{ms, 10}</font>
<br> counter.<a target="foot" id="fmz0042">&ordm;</a></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Hold on, said Lenehan, till I&nbsp;&hellip;.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Fortune, he said, lifting his fresh drawn ale.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Sceptre will win hands down, he said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I plunged a bit, Blazes Boylan said. Not for my own fancy. Friend of mine.</p>
<p> Lenehan still drank and smiled at the tilted ale. Miss Douce&apos;s lips all
but hummed, the oceansong her lips had trilled. Idolores. Eastern seas.</p>
<p> Clockface clacked.</p>
<p> She took the coin, struck the cash register. It clanged. Fair one of Egypt.
She teased and sorted in the still. Look to the west, she hummed. And handed ringing coins in change. For me.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What time is it? asked Blazes Boylan, drinking. Four?</p>
<p> Lenehan, his eyes hungering on Miss Douce&apos;s humming bust tugged Blazes Boylan&apos;s cocca of his coat.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Let&apos;s hear the time, he said</p>
<p> The legal bag of Richie Goulding led
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Mr</span></span> Bloom by blooms
flowered tables. Aimless he chose with agitated aim a table near the bardoor. He
sat with Richie Goulding. Near. At four. Is he not? Forgotten. Wait.</p>
<p> Miss Douce&apos;s sparkling eyes eyed Blazes&apos; slanting hat</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Go on, pressed Lenehan. He never heard it.</p>
<p class="deep">&hellip;. <u>to Flora&apos;s lips did hie</u></p>
<p> High, the high note pealed in the treble clear</p>
<p> Miss Douce, communing with
<br><font color="green">{ms, 11}</font>
<br> her<a target="foot" id="fmz0043">&ordm;</a> rose that fell and rose, sought
Blazes Boylan&apos;s bold blue tie and eyes.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Please, please.</p>
<p> He pleaded over returning phrases of avowal.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>I could not leave thee</u>&nbsp;&hellip;.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Afterwits, Miss Douce said coyly.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, now, urged Lenehan. <u>Sonnez la cloche!</u> Please do.</p>
<p> Sudden she bent. Two
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">kindled</span></span> kindling faces watched her bend.</p>
<p> Quavering the chords of the piano strayed from the air, found it again and lost, and found it</p>
<p> She nipped a peak of skirt above her knee, taunted them still with wilful eyes.</p>
<p> Smack. She set free <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">a
warm</span></span> her elastic garter smack in rebound against her warm smart thigh.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>La cloche!</u> cried Lenehan, kindled, content. I
taught her. Trained by owner. No sawdust there.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You&apos;re the essence of vulgarity, she said, turning her supercilious gaze.</p>
<p> Boylan tossed to fat lips a tiny chalice, sucking the last thick syrupy
drops. His spellbound eyes went after her, her gliding head where it went down
the bar by mirrors and hock and claret glasses, where it concerted, bronze with
gold, with sad Miss Kennedy, whispering.</p>
<p class="deep">&nbsp;&hellip;.. <u>sweetheart, goodbye!</u></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I&apos;m off, said Blazes Boylan.</p>
<p> He slid his glass away and gathered change.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Where? said Lenehan, drinking quickly. Got the horn? Wait. I&apos;m coming.</p>
<p> He gulped his all.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Come on to blazes! Blazes Boylan said.</p>
<p> He went.</p>
<p> Lenehan followed the hasty creaking shoes but stood by neatly as a bulky and a slender form
<br><font color="green">{ms, 12}</font>
<br> crossed<a target="foot" id="fmz0044">&ordm;</a> the dark threshold to salute:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; How do you do, Mr Dollard?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Eh? Ben Dollard&apos;s vague bass answered, turning an
instant from Father Cowley&apos;s
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">ear</span></span> trouble. He
won&apos;t give you any trouble. I know long John. We&apos;ll put a barleystraw
in <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">that</span></span> Judas&apos; ear.</p>
<p> Sighing, Mr Dedalus came through the saloon, a finger soothing an eyelid.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Hoho, we will, Ben Dollard yodled. Come on, Simon. Give us a stave. We heard the piano.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What&apos;s that? Mr Dedalus said. I was only vamping.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Come on, come on, Ben Dollard said. Begone, dull care. Come, Bob!</p>
<p> He ambled in advance to the saloon. He plumped himself upon the stool. His
gouty paws plumped heavy chords. He stopped abrupt.</p>
<p> A jingle tinkle jaunted. Bloom heard:
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">and sobbed</span></span> the
little sound: he heard: a sob of soft breath on the
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">hyacin</span></span> narcissus.
He&apos;s gone. Jingling it jaunted. Hear.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Love and War, Mr Dedalus said. God be with the past, Ben.</p>
<p> Miss Douce&apos;s brave eyes, unregarded, turned, smitten by sunlight. Gone.
Smiling (who knows?), smitten (the light is strong) she lowered the blind. She
drew, smiling, upon their bronze and gold, a cool seagreen depth of shadow, eau de Nil.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Poor old Goodwin was the pianist that night, Father
Cowley remembered. There was a slight difference of opinion between himself and the piano.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A symposium all his own, Mr Dedalus said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; God, do you remember? Ben Dollard said, turning from the
keyboard. And, by God, I had no wedding garment</p>
<p> They laughed all three. He had
<br><font color="green">{ms, 13}</font>
<br> no<a target="foot" id="fmz0045">&ordm;</a> wedding garment.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Bloom turned in handy, Mr Dedalus said. Where&apos;s my pipe, by the way?</p>
<p> He wandered back to the bar. Father Cowley laughed again</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, I saved the situation, Ben, what? he said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You did, Ben Dollard said. By God, I remember that. And
those tight trousers too. By God, that was a brilliant idea of yours, Bob.</p>
<p> Father Cowley&apos;s <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">ears and</span></span> face blushed purple.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I knew he was hard up, he explained. She used to play the
piano in the coffee palace. The waiter in the Grosvenor gave us the tip. Do you
remember? We had to search all Holles Street. Old clo&apos;, what?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; By God she had some splendid things there, I remember,
Ben Dollard said, his broad face wondering.</p>
<p> Mr Dedalus, pipe in hand, wandered back.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Merrion square. Opera cloaks and balldresses. I remember
he wouldn&apos;t take any money. And court dresses.</p>
<p> Mr Dedalus nodded.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ay, ay, he said. Mrs Marion Bloom has left off clothes of all descriptions.</p>
<p> Jingle jaunted up the quays Blazes sprawled on bounding tyres.</p>
<p> Liver and bacon, steak and kidney pie bald Pat the waiter served them.</p>
<p> Mrs Marion. <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">A smell of
burn</span></span> Met him pike hoses. Smell of burn. Of Paul de Kock. Nice name he.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What&apos;s this her name was? Marion&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Tweedy.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is she alive?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And kicking.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; She&apos;s a daughter of&nbsp;&hellip; who&apos;s this?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Daughter of the regiment.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, begad. I remember old major Tweedy.</p>
<p> Mr Dedalus lit and puffed savoury puff after.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Irish? I don&apos;t know, faith. Is she Simon?</p>
<p> Puff after stiff puff, a
<br><font color="green">{ms, 14}</font>
<br> strong,<a target="foot" id="fmz0046">&ordm;</a> savoury.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;
<a name="jn2037d" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2037d">The buccinator muscle is. Bit rusty.</a> What? O, she is.</p>
<p> He puffed a pungent plumy blast.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Irish Molly O. From the rock of Gibraltar all the way.</p>
<p> They pined in depth of ocean shadow, bronze by the beerpull, gold near
maraschino, silent all two, Lidia Kennedy of 4 Lismore terrace, Drumcondra and Idolores, a queen, now silent.</p>
<p> Bloom cut nutty liver, streaky bacon. As said before he ate with relish the
inner organs, nutty gizzards, fried cods&apos; roes while Richie Goulding,
Colles, Ward ate steak and kidney, kake and stidney, bite by bite he ate Bloom ate they ate.</p>
<p> Bloom with Goulding, silent ate.</p>
<p> Jaunty jingled Blazes Boylan, bachelor: in sun, in heat, mare&apos;s glossy
rump, with flick of whip, on bounding tyres, sprawled, warmseated, ardent, bold.
Horn. Have you the? Horn. B. Boylan&apos;s horn</p>
<p> Over their voices Ben boomed with crashing chords:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>When love absorbs my ardent soul.</u></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; War! war! cried Father Cowley. You&apos;re the warrior.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; So I am, Ben Dollard cried.</p>
<p> He stopped. He wagged his huge beard and huge face over his blunder huge.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Sure, you&apos;d burst the tympanum of her ear, man, Mr
Dedalus said <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">with</span></span>
amid smoke aroma, with an organ like yours.</p>
<p> In abundant laughter Dollard shook upon the keys. He would.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Not to mention another membrane, Father Cowley added. Half time, Ben,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 15}</font>
<br> Let<a target="foot" id="fmz0047">&ordm;</a> me there.</p>
<p> <u>Love and War</u> someone is playing. Mr Bloom mashed mashed potatoes in
liver gravy. Ben Dollard&apos;s famous. Night he came round to us to borrow the
suit for that concert. Trousers tight as a drum on him. All Molly laughed when
he went out. Threw herself across the bed, screaming, kicking. With all his
belongings on show. O saints above, I&apos;m drenched! O, I never laughed so
much! Well, of course, that&apos;s what gives men the base barreltone. For
instance eunuchs. Wonder who&apos;s playing. Nice touch. Must be Cowley. Stopped.</p>
<p> Miss Douce, engaging, bowed to suave George Lidwell, entering. Good
afternoon. She gave her moist (a lady&apos;s) hand
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">to</span></span> to his firm handclasp. Afternoon.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Your friends are inside, Mr Lidwell.</p>
<p> George Lidwell held her genteel hand</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ah, I couldn&apos;t, man, Mr Dedalus said, shy and listless.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Go on, blast you! Ben Dollard said. Get it out in bits.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>M&apos;appari</u>, Simon, Father Cowley said.</p>
<p> He strode gravely down stage, tall in affliction, his arms outheld.
Hoarsely, <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">{bent}</span></span> the
apple of his throat, sang softly. Softly he sang to the dusty
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">landscape</span></span> seascape
there: <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">a headland</span></span>
<u>A Last Farewell</u>. A headland, a ship upon the billows, farewell, a lovely
girl waving her veil upon the headland height, wild wind around her. Cowley sang:</p>
<p class="pdiset">&mdash; <u>M&apos;appari tutt&apos; amor</u>
<br> <u>Il mio sguardo</u>&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> She waved, unhearing, him, her veil, to one departing,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 16}</font>
<br> dear<a target="foot" id="fmz0048">&ordm;</a> one, love, return.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Go on, Simon.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ah, sure, my dancing days are done, &nbsp;&hellip; Well.</p>
<p> Mr Dedalus laid his pipe to rest upon the piano ledge and, sitting, touched the keys.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, Simon, Father Cowley said, turning. Play it in the original. One flat.</p>
<p> The keys, obedient, rose higher, told, faltered, confessed, confused.
<br><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">&mdash; Here, Simon,</span></span></p>
<p> Up stage came Father Cowley</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Here, Simon, I&apos;ll do that, he said. Get up.</p>
<p> By Graham Lemon&apos;s jingle jangled, by Elvery&apos;s elephant house.</p>
<p> Steak and kidney. Power. Most beautiful tenor air ever written.
<u>Sonambula. All is lost now.</u> He heard Joe Maas one night sing. Never would
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext"><font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">unread</span></font></span></span>
he forget</p>
<p> <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Mr</span></span> Bloom
tenderly over liverless bacon saw the suffering face before him. Backache.
Bright&apos;s disease. Next item on the programme. Power. So particular about
his drink. Fecking matches from counters to save then squander a sovereign in
dribs and drabs. Never a cent when he&apos;s wanted! Queer types.</p>
<p> Never would Richie Goulding forget that night
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">as</span></span>. As long as he
lived. He was in the gallery with little Peake. And when the first note.</p>
<p> Coming out with a whopper now. Greatest liar unhung. Believes them himself. He does</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Which air is that? Mr Bloom asked.</p>
<p> Richie <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Goulding&apos;s

murmured: all. A thrush. A throstle. His breath, sweet, good teeth he has for
all that, fluted with plaintive woe. Is lost now. All is lost. Mournful surrender,

<p> Mr Bloom bent ear, turning a fringe of doyley down under the breadtray.

back. Too late <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">now</span></span>.
Jingle jaunting. She longed to go. That&apos;s why she went. A woman. Stop the sea. Yes. All is lost.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A beautiful air, Mr Bloom said. I know it.</p>
<p> Never in all his life had Richie Goulding.</p>
<p> He knows it too or feels. The wise child that knows her
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">own</span></span> father. Sharp man Dedalus is. And me?</p>
<p> Bloom askance over liverless bacon saw the suffering face before him.</p>
<p> Piano again. Sounds better than last time.</p>
<p> Dollard and Cowley still urged the lingering singer.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Out with it, Simon.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; with it, Simon</p>
<p> By the sandwich bell in screening shadow Mina Douce, her bronze and rose, a
lady&apos;s grace, gave and withheld: and in cool seashadow Lydia Kennedy {sunned} her pinnacles of gold.</p>
<p> The prelude
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">ended</span></span> closed: a
chord, longdrawn, expectant, drew the voice its way.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>When first I saw that form endearing</u></p>
<p> Richie Goulding turned:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That&apos;s Simon Dedalus&apos; voice, he said</p>
<p> Mr Bloom signed to bald Pat to set the door ajar. So. Right: so.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Sorrow from me seemed to depart</u></p>
<p> Through the hush of air a voice sang to them, low, not rain, not leaves in
murmur, like no voice of strings or reeds touching their still ears, their
hearts, remembered lives. It was good to hear: sorrow from them seemed to depart when first they heard: when first they
<br><font color="green">{ms, 18}</font>
<br> saw<a target="foot" id="fmz0050">&ordm;</a> mercy and beauty, and heard her merciful and lovely lovesoft eyes.</p>
<p> Love that is singing. Mr Bloom unwound slowly the elastic band of his packet
and wound it in a skein round four &mdash; fingers and stretched it and relaxed
and wound it round his troubled (?) double and treble and
<a name="un4037h" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4037h">gyved</a> them fast.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Full of hope and all delighted</u></p>
<p> Tenors get women. He can&apos;t sing for nuts. Your head it simply swurls.
Perfumed for him. What perfume does your wife. I want to know. Jingle, jingle,
jingle. Stop. Knock. Looks at mirror: always before she answers, the door. The
hall. There? Kiss? <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">a</span></span>
how do you do? Phial of violet couchous she has: sweetens the breath. Hand felt for the opulent.</p>
<p> Alas! The voice rose sighing loud, full, shining, proud.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Alas &apos;twas idle dreaming</u>&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> Glorious voice he has still. Silly man! He could have made his fortune. All like that.</p>
<p> It welled its tenderness, slow swelling, full and throbbed. Give all! Take!
Throb, a throb, a throb, pulsing, proud, erect.</p>
<p> It&apos;s not the words. It&apos;s the thing behind.</p>
<p> A flood of warm sweet secretness flowed out in music, in desire, the dark
invisible sinful invading. Tup. From pores dilated. Tup. From sluices pouring
gushes. Pour, flood, gush, flow, throb again. Language of love.</p>
<p> <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">L</span></span> Martha it is.
Coincidence. Must write. Can&apos;t write. Accept my little present. She&apos;s
a silly. I called you naughty boy. Still the name. Martha. How strange.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 19}</font> </p>
<p> The<a target="foot" id="fmz0051">&ordm;</a> voice returned. Weaker but
unwearied it sang again how first it saw that form endearing, how sorrow then
departed, how look and form and word charmed him and won his heart</p>
<p> First night at Mat Dillon&apos;s I saw her. Yellow and black, she wore. Her
voice. <u>Waiting</u> she sang. I turned her music. Full voice of
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">win</span></span> sun and flowers,
something like flowers. Full bust I saw singing. When first I saw. She thanked me. Spanish eyes.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Martha! Martha!</u></p>
<p> He cried in grief, in passion to love to return, with deepening and rising
chords of harmony, in loneliness that she should know, should
feel<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span>. For her he waited. Where? Somewhere.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Co-ome, thou lost one!
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">co-come</span></span> Co-ome, thou dear one!</p>
<p> Alone one love, one hope, one comfort. Come!</p>
<p> It soared, a swift pure cry, highsoaring, high resplendent, crowned and
consumed in the effulgence of the etherial bosom, high, of the vast irradiation everywhere all round about of</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; To me.</p>
<p> Consumed.</p>
<p> Come. Well sung. All clapped. She ought to. Come to me, him, her, me, us.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Bravo. Clapclap. Good man, Simon. Clappyclapclap. Encore.
Clapclapclapclap. Sound as a bell, Simon. Clopclopclap. Encore. Enclap, said,
cried, clapped all, Ben Dollard, Lydia Kennedy, Mina Douce, Father Cowley, two
gentlemen with two tankards, Ben Dollard, George Lidwell, first gentleman with
first tankard and bronze Miss Douce and gold miss Kennedy.</p>
<p> Blazes Boylan&apos;s smart tan
<br><font color="green">{ms, 20}</font>
<br> shoes<a target="foot" id="fmz0052">&ordm;</a> creaked on the barfloor as he
strode, as said before. Jingle by monuments of sir John Gray, of admiral Horatio
Nelson, of Father Theobald Matthew, jaunted, as said before. Atrot, in heat,
warmseated. Cloche. Sonnez la. Cloche. Sonnez la. Slower the mare went up the
hill by the Rotunda, Rutland square. Too slow for Boylan, Blazes Boylan, impatience Boylan jogged the mare.</p>
<p> The afterclang of chords closed, and died on the air made richer.</p>
<p> And Richie Goulding drank his Power and Bloom his cider drank and Lidwell
drank his Jameson and the second gentleman ordered two fresh tankards
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">from</span></span> if she would
not mind. She smiled, disserving, at first and second gentleman. She did not mind.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A week in gaol, Ben Dollard said, on bread and water. Then you&apos;d sing, Simon.</p>
<p> The singer laughed pleased. Father Cowley played. Mina Kennedy served. The
second gentleman paid. Tom Kernan strutted in. Miss Douce, admired, admired.</p>
<p> Richie Goulding, admiring, said that man had a glorious voice. He remembered
one night. He would never forget that night. Si sang <u>&apos;Twas rank and
fame</u> Good God, he never heard in all his life a note like that he never did
then false one we had better part so clear so God he never heard since love
lives not a clinking voice lives not ask Lambert he will tell you too.</p>
<p> Richie Goulding, a flush struggling in his pale, told Mr Bloom face of the
night Si in Ned Lambert&apos;s house Dedalus
<br><font color="green">{ms, 21}</font>
<br> sang<a target="foot" id="fmz0053">&ordm;</a> <u>&apos;Twas Rank and Fame</u>.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom listened while Richie Goulding told him
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">about</span></span> of the night,
he, Richie Goulding, heard him, Si Dedalus, sing <u>&apos;Twas Rank and Fame</u> in his, Ned Lambert&apos;s, house.</p>
<p> Brothers-in-law. Rift in the lute at present. Treats him with contempt. See. He admires him all the more.</p>
<p> That voice was a lamentation. Her name too. And I am waiting.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom
<a name="un4037h" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4037h">ungyved</a> his hands
and, with slack fingers, plucked the slender catgut band. While Richie Goulding
talked of voice production. While Tom Kernan talked to Father Cowley, who played
a voluntary, who nodded as he played. While big Ben Dollard talked with Simon
Dedalus who nodded as he smoked, who smoked.</p>
<p> Thou lost one. All songs are about that. Cruel it seems. Let people get fond
of each other. Then tear them asunder. Death. Explosion. Knock on the head.
Outohelloutofthat. Human life that is. Dignam. And I. And one day she with.
Suffer then. Snivel. Big eyes. Look at nothing. Hair uncombed.</p>
<p> Jingle into Dorset street jinglejingled.</p>
<p> Miss Douce withdrew her satiny arm, reproachful, pleased.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Don&apos;t make half so free, she said, till we&apos;re better acquainted.</p>
<p> A tankard gentleman told gold Miss Kennedy: she asked him was that so. He
told her it was so. His friend told her also it was so. She asked him was it so.</p>
<p> Bald Pat, at a sign, drew nigh. A pen and ink. He went. A blotting pad.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, Mr Bloom said, teasing the curling catgut band. It
certainly is. Few lines will do. My present. All that Italian music is. Take out
sheet notepaper envelope. Unconcerned.
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">So</span></span> It&apos;s so
<a name="un5011ae" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5011ae">characteristic</a>.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The finest number in the whole
<br><font color="green">{ms, 22}</font>
<br> opera,<a target="foot" id="fmz0054">&ordm;</a> Richie Goulding said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It is, said Mr Bloom.</p>
<p> Numbers it is. All the sounds when you come to think. Two multiplied by two
divided by half. Two is twice one. The vibrations. Chords. Those are one plus
two plus six is seven. Then it&apos;s all the symmetry of the cemetery. And you
think you&apos;re listening to the etherial. But suppose you said it like seven
times nine minus x is thirtyfive thousand. Have no effect. It&apos;s on account of the sound.</p>
<p> Instance he&apos;s playing now. Might be what you like. Question of mood.
Still nice to hear. Except of course

<p> Bald deaf Pat brought flat pad ink pen. and set, them down ink pen flat pad.

<p> It was the only language Mr Dedalus said. As a boy in Queenstown he heard
them out by Ringabella. Harbour full of Italian ships then. Walking in the
moonlight with their earthquake hats they blent their voices. As a boy he heard it.</p>
<p> A sour pipe removed he held a shield of hand over his lips that sang a

<p> Down the edge of his <u>Freeman</u> baton travelled Mr Bloom&apos;s glance

<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, Mr Bloom said. Town traveller. Nothing in it, I expect.</p>
<p> Address. Just copy out of paper. He murmured: Messrs Callan, Coleman and Co, limited. He wrote:</p>

<p> Miss Douce, requested, served the same again, she had a gorgeous time.
Simply gorgeous it was. That lovely shell she brought. To the end of the bar she
bore lightly the spiked and winding seahorn that he, George Lidwell, solicitor might hear.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Listen! she bade.</p>
<p> Under Tom Kernan&apos;s ginhot words wove music slow, ceasing could not. She
held it to his ear. He heard. He heard. Wonderful. She held it to her own. And gold Miss approached to hear.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom, through the open door, saw a shell held at their ears and heard
more faintly that they heard, each for herself alone, then each for other,
hearing, the plash of waves, loudly, a silent roar.</p>
<p> Bronze by a weary gold they listened.</p>
<p> Her ear too is a shell, the peeping lobe there. Hair braided over. Shell
with seaweed. Why do they hide their ears with
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">hairs</span></span> hair. Find the
way in. A cave. No admittance except on business.</p>
<p> The sea they think they hear. Singing and a roar. The blood it is. Singing
in the ears sometimes. Blood is a sea, sea with purple islands.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 25}</font> </p>
<p> Wonderful<a target="foot" id="fmz0058">&ordm;</a> really. So clear. Again
George Lidwell held its murmur, hearing, and laid it most gently by.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What are the wild waves saying? he
asked<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span>
her<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span>, smiling.</p>
<p> Charming and smiling and unanswering she smiled.</p>
<p> By Larry, my bold Larry, by Larry O&apos;Rourke&apos;s went Boylan.</p>
<p> From the abandoned shell Miss Kennedy glided to tankards waiting. Miss Douce
was not so lonely, archly her arching head let Lidwell know. It was exquisite
walking in the moonlight by the sea. With whom? he asked her. Not alone? No, she
said nobly. With a gentleman friend.</p>
<p> Bob Cowley&apos;s twinkling fingers in the treble played again. The landlord
has the prior claim. a little time. Long John. Big Ben. He played lightly a
light bright tinkling measure, for tripping ladies, arch and smiling, for graces
and for their gallants, gentlemen friends. One, one, one, one, one, one, two, one, three, four.</p>
<p> Sea, wind, leaves, thunder, cows birds, snakes. There&apos;s music
everywhere. Ruttledge&apos;s door: ee, cree. That&apos;s only noise. Minuet of
<u>Don Giovanni</u> he&apos;s playing. Nice that is. Dee: dee, dee, dee, dee, dee: tareedarum.</p>
<p>]Joy: I can feel<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span>

<p class="pdi">&mdash; F. sharp major, Ben Dollard said.</p>
<p> The outstretched talons griped the black deepsounding chords.</p>
<p> Miss Douce did not believe George Lidwell. Miss Kennedy did not believe the
first and not the second gentleman of the tankards.</p>
<p> Bald bothered Pat folded napkins. Pat is a waiter, hard in his hearing. Pat
is a waiter who waits while you wait. Hee hee hee hee. He waits while you wait.
Hee hee. A waiter is he. Hee hee hee hee. He waits while you wait. While you
wait. He will wait. Hee hee hee hee. Wait while you wait.</p>
<p> But wait. But hear. Dark lugulugubrious.</p>
<p> The voice of age, of unlove, of
<a name="un4015q" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4015q">fatigue</a>, called on
good men and true. The priest he sought. With him would he
speak<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span> a word.</p>
<p> Ben Dollard&apos;s voice that is, base barreltone. Another come down. Big
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">ship&apos;s</span></span> ship
chandler&apos;s business he had. Now in the Iveagh home. Cubicle so and so. Number one bass did that.</p>
<p> The priest&apos;s at home. A false servant bade him welcome. Step inside. The holy father. A
<br><font color="green">{ms, 27}</font>
<br> traitor<a target="foot" id="fmz0060">&ordm;</a> servant. Curleques of chords.</p>
<p> Ruin them. Then build cubicles to lay them in to die in. After all the
pints. Put me in my little bed. Die, dog. Little dog.</p>
<p> The voice of warning told
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">me</span></span> them the youth
had entered that lonely hall, how solemn sounded his footfall there, told them
the gloomy chamber, told them the priest vested in an oaken chair.</p>
<p> Decent soul but fat in the head. Bass. Thinks he&apos;ll win a prize in
<u>Answers</u> competition, great writers&apos; puzzle. Bird sitting on a
nestegg. <u>Lay of the Last Minstrel</u>, he thought it was. Fine voice, though.</p>
<p> Listen. Bloom listened, Richie Goulding listened to Ben Dollard. Deaf Pat listened by the door again.</p>
<p> The chords harped slower.</p>
<p> The voice of penance and grief came slow. He knelt, confessed his sins. The
voice intoned a sound of penance. <u>In nomine Dei</u>, in God&apos;s name he
confessed. He beat his hand upon his breast. <u>Mea culpa</u>.</p>
<p> Latin. That holds them fast. The priest this morning with the communion
things. The priest in the mortuary. <u>Namine Domini</u>. Croak of a raven.</p>
<p> They listened. The false priest. The tankards and miss Kennedy. George Lidwell and fullbusted satin. Kernan. Si.</p>
<p> The sighing voice of sorrow sang. His sins. Since Easter he had cursed three
times. And once at masstime he had gone to play. And once by the churchyard he
had gone and for his mother he had not prayed. A boy confessed. A croppy boy.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 27v}</font> </p>
<p>
<br><font color="green">{ms, 28}</font> </p>
<p> Deaf<a target="foot" id="fmz0062">&ordm;</a> Pat held wider open the door.</p>
<p> Bronze, listening by the beerpull, gazed far away. Soulful eyes. What do
they think about when they hear music. Way to catch rattlesnakes. Night we got
the box for <u>Trilby</u>, Michael Gunn. Footlights glowering on the gilty work.
Clove in her mouth account of the heat. Keep breath sweet. Her crocus dress she
wore lowcut, full to be seen. Hypnotism. Told her what Spinoza says in that book
of poor papa&apos;s. She listened, soulful eyes. Chap in dress circle staring
down into her with his operaglass. Philosophy.</p>
<p> All gone, all fallen. At the siege of Ross his father, at Gorey his loving
brothers all. To Wexford, the boys of. Wexford, he would go. Last of his name and race.</p>
<p> I too. Last of my name. Milly young student. Rudy. My fault perhaps. No son. Too late now. Or if not?</p>
<p> He bore no hate.</p>
<p> I too. No hate. Why hate? Or love? Rudy, if he had lived.</p>
<p> Great voice Richie Goulding said, flush struggling in his pale. Ireland
comes now. My country above the King. They are all hypnotised.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Bless me, father, Ben Dollard the croppy cried, bless me and let me go.</p>
<p> Got up to kill. On eighteen bob. Mystery. Fellows. Land out the cash. Been
to the seaside. Hotel. Moonlit walk. Breach of promise. Jack Power
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">and</span></span>, that barmaid.
Those girls! Those girls, those lovely seaside.</p>
<p> Low sank the music, air and words. The false priest rustling from his cloak.
A yeoman captain. They know it all before. A yeoman cap. The thrill they like.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 29}</font> </p>
<p> Thrilled,<a target="foot" id="fmz0063">&ordm;</a> she listened, bending to hear.</p>
<p> Blank face. Virgin perhaps. Write something. If you don&apos;t what becomes
of them. Despair. Decline. Sad thing. They want it. Not too much polite. And
that&apos;s why he. Say something, make her hear. Ventriloquism. My lips closed. Think in the stomach or what?</p>
<p> Will? You? I. Want. You. To.</p>
<p> With hoarse rude fury the yeoman cursed. Good night, boy, to come. One short hour&apos;s your time to live.</p>
<p> The thrill. Pity they feel: For all things dying, for all things born.
Because they feel it. That&apos;s their job, part of life.</p>
<p> The liquid woman&apos;s eyeball gazed under a fence of barbs, calmly,
hearing. On yonder river. At each slow heaving wave of her bosom (the heaving
embonpoint) her red rose rose and sank with the waves and all the tiny tiny trembles of maidenhair</p>
<p> But look. The bright stars fade. Orose. Castile. The morn is breaking.</p>
<p> Lidwell that is. His fascinated eyes. See her from here. Popped corks, splashes of beerfroth, stacks of empties.</p>
<p> On the smooth jutting beerpull lay her hand, lightly, plumply, white on the
enamel. Molly knows that too. Hand up so that the blood runs back. White hand.
She&apos;s lost in pity. To, fro, to, fro over the polished knob (she knows my
eyes, his eyes) her fingers passed in pity and reposed and, gently touching,
then slid so smoothly, slowly down, a cool firm baton white protruding out of their sliding ring.</p>
<p> I hold this house. Amen. All traitors swing.</p>
<p> The chords consented. Sadly. It had to be.</p>
<p> Get out before the end. Pass by her. Letter I have. Walk, walk, walk somewhere. Time. Goulding.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 30}</font>
<br> Must<a target="foot" id="fmz0064">&ordm;</a> shove along. Sorry. Can&apos;t reach.</p>
<p> By deaf Pat in the doorway Mr Bloom passed out.</p>
<p> At Geneva barrack he died, that young man. At Passage was his body laid. The
voice of mournful herald called to prayer.</p>
<p> By rose, by satin bosom, by the caressing hand, by slops, by empties, by
popped corks, greeting in going, past eyes and maidenhair, bronze and faint
gold, went Bloom, soft Bloom, so sad, so lonely Bloom.</p>
<p> Pray for him, prayed the voice of Dollard. You who hear in peace. Breathe a
prayer for him, drop a tear. Good men, good people. For the croppy boy.</p>
<p> Bloom heard the growls and roars of bravo, heard the treading of their feet.
Going in all for a drink to wash it down. Just avoided that</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Come on, Ben, Mr Dedalus said. By Christ, you&apos;re as good as ever you were.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Better, Tomgin Kernan said. A most masterly rendition upon my oath and honour it is.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Lablache, Bob Cowley said</p>
<p> Ben Dollard bulkily kecuchad towards the bar, mightily rewarded, and all
roseate, on heavyfooted feet, his gouty fingers nakkering castaquettes in the air</p>
<p> Big Benaben Dollard. Big Benaben. Bigbenben.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You&apos;re looking rubicund, George Lidwell said.</p>
<p> Miss Douce polished a tumbler. Miss Douce composed her rose.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He is, Mr Dedalus said, clapping the fat back&apos;s
shoulderblade. He has a lot of adipose tissue concealed about his
<br><font color="green">{ms, 31}</font>
<br> person.<a target="foot" id="fmz0065">&ordm;</a></p>
<p> Rrrrrrrss.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Fat of death, Simon, Ben Dollard said.</p>
<p> Bob Cowley. Father Cowley with stout Tom Kernan followed. Most masterly
rendition with purply lugs and scraggy Adam&apos;s apple.</p>
<p> Richie Goulding of
<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">unread</span></font>
firm sat alone, uncertain, waiting. While he waited deaf Pat waited.</p>
<p> Miss Kennedy approached her lips near to the nearer ear of tankard one.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Mr Dollard, she whispered, so prudently.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Dollard, the tankard murmured.</p>
<p> He murmured that he knew the name. The name was familiar to him, that is to
say. That was to say he had heard the name of. Dollard, was it? Dollard, yes.
Yes, her lips said more loudly Mr Dollard. He sang that song lovely, Lydia said.
Dollard. And The <u>Last Rose of Summer</u> was a lovely one. Lydia loved that.</p>
<p> Tis the last rose of summer dollard left bloom felt wind wound inside.</p>
<p> Gassy thing that cider. Wait. Post office up there where Reuben J&apos;s
office. Get shut of it. Dodge round by Greek street. Wish I hadn&apos;t promised
to meet them. Freer in the air, walking. Gets on your nerves. Music. Hand. Beerpull.</p>
<p> Cowley, he stuns himself with it.
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Rea</span></span> Unpleasant when
it stops. Old Glynn too in Gardiner street. Made it talk. Instruments always
trying to say. Queer up there in the organ loft, back to the whole performance,
with keys and stops. Blow the bellows. Growl, angry, then shriek, cursing (want
to have wadding or something in his ears) then
<br><font color="green">{ms, 32}</font>
<br> all<a target="foot" id="fmz0066">&ordm;</a> soft all of a sudden wee little wee little pipey wind</p>
<p> Pwee. A wee little wind piped. Eeee. In Bloom&apos;s little wee.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Was he? Mr Dedalus said. I was with him this morning at Glasnevin.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The wife is in the musical line, isn&apos;t she? Fine voice, hasn&apos;t she?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Shout! Ben Dollard said, pouring water.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I do, cried Father Cowley.</p>
<p> I feel I want.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Very, Mr Dedalus said, staring at a
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">label of</span></span> headless sardine.</p>
<p> Under the sandwich bell on a bier of bread lay a lonely. Bloom alone.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Very, he stared.
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">In</span></span> The lower register for choice.</p>
<p> Bloom went by Barry&apos;s. Wish I could. Wait. Twentyfour solicitors in
that house. Counted them. Overcrowded. Parchment.</p>
<p> But for example the
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">fe</span></span> chap that plays
the big drum. His vocation in life. Wonder how it first struck him. Sitting at
home with it in an armchair after dinner. Pom. Pompedy. Pom. Asses&apos; skins.
Welt them black and blue through life, then after death. Pom. Seems to be bocksheesh or I mean kismet.</p>
<p> I must really. Fff. Wait. O. The whore.</p>
<p> A frowsy whore with black straw hat askew came glazily in the day towards Mr
Bloom. Yes, that&apos;s the one that wet night in the lane. Psst! Any chance of
your washing. Knew Molly. Stout lady does be with you. Devils women are. Look in here.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom earnestly viewed a gallant hero in Lionel Marks&apos;s window.
Stout lady does be with. Put me off my stroke. Robert Emmet. Last words. Seven last words of Mercadante.</p>
<p> When my country takes her place. Softly.</p>
<p> Prrpprr.

<p> They stossed their clinking glasses all, brighteyed and gallant, before
bronze Lydia&apos;s tempting rose. Lid. Ker. Cow. De and Doll: Lidwell, Tom
Kernan, Father Cowley, Si Dedalus and Big Ben Dollard.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; True men like you men</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ay, ay, Ben.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Will lift your glass with us.
<br> <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Tschink. Tschuk.</span></span></p>
