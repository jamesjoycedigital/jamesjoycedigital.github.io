<p class="pStDir">Bronze by gold, Miss Douce&apos;s head by Miss Kennedy&apos;s
head, over the crossblind of the Ormond bar heard the viceregal hoofs go by, ringing steel.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is that he? asked Miss Kennedy</p>
<p> Miss Douce said yes, sitting with his ex, pearl grey and eau de Nil.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Exquisite contrast, miss Kennedy said.</p>
<p> All agog Miss Douce said eagerly:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Look at the fellow in the tall silk.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Who? Where? gold asked more eagerly</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; In the second carriage, Miss Douce said, he wet lips
laughing in the sun. He&apos;s looking. Mind till I see.</p>
<p> Bronze she darted to the backmost corner, flattening her face against the pane in a halo of hurried breath.</p>
<p> Her wet lips tittered:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He&apos;s killed looking back.</p>
<p> She laughed:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O wept! Aren&apos;t men frightful idiots?</p>
<p> Miss Kennedy sauntered sadly from bright light, twining a loose air behind
an ear. Sauntering sadly, gold no more, she twisted twined a hair. Sadly she
twined in sauntering gold hair behind a curving ear.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It&apos;s them has the fine times, sadly then she said.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom went by Moulang&apos;s pipes bearing in his breast the sweets of
sin, by Wine&apos;s antiques, in memory bearing sweet sinful words, by
Carroll&apos;s dusky battered plate, for Raoul.</p>
<p> The boots to them from the hallway came, to them unheeding, and banged on
the counter his tray of chattering china. And.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; There&apos;s your teas, he said.</p>
<p> Miss Kennedy with manners transposed the teatray to an upturned lithia crate, safe from eyes, low.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What is it? unmannerly loud boots asked</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Find out, Miss Douce retorted, leaving
<br><font color="green">{ms, 4}</font>
<br> her spyingpoint.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Your beau, is it?</p>
<p> She, haughty bronze, replied:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I&apos;ll complain to Mrs de Massey on you if I hear any more of your impertinent insolence</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Imperthnthnthnthnthn, the boots&apos;s snout sniffed
rudely, as he retreated as he heard her as he had come.</p>
<p> Bloom.</p>
<p> On her flower frowning miss Douce said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Most aggravating that fellow is. If he doesn&apos;t
conduct himself I&apos;ll wring his ear a yard long.</p>
<p> Ladylike.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Take no notice, Miss Kennedy rejoined</p>
<p> She poured in a teacup tea, then back in the teapot tea. They cowered under
the reef of the counter, waiting on footstools, crates upturned, waiting for
their teas to draw. They pawed their blouses, two and nine a yard, waiting for
their teas to draw, and two and seven.</p>
<p> Yes bronze, from anear, by gold, from afar, heard steel, from anear, hoofs
ring, from afar, and heard steel hoofs ringhoof, ringsteel.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Am I awfully sunburnt?</p>
<p> Miss Douce unbloused her neck.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, said Miss Kennedy. It gets brown after. Did you try
the borax with the cherry laurel water?</p>
<p> Miss Douce half stood to see her skin askance in the barmirror where hock
and <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">g</span></span> claret glasses
shimmered and in their midst a shell.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And leave it to my hands, she said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Try it with the glycerine, Miss Kennedy advised.</p>
<p> Bidding her neck and hands adieu Miss Douce</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Those things only bring out a rash replied reseated. I
asked that old
<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font> in
Boyd&apos;s for something for my skin.</p>
<p> Miss Kennedy, pouring now a fulldrawn tea, grimaced and prayed:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O don&apos;t remind me of him for
<br><font color="green">{ms, 5}</font>
<br> mercy&apos; sake.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But wait till I tell you, Miss Douce entreated</p>
<p> Sweet tea Miss Kennedy having poured with milk plugged both two ears with little fingers.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, don&apos;t, she cried.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I won&apos;t listen, she cried.</p>
<p> But Bloom?</p>
<p> Miss Douce grunted in snuffy tone:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; For your what? says he</p>
<p> Miss Kennedy unplugged her ear to hear, to speak but said, but prayed again:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Don&apos;t let me think of him or I&apos;ll expire. The
awful old wretch. That night in the Antient Concert Rooms.</p>
<p> She sipped distastefully her brew, hot tea, a sip, sipped, sweet tea.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Here he was, Miss Douce said, cocking her bronze head
three quarters, ruffling her nosewings. Huf! Huf!</p>
<p> A shrill shriek of laughter flew from Miss Kennedy&apos;s throat. Miss Douce
huffed and snorted down her nostrils that quivered like a snout in quest.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O! shrieking, miss Kennedy cried. Will you ever forget his goggle eyes?</p>
<p> Miss Douce chimed in in deep bronze laughter, shouting:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And your other eye!</p>
<p> Bloom&apos;s dark eye read Aaron Figatner&apos;s name. Why do I think always
Figather? Gathering figs, I think. And Prosper Lor&eacute;&apos;s huguenot name.
By Bassi&apos;s blessed virgins his dark eyes went by. Comely and whiterobed,
come to me. God they believe she is, goddess I mean. Those I saw. That fellow
that spoke to me, student. That brings the fellows in, the rakes, he who he. By
went his eyes. The sweets of sin. Sweet are the sweets.</p>
<p> Of sin.</p>
<p> In a giggling peal young voices blended, Douce with Kennedy. You other eye. They
<br><font color="green">{ms, 6}</font>
<br> threw their heads back, bronze and gold, to let free fly their laughter,
screaming, your other, signals to each other, high piercing notes.</p>
<p> Panting, sighing, sighing, fordone, their mirth died down.</p>
<p> Miss Kennedy touched her cup again, raised, drank a sip. Miss Douce, bending
over the teatray, ruffled again her nose and rolled droll fattened eyes. Again
Miss Kennedy, stooping her fair pinnacles of hair, stooping, her tortoise
napecomb showed, spluttered out of her mouth her tea, choking in tea and laughter, coughing, choking, crying:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O greasy eyes! Imagine being married to a man like that! she cried. The bit of beard!</p>
<p> Douce gave full vent to a splendid yell, a full yell of a woman, delight, joy, indignation.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Married to the greasy nose! she yelled.</p>
<p> Shrill, with deep laughter, after, gold after bronze, they urged each other
to peal after peal, ringing in changes, bronzegold, goldbronze, shrill deep, to
laughter after laughter. And then laughed more. Greasy I knows. Exhausted,
breathless, their shaken
heads<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span> they laid,
braided and pinnacled by glossycombed against the counterledge. All flushed
(O!), panting, sweating (O!), all breathless.</p>
<p> Married to Bloom, to <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">greasy</span></span> grea seabloom.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O saints above! Miss Douce said, sighed above her jumping
rose. I wished I hadn&apos;t laughed so much. I feel all wet.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, miss Douce! miss Kennedy protested. You horrid thing!</p>
<p> And flushed yet more, (you horrid!) more goldenly.</p>
<p> By Cantwell&apos;s offices walked roving Bloom, by Ceppi&apos;s virgins,
bright of oils. Nannetti&apos;s father hawked those things about,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 7}</font>
<br> wheedling. Religion pays. Must see him for that par. Eat first. I want. Not
yet. At four, she said. Time ever passing. Clockhands turning. On. Where eat?
The Clarence, Dolphin. On. For Raoul. Eat. If I make five guineas with those ads. Not yet. The sweets of sin.</p>
<p> Flushed less, still less, goldenly paled.</p>
<p> Into the bar strolled Mr Dedalus. Chips, picking chips off one of his rocky thumbnails. Chips. He strolled.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, welcome back, miss Douce.</p>
<p> He held her hand. Enjoyed her holidays?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Tiptop.</p>
<p> He hoped she had nice weather in Rostrevor.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Gorgeous, she said. Look at the holy show I am. Lying out on the strand all day.</p>
<p> Comely virgins. That brings the rakes in. Her whiteness.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That was exceedingly naughty of you, Mr Dedalus told her
and shook his head indulgently. Tempting poor simple males</p>
<p> Miss Douce of satin pulled her arm away.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O go away! she said. I&apos;m sure you&apos;re very simple.</p>
<p> He was.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well now I am, he mused. I looked so simple in the cradle they christened me simple Simon.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, I don&apos;t think, miss Douce made answer. And what did the doctor order today?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well now, he mused, whatever you say yourself. I think
I&apos;ll trouble you for some fresh water and a half glass of whisky.</p>
<p> Jingle.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; With the greatest alacrity, miss Douce agreed.</p>
<p> With grace of alacrity towards the mirror she turned herself, with grace she
tapped a measure of gold whisky from her crystal keg. Forth from the skirt of his coat Mr Dedalus
<br><font color="green">{ms, 8}</font>
<br> brought pouch and pipe. Alacrity she served. He blew through the flue two husky fifenotes.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; By Jove, he
mused<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span>, I often
wanted to see the Mourne mountains. Must be a great tonic in the air down there.
But a long threatening comes at last, they say. Yes. Yes.</p>
<p> He fingered shreds into the bowl. Chips. Shreds. Musing. Mute.</p>
<p> None nought said nothing. Yes.</p>
<p> Gaily miss Douce polished a tumbler, trilling:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>O, Idolores, queen of the eastern seas.</u></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Was Mr Lidwell in today?</p>
<p> In came Lenehan. Round him peered Lenehan. Mr Bloom reached Essex Bridge.
Yes, Yessex bridge. To Martha I must write. Buy paper. Daly&apos;s. Girl there
civil. Bloom. Old Bloom. Blue bloom is on the rye.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He was in at lunchtime, miss Douce said.</p>
<p> Lenehan came forward.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Was Mr Boylan looking for me?</p>
<p> He asked. She answered:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Miss Kennedy, was Mr Boylan in while I was upstairs?</p>
<p> She asked. Miss Kennedy answered, her teacup poised, her gaze upon her page:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No. He was not.</p>
<p> Miss gaze of Kennedy, heard, not seen, read on. Lenehan round the
sandwichbell <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">round</span></span> wound his round body.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Peep! Who&apos;s in the corner?</p>
<p> No glance of Kennedy rewarding him he yet made overtures. To mind her stops.
To read only the black ones. Round o and crooked ess.</p>
<p> Jingle jaunty jingle.</p>
<p> Girlgold she read and did not glance. Take no notice. She took no notice
while he read by rote a solfa fable for her, plappering flatly:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; ah fox met ah stork. Said the fox too thee stork will
<br><font color="green">{ms, 9}</font>
<br> you put your bill down inn my throat and pull up ah bone?</p>
<p> He droned in vain. Miss Douce turned aside.</p>
<p> He sighed aside:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; ah me! O my!</p>
<p> He greeted Mr Dedalus and got a nod.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Greetings from the famous son of a famous father.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Who may he be? Mr Dedalus asked.</p>
<p> Lenehan opened most genial arms. Who?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Can you ask? he asked. Stephen, the youthful bard.</p>
<p> Dry.</p>
<p> Mr Dedalus laid by his dry filled pipe.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I see, he said. I didn&apos;t recognise him for the
moment. I hear he is keeping very select company. Have you seen him lately?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I quaffed the nectar bowl with him this very day, said
Lenehan. In Mooney&apos;s en ville and in Mooney&apos;s sur mer. He had received
the rhino for the labour of his muse.</p>
<p> He smiled at miss bronze Douce&apos;s listening eyes and lips:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The elite of Erin hung upon his lips. The ponderous
pundit, Hugh MacHugh, Dublin&apos;s most brilliant editor and the minstrel boy
of the wild wet west who is known by the euphonious appellation of the O&apos;Madden Burke.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That must have been highly diverting, Mr Dedalus said. I see.</p>
<p> He looked towards the door of the saloon.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I see you have moved the piano.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The tuner was in today, miss Douce replied, tuning it for
the smoking concert and I never heard such an exquisite player.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is that a fact?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Didn&apos;t he, miss Kennedy? The real classical, you
know. And blind too, poor fellow. Not twenty I&apos;m sure he was</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is that a fact? Mr Dedalus said.</p>
<p> He drank and strayed away.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 10}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; So sad to look at his face, Miss Douce condoled.</p>
<p> God&apos;s curse. You bitch&apos;s bastard.</p>
<p> Tink to her pity cried a diner&apos;s bell. To the door of the bar and
diningroom came bald Pat, came bothered Pat, came Pat, waiter of Ormond. Lager
for diner. Lager without alacrity she served.</p>
<p> Now in the saloon Mr Dedalus held up the piano lid and gazed in the coffin
at the oblique triple wires. He pressed, soft pedalling a triple of notes of
keys, to see the thicknesses of felt advancing, to hear the muffled hammerfall in action.</p>
<p> Two sheets cream vellum paper, one reserve, two envelopes Bloom bought in
Daly&apos;s: a swaying mermaid smoking mid the waves, smoke mermaids, the
coolest whiff of all. He eyed and saw afar on Essex bridge a gay hat riding on a
jaunting car. It is. Again. Third time. Coincidence.</p>
<p> Jingling it jaunted from the bridge to Ormond quay. Follow. Risk it. Go quick. At four, she said. Out after.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Twopence, sir, the shopgirl dared to say.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Aha&nbsp;&hellip; I was forgetting&nbsp;&hellip; Excuse.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And four.</p>
<p> Winsomely she smiled on Bloom. Bloo smi qui go. Ternoon. Think you&apos;re
the only pebble on the beach. Does that to all. For men.</p>
<p> In drowsy silence gold bent on her page.</p>
<p> From the saloon a call came, long in dying. A call again from the tuningfork
struck and poised. Poised lightly on the pianocase it purely throbbed, softly
and softlier, its buzzing prongs. Longer in dying call.</p>
<p> Pat paid for diner&apos;s popcorked bottle. And over tumbler, tray and
popcorked bottle ere he went he whispered, bald and bothered, with miss Douce.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>The bright stars fade</u>&nbsp;&hellip;.</p>
<p> A voiceless song sang from within, singing:</p>
<p class="deep"><u>The morn is breaking</u>
<br><font color="green">{ms, 11}</font> </p>
<p> A duodene of birdnotes chirruped bright treble answer under sensitive hands.
Brightly the keys, all twinkling, linked, all harpsichording, called to a voice
to sing the strain of dewy morn, of youth, of love&apos;s leavetaking, life, love&apos;s morn.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>The dewdrops pearl</u>&nbsp;&hellip;.</p>
<p> Lenehan&apos;s lips over the counter blew a low whistle of decoy.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But look this way, he said, rose of Castile.</p>
<p> Jingle jaunted by the curb and halted.</p>
<p> She rose and closed her reading, rose of Castile: dreamily rose.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Did she fall or was she pushed? he asked her.</p>
<p> She answered, slighting:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ask no questions and you&apos;ll hear no lies.</p>
<p> Blazes Boylan&apos;s smart tan shoes creaked on the barfloor as he strode.
Lenehan heard and knew and hailed him.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; See the conquering hero comes.</p>
<p> Between the car and window of the bar went Bloom, catwalker. See me he
might. The seat he sat on. Warm. A hecat walked towards Richie Goulding&apos;s legal bag, lifted aloft, saluting.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>And I from thee</u>&nbsp;&hellip;.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I heard you were round, said Blazes Boylan.</p>
<p> He touched to fair miss Kennedy a rim of his slanted straw. She smiled on
him. But bonze miss Douce outsmiled her, preening for him her richer hair, her bosom and a rose.</p>
<p> Smart Boylan bespoke potions.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What&apos;s your cry? Glass of bitter? Glass of bitter, please, and a
<br><font color="green">{ms, 12}</font>
<br> sloe gin for me. Wire in yet?</p>
<p> Not yet. At four<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span> he. Who said four?</p>
<p> Cowley&apos;s red lugs and bulging apple in the door of the sheriff&apos;s
office. Avoid. Goulding a chance. What is he doing in the Ormond. Car waiting. Wait.</p>
<p> Hello. Where off to? Something to eat? I too was just. In here. Best value
in Dublin. Diningroom. Sit tight there. See, not be seen. I&apos;ll join you. Best value in Dub. Is that so?</p>
<p> Bloom followed Goulding&apos;s legal bag.</p>
<p> Miss Douce reached high to take a flagon, stretching her arm, her bust</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O! O! jerked Lenehan, gasping at easy stretch. O!</p>
<p> But easily she seized her prey and led it low in triumph.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Why don&apos;t you grow? asked Blazes Boylan.</p>
<p> Shebronze, dealing from her oblique jar thick syrupy liquor for his lips,
looked as it flowed for him and syrupped with her voice:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Fine goods in small
<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">unread</span></font></p>
<p> That is to say. You know she. She poured neatly slow syrupy<a target="foot" id="fmz0072">&ordm;</a> sloe.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Here&apos;s fortune, Blazes said.</p>
<p> He pitched a broad crown down.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Hold on, said Lenehan, till I&nbsp;&hellip;.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Fortune, he said, lifting his bubbled ale.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Sceptre
<a name="un2010f" href="../../ff/unbs/un2all.htm#un2010f">will win in a canter</a>, he said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I plunged a bit, said Boylan. Not on my own, you know. Fancy of a friend of mine.</p>
<p> Lenehan still drank and grinned at his tilted
<br><font color="green">{ms, 13}</font>
<br> ale and at miss Douce&apos;s lips that all but hummed, not shut, the
oceansong her lips had trilled. Idolores. The eastern seas.</p>
<p> Clockface clacked.</p>
<p> She took his crown and struck boldly the cashregister. It clanged. Fair one
of Egypt, she teased and sorted in her till. Look to the west he hummed and
handed Blazes Boylan ringing coins in change. For me. A clack</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What time is that? asked Blazes Boylan. Four.</p>
<p> O&apos;clock.</p>
<p> Lenehan, his eyes ahunger on her bronze humming bust tugged Blazes Boylan&apos;s elbowsleeve.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Let&apos;s hear the time, he said.</p>
<p> The bag of Goulding, Colles, Ward led Bloom by ryebloom flowered tables.
Aimless he chose with agitated aim, bald Pat attending, a table near the door.
Be near. At four. Has he forgotten? Perhaps a trick. Not come: whet appetite. I
couldn&apos;t do. Wait, wait. Pat, waiter, waited.</p>
<p> Bronze sparkling eyes eyed Blazes skyblue tie and eyes</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Go on, pressed Lenehan. There&apos;s no-one. He never heard.
<br> &hellip;.... <u>to Flora&apos;s lips did hie</u></p>
<p> High, a high note pealed in the treble clear.</p>
<p> Bronzedouce communing with her rose that sank and rose sought Blazes Boylan&apos;s flower and eyes.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Please, please.</p>
<p> He pleaded over returning phrases of avowal</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>I could not leave thee</u>&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Afterwits, said miss Douce coyly.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, now, urged Lenehan. <u>Sonnez</u>
<br><font color="green">{ms, 14}</font>
<br> <u>la cloche!</u> O do! There&apos;s no-one.</p>
<p> He looked. Other out of earshot. And, sudden, bent. Two kindling faces watched her bend.</p>
<p> Quavering the chords strayed from the air, found it again, lost chord, and lost and found it, faltering.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Go on! Do! <u>Sonnez!</u></p>
<p> She nipped a peak of skirt above her knee. Delayed. Taunted them still with wilful eyes</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;</p>
<p> Smack. She set free sudden in rebound her elastic garter smack warm against
her warm, a woman&apos;s, warmhosed thigh.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>La cloche!</u> cried gleeful Lenehan. Trained by owner. No sawdust there.</p>
<p> She smilesmirked supercilious, but mild on Blazes:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You&apos;re the essence of vulgarity, she said.</p>
<p> Boylan, eyed, eying, tossed to fat lips his
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">ti</span></span> chalice tiny,
sucking the last fat violet syrupy drops. His spellbound eyes went after, after
her gliding head as it went down the bar by mirrors, hock and claret glasses
shimmering, a spiky shell, where it concerted bronze with sunnier bronze.</p>
<p class="deep">&nbsp;&hellip;. <u>sweetheart, goodbye!</u></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I&apos;m off, said Boylan.</p>
<p> He slid his glass briskly away, gathered his change.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Wait a shake, cried Lenehan, drinking quickly. I wanted
to tell you Tom Rochford&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Come on to blazes, Blazes Boylan.</p>
<p> Lenehan gulped to go.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Got the horn or what? he said. Half a mo, I&apos;m coming.</p>
<p> He followed the hasty
<br><font color="green">{ms, 15}</font>
<br> creaking shoes but stood by nimbly by the threshold, saluting a bulky and a slender form.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; How do you do, Mr Dollard?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Eh? How do? How do? Ben Dollard&apos;s vague bass
answered, turning an instant from Father Cowley&apos;s
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">trouble</span></span> woe. He
won&apos;t give you any trouble, Bob. Alf Bergan will speak to long John.
We&apos;ll put a barleystraw in that Judas&apos; ear this time.</p>
<p> Sighing Mr Dedalus came through the saloon, a finger soothing an eyelid.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Hoho, we will, Ben Dollard yodled jollily. Come on,
Simon. Give us a ditty. We heard the piano.</p>
<p> Bald Pat, bothered waiter, waited for orders. Power for Richie. And Bloom?
Let me see. Four. Warm this black is refracts (is it?) heat. Let me see. Cider. Yes, bottle of cider.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What&apos;s that? Mr Dedalus said. I was only vamping, man.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Come on, come on, Ben Dollard called. Begone dull care. Come, Bob.</p>
<p> He ambled Dollard, bulky slops, before them (hold that fellow with the: hold
him now) into the saloon. He plumped him Dollard on the stool. His gouty paws
plumped chords. Plumped, stopped abrupt.</p>
<p> Bald Pat in the doorway met tealess gold returning. Bothered, he wanted
Power and cider. Bronze by the window, watched, bronze from afar.</p>
<p> Jingle a tinkle jaunted.</p>
<p> Bloom heard<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span> a
jing, a little sound. He&apos;s off. Light sob of breath Bloom sighed on the
silent flowers. Jingling. He&apos;s gone. Jingle. Hear.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Love and War, Ben, Mr Dedalus said. God be with old times.</p>
<p> Miss Douce&apos;s brave eyes,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 16}</font>
<br> unregarded, turned from the crossblind, smitten by sunlight. Gone. Pensive
(who knows?), smitten (the smiting light) she lowered the dropblind with a
sliding cord. She drew down pensive (why did he go so quick after I?) about her
bronze, about the bar where bald stood by sister gold, inexquisite contrast,
slow cool seagreen sliding depth of shadow, eau de Nil.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Poor old Goodwin was the pianist that night, Father
Cowley reminded them. There was a slight difference of opinion between himself and the piano.</p>
<p> There was.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A symposium all his own, Mr Dedalus said. The devil
wouldn&apos;t stop him. He was a crotchety old fellow in the primary stage of drink.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; God, do you remember? Ben bulky Dollard said, turning
from the punished keyboard. And, by Japers, I had no wedding garment.</p>
<p> They laughed all three. He had no wed. They all three laughed. No wedding garment.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Our friend Bloom turned in handy that night, Mr Dedalus
said. Where&apos;s my pipe, by the way?</p>
<p> He wandered back to the bar to the lost chord pipe. Bald Pat carried two
diners&apos; drinks. And Father Cowley laughed again.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I saved the situation, Ben, I think.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You did, averred Ben Dollard. I remember those tight
trousers too. That was a brilliant idea, Bob.</p>
<p> Father Cowley blushed to his brilliant purply lobes. He saved the situa.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I knew he was on the rocks, he said. The wife was playing the piano
<br><font color="green">{ms, 17}</font>
<br> in the coffee palace on Saturdays and who was it told me she was doing the
other business. Do you remember? We had to search half Holles street first till
the chap in Keogh&apos;s gave us the number.
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Remembered</span></span> Remember?</p>
<p> Ben remembered, his broad visage wondering.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; By God, she had some splendid cloaks and things there.</p>
<p> Mr Dedalus wandered back, pipe in hand.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Merrion square affairs. Balldresses, by God, and court
dresses. He wouldn&apos;t take any money either. And costumes, by God. What?</p>
<p> Mr Dedalus nodded.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ay, ay, he said. Mrs Marion Bloom has left off clothes of all descriptions.</p>
<p> Jingle jaunted down the quays. Blazes sprawled on bounding tyres.</p>
<p> Liver and bacon. Steak and kidney pie. Right, sir. Right Pat.</p>
<p> Mrs Marion. Met him pike hoses. Smell of burn. Of Paul de Kock. Nice name he.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What&apos;s this her name was? A buxom piece. Marion&nbsp;&hellip;?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Tweedy.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes. Is she alive?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And kicking.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; She was a daughter of&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Daughter of the regiment.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, begad. I remember the old drum major.</p>
<p> Mr Dedalus struck, whizzed, lit, puffed savoury puff after.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Irish? I don&apos;t know, faith. Is she Simon?</p>
<p> Puff after stiff, a
puff<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">:</span></span>, strong, savoury crackling.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Buccinator muscle is. What? Bit rusty. O, she is. My Irish Molly, O.</p>
<p> He puffed a pungent plumy blast.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 18}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; From the rock of Gibraltar all the way.</p>
<p> They pined in depth of ocean shadow, gold by the beerpull, bronze by
maraschino, thoughtful all two. Mina Kennedy, 4 Lismore terrace, Drumcondra with Idolores, a queen, silent.</p>
<p> Pat served, uncovered dishes. Leopold cut liver slices, streaky bacon. As
said before he ate with relish the inner organs, nutty gizzards, fried
cods&apos; roes while Richie Goulding, Colles, Ward ate steak and kidney, steak
then kidney, bite by bite of pie he ate Bloom ate they ate.</p>
<p> Bloom with Goulding, married in silence, ate. Dinners fit for princes.</p>
<p> By Bachelor&apos;s walk jogjaunty jingled Blazes Boylan, bachelor, in sun in
heat, mare&apos;s glossy rump atrot, with flick of whip on bounding tyres:
sprawled, warmseated, impatientsouled, boldsouled. Horn. Have you the? Horn. Have you the? Haw haw horn.</p>
<p> Over their voices Dollard basooned attack, booming over bombarding chords:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; When love absorbs my ardent soul.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; War! War! cried Father Cowley. You&apos;re the warrior.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; So I am, Ben Dollard laughed.</p>
<p> He stopped. He wagged huge beard, huge face over his blunder huge.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Sure, you&apos;d burst the tympanum of her ear, man, Mr
Dedalus said through smoke aroma, with an organ like yours.</p>
<p> In abundant laughter Dollard shook upon the keyboard. He would.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Not to mention another membrane, Father Cowley added. Half time, Ben, Amoroso ma non troppo.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 19}</font>
<br> Let me there.</p>
<p> Miss Kennedy served two gentlemen with tankards of cool stout. She passed a
remark. It was indeed, first gentleman said, beautiful weather. They drank cool
stout. Did she know where the lord lieutenant was going? And heard steel hoofs
ring hoof ring. No, she couldn&apos;t say. But it would be in the paper. O, she
need not trouble. No trouble. She waved about her outspread <u>Independent</u>,
searching, the lord lieutenant, her pinnacles of hair slowmoving, lord lieuten.
Too much trouble, <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">O</span></span>
first gentleman said it was. O, not at all. Way he looked that. Lord lieutenant. Gold by bronze heard iron steel.</p>
<p class="deep">&hellip;.. <u>my ardent soul</u></p>
<p class="flush"><u>I care not for or the morrow.</u></p>
<p> In liver gravy Bloom mashed mashed potatoes. <u>Love and War</u> someone is.
Ben Dollard&apos;s famous. Night he ran round to us to borrow a dress suit for
the concert. Trousers tight as a drum on him. Molly did laugh when he went out.
Threw herself back across the bed, screaming, kicking. With all his belongings
on show. O saints above, I&apos;m drenched! O, the women in the front row! O, I
never laughed so much! Well, of course that&apos;s what gives him the base
barreltone. For instance eunuchs. Wonder who&apos;s playing. Nice touch. Must be
Cowley. Musical. Knows what note you play. Bad breath he has, poor chap. Stopped.</p>
<p> Miss Douce, engaging, Lydia Douce, bowed to suave George Lidwell, gentleman,
entering. Good afternoon. She gave her moist (a lady&apos;s) hand to his firm clasp. Afternoon.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Your friends are inside, Mr Lidwell.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 20}</font> </p>
<p> George Lidwell, solicited, held a Lydia&apos;s hand.</p>
<p> Bloom ate liv. Clean here at least. That chap in the Burton, gummy with
gristle. Not many here, Goulding and I. Clean tables, flowers, mitres of
napkins. Pat to and fro. Bald Pat. Nothing to do. Best value in Dub.</p>
<p> Piano again. Cowley it is. Way he sits in to it, like one together, mutual
understanding. Tiresome shapers scraping fiddles, sawing the cello, remind you
of toothache. Night we were in the box. Brasses under blowing like
<a name="un4016d" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4016d">a grampus</a>,
unscrewing, emptying spittle. Conductor&apos;s legs too, bagstrousers jiggedy jiggedy. Do right to hide them.</p>
<p> Only the harp. Lovely. Gold glowering light. Girl touched it. Poop of a
lovely. Gravy&apos;s rather good fit for a. Golden ship. Erin. The harp that
once. Cool hands. Ben
Howth<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span>, the
rhododendrons. We are their harps. He. He. Old, young.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ah, I couldn&apos;t, man, Mr Dedalus said, shy and listless.</p>
<p> Strongly.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Go on, blast you! Ben Dollard growled. Get it out in bits.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>M&apos;appari</u>, Simon, Father Cowley said.</p>
<p> Down stage he strode some paces, grave, tall in affliction, his long arms
outheld. Hoarsely the apple of his throat hoarsed softly. Softly he sang to a
dusty seascape there: <u>A Last Farewell</u>. A headland, a ship, a sail upon
the billows. Farewell. A lovely girl, her veil awave upon the wind upon the headland, wind around her.</p>
<p> Cowley sang:</p>
<p class="pdiset">&mdash; <u>M&apos;appari tutt&apos;amor</u>
<br> <u>Il mio sguardo</u>&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> She waved, unhearing him, her veil, to one departing, dear one, love, return.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Go on, Simon.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 21}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ah, sure, my dancing days are done, Ben&nbsp;&hellip; Well.</p>
<p> Mr Dedalus laid his pipe to rest beside the tuningfork and, sitting, touched the obedient keys.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, Simon, Father Cowley turned. Play it in the original. One flat.</p>
<p> The keys, obedient, rose higher, told, faltered, confessed, confused.</p>
<p> Up stage strode Father Cowley.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Here, Simon, I&apos;ll accompany you, he said. Get up.</p>
<p> By Graham Lemon&apos;s pineapple rock, by Elvery&apos;s elephant
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">jingle</span></span> jingly jogged.</p>
<p> Steak, kidney, liver, mashed, at meat fit for princes sat princes Bloom and
Goulding. Princes at meat they raised and drank, Power and cider.</p>
<p> Most beautiful tenor air ever written, Richie said: <u>Sonambula.</u> He
heard Joe Maas sing that one night. That was a lyrical tenor if you like. Never forget it.</p>
<p> Bloom tenderly over liverless bacon saw the
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">s</span></span> tigthened face
before him. Backache. Bright&apos;s bright
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext"><font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">unread</span></font></span></span>
eye. Next item on the programme. Pills, pounded bread, worth a guinea a box.
Stave it off awhile. Sings too: <u>Down among the dead men</u>. Appropriate.
Kidney pie. Sweets to the. Not making much hand of it. Best value in.
Characteristic of him. Power. Particular about his drink. Fecking matches from
counters to save. Then squander a sovereign in dribs and drabs. And when
he&apos;s wanted not a farthing. Curious types.</p>
<p> Never would Richie forget that night. As long as he lived: never. In the
gods of the old Royal with little Peake. And when the first note.</p>
<p> Speech paused on Richie&apos;s lips.</p>
<p> Coming out with a whopper now. Rhapsodies about damn all. Believes his own
lies. Does really. <a name="un4015dd" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4015dd">Wonderful liar</a>.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Which air is that? asked Leopold Bloom.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;</p>
<p> Richie cocked his lips upout. A low incipient note sweet murmured: all. A
thrush. A throstle. His breath, birdsweet, good

<br><font color="green">{ms, 22}</font>
<br> he&apos;s proud of, fluted with plaintive woe. Is lost. Rich sound. Two
notes there like that blackbird I heard in the hawthorn valley. How is that
done? All lost now. Mournful he whistled. Fall, surrender, lost.</p>
<p> Leopold Bloom bent ear, turning a fringe of doyley down under the vase.
Order. Yes, I remember. Lovely air. In sleep she went to him. Innocence, Still
hold her back. <a name="un4014ad" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4014ad">Call
name</a>. Touch water. Jingle jaunty. Too late. She longed to go. That&apos;s
why. Woman. As easy stop the sea. Yes<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span>: all is lost.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A beautiful air, Bloom said. I know it well.</p>
<p> Never in all his life had Richie Goulding.</p>
<p> He knows it well too. Or he feels. Wise child that knows her father, Dedalus said. Me?</p>
<p> Bloom askance over liverless saw. Face of the all is lost. Rollicking Richie
once. Old stale jokes now. Wagging his ear. Napkinring in his eye.</p>
<p> Piano again. Sounds better than last time I heard. Tuned probably. Stopped again.</p>
<p> Dollard and Cowley still urged the lingering singer out with it.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; With it, Simon.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It, Simon.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ladies and gentlemen, I am most deeply obliged by your kind solicitations.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It, Simon.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I have no money but if you will lend me your attention I
shall endeavour to sing to you of a heart bowed down.</p>
<p> By the sandwichbell in screening shadow Lydia, her bronze and rose, a
lady&apos;s grace, gave and withheld: and in cool glaucous eau de Nil Mina her pinnacles of gold.</p>
<p> The harping chords of prelude closed. A chord, longdrawn, expectant, drew a voice away.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>When first I saw that form endearing.</u></p>
<p> Richie turned:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Si Dedalus&apos; voice, he said
<br><font color="green">{ms, 23}</font> </p>
<p> Bloom signed to Pat, bald Pat is a waiter hard of hearing, to set ajar the
door of the bar. The door of the bar. So. That will do. Pat, waiter, waited to hear hard of hear by the door.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Sorrow from me seemed to depart.</u></p>
<p> Through the hush of air a voice sang to them, low, not rain, not leaves in
murmur, like no voice of strings or reeds or what do you call them dulcimers
touching their still ears with words, still hearts of their each his remembered
lives. Good, good to hear: sorrow from them each seemed to from both depart when
first they heard. When first they saw, lost Richie Poldy, mercy of beauty, heard
from a person wouldn&apos;t expect
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">in</span></span> it in the least her first merciful lovesoft word.</p>
<p> Love that is singing: love&apos;s old sweet song. Bloom unwound slowly the
elastic band of his packet. Love&apos;s old sweet sonnez la gold. Bloom wound it
in a skein round four forkfingers, stretched it, relaxed, and wound it round his
troubled double, fourfold, in octave: gyved them fast.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Full of hope and all delighted.</u></p>
<p> Tenors get women by the score. Jingle all delighted. He can&apos;t sing for
tall hats. Your head it simply swurls. Perfumed for him. What perfume does your
wife? I want to know. Jingle. Stop. Knock. Last look at mirror always before she
answers the door. The hall. There? How do you? I do well. There? What? Or? Phial
of kissing comfits in her satchel. Yes? Hand felt for the opulent.</p>
<p> Alas the voice rose, sighing, changed: loud, full, shining, proud.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>But alas, &apos;twas idle dreaming</u>&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> Glorious tone he has still. Silly man! Could have made oceans of money. Wore out his
<br><font color="green">{ms, 24}</font>
<br> wife: now sings. But hard to tell. Only the two themselves. If he
doesn&apos;t break down. Drink. Nerves overstrung. Singers must be abstemious.</p>
<p> Tenderness it
welled<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span>: slow,
swelling, full it throbbed. That&apos;s the chat. Ha, give! Take! Throb, a throb, a pulsing proud erect.</p>
<p> Words? Music? No: it&apos;s what&apos;s behind.</p>
<p> Bloom looped, unlooped, noded, disnoded.</p>
<p> Bloom. Flood of warm jamjam lickitup secretness flowed to flow out in music,
in desire, dark to lick flow invading. Tup. Pores to dilate dilating. Tup. The
joy the feel the warm the. Tup. To pour o&apos;er sluices pouring gushes. Flood,
gush, flow, joygush, tupthrob. Now! Language of love.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;&nbsp;&hellip; <u>ray of hope is</u>&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

naughty boy. Still the name: Martha. How strange.</p>
<p> The voice returned, weaker but unwearied. It sang again to Richie Poldy
Lydia Lidwell also sang to Pat open mouth ear waiting to wait. How first he saw
that form endearing, how sorrow seemed to part, how look, form, word charmed him
Gould Lidwell, won Pat Bloom&apos;s heart</p>
<p> Wish I could see his face, though. Explain better. Why the barber in
Drago&apos;s always looked my face when I spoke his face in the glass.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Each graceful look</u>&nbsp;&hellip;.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 25}</font> </p>
<p> First night I met her at Mat Dillon&apos;s in Roundtown. Yellow, black lace
she wore. Musical chairs. We two the last. Fate. Fate. After her. Round and
round. Slow. Quick. Round. We. All looked. Halt. She sat. Yellow knees.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Charmed my eye</u>&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> Then singing. <u>Waiting</u> she sang. I turned her music. Full voice of
perfumes of the lilactrees. Bosom I saw, both full, throat warbling. When first
I saw. She thanked me. Why did she me? Spanishy eyes. At me. Luring. Ah, alluring.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Martha! Ah, Martha!</u></p>
<p> Quitting all langour he cried in grief, in cry of passion to love to return
with deepening and rising chords of harmony. In cry of loneliness that she
should know, must feel. For her he waited. Where? Somewhere.</p>
<p class="pdiset">&mdash; <u>Co-ome, thou lost one!</u>
<br> <u>Co-ome, thou dear one!</u></p>
<p> Alone. One love. One hope. One comfort me. Martha, return!</p>

long breath he breath long life, soaring high, high resplendent, crowned,
aflame, high in the effulgence, high, of the etherial bosom. high of the vast

<p class="pdi">&mdash; Seven days in gaol, Ben Dollard said, on bread and water.
Then you&apos;d sing, Simon, like a garden thrush.</p>
<p> The singer Simon laughed. Father Cowley played. Mina Kennedy served. Second
gentleman paid. Tom Kernan strutted in. Lydia, admired, admired.</p>
<p> Admiring.</p>
<p> Richie, admiring, descanted on that man&apos;s glorious voice. He remembed
one night. Never forget that night. Si sang <u>&apos;Twas rank and fame</u>: in
Ned Lambert&apos;s &apos;twas. Good God he never heard in all his life a note
like that he never did then false one we had better part so clear so God he
never heard since love lives not a clinking voice lives not ask Lambert he can tell
<br><font color="green">{ms, 27}</font>
<br> you too.</p>
<p> Goulding, a flush struggling in his pale, told Mr Bloom, face of the night,
Si in Ned Lambert&apos;s, Dedalus house, sang <u>&apos;Twas rank and fame</u>.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom listened while Richie Goulding told him, Mr Bloom, of the night,
he, Richie, heard him, Si Dedalus sing <u>&apos;Twas rank and fame</u> in his, Ned Lambert&apos;s, house.</p>
<p> Brothers-in-law. Rift in the lute I think. Treats him with scorn. See. He
admires him all the more. The night Si sang. The human voice, two tiny silky
chords, wonderful, more than all others.</p>
<p> That voice was a lamentation. Calmer now. It&apos;s in the silence after you
feel you hear. Vibrations. Now silent air.</p>
<p> Bloom ungyved his crisscrossed hands and, with slack fingers, plucked the
slender catgut thong. He drew and plucked. It twanged. While Goulding talked of
Barraclough&apos;s voice production, while Tom Kernan, harking back in a
retrospective arrangement talked to listening Father Cowley, who played a
voluntary, who nodded as he played. While big Ben Dollard talked with Simon
Dedalus, lighting, who nodded as he smoked, who smoked.</p>
<p> Thou lost one. All songs about that theme. Yet more Bloom stretched his
string. Cruel it seems. Let people get fond of each other: lure them on. Then
tear asunder. Death. Explos. Knock on the head.

<p> Miss Douce, requested, served the same again. She had a gorgeous time.
Simply gorgeous. That lovely shell she brought. To the end of the bar to him she
bore lightly the spiked and winding seahorn that he, George Lidwell, solicitor might hear:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Listen! she bade him.</p>
<p> Under Tom Kernan&apos;s ginhot words the accompanist wove music slow.
Authentic fact. How Walter Bapty lost his voice. The husband took him by the
throat. Scoundrel, said he, you&apos;ll sing no more lovesongs. He did, faith,
sir Tom. Bob Cowley wove. Tenors get wom. Cowley lay back.</p>
<p> Ah, now he heard, she holding it to his ear. Hear! He heard. Wonderful. She
held it to her own. And through the sifted light pale gold in contrast glided.</p>
<p> Tap.</p>
<p> Bloom through the bardoor saw a shell held at their ears. He heard more
faintly that that they heard, each for herself alone, then each for other,
hearing the plash of waves, loudly, a silent roar.</p>
<p> Bronze by a weary gold, anear, afar, they listened.</p>
<p> Her ear too is a shell, the peeping lobe there. Been to the seaside. Lovely
seaside girls. Skin all raw. Should have put on coldcream first make it brown. Buttered toast. Fever
<br><font color="green">{ms, 33}</font>
<br> near her mouth. Your head it simply. Hair braided over, shell with seaweed.
Why do they hide their ears with hair. And Turks the mouth, why. Her eyes over
the sheet. Yashmak. Find the way in. A cave. No admittance except on business.</p>
<p> The sea they think they hear. Singing, a roar. The blood it is. Souse in the
ears sometimes. Well, it&apos;s a sea. Corpuscle islands.</p>
<p> Wonderful really. So distinct. Again. George Lidwell held its murmur, hearing: then laid it by, gently.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What are the wild waves saying? he asked her, smiled.</p>
<p> Charming, seasmiling and unanswering Lydia on Lidwell smiled.</p>
<p> Tap.</p>
<p> By Larry O&apos;Rourke&apos;s, by Larry, bold Larry O&apos;, Boylan swayed and Boylan turned.</p>
<p> From the forsaken shell Miss Mina glided to her tankards waiting. no, she
was not so lonely archly Miss Douce&apos;s head let Lidwell know. Walking in the
moonlight by the sea. Not, not alone. With whom? She nobly answered: with a gentleman friend.</p>
<p> Bob Cowley&apos;s twinkling fingers in the treble played again. The landlord
has the prior. A little time. Long John. Big Ben. Lightly he played a light
bright tinkling measure, arch and smiling, and for their gallants, gentlemen
friends. One: one, one, one, one, one: two, one, three, four.</p>
<p> Sea, wind, leaves, thunder, waters, cows, lowing, the cattle market, cocks,
hens don&apos;t crow, snakes hissss. There&apos;s music everywhere.
Ruttledge&apos;s door: ee creaking. No, that&apos;s noise. Minuet of Don Giovanni he&apos;s playing now. Court dresses
<br><font color="green">{ms, 34}</font>
<br> in castle dancing. Misery. Peasants outside. Green starving faces eating
dockleaves. Nice that is. Look: look, look, look, look, look: you look at us.</p>
<p> That&apos;s joyful I can feel. Never have written it. Why? My joy is other
joy. But both are joys. Yes, joy it must be. Mere fact of music shows you are.

<p> O, look we are so! Chamber music. Could make a pun of that. &apos;Tis kind

<p> The voice of dark age, of unlove, earth&apos;s fatigue made grave approach,
called on good men and true. The priest he sought. With him would he speak a word.</p>
<p> Ben Dollard&apos;s voice. Base barreltone. Doing his best to say it. Other
comedown. Big ships&apos; chandler&apos;s business he had once. Remember: rosiny
ropes, ships&apos; lanterns. Failed to the tune of ten thousand pounds. Now in
the Iveagh home.

Step in. The holy father. With bows a traitor servant. Curleques of chords.</p>
<p> Ruin. Then build them cubicles to end their days in. Hushaby. Lullaby. Die, dog. Little dog, die</p>
<p> The voice of warning, solemn warning, told them the youth had entered a
lonely hall, told them how solemn fell his footfalls there, told them the gloomy
chamber, the vested priest sitting to hear.</p>
<p> Decent soul. Bit addled now. Thinks he&apos;ll win

Poets&apos; competition. Bird sitting hatching in a nest. <u>Lay of the Last
Minstrel</u>, he thought it was. Good voice he has still. No eunuch yet.</p>
<p> Listen. Bloom listened. Richie Goulding listened. And by the door deaf Pat, bald Pat, tipped Pat, listened.</p>
<p> The chords harped slower.</p>
<p> The voice of penance and of grief came slow, embellished, tremulous.
Ben&apos;s beard confessed. <u>In nomine Domini</u>
<br><font color="green">{ms, 36}</font>
<br> in God&apos;s name he knelt. He beat his hand upon his breast, confessing: <u>mea culpa</u>.</p>

<p> Tap.</p>
<p> They listened. Tankards and Miss Kennedy. George Lidwell, eyelid well expressive, fullbusted satin. Kernan. Si.</p>
<p> The sighing voice of sorrow sang. His sins. Since Easter he had cursed three
times. Once at masstime<a target="foot" id="fmz0081">&ordm;</a> he had gone to
play. Once by the churchyard he had passed and for his mother&apos;s rest he had not prayed. A boy. A croppy boy.</p>
<p> Bronze, listening, by the beerpull gazed far away. Soulfully. Doesn&apos;t

<p> Bronze gazed far sideways. Is that best side of her face. They always know.
Knock at the door. Last touch to titivate.</p>

<p> What do they think about when they hear music. Way to catch rattlesnakes.
Night Michael Gunn gave us the box. Tuning up. Shah of Persia liked that best of
all. Wiped his nose in curtain too. Custom his country perhaps. That&apos;s
music too. Tootling. Brasses braying asses. Doublebasses helpless gashes in
their sides. Woodwinds mooing cows. Woodwind like Goodwin&apos;s name.</p>
<p> She looked fine. Her crocus dress she wore lowcut, belongings on show. Clove
her breath was always in theatre when she bent to ask a question. Told her what
Spinoza says in that book of poor papa&apos;s. Hypnotised, listening. Eyes like
that. She bent. Chap in dress circle staring down into her with his opera glass. Met him pike hoses. Philosophy.

Rudy gone. Too late now. Or if not? If not? If still?</p>
<p> He bore no hate.</p>
<p> Hate. Love. Those are names. Rudy. Soon I am old.</p>
<p> Big Ben his voice unfolded. Great voice Richie Goulding said, a flush

<p> Ireland comes now. My country above the king. She listens. Time to be going. Looked enough.</p>

<p> Bloom looked. Got up to kill. On eighteen bob a week. Fellows shell out the
dibs. Moonlit walks by the sad sea waves. Want to keep your weather eye open.
Those girls, those lovely. Chorusgirl&apos;s romance. Letters read out in court
for breach of promise. From chickabiddy&apos;s owny Mumpsypum. Laughter in court. Henry. The lovely name you have.</p>
<p> Low sank the music, air and words. Then hastened. The false priest rustling
soldier from his cassock. A yeoman captain. They know it all before. The thrill they itch for. Yeoman cap.</p>
<p> Tap. Tap.</p>
<p> Thrilled she listened, bending to hear.</p>
<p> Blank face. Virgin should say or fingered only. Write something on it: page.
If not what becomes of them: despair. Keeps them young. Even admire themselves.
See. Play on her. Lip blow. Body of white woman, a flute alive. Blow gentle.
Loud. Three holes, all women. Goddess I didn&apos;t see. They want it. Not too much polite. That&apos;s why

<p> <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">I.</span></span> Will? You? I. Want. You. To.</p>
<p> With hoarse rude fury the yeoman cursed, swelling in apoplect. A good

<p> A liquid of woman eyeball gazed under a fence of lashes, calmly, hearing.
See real beauty of the eye when she not speaks. On yonder river. At each slow
heaving bosom&apos;s wave (her heaving embon) red rose rose slowly sank red
rose. Heartbeats: her breath: breath that is life. And all the tiny tiny fernfoils trembled of maidenhair.</p>
<p> But look. The bright stars fade. O rose. Castile. The morn.</p>
<p> Ha. Lidwell that is. For him then she, not me. His eyes infatuated. See her
from here though. Popped corks, splashes of beerfroth, stacks of empties.</p>

reposed and, gently touching, then slid so smoothly, slowly down, a cool firm

<br><font color="green">{ms, 39}</font>
<br> Walk, walk, walk somewhere.</p>
<p> Well, I must be. Are you off? Yes. Bloom stood up. Soap feeling rather
sticky behind. Well, so long. High grade. Card inside. Yes.</p>
<p> By deaf Pat in the doorway straining ear Bloom passed.</p>
<p> At Geneva barrack that young man died. At Passage was his body laid. The
voice of the mournful chanter called to prayer.</p>
<p> By rose, by satiny bosom, by the fondling hand, by slops, by empties, by
popped corks, greeting in going, past eyes and maidenhair, bronze and faint gold
in deepseashadow, went Bloom, soft Bloom, I feel so lonely Bloom.</p>
<p> Tap. Tap. Tap.</p>
<p> Pray for him prayed the bass of Dollard. You who hear in peace. Breathe a
prayer, drop a tear, good men, good people. He was the croppy boy.</p>
<p> Scaring eavesdropping boots croppy bootsboy Bloom in the Ormond hallway
heard the growls and roars of bravo, fat backslapping, their boots all treading,

<p class="pdi">&mdash; Come on, Ben, Simon Dedalus cried. By God, you&apos;re as good as ever you were.</p>

nursing it after dinner. Pom. Pompedy. Jolly for the wife. Asses&apos; skins.
Welt them through life, then wallop after death. Pom. Wallop. Seems to me what
you call yashmak or I mean kismet. Fate.</p>
<p> Tap. Tap. A stripling, blind, with a tapping cane came taptaptapping by
Daly&apos;s window where a mermaid blew whiffs of a mermaid, smoke mermaids, coolest whiffs of all.</p>
<p> Instruments. Even comb and tissue paper you can knock a tune out of. Molly
in her shift in Lombard street west, hair down. I suppose each kind of trade
made its own, don&apos;t you see. Hunter with a horn. Have you the? Haw haw.
Sonnez la. Shepherd his pipe. Policeman a whistle. All is lost now. Drum?
Pompedy. Wait. I know. Towncrier or bum bailiff. Waken the dead. Dignam. Poor
little Paddy. It is music. I mean, of course, it&apos;s all pom pom pompedy pom. But still.</p>
<p> I must really. Fff.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 43}</font>
<br> Now if I did that at a banquet. Still it&apos;s question of custom. The
shah of Persia. Breathe a prayer, drop a tear. All the same he must have been a
bit stupid not to see it was a yeoman cap. O, the whore of the lane!</p>
<p> A frowsy whore with black straw hat askew came glazily in the day towards Mr
Bloom. When first he saw that form endearing? Yes, it is. I feel so lonely. Wet
night in the lane. Off her beat here. What is she? Hope she. Psst! Any chance of
your wash. Knew Molly. Had me decked. Stout lady does be with you in the brown
costume. Put you off your stroke that. Sees me, does she? Looks a fright in the
day. Face like dip. Damn her. O, well, she has to live. Look in here.</p>
<p> In Lionel Marks&apos;s antique window Lionel Leopold dear Henry Flower
earnestly Mr Leopold Bloom envisaged battered candlesticks melodeons oozing
maggoty blowbags. Bargain, six bob. Might learn to play. Cheap. Let her pass.
Course everything is dear if you don&apos;t want it. That&apos;s what good
salesman is. Make you buy what he wants to sell. She&apos;s passing now. Six bob.</p>
<p> Must be the cider or perhaps the burgund.</p>
<p> Near bronze from anear near gold from afar they stossed their clinking
glasses all, brighteyed and gallant, before bronze Lydia&apos;s tempting last
rose of summer, rose of Castile. First Lid, De, Cow, Ker, Doll, a fifth.
Lidwell, Si Dedalus, Bob Cowley, Kernan and big Ben Dollard.</p>
<p> Bloom viewed <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">t</span></span> a
gallant pictured hero in Lionel Marks&apos;s window. Robert Emmet&apos;s last
words. Seven last words. Of Meyer beer that is.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; True men like you men.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 44}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ay, ay, Ben</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Will lift your glass with us.</p>
<p> They lifted.</p>
<p> Tschink. Tschunk.</p>
<p> Tip. An unseeing stripling stood in the door. He saw not bronze. He saw not
gold. Nor Ben nor Bob nor Tom nor Si nor George nor tanks nor Richie nor Pat. Hee hee hee hee. He did not see.</p>
<p> Seabloom, greeseabloom viewed last words. Softly. When my country takes her place</p>
<p> Prrprr.</p>
<p> Must be the <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">bur.</span></span> burgund.</p>
<p> Fff! Oo. Rrpr.</p>
<p> The nations of the earth. No-one behind. She&apos;s passed. Then and not
till then. Tram kran kran kran. Good oppor. Coming. Krandlkrankran. I&apos;m
sure it&apos;s the bur. One, two. Let my epitaph be. Kraaaaaa. Written. I have.</p>
<p> Pprrpffrrppffff.</p>
<p> Done. $.ZH</p>
