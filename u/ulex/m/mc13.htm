<p class="SpPar">Bronze by gold, Miss Douce&apos;s head by Miss Kennedy&apos;s head, over the
<br><font color="green">{u22, 247}</font>
<br> crossblind of the Ormond bar heard the viceregal hoofs go by, ringing steel.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Is that her? asked Miss Kennedy.</p>
<p> Miss Douce said yes, sitting with his ex, pearl grey and <i>eau de Nil</i>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Exquisite contrast, Miss Kennedy said.</p>
<p> When all agog Miss Douce said eagerly:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Look at the fellow in the tall silk.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who? Where? gold asked more eagerly.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; In the second carriage, Miss Douce&apos;s wet lips said,
laughing in the sun. He&apos;s looking. Mind till I see.</p>
<p> She darted, bronze, to the backmost corner, flattening her face against the pane in a halo of hurried breath.</p>
<p> Her wet lips tittered:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He&apos;s killed looking back.</p>
<p> She laughed:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O wept! Aren&apos;t men frightful idiots?</p>
<p> With sadness.</p>
<p> Miss Kennedy sauntered sadly from bright light, twining a loose hair behind
an ear. Sauntering sadly, gold no more, she twisted twined a hair. Sadly she
twined in sauntering gold hair behind a curving ear.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It&apos;s them has the fine times, sadly then she said.</p>
<p> A man.</p>
<p> <a name="un4015bf" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4015bf">Bloowho</a> went
by by Moulang&apos;s pipes, bearing in his breast the sweets of sin, by
Wine&apos;s antiques in memory bearing sweet sinful words, by Carroll&apos;s dusky battered plate, for Raoul.</p>
<p> The boots to them, them in the bar, them barmaids came. For them unheeding
him he banged on the counter his tray of chattering china. And </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There&apos;s your teas, he said.</p>
<p> Miss Kennedy with manners transposed the teatray down to an upturned lithia crate, safe from eyes, low.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What is it? loud boots unmannerly asked.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Find out, Miss Douce retorted, leaving her spyingpoint.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Your beau<a target="foot" id="fmm0005">&ordm;</a>, is it?</p>
<p> A haughty bronze replied:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I&apos;ll complain to Mrs de Massey on you if I hear any more of your impertinent insolence.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Imperthnthn thnthnthn, bootsnout sniffed rudely, as he retreated as she threatened as he had come.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 248}</font> </p>
<p> Bloom.</p>
<p> On her flower frowning Miss Douce said:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="un4031cc" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031cc">Most aggravating</a>
that young brat is. If he doesn&apos;t conduct himself I&apos;ll wring his ear for him a yard long.</p>
<p> Ladylike in exquisite contrast.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Take no notice, Miss Kennedy rejoined.</p>
<p> She poured in a teacup tea, then back in the teapot tea. They cowered under
their reef of counter, waiting on footstools, crates upturned, waiting for their
teas to draw. <a name="un1015i" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1015i">They
pawed their blouses</a>, both of black satin,
<a name="un1015i" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1015i">two and nine a
yard</a>, waiting for their teas to draw, and
<a name="un1015i" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1015i">two and seven</a>.</p>
<p> Yes, bronze from anear, by gold from afar, heard steel from anear, hoofs
ring from afar, and heard steelhoofs ringhoof ringsteel.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Am I awfully sunburnt?</p>
<p> Miss bronze unbloused her neck.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; No, said Miss Kennedy.
<a name="un1007e" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1007e">It gets brown after.
Did you try the borax with the cherry laurel water</a>?</p>
<p> Miss Douce halfstood to see her skin askance in the barmirror gildedlettered
where hock and claret glasses shimmered and in their midst a shell.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And leave it to my hands, she said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Try it with the
<a name="un1007d" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1007d">glycerine</a>, Miss Kennedy advised.</p>
<p> Bidding her neck and hands adieu Miss Douce<a target="foot" id="fmm0006">&ordm;</a> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Those things only bring out a rash, replied, reseated. I
asked that old fogey in Boyd&apos;s for something for my skin.</p>
<p> Miss Kennedy, pouring now fulldrawn tea, grimaced and prayed:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O, don&apos;t remind me of him for mercy&apos; sake<a target="foot" id="fmm0007">&ordm;</a>!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; But wait till I tell you, Miss Douce entreated.</p>
<p> Sweet tea Miss Kennedy having poured with milk plugged both two ears with little fingers.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; No, don&apos;t, she cried.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I won&apos;t listen, she cried.</p>
<p> But Bloom?</p>
<p> Miss Douce grunted in snuffy fogey&apos;s tone:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; For your what? says he.</p>
<p> Miss Kennedy unplugged her ears to hear, to speak: but said, but prayed again:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Don&apos;t let me think of him or I&apos;ll expire. The
hideous old wretch! That night in the Antient Concert Rooms.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 249}</font> </p>
<p> She sipped distastefully her brew, hot tea, a sip, sipped sweet tea.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Here he was, Miss Douce said, cocking her bronze head
three quarters, ruffling her nosewings. Hufa! Hufa!</p>
<p> Shrill shriek of laughter sprang from Miss Kennedy&apos;s throat. Miss Douce
huffed and snorted down her nostrils that quivered imperthnthn like a
snout<a target="foot" id="fmm0008">&ordm;</a> in quest.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O! shrieking, Miss Kennedy cried. Will you ever forget his goggle eye?</p>
<p> Miss Douce chimed in in deep bronze laughter, shouting:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And your other eye!</p>
<p> <a name="un4015bf" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4015bf">Bloowhose</a>
dark eye read Aaron Figatner&apos;s name. Why do I always think Figather?
Gathering figs I think. And Prosper Lor&eacute;&apos;s huguenot name. By
Bassi&apos;s blessed virgins Bloom&apos;s dark eyes went by. Bluerobed, white
under, come to me. God they believe she is: or goddess. Those today. I could not
see. That fellow spoke. A student. After with Dedalus&apos;
son<a target="foot" id="fmm0009">&ordm;</a>. He might be Mulligan. All comely
virgins. That brings those rakes of fellows in: her white.</p>
<p> By went his eyes. The sweets of sin. Sweet are the sweets. </p>
<p> Of sin.</p>
<p> In a giggling peal young goldbronze voices blended, Douce with Kennedy your
other eye. They threw young heads back, bronze
<a name="un4015o" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4015o">gigglegold</a>, to let
freefly their laughter, screaming, your other, signals to each other, high piercing notes.</p>
<p> Ah, panting, sighing,<a target="foot" id="fmm0010">&ordm;</a>
sighing<a target="foot" id="fmm0011">&ordm;</a>, ah, fordone their mirth died down.</p>
<p> Miss Kennedy lipped her cup again, raised, drank a sip and
<a name="un4015o" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4015o">gigglegiggled</a>.
Miss Douce, bending again over the teatray, ruffled again her nose and rolled
droll fattened eyes. Again
<a name="un4015o" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4015o">Kennygiggles</a>,
stooping her fair pinnacles of hair, stooping, her tortoise napecomb showed,
spluttered out of her mouth her tea, choking in tea and laughter, coughing with choking, crying:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O greasy eyes! Imagine being married to a man like that, she cried. With his bit of beard!</p>
<p> Douce gave full vent to a splendid yell, a full yell of full woman, delight, joy, indignation.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Married to the greasy nose! she yelled.</p>
<p> Shrill, with deep laughter, after bronze in gold, they urged each each to
peal after peal, ringing in changes, bronzegold goldbronze, shrilldeep, to
laughter after laughter. And then laughed more. Greasy I knows. Exhausted,
breathless their shaken heads they laid, braided and pinnacled by glossycombed,
against the counterledge. All flushed (O!), panting, sweating (O!), all breathless.</p>
<p> Married to Bloom, to greaseaseabloom.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 250}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O saints above! Miss Douce said, sighed above her jumping
rose. I wished I hadn&apos;t laughed so much. I feel all wet.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O, Miss Douce! Miss Kennedy protested. You horrid thing!</p>
<p> And flushed yet more (you horrid!), more goldenly.</p>
<p> By Cantwell&apos;s offices roved Greaseabloom, by Ceppi&apos;s virgins,
bright of their oils. Nannetti&apos;s father hawked those things about,
wheedling at doors as I. Religion pays. Must see him about Keyes&apos;s par. Eat
first. I want. Not yet. At four, she said. Time ever passing. Clockhands
turning. On. Where eat? The Clarence, Dolphin. On. For Raoul. Eat. If I net five
guineas with those ads. The violet silk petticoats. Not yet. The sweets of sin. </p>
<p> Flushed less, still less, goldenly paled.</p>
<p> Into their bar strolled Mr Dedalus. Chips,
<a name="un1001e" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1001e">picking chips off one
of his rocky thumbnails</a>. Chips. He strolled.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O welcome back, Miss Douce.</p>
<p> He held her hand. Enjoyed her holidays?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Tiptop.</p>
<p> He hoped she had nice weather in Rostrevor.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Gorgeous, she said. Look at the holy show I am. Lying out on the strand all day.</p>
<p> Bronze whiteness.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That was exceedingly naughty of you, Mr Dedalus told her
and pressed her hand indulgently. Tempting poor simple males.</p>
<p> Miss Douce of satin douced her arm away.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O go away, she said. You&apos;re very simple, I don&apos;t think.</p>
<p> He was.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Well now, I am, he mused. I looked so simple in the cradle they christened me simple Simon.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You must have been
<a name="un4015k" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4015k">a doaty</a>, Miss
Douce made answer. And what did the doctor order today?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Well now, he mused, whatever you say yourself. I think
I&apos;ll trouble you for some fresh water and a half glass of whisky.</p>
<p> Jingle.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="un1032eh" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1032eh">With the greatest alacrity</a>, Miss Douce agreed.</p>
<p> With grace of alacrity towards the mirror gilt Cantrell and Cochrane&apos;s
she turned herself. With grace she tapped a measure of gold whisky from her
crystal keg. Forth from the skirt of his coat Mr Dedalus brought pouch and pipe.
Alacrity she served. He blew through the flue two husky fifenotes.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 251}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; By Jove, he mused. I often wanted to see the Mourne
mountains<a target="foot" id="fmm0012">&ordm;</a>. Must be a great tonic in the
air down there. But a long threatening comes at last, they say. Yes, yes.</p>
<p> Yes. He fingered shreds
<a name="un7033b" href="../../ff/unbs/un7all.htm#un7033b">of hair, her
maidenhair, her mermaid&apos;s,</a> into the bowl. Chips. Shreds. Musing. Mute.</p>
<p> None not said nothing. Yes. </p>
<p> Gaily Miss Douce polished a tumbler, trilling:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>O, Idolores, queen of the eastern seas!</i><a target="foot" id="fmm0013">&ordm;</a></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Was Mr Lidwell in today?</p>
<p> In came Lenehan. Round him peered Lenehan. Mr Bloom reached Essex bridge.
Yes, Mr Bloom crossed bridge of Yessex. To Martha I must write. Buy paper.
Daly&apos;s. Girl there civil. Bloom. Old Bloom. Blue bloom<a target="foot" id="fmm0014">&ordm;</a> is on the rye.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He was in at lunchtime, Miss Douce said.</p>
<p> Lenehan came forward.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Was Mr Boylan looking for me?</p>
<p> He asked. She answered:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Miss Kennedy, was Mr Boylan in while I was upstairs?</p>
<p> She asked. Miss voice of Kennedy answered, a second teacup poised, her gaze
upon a page:<a target="foot" id="fmm0015">&ordm;</a></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; No. He was not.</p>
<p> Miss gaze of Kennedy, heard not seen, read on. Lenehan round the sandwichbell wound his round body round.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Peep! Who&apos;s in the corner?</p>
<p> No glance of Kennedy rewarding him he yet made overtures. To mind her stops.
To <a name="un1032ea" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1032ea">read only the
black ones</a>: round o and crooked ess.</p>
<p> Jingle jaunty jingle.</p>
<p> Girlgold she read and did not glance. Take no notice. She took no notice
while he read by rote a solfa fable for her, plappering flatly:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ah fox met ah stork. Said thee fox too thee stork: Will
you put your bill down inn my troath and pull upp ah bone?</p>
<p> He droned in vain. Miss Douce turned to her tea aside.</p>
<p> He sighed, aside<a target="foot" id="fmm0016">&ordm;</a>:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ah me! O my!</p>
<p> He greeted Mr Dedalus and got a nod.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Greetings from the famous son of
<a name="un1003d" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1003d">a famous father</a>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who may he be? Mr Dedalus asked.</p>
<p> Lenehan opened most genial arms. Who?
<br><font color="green">{u22, 252}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who may he be? he asked. Can you ask? Stephen, the youthful bard. </p>
<p> Dry.</p>
<p> Mr Dedalus, famous father, laid by his dry filled pipe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I see, he said. I didn&apos;t recognise him for the
moment. I hear he is keeping very select company. Have you seen him lately?</p>
<p> He had.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I quaffed the nectarbowl with him this very day, said
Lenehan. In Mooney&apos;s <i>en ville</i> and in Mooney&apos;s <i>sur mer</i>.
He had received the rhino for the labour of his muse.</p>
<p> He smiled at bronze&apos;s teabathed lips, at listening lips and eyes.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The <i>&eacute;lite</i> of Erin hung upon his lips. The
ponderous pundit,<a target="foot" id="fmm0017">&ordm;</a> Hugh MacHugh,
Dublin&apos;s most brilliant scribe and editor and that minstrel boy of the wild
wet west who is known by the euphonious appellation of the O&apos;Madden Burke.</p>
<p> After an interval Mr Dedalus raised his grog and</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That must have been highly diverting, said he. I see.</p>
<p> He see. He drank.
<a name="un4015ba" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4015ba">With faraway
mourning mountain eye.</a> Set down his glass.</p>
<p> He looked towards the saloon door.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I see you have moved the piano.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The tuner was in today, Miss Douce replied, tuning it for
the smoking concert and I never heard such an exquisite player.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Is that a fact?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Didn&apos;t he, Miss Kennedy? The real classical, you
know. And blind too, poor fellow. Not twenty I&apos;m sure he was.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Is that a fact? Mr Dedalus said.</p>
<p> He drank and strayed away.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; So sad to look at his face, Miss Douce condoled.</p>
<p> God&apos;s curse on bitch&apos;s bastard.</p>
<p> Tink to her pity cried a diner&apos;s bell. To the door of the diningroom
came bald Pat, came bothered Pat, came Pat, waiter of Ormond. Lager for diner. Lager without alacrity she served.</p>
<p> With patience Lenehan waited for Boylan with impatience, for jingle
jaunty<a target="foot" id="fmm0018">&ordm;</a> blazes boy.</p>
<p> Upholding the lid he (who?) gazed in the coffin (coffin?) at the  oblique
triple (piano!) wires. He pressed (the same who pressed indulgently her hand),
soft pedalling a triple of keys to see<a target="foot" id="fmm0019">&ordm;</a>
the thicknesses of felt advancing, to hear the muffled hammerfall in action.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 253}</font> </p>
<p> Two sheets cream vellum paper one reserve two envelopes when I was in Wisdom
Hely&apos;s wise Bloom in Daly&apos;s Henry Flower bought. Are you not happy in
your home? Flower to console me and a pin cuts lo. Means something, language of
flow. Was it a daisy? Innocence that is. Respectable girl meet after mass.
Thanks<a target="foot" id="fmm0020">&ordm;</a> awfully muchly. Wise Bloom eyed
on the door a poster, a swaying mermaid smoking mid nice waves. Smoke mermaids,
coolest whiff of all. Hair streaming: lovelorn. For some man. For Raoul. He eyed
and saw afar on Essex bridge a gay hat riding on a jauntingcar. It is. Third time. Coincidence.</p>
<p> Jingling on supple rubbers it jaunted from the bridge to Ormond quay.
Follow. Risk it. Go quick. At four. Near now. Out.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Twopence, sir, the shopgirl dared to say.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Aha&nbsp;&hellip; I was forgetting&nbsp;&hellip; Excuse&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And four.</p>
<p> At four she. Winsomely she on Bloohimwhom smiled. Bloo smi qui go. Ternoon.
Think you&apos;re the only pebble on the beach? Does that to all. For men.</p>
<p> In drowsy silence gold bent on her page.</p>
<p> From the saloon a call came, long in dying. That was a tuningfork the tuner
had that he forgot that he now struck. A call again. That he now poised that it
now throbbed. You hear? It throbbed, pure, purer, softly and softlier, its buzzing prongs. Longer in dying call.</p>
<p> Pat paid for diner&apos;s popcorked bottle: and over
tumbler,<a target="foot" id="fmm0021">&ordm;</a> tray and popcorked bottle ere
he went he whispered, bald and bothered, with Miss Douce.</p>
<p class="diset">&mdash; <i>The bright stars fade</i>&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> A<a target="foot" id="fmm0022">&ordm;</a> voiceless song sang from within, singing:</p>
<p class="diset">&mdash; &hellip; <i>the morn is breaking</i>.</p>
<p> A duodene of birdnotes chirruped bright treble answer under sensitive hands.
Brightly the keys, all twinkling, linked, all  harpsichording, called to a voice
to sing the strain of dewy morn, of youth, of love&apos;s leavetaking, life&apos;s, love&apos;s morn.</p>
<p class="diset">&mdash; <i>The dewdrops pearl</i>&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> Lenehan&apos;s lips over the counter lisped a low whistle of decoy.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; But look this way, he said, rose of Castile.</p>
<p> Jingle jaunted by the curb and stopped.</p>
<p> She rose and closed her reading, rose of Castile. Fretted forlorn, dreamily rose.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Did she fall or was she pushed? he asked her.</p>
<p> She answered, slighting:
<br><font color="green">{u22, 254}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ask no questions and you&apos;ll hear no lies.</p>
<p> Like lady, ladylike.</p>
<p> Blazes Boylan&apos;s smart tan shoes creaked on the barfloor where he
strode. Yes, gold from anear by bronze from afar. Lenehan heard and knew and hailed him:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; See the conquering hero comes.</p>
<p> Between the car and window, warily walking, went Bloom, unconquered hero.
See me he might. The seat he sat on: warm. Black wary hecat walked towards
Richie Goulding&apos;s legal bag, lifted aloft,<a target="foot" id="fmm0023">&ordm;</a> saluting.</p>
<p class="diset">&mdash; <i>And I from thee</i>&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I heard you were round, said Blazes Boylan.</p>
<p> He touched to fair Miss Kennedy a rim of his slanted straw. She smiled on
him. But sister bronze outsmiled her, preening for him her richer hair, a bosom and a rose.</p>
<p> Boylan bespoke potions.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What&apos;s your cry? Glass of bitter? Glass of bitter,
please, and a sloegin for me. Wire in yet?</p>
<p> Not yet. At four he. All said four.</p>
<p> Cowley&apos;s red lugs and Adam&apos;s apple in the door of the
sheriff&apos;s office. Avoid. Goulding a chance. What is he doing in the Ormond? Car waiting. Wait.</p>
<p> Hello. Where off to? Something to eat? I too was just. In here. What,
Ormond? Best value in Dublin. Is that so? Diningroom. Sit  tight there. See, not
be seen. I think I&apos;ll join you. Come on. Richie led on. Bloom followed bag. Dinner fit for a prince.</p>
<p> Miss Douce reached high to take a flagon, stretching her satin arm, her bust, that all but burst, so high.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O! O! jerked Lenehan, gasping at each stretch. O!</p>
<p> But easily she seized her prey and led it low in triumph.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Why don&apos;t you grow? asked Blazes Boylan.</p>
<p> Shebronze, dealing from her jar thick syrupy liquor for his lips, looked as
it flowed (flower in his coat: who gave him?), and syrupped with her voice:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Fine goods in small parcels.</p>
<p> That is to say she. Neatly she poured slowsyrupy sloe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Here&apos;s fortune, Blazes said.</p>
<p> He pitched a broad coin down. Coin rang.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Hold on, said Lenehan, till I&nbsp;&hellip;
<br><font color="green">{u22, 255}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Fortune, he wished, lifting his bubbled ale.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Sceptre
<a name="un2010f" href="../../ff/unbs/un2all.htm#un2010f">will win in a canter</a>, he said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I plunged a bit, said Boylan
<a name="un4015bk" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4015bk">winking
and</a><a target="foot" id="fmm0024">&ordm;</a>
<a name="un4015bk" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4015bk">drinking</a>. Not on
my own, you know. Fancy of a friend of mine.</p>
<p> Lenehan still drank and grinned at his tilted ale and at Miss Douce&apos;s
lips that all but hummed, not shut, the oceansong her lips had trilled. Idolores. The eastern seas.</p>
<p> Clock whirred. Miss Kennedy<a target="foot" id="fmm0025">&ordm;</a> passed
their way (flower, wonder who gave), bearing away teatray. Clock clacked.</p>
<p> Miss Douce took Boylan&apos;s coin, struck boldly the cashregister. It
clanged. Clock clacked. Fair one of Egypt teased and sorted in the till and
hummed and handed coins in change. Look to the west. A clack. For me.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What time is that? asked Blazes Boylan. Four?</p>
<p> O&apos;clock.</p>
<p> Lenehan, small eyes ahunger on her humming, bust ahumming, tugged Blazes Boylan&apos;s elbowsleeve.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Let&apos;s hear the time, he said.</p>
<p> The bag of Goulding, Colles, Ward led Bloom by ryebloom  flowered tables.
Aimless he chose with agitated aim, bald Pat attending, a table near the door.
Be near. At four. Has he forgotten? Perhaps a trick. Not come: whet appetite. I
couldn&apos;t do. Wait, wait. Pat, waiter, waited.</p>
<p> Sparkling bronze azure eyed Blazure&apos;s skyblue bow and eyes.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Go on, pressed Lenehan. There&apos;s no-one. He never heard.</p>
<p class="diset">&mdash; &hellip; <i>to Flora&apos;s lips did hie</i>.</p>
<p> High, a high note, pealed in the treble, clear.</p>
<p> Bronzedouce, communing with her rose that sank and rose sought Blazes Boylan&apos;s flower and eyes.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Please, please.</p>
<p> He pleaded over returning phrases of avowal.</p>
<p class="diset">&mdash; <i>I could not leave thee</i>&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Afterwits, Miss Douce promised coyly.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; No, now, urged Lenehan. <i>Sonnez la cloche!</i> O do! There&apos;s no-one.</p>
<p> She looked. Quick. Miss Kenn out of earshot. Sudden bent. Two kindling faces watched her bend.</p>
<p> Quavering the chords strayed from the air, found it again, lost chord, and lost and found it faltering.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Go on! Do! <i>Sonnez!</i>
<br><font color="green">{u22, 256}</font> </p>
<p> Bending, she nipped a peak of skirt above her knee. Delayed. Taunted them
still, bending, suspending, with wilful eyes.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>Sonnez!</i></p>
<p> Smack. She set<a target="foot" id="fmm0027">&ordm;</a> free sudden in
rebound her nipped elastic garter smackwarm against her smackable a woman&apos;s warmhosed thigh.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>La cloche!</i> cried gleeful Lenehan. Trained by owner. No sawdust there.</p>
<p> She smilesmirked supercilious (wept! aren&apos;t men?), but, lightward gliding, mild she smiled on Boylan.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You&apos;re the essence of vulgarity, she in gliding said.</p>
<p> Boylan, eyed, eyed. Tossed to fat lips his chalice,
drankoff<a target="foot" id="fmm0028">&ordm;</a> his
tiny,<a target="foot" id="fmm0029">&ordm;</a> chalice, sucking the last fat
violet syrupy drops. His spellbound eyes went after her gliding head as it went
down the bar by mirrors, gilded  arch for ginger ale, hock and claret glasses
shimmering, a spiky shell, where it concerted, mirrored, bronze with sunnier bronze.</p>
<p> Yes, bronze from anearby.</p>
<p class="diset">&mdash; &hellip; <i>sweetheart,</i><a target="foot" id="fmm0030">&ordm;</a> <i>goodbye!</i></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I&apos;m off, said Boylan with impatience.</p>
<p> He slid his chalice brisk away, grasped his change.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Wait a shake, begged Lenehan, drinking quickly. I wanted
to tell you. Tom Rochford&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Come on to blazes, said Blazes Boylan, going.</p>
<p> Lenehan gulped to go.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Got the horn or what? he said. Wait. I&apos;m coming.</p>
<p> He followed the hasty creaking shoes but stood by nimbly by the threshold,
saluting forms, a bulky with a slender.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; How do you do, Mr Dollard?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Eh? How do? How do? Ben Dollard&apos;s vague bass
answered, turning an instant from Father Cowley&apos;s woe. He won&apos;t give
you any trouble, Bob. Alf Bergan will speak to the long fellow. We&apos;ll put a
barleystraw in that Judas Iscariot&apos;s ear this time.</p>
<p> Sighing, Mr Dedalus came through the saloon, a finger soothing an eyelid.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Hoho, we will, Ben Dollard yodled jollily. Come on, Simon,
give us a ditty. We heard the piano.</p>
<p> Bald Pat, bothered waiter, waited for drink
orders.<a target="foot" id="fmm0031">&ordm;</a> Power for Richie. And Bloom? Let
me see. Not make him walk twice. His corns. Four now. How warm this black is.
Course nerves a bit. Refracts (is it?) heat. Let me see. Cider. Yes, bottle of cider.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 257}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What&apos;s that? Mr Dedalus said. I was only vamping, man.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Come on, come on, Ben Dollard called. Begone, dull care. Come, Bob.</p>
<p> He ambled Dollard, bulky slops, before them (hold that fellow with the: hold
him now) into the saloon. He plumped him Dollard on the stool. His gouty paws
plumped chords. Plumped,<a target="foot" id="fmm0032">&ordm;</a> stopped abrupt.</p>
<p> Bald Pat in the doorway met tealess gold returning. Bothered he  wanted
Power and cider. Bronze by the window watched, bronze from afar.</p>
<p> Jingle a tinkle jaunted.</p>
<p> Bloom heard a jing, a little sound. He&apos;s off. Light sob of breath Bloom
sighed on the silent
<a name="un4015bh" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4015bh">bluehued</a>
flowers. Jingling. He&apos;s gone. Jingle. Hear.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Love and war, Ben, Mr Dedalus said. God be with old times.</p>
<p> Miss Douce&apos;s brave eyes, unregarded, turned from the crossblind,
smitten by sunlight. Gone. Pensive (who knows?), smitten (the smiting light),
she lowered the dropblind with a sliding cord. She drew down pensive (why did he
go so quick when I?) about her bronze, over the bar where bald stood by sister
gold, inexquisite contrast, contrast inexquisite nonexquisite, slow cool dim
seagreen sliding depth of shadow, <i>eau de Nil</i>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Poor old Goodwin was the pianist that night, Father Cowley
reminded them. There was a slight difference of opinion between himself and the Collard grand.</p>
<p> There was.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A symposium all his own, Mr Dedalus said. The devil
wouldn&apos;t stop him. He was a crotchety old fellow in the primary stage of drink.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; God, do you remember? Ben bulky Dollard said, turning from
the punished keyboard. And by Japers I had no wedding garment.</p>
<p> They laughed all three. He had no wed.
<a name="un4015dh" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4015dh">All trio</a> laughed. No wedding garment.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Our friend Bloom turned in handy that night, Mr Dedalus said. Where&apos;s my pipe by the way?</p>
<p> He wandered back to the bar to the lost chord pipe. Bald Pat carried two
diners&apos; drinks, Richie and Poldy. And Father Cowley laughed again.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I saved the situation, Ben, I think.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You did, averred Ben Dollard. I remember those tight
trousers too. That was a brilliant idea, Bob.</p>
<p> Father Cowley blushed to his brilliant purply lobes. He saved the situa. Tight trou. Brilliant ide. </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I knew he was on the rocks, he said. The wife was playing the piano
<br><font color="green">{u22, 258}</font>
<br> in the coffee palace on Saturdays for a
very<a target="foot" id="fmm0033">&ordm;</a> trifling consideration and who was
it gave me the wheeze she was doing the other business? Do you remember? We had
to search all Holles street to find them till the chap in Keogh&apos;s gave us the number. Remember?</p>
<p> Ben remembered, his broad visage wondering.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; By God she had some luxurious operacloaks and things there.</p>
<p> Mr Dedalus wandered back, pipe in hand.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Merrion square style. Balldresses, by God, and court
dresses. He wouldn&apos;t take any money either. What? Any God&apos;s quantity
of cocked hats and boleros and trunkhose. What?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ay, ay, Mr Dedalus nodded. Mrs Marion Bloom has left off clothes of all descriptions.</p>
<p> Jingle jaunted down the quays. Blazes sprawled on bounding tyres.</p>
<p> Liver and bacon. Steak and kidney pie. Right, sir. Right, Pat.</p>
<p> Mrs Marion<a target="foot" id="fmm0034">&ordm;</a> met him pike hoses. Smell
of burn of Paul de Kock. Nice name he.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What&apos;s this her name was? A buxom lassy. Marion&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Tweedy.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes. Is she alive?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And kicking.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; She was a daughter of&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Daughter of the regiment.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, begad. I remember the old drummajor.</p>
<p> Mr Dedalus struck, whizzed, lit, puffed savoury puff after</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Irish? I don&apos;t know, faith. Is she, Simon?</p>
<p> Puff after stiff, a puff, strong, savoury, crackling.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="jn2037d" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2037d">Buccinator muscle
is&nbsp;&hellip; What?&nbsp;&hellip; Bit rusty&nbsp;&hellip;</a> O, she is&nbsp;&hellip; My Irish Molly, O.</p>
<p> He puffed a pungent plumy blast.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; From the rock of Gibraltar&nbsp;&hellip; all the way.</p>
<p> They pined in depth of ocean shadow, gold by the beerpull, bronze by
maraschino, thoughtful all two, Mina Kennedy, 4 Lismore terrace, Drumcondra with
Idolores, a queen, Dolores, silent. </p>
<p> Pat served,<a target="foot" id="fmm0035">&ordm;</a> uncovered dishes.
Leopold cut liverslices. As said before he ate with relish the inner organs,
nutty gizzards, fried cods&apos; roes<a target="foot" id="fmm0036">&ordm;</a>
while Richie Goulding, Collis, Ward ate steak and kidney, steak then kidney,
bite by bite of pie he ate Bloom ate they ate.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 259}</font>
</p>
<p> Bloom with Goulding, married in silence, ate. Dinners fit for princes.</p>
<p> By Bachelor&apos;s walk jogjaunty jingled Blazes Boylan, bachelor, in
sun<a target="foot" id="fmm0037">&ordm;</a> in heat, mare&apos;s glossy rump
atrot, with flick of whip, on bounding tyres: sprawled, warmseated, Boylan
impatience, ardentbold. Horn. Have you the? Horn. Have you the? Haw haw horn.</p>
<p> Over their voices Dollard bassooned attack, booming over bombarding chords:</p>
<p class="diset">&mdash; <i>When love absorbs my ardent soul</i>&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> Roll of Bensoulbenjamin rolled to the quivery loveshivery roofpanes.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; War! War! cried Father Cowley. You&apos;re the warrior.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; So I am, Ben Warrior laughed. I was thinking of your
landlord. <a name="un4015cu" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4015cu">Love or money.</a></p>
<p> He stopped. He wagged huge beard, huge face over his blunder huge.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Sure, you&apos;d burst the tympanum of her ear, man, Mr
Dedalus said through smoke aroma, with an organ like yours.</p>
<p> In bearded abundant laughter Dollard shook upon the keyboard. He would.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Not to mention another membrane, Father Cowley added. Half
time, Ben. <i>Amoroso ma non troppo</i>. Let me there.</p>
<p> Miss Kennedy served two gentlemen with tankards of cool stout. She passed a
remark. It was indeed, first gentleman said, beautiful weather. They drank cool
stout. Did she know where the lord lieutenant was going? And heard steelhoofs
ringhoof ring. No, she couldn&apos;t say. But it would be in the paper. O, she
needn&apos;t trouble. No trouble. She waved about her outspread
<i>Independent</i>, searching, the lord lieutenant, her pinnacles of hair
slowmoving, lord lieuten. Too much trouble, first gentleman said. O, not in the
least. Way he looked that. Lord lieutenant. Gold by bronze heard iron steel. </p>
<p class="diset">&mdash; &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; <i>my ardent soul</i>
<br> <i>I care not foror the morrow</i>.</p>
<p> In liver gravy Bloom mashed mashed potatoes. Love and war someone is. Ben
Dollard&apos;s famous. Night he ran round to us to borrow a dress suit for that
concert. Trousers tight as a drum on him.
<a name="un4015bn" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4015bn">Musical porkers.</a>
Molly did laugh when he went out. Threw herself back across the bed, screaming,
kicking. With all his belongings on show. O, saints above, I&apos;m drenched! O,
the women in the front row! O, I never laughed so many! Well, of course,
that&apos;s what gives him the base barreltone. For instance eunuchs. Wonder
who&apos;s playing. Nice touch. Must be Cowley. Musical. Knows whatever note you
play. Bad breath he has, poor chap. Stopped.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 260}</font> </p>
<p> Miss Douce, engaging, Lydia Douce, bowed to suave solicitor, George Lidwell,
gentleman, entering. Good afternoon<a target="foot" id="fmm0038">&ordm;</a>. She
gave her moist, a lady&apos;s, hand to his firm clasp. Afternoon. Yes, she was
back. <a name="un4015j" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4015j">To the old dingdong again.</a></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Your friends are inside, Mr Lidwell.</p>
<p> George Lidwell, suave, solicited, held a lydiahand.</p>
<p> Bloom ate liv as said before. Clean here at least. That chap in the Burton,
gummy with gristle. No-one here: Goulding and I. Clean tables, flowers, mitres
of napkins. Pat to and fro, bald Pat. Nothing to do. Best value in Dub.</p>
<p> Piano again. Cowley it is. Way he sits in to it, like one together, mutual
understanding. Tiresome shapers scraping fiddles,
<a name="un4015da" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4015da">eye on the
bowend,</a> sawing the cello<a target="foot" id="fmm0039">&ordm;</a>, remind you
of toothache. <a name="un5011ap" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5011ap">Her
high long snore.</a> Night we were in the box. Trombone under blowing like
<a name="un4016d" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4016d">a grampus</a>, between
the acts, other brass chap unscrewing, emptying spittle. Conductor&apos;s legs
too, bagstrousers, jiggedy jiggedy. Do right to hide them.</p>
<p> Jiggedy jingle jaunty jaunty.</p>
<p> Only the harp. Lovely. Gold<a target="foot" id="fmm0040">&ordm;</a>
glowering light. Girl touched it. Poop of a lovely. Gravy&apos;s rather good fit
for a. Golden ship. Erin. The harp that once or twice. Cool hands. Ben Howth,
the rhododendrons. We are their harps. I. He. Old. Young. </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ah, I couldn&apos;t, man, Mr Dedalus said, shy, listless.</p>
<p> Strongly.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Go on, blast you, Ben Dollard growled. Get it out in bits.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>M&apos;appari</i>, Simon, Father Cowley said.</p>
<p> Down stage he strode some paces, grave, tall in affliction, his long arms
outheld. Hoarsely the apple of his throat hoarsed softly. Softly he sang to a
dusty seascape there: <i>A Last Farewell</i>. A headland, a ship, a sail upon
the billows. Farewell. A lovely girl, her veil awave upon the wind upon the
headland,<a target="foot" id="fmm0041">&ordm;</a> wind around her.</p>
<p> Cowley sang:</p>
<p class="diset">&mdash; <i>M&apos;appari tutt&apos;amor:</i>
<br> <i>Il mio sguardo l&apos;incontr</i>&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> She waved, unhearing Cowley, her veil to one departing, dear one, to wind, love, speeding sail, return.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Go on, Simon.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ah, sure my dancing days are done, Ben&nbsp;&hellip; Well&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> Mr Dedalus laid his pipe to rest beside the tuningfork and, sitting, touched the obedient keys.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 261}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; No, Simon, Father Cowley turned. Play it in the original. One flat.</p>
<p> The keys, obedient, rose higher, told, faltered, confessed, confused.</p>
<p> Up stage strode Father Cowley.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Here, Simon. I&apos;ll accompany you, he said. Get up.</p>
<p> By Graham Lemon&apos;s pineapple rock, by Elvery&apos;s elephant jingle jogged.</p>
<p> Steak, kidney, liver, mashed,<a target="foot" id="fmm0042">&ordm;</a> at
meat fit for princes sat princes Bloom and Goulding. Princes at meat they raised and drank Power and cider.</p>
<p> Most beautiful tenor air ever written, Richie said: <i>Sonambula</i>. He
heard Joe Maas sing that one night. Ah, what M&apos;Guckin! Yes. In his way.
Choirboy style. Maas was the boy. Massboy. A lyrical tenor if you like. Never forget it. Never.</p>
<p> Tenderly Bloom over liverless bacon saw the tightened features strain.
Backache he. Bright&apos;s bright eye. Next item on the programme.
 <a name="un4015df" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4015df">Paying the

Sings too: <i>Down among the dead men</i>. Appropriate. Kidney pie. Sweets to

<p class="di">&mdash; Which air is that? asked Leopold Bloom.</p>
<p class="diset">&mdash; <i>All is lost now.</i></p>
<p> Richie cocked his lips apout. A low incipient note sweet
<a name="un4014bd" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4014bd">banshee</a>
murmured: all. A thrush. A throstle. His breath, birdsweet, good teeth he&apos;s
proud of, fluted with plaintive woe. Is lost. Rich sound. Two notes in one
there. Blackbird I heard in the hawthorn valley.
<a name="un4015ai" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4015ai">Taking my

the answer. How is that done? All lost now. Mournful he whistled. Fall, surrender, lost.</p>

<br> Touch water. Jingle jaunty. Too late. She longed to go. That&apos;s why.
Woman. As easy stop the sea. Yes: all is lost.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A beautiful air, said Bloom lost Leopold. I know it well.</p>
<p> Never in all his life had Richie Goulding.</p>
<p> He knows it well too. Or he feels. Still harping on his daughter. Wise child
that knows her father, Dedalus said. Me?</p>
<p> Bloom askance over liverless saw. Face of the all is lost. Rollicking Richie
once. Jokes old stale now. Wagging his ear. Napkinring in his eye. Now begging
letters he sends his son with.

<p> Piano again. Sounds better than last time I heard. Tuned probably. Stopped again.</p>
<p> Dollard and Cowley still urged the lingering singer out with it.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; With it, Simon.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It, Simon.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ladies and gentlemen, I am most deeply obliged by your kind solicitations.</p>

<p> By the sandwichbell in screening shadow, Lydia her bronze and rose, a
lady&apos;s grace, gave and withheld: as in cool glaucous <i>eau de Nil</i> Mina
to tankards two her pinnacles of gold.</p>
<p> The harping chords of prelude closed. A chord longdrawn, expectant drew a voice away.</p>
<p class="diset">&mdash; <i>When first I saw that form endearing,</i><a target="foot" id="fmm0045">&ordm;</a></p>
<p> Richie turned.</p>

waiter, waited, waiting to hear, for he was hard of hear by the door.</p>
