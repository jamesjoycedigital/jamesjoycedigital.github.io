<p class="pStDir"><a target="foot" id="fmz0006">&ordm;</a> Bronze by gold, Miss
Kennedy&apos;s head by Miss Douse&apos;s head, bronze, over the blind of the
Ormond Hotel, and heard the viceregal hoofs go by, ringing steel.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is that her? Miss Kennedy said</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, Miss Douse said, the one sitting beside his ex. grey and crushed strawberry.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And is that her? Miss Kennedy said. Exquisite contrast,
isn&apos;t it, the pink with the grey.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Look at the fellow coming in the carriage after, Miss
Douse said eagerly. Do you see? In the tall silk.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Who? Where? Who is he? Miss Kennedy asked.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Look at him, Miss Douse said, her wet lips laughing in
the sun. He&apos;s looking in here, I declare to God. Mind till I see.</p>
<p> She ran to the far corner of the window, flattening her face sideways
against the pane in a halo of her flurried breath.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He&apos;s killed turning to look back, she said. gaily! O, wept, aren&apos;t men frightful idiots
<br> Sauntering and {hairpinning}</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It&apos;s them have the fine times, Miss Kennedy said. All the clothes they have.</p>
<p> The boots came across from the hall and laid his tray on the counter</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; There&apos;s your teas, he said</p>
<p> Miss Kennedy came down the bar and conveyed the tray down to an upturned lemonade crate. {Spoon}</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What is it? the boots asked</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Find out, Miss Douce answered as she left her spyingpoint.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Your beau, is it?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I&apos;ll complain to Mrs De Massey on you, Miss Douse answered him haughtily, if I hear any
<br><font color="green">{ms, 2}</font>
<br> more<a target="foot" id="fmz0007">&ordm;</a> of your impertinent insolence </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Imperthnthnthnthnthn, the boots&apos;s snouted lips said
mockingly as he backed out by the way he had come.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That fellow is
<a name="un4031cc" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4031cc">most aggravating</a>
going beyond the beyonds, Miss Douse said. Little brat. I&apos;ll wring his ears a yard long.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Take no notice, Miss Kennedy said.</p>
<p> She poured tea into a cup, then back into the pot. In their nook under the
counter they sat on the low stools to let it draw well.
<a name="un1015i" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1015i">They paw each other&apos;s blouses.</a></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Am I much sunburned? Miss Douse asked, showing her neck.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, Miss Kennedy said.
<a name="un1007e" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1007e">It gets brown after.
Did you try the cherry laurel water and borax</a>?</p>
<p> Miss Douse, viewing her skin askance in the mirror behind the hock and claret glasses, asked again:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And leave it to my hands, she said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Why don&apos;t you try that with the
<a name="un1007d" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1007d">glycerine</a>? Miss Kennedy said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ah, those things only bring out a rash on you, Miss Douse
said. I asked that old fellow in Boyd&apos;s for something for the skin.</p>
<p> Miss Kennedy, pouring tea, made a grimace, saying:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, don&apos;t remind me of him for mercy&apos; sake.</p>
<p> Miss Douse said gaily:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But wait till I tell you.</p>
<p> Miss Kennedy set down the teapot put both her little fingers into her ears, saying:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, I won&apos;t listen.</p>
<p> Miss Douse said in a snuffy voice</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>For your what?</u> he said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, don&apos;t let me think of him, Miss
<br><font color="green">{ms, 3}</font>
<br> Kennedy<a target="foot" id="fmz0008">&ordm;</a> said, uncorking her ears,
or I&apos;ll expire. That awful old wretch. Do you remember the night in the Gaiety?</p>
<p> She drank distastefully from her cup.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Here he was, Miss Douse said, leaning sideways and ruffling her nose. Huf! Huf!</p>
<p> A high shriek of laughter came from Miss Kennedy&apos;s throat while Miss
Douse continued to blow through nostrils that quivered like a snout</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, Miss Kennedy cried, will you ever forget his goggle eye? And his</p>
<p> Without answering Miss Douse burst into loud laughter</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And your other eye! she said.</p>
<p> Their unresisting voices blended in a giggling peal. Then they threw their
heads back to let their laughter free, signalling to each other by high piercing
notes. Panting and sighing their mirth died down. Miss Kennedy took her cup
again and had drunk a mouthful when Miss Douse bent over the teatray and,
ruffling her nose again, began to roll droll fattened eyes. Miss Kennedy
spluttered into her teacup and, convulsed with laughter and coughing, cried:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, greasy eyes! Imagine being married to a man like that! The bit of beard.</p>
<p> Miss Douse gave a full woman&apos;s scream of delight and indignation</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Married to the greasy nose! she said</p>
<p> They broke again into high and deep laughter, urging each other to peal
after peal: and then laid their shaken heads against the
<br><font color="green">{ms, 4}</font>
<br> counter<a target="foot" id="fmz0009">&ordm;</a> ledge, flushed, panting, sweated.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Lord, Miss Douse sighed to the rose jumping on her bosom.
I wish I hadn&apos;t laughed so much. I&apos;m wringing wet.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, you horrid thing, Miss Kennedy said, flushing more.</p>
<p> Mr Dedalus came into the bar
<a name="un1001e" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1001e">picking chips off one of his rocky thumbnails</a>. </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, how do you do, Miss Douse, he said suddenly agreeably as she rose in her seat. Back again.</p>
<p> He held her genteelly hand over the counter</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And how did you enjoy your holidays?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Tiptop, Miss Douse said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I hope you had nice weather in Rostrevor.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Gorgeous, Miss Douse said. Look at the holy show I am from lying out on the strand every day.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That was very naughty of you, Mr Dedalus said, shaking
his head indulgently. Tempting poor simple innocent creatures.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, go away out of that now, Miss Douse said, pulling back
her satined arm. I&apos;m sure you&apos;re very simple.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well now I am, Mr Dedalus said to himself. I looked so
innocent in the cradle that they christened me simple Simon. So they tell me, at all events.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, I don&apos;t think, Miss Douse said. And what did the doctor order today?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Whatever you say yourself, Mr Dedalus answered. Well
I&apos;ll just take. Let me see now. I&apos;ll take a&nbsp;&hellip; No, I think
I&apos;ll trouble you for some fresh water and a half glass of whisky.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;
<a name="un1032eh" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1032eh">With the greatest alacrity</a>, Miss Douse said.</p>
<p> She turned back towards the mirror to the crystal kegs to draw off a bright measure
<br><font color="green">{ms, 5}</font>
<br> Mr<a target="foot" id="fmz0010">&ordm;</a> Dedalus took forth pipe and
pouch from the skirt of his coat and blew a husky whistle down the pipeshank.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; By Jove, he said. Well I often wanted to see Rostrevor.
But a long threatening comes at last, they say. Yes, yes.</p>
<p> He fingered tobacco into the bowl nodding as the drink was set before him.
Miss Douse began to polish a glass, humming:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>O, Idolores, queen of the eastern sea</u></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Was Mr Lidwell in today?</p>
<p> Lenehan entered the bar and looked about him.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He was in at lunchtime, Miss Kennedy said, patting her
mouth with her handkerchief and making a sign to Miss Douse</p>
<p> came down to the beerpull and stood flicking crumbs off her tulle front.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Has Mr Boylan been looking for me? Lenehan said coming to the counter.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, Mr Lenehan, Miss Kennedy said. Was Mr Boylan in while I was upstairs, Miss Douse?</p>
<p> Miss Douse, seated by the crate with a poised teacup, answered without looking up from her book:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, he was not.</p>
<p> Lenehan craned his short body round the sandwich bell towards her voice, saying:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Peep! Who&apos;s in the corner?</p>
<p> Unrewarded by a glance, he said to her:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;
<a name="un1032ea" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1032ea">only read the black ones</a>. Round o and crooked ess.</p>
<p> He plappering by rote flatly to her in solfa:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ah fox met ah stork. Said thee fox to thee stork: will
you put your bill down my troath and pull up ah bone?</p>
<p> He greeted Mr Dedalus who nodded slightly</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ah me, O my, he said, sighing.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 6}</font>
<br> &apos;Twas<a target="foot" id="fmz0011">&ordm;</a> ever thus. Greetings
from the famous son of <a name="un1003d" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1003d">a famous father</a>.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Who is he? Mr Dedalus asked</p>
<p> Lenehan opened his arms genially.
<a name="un5014as" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5014as">cigarette chewed</a></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Can you ask? he said. Stephen of the tribe of Dedalus.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, I see, Mr Dedalus said, laying down his filled pipe. I
didn&apos;t recognise him for the moment. I believe he is keeping very select
company. I haven&apos;t had the pleasure of seeing him lately. Are you a friend of his?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I quaffed the winecup with him, Lenehan said laughing to
Miss Kennedy&apos;s waiting eyes, this very day. In Mooney&apos;s sur Mer. He
had received some of the rhino for the labour of his muse. The wise ones of Erin
hung so to speak on his lips. Professor MacHugh, Dublin&apos;s darling editor
and that minstrel boy of the west known to the muses as O&apos;Madden Burke.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Indeed, Mr Dedalus said. That must have been very interesting. I see.</p>
<p> He lifted his glass and drank. Then, glancing towards the inner saloon, he said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I see you have moved the piano.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The tuner was in this morning, Miss Kennedy said, tuning
it. And I never heard such an exquisite player.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is that a fact? Mr Dedalus said</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Didn&apos;t he, Miss Douse? Miss Kennedy said. The Real
classical, you know. And the poor fellow blind too. Not twenty years old I&apos;m sure he was.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is that so, Mr Dedalus said</p>
<p> He strayed off towards the open saloon door.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; So sad to look at his face, Miss Kennedy
<br><font color="green">{ms, 7}</font>
<br> said.<a target="foot" id="fmz0012">&ordm;</a></p>
<p> A diner&apos;s bell cried tink to her pity.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, I never served the gentleman, she said.</p>
<p> Enter Pat The bardoor Lenehan eyed what he could see of Miss Douse&apos;s
gold hair, reading. In drowsy silence came from the saloon a call, long in
dying: and once more, as the tuningfork Mr Dedalus struck and poised lightly on
the pianocase throbbed purely, ever softer, from its buzzing prongs.</p>
<p> A<a target="foot" id="fmz0013">&ordm;</a> duodene of treble notes answered. In answer</p>
<p> A duodene of bright notes chirruped answer Then amid their pause keys of a
harpsichord twinkled, harping their chords and singing of youth, of youth&apos;s morn, and young as morning wind and</p>
<p> A duodene of notes chirruped bright answer. Then following their pause the
keys twinkling linked themselves, harpsichording, calling any voice near by to
sing with them to the strains of youth&apos;s morn.</p>
<p> A duodene of notes chirruped bright answer. Then in their pause the keys
twinkling linked themselves chords of a harpsichord calling to some voice to
sing to them, recalling youth&apos;s morn.</p>
<p class="set"><u>The bright stars fade, the morn is breaking</u></p>
<p> decoy Lenehan&apos;s lips blew over the counter a soft whistle of decoy makes a pun</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But look this way, he said. Rose of Castile</p>
<p> Miss Douse turned dreaming a page.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Does she feel as if she felt? Lenehan asked. What is the name of it?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ask no questions and you&apos;ll hear no lies, Miss Douse said,</p>
<p> Blazes Boylan&apos;s stride creaked smartly.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; See the conquering hero comes, Lenehan said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I heard you were round, Blazes Boylan said. What is it?</p>
<p> He touched the slanted rim of his straw hat to Miss Douse who rising preened herself at her leisure, amiably.
<br> You&apos;re very backward in coming forward, Lenehan told her.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What&apos;s your cry? Blazes Boylan bespoke. A half one?
Give us a half one, Miss D, and a sloe gin, please. Is the wire in yet?</p>
<p> Miss Douse reached high to take a flagon, reaching,</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, O, O, O, Lenehan said as she reached.</p>
<p> Easily she seized it and brought it low in triumph.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Grow up, Lenehan said. I like them sizeable.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Fine goods in small parcels, Miss Douse said winsomely.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Not yet, Lenehan said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Here&apos;s fortune, Blazes Boylan said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; How&apos;s the time? Blazes Boylan said. Half three. I met Bantam Lyons in
<br><font color="green">{ms, 8}</font>
<br> Grafton<a target="foot" id="fmz0014">&ordm;</a> street. He plunged too.</p>
<p> He was ramblingly about some horse&nbsp;&hellip;..</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Sceptre will win, hands down, Lenehan said, taking his glass to him.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I put a bit on her, Blazes Boylan said. Not for my own fancy, you know. Friend of mine.</p>
<p> Lenehan sipped, smiling finely at the tilted gold he drank.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Here&apos;s fortune, Blazes Boylan said.</p>
<p> He drank half and pitched on the counter a coin that rang on the counter
smartly. A clockface clacked its tongue.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Half three is it? he said, looking among the gaudy reflections.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That clock&apos;s fast, Lenehan said. Isn&apos;t it, Miss Douse?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Fivepence, demure Miss Douse said, handing damp change.</p>
<p> Lenehan pulled the cocca of Blazes Boylan&apos;s coat, his eyes hungering on her face.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Let&apos;s hear the time, he said. He has an appointment he can&apos;t miss.</p>
<p> Miss Douse {sunny} eyes glanced archly at the slanted straw hat for an instant.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Go on, Lenehan said urgently. He never heard that.</p>
<p class="set">&nbsp;&hellip;... <u>to Flora&apos;s lips did hie</u>
<br> her rose</p>
<p> The high note pealed in treble clear.</p>
<p> Miss Douse communing with her rose that moved glanced again at Blazes Boylan&apos;s bold eyes and tie.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Please, Lenehan said.</p>
<p> His voice pleaded over the song&apos;s returning phrase of avowal:</p>
<p class="set"><u>I could not leave thee</u>&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Afterwits, Miss Douse said coyly.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, now, he said. <u>Sonnez la cloche!</u> Do.</p>
<p> Miss Douse bent suddenly, nipping a peak of her skirt out at knee. The
chords of the piano strayed from the air shakily, feeling for it again, shaking.
The two kindled faces watched her bend. Her eyes taunted them an instant still.
Her wilful eyes taunted them still an instant ere her hand set free</p>
<p> For still an instant her wilful eyes delayed them ere her hand set free the
warm rebound of her garter smack on her stockinged thigh
<br><font color="green">{ms, 9}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>La</u><a target="foot" id="fmz0015">&ordm;</a>
<u>cloche!</u> Lenehan cried, content. I taught her that. Trained by owner.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You&apos;re the essence of vulgarity, Miss Douse said, superciliously.</p>
<p> Blazes Boylan raised to his greedy lips a tiny chalice and swallowed his
sloe gin at his ease, his eyes following Miss Douse&apos;s head. She glided down
the bar and concerted, gold with bronze, with Miss Kennedy&apos;s over the diner&apos;s bill, whispering.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No sawdust there? Lenehan said. Eh?</p>
<p class="set">&hellip;. <u>sweetheart, goodbye.</u></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I&apos;m off, Blazes Boylan said brusquely</p>
<p> With bold
<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font> He
sucked boldly the violet dregs, he slid his glass away and gathered his change.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Where? Lenehan said, taking his glass up. Have you the
horn? Wait a minute. What way are you going?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Come on to blazes, Blazes Boylan said. I can&apos;t wait, curse you.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; As bad as that? Lenehan said tossing off his drink. I&apos;m coming too.</p>
<p> He followed the creaking hasty shoes out, standing by neatly as a bulky and
a slender form crossed the penumbra of threshold, to salute:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; How do you do, Mr Dollard?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The long fellow is all right Eh? God bless you! Ben
Dollard&apos;s bass said vaguely, turning a moment from Father Cowley&apos;s
ear. He won&apos;t give you any trouble. I know Long John. We&apos;ll put a
barleystraw in Antichrist&apos;s ear, anyhow.</p>
<p> Sighing, came towards the door of the saloon, a finger soothing his eyelid.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, we will, Ben Dollard said. Come on, Simon. Where&apos;s the piano? We heard you coming in.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What&apos;s that? Mr Dedalus said. I was only struming.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Come on, come on, Ben Dollard cheerily. Begone dull care. Come in, Bob.</p>
<p> He ambled before them into the saloon and, plumping himself heavily on the stool, his big gouty hands struck
<br><font color="green">{ms, 10}</font>
<br> off<a target="foot" id="fmz0016">&ordm;</a> chords.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Love and War</u>, Mr Dedalus said. God be with the past, Ben.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Poor old Goodwin was the pianist that night, Father Cowley said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And a nice hash he made of it! Mr Dedalus said. A symposium all his own.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I remember, Father Cowley said. Marie Powell sang too.
What became of her, Simon? I never see her name. A buxom piece Is she alive?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Alive and kicking, Mr Dedalus began. Soldier&apos;s
daughter. My Irish Molly O. From the rock of Gibraltar.</p>
<p> Ben Dollard boomed over their voices with crashing chords:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>When love absorbs my ardent soul</u>.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; War! War! Father Cowley said, turning to him. You&apos;re the warrior.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, so I am, Ben Dollard said, stopping</p>
<p> He wagged his laughing face and huge beard over his blunder.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Sure, you&apos;d burst the tympanum of her ear, man, Mr
Dedalus said, with an organ like yours.</p>
<p> Ben Dollard shook in abundant laughter over the keys.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; To say nothing of another membrane, Father Cowley added.
Get up, Ben. Half time. Let me there.</p>
<p class="pchar">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

face all the same. Virgin. Write some thing on it</a>. If you don&apos;t what
becomes of them. Get into despair. Really They want it.</p>
<p class="pStDir">She viewed herself sideways. Mirror there. Molly always does
before she answers a knock. Titivating herself.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom watched in silence the liquid eyeball at gaze behind its fence of
lashes calm and pitiless under its narrowed lid. Polite interest. But they
don&apos;t like too much politeness. Why a fellow like him I could make her hear
something from here. Ventriloquism. Close my lips. Want to think it in my
stomach? What? Will? You? I. Want. To. To be Admired. Keeps them young. Admire
themselves. At each slow heave of her satin bosom (her heaving embonpoint) her
red rose rose and sank with satin and all her tiny foils trembled of maidenhair.
She knows I&apos;m looking, knows without looking. Molly (has a) devil of a
quick eye to notice if anyone is looking at her. All women. Heat and spices of
drinks floated round her. On the jutting beerpull lay (?) her hand lightly,
plumply, white as the enamel: and to and fro (she knows I&apos;m looking) over
the polished knob her thumb and finger passed, repassed, gently touching and then slid smoothly, slowly down, as
<br><font color="green">{ms, 11}</font>
<br> cool<a target="foot" id="fmz0017">&ordm;</a> firm baton white protruding out of thin sliding ring.</p>
<p> A vision was given her. She pulled a full pull down, down, and pulled it
down. Ale gushed to her tankard, gushed &amp; foamed.</p>
<p class="pchar">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; There<a target="foot" id="fmz0018">&ordm;</a> was an put
up job between them, Father Cowley said. About ten she&apos;d ring up the hubby
about the poor child and if Bloom had raked in the pot begod off with him
<a name="un5007aq" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5007aq">in a brace of
shakes</a> saying the child was bad. There was nothing wrong with the child at
all. But old Mat Dillon spotted the game.</p>
<p class="pchar">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; To hear that fellow croaking, is it, Mr Dedalus said,
with a <a name="un5014at" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5014at">belly on him like a poisoned pup</a></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He&apos;d want a stiff glass of grog to keep his pecker up, Ben Dollard said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He has a fair share
<a name="un5014au" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5014au">concealed about his
person</a>, if you ask me, Mr Dedalus said.</p>
<p class="pchar">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p> Mr Bloom heard the voice in lamentation. Martha, Martha, ah return, love.
Her name. Strange. I am waiting here. Glorious voice he has. For thee. Co-ome,
thou lost one. Cruel it is let people get fond of each. Thou dear one. Then tear
them asunder. Way out of that. Alone. Canst com. Fort me. Human life that is. And she

<p class="pStDir">Ben Dollard had to get a loan of a dresscoat from L.B. He had no wedding garment.</p>
