<p> Mr Leopold Bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls. He
liked thick giblet soup, nutty gizzards, a stuffed roast heart, liverslices
fried with crustcrumbs, fried cods&apos; roes. Most of all he liked grilled
mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of faintly scented urine.</p>
<p> Kidneys were in his mind as he moved about the kitchen softly, righting her
breakfast things on the humpy tray. Gelid light and air were in the kitchen but
out of doors gentle summer morning everywhere. Made him feel a bit peckish.</p>
<p> The coals were reddening.</p>
<p> Another slice of bread and butter: three, four: right. She didn&apos;t like
her plate full. Right. He turned from the tray, lifted the kettle off the hob
and set it sideways on the fire. It sat there, dull and squat, its spout stuck
out.
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black">Cup of
tea soon. Good. Mouth dry.</font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font></p>
<p> The cat walked stiffly round a leg of the table with tail on high.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Mkgnao!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O, there you are, Mr Bloom said, turning from the fire.</p>
<p> The cat mewed in answer and stalked again stiffly round a leg of the table, mewing.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom watched curiously, kindly the lithe black form. Clean to see: the
gloss of her sleek hide, the white button under the butt of her tail, the green
flashing eyes. He bent down to her, his hands on his knees.</p>

<p> They call them stupid. They understand what we say better than we understand them. She understands all she wants to.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 54}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Afraid of the chickens she is, he said mockingly. Afraid
of the chookchooks. I never saw such a stupid pussens as the pussens.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Mrkrgnao! the cat said loudly.</p>
<p> She blinked up out of her avid eyes, mewing plaintively and long, showing
him her milkwhite teeth. He watched the dark eyeslits narrowing with greed till
her eyes were green stones. Then he went to the dresser, poured milk on a saucer
and set it for her slowly on the floor.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Gurrhr! she cried, running to lap.</p>
<p> He watched the bristles shining wirily in the weak light
<font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black">as

it true if you clip them they can&apos;t mouse after. Why? They shine in the
dark, perhaps, the tips. Or kind of feelers in the dark, perhaps.</p>
<p> He listened to her licking lap. Thursday: good day for a mutton kidney at
Buckley&apos;s. Fried with butter, a shake of pepper. Or better a pork kidney at
Dlugacz&apos;s. While the kettle is boiling. She lapped slower, then licking the
saucer clean. Why are their tongues so rough? To lap better, all porous holes.
Nothing she can eat? He glanced round him. No.</p>

he</font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font> went up the
staircase to the hall, paused by the bedroom door. She might like something
tasty. Thin bread and butter she likes in the morning. Still perhaps: once in a way.</p>
<p> He said softly in the bare hall:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I am going round the corner. Be back in a minute.</p>
<p> And when he had heard his voice say it he added:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You don&apos;t want anything for breakfast?
<br><font color="green">{u21, 63}</font> </p>
<p> A sleepy soft grunt answered:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Mn.</p>
<p> No. She did not want anything. He heard then a warm heavy sigh, softer, as
she turned over and the loose brass quoits of the bedstead jingled. Must get
those settled really. Pity. All the way from Gibraltar. Wonder what her father
gave for it. Old style. Ah yes, of course. Bought it at the governor&apos;s
auction. Got a short knock. Hard as nails at a bargain, old Tweedy. Yes, sir. At
Plevna that was. I rose from the ranks, sir, and I&apos;m proud of it. Still he
had brains enough to make that corner in stamps. Now that was farseeing.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 55}</font> </p>
<p> His hand took his hat from the peg. Stamps: stickyback pictures. Daresay
lots of officers are in the swim too. Course they do. The sweated legend in the
crown of his hat told him mutely: Plasto&apos;s high grade ha. He peeped quickly
inside the leather headband. White slip of paper. Quite safe.</p>
<p> On the doorstep he felt in his hip pocket for the latchkey. Not there. In
the trousers I left off. Creaky wardrobe. No use disturbing her. She turned over
sleepily that time. He pulled the halldoor to after him very quietly, more, till
the footleaf dropped gently over the threshold, a limp lid. Looked shut. All right till I come back anyhow.</p>
<p> He crossed to the bright side. The sun was nearing the steeple of
George&apos;s church. Be a warm day I fancy. Specially in these black clothes
feel it more. Black conducts,

happy warmth.

through awned streets. Turbaned faces going by. Dark caves of carpet shops, big
man, Turk, seated crosslegged smoking a coiled pipe. Cries of sellers in the
streets. Drink water scented with fennel, sherbet. Wander along all day. Getting
on to sundown. The shadows of the mosques among the pillars: priest with a
scroll rolled up. A shiver of the trees, signal, the evening wind. I pass on.
Fading gold sky. A mother watches me from her doorway. She calls her children
home in their dark language. High wall: beyond strings twanged. Night sky, moon,
violet, colour of Molly&apos;s new garters. Strings. Listen. A girl playing one
of those instruments what do you call them: dulcimers. I pass.</p>
<p> Probably not a bit like it really. Kind of stuff you read: in the track of
the sun. Sunburst on the titlepage. He smiled, pleasing himself. What Arthur
Griffith said about the headpiece over the <i>Freeman</i> leader: a homerule sun
rising up in the northwest from the laneway behind the bank of Ireland. He
prolonged his pleased smile. Ikey touch that: homerule sun rising up in the northwest.

<p> He approached Larry O&apos;Rourke&apos;s. From the cellar grating floated up
the flabby gush of porter. Through the open doorway the bar squirted out whiffs
of ginger, teadust, biscuitmush. Good house, however: just the end of the city
traffic. For instance M&apos;Auley&apos;s down there: n.g. as position. Of
course if they ran a tramline along the North Circular from the cattle market to
the quays value would go up like a shot.</p>

Cute old codger. No use canvassing him for an order. Still he knew his own
business best. There he is, sure enough, my bold Larry, leaning against the
sugarbin in his shirtsleeves watching the aproned curate swab up with mop and
bucket. Simon Dedalus takes him off to a tea, with his eyes screwed up. Do you
know what I&apos;m going to tell you? What&apos;s that, Mr O&apos;Rourke? Do you
know what? The Russians, they are only an eight o&apos;clock breakfast for the Japanese.</p>
<p> Stop and say a word: about the funeral perhaps. Sad thing about
<br><font color="green">{u21, 65}</font>
<br> poor Dignam, Mr O&apos;Rourke.</p>
<p> Turning into Dorset street he said freshly in greeting through the doorway:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Good day, Mr O&apos;Rourke.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Good day to you.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Lovely weather, sir.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; &apos;Tis all that.</p>

<p> How much would that tot to off the porter in the month? Say ten barrels of
stuff. Say he got ten per cent off. O more. Fifteen.</p>
<p> He halted before Dlugacz&apos;s window, staring at the hanks of sausages,
polonies, black and white. Fifteen multiplied by. The figures whitened in his
mind unsolved: displeased, he let them fade. The shiny links packed with
<br><font color="green">{u22, 57}</font>
<br> forcemeat, fed his gaze and he breathed in tranquilly the lukewarm breath of cooked spicy pigs&apos; blood.</p>
<p> A kidney oozed bloodgouts on the willow patterned dish: the last. He stood
near the nextdoor girl at the counter. Would she buy it too, calling the items
from a slip in her hand? Chapped: washing soda. And a pound and a half of
sausages. His eyes rested on her vigorous hips. Strong pair of arms. Whacking a
carpet on the clothesline. She does whack it, by George.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 66}</font>
<br> The way her crooked skirt swings at each whack.</p>
<p> The ferreteyed porkbutcher folded the sausages he had snipped off with
blotchy fingers, sausagepink. Sound meat there: like a stallfed heifer.</p>
<p><font color="red"><sup><small>|5</small></sup></font><font color="black">&rArr;</font><font color="red"><sup><small>5|</small></sup></font>
He took a page up from the pile of cut sheets: the model farm at Kinnereth on
the lakeshore of Tiberias. I thought he was. Farmhouse, wall round it, blurred
cattle cropping. He held the page from him: interesting: read it nearer, the
title, the blurred cropping cattle, the page rustling. A young white heifer.
Those mornings in the cattlemarket, the beasts lowing in their pens,
<font color="red"><sup><small>(5</small></sup></font><font color="black"><a name="un4001al" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4001al">branded

fall of dung, the breeders in hobnailed boots trudging through the litter,
slapping a palm on a meaty hindquarter, there&apos;s a prime one, unpeeled
switches in their hands. He held the page aslant patiently, bending his senses
and his will, his soft subject gaze at rest. The crooked skirt swinging, whack by whack by whack.</p>
<p> The porkbutcher snapped two sheets from the pile, wrapped up her sausages and made a red grimace.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Now, my miss, he said.</p>
<p> She tendered a coin, smiling boldly, holding her thick wrist out.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Thank you, my miss. And one shilling threepence change. For you, please?</p>
<p> Mr Bloom pointed quickly. To catch up and walk behind her if she went
slowly, behind her moving hams. Hurry up, damn it. She stood outside the shop in
sunlight and turned lazily to the right. He sighed down his nose: they never
understand. Sodachapped hands. Crusted toenails too. Brown scapulars in tatters,
defending her both ways. The sting of disregard glowed to weak pleasure within
his breast. For another: a constable off duty cuddled her in Eccles Lane.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Threepence, please.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 58}</font> </p>
<p> His hand accepted the moist tender gland and slid it into a
<br><font color="green">{u21, 67}</font>
<br> sidepocket. Then it fetched up three coins from his trousers&apos; pocket
and laid them on the rubber prickles. They lay, were read quickly and quickly slid, disc by disc, into the till.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Thank you, sir. Another time.</p>
<p> A speck of eager fire from foxeyes thanked him. He withdrew his gaze after
an instant. No: better not: another time.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Good morning, he said, moving away.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Good morning, sir.</p>
<p> No sign. Gone. What matter?</p>
<p> He walked back along Dorset street, reading gravely. Agendath Netaim:
planters&apos; company. You pay eighty marks and they plant a dunam of land for
you with olives, oranges, almonds or citrons. Olives cheaper: oranges need
artificial irrigation. Every year you get a sending of the crop. Your name
entered for life as owner in the book of the union. Can pay ten down and the
balance in yearly instalments. Bleibtreustrasse 34, Berlin, W. 15.</p>
<p> Nothing doing. Still an idea behind it.</p>
<p> He looked at the cattle, blurred in silver heat. Silverpowdered olivetrees.
Quiet long days: pruning, ripening. Olives are packed in jars, eh? I have a few
left from Andrews. Molly spitting them out. Knows the taste of them now. Oranges
in tissue paper packed in crates. Citrons too. Wonder is poor Citron still alive
in saint Kevin&apos;s parade. And Mastiansky with the old cither. Pleasant
evenings we had then. Molly in Citron&apos;s basketchair. Nice to hold, cool
waxen fruit, hold in the hand, lift it to the nostrils and smell the perfume.
Like that, heavy, sweet, wild perfume. Always the same, year after year. They
fetched high prices too, Moisel told me. Arbutus place: Pleasants street:
pleasant old times. Must be without a flaw, he said. Coming all that way: Spain,
Gibraltar, Mediterranean, the Levant. Crates lined up on the quayside at Jaffa,
chap ticking them off in a book, navvies handling them in soiled dungarees.

<p> No, not like that. A barren land, bare waste. Vulcanic lake, the dead sea:
no fish, weedless, sunk deep in the earth. No wind could lift those waves, grey
metal, poisonous foggy waters. Brimstone they called it raining down: the cities
of the plain: Sodom, Gomorrah, Edom. All dead names. A dead sea in a dead land,
grey and old. Old now. It bore the oldest, the first race. A bent hag crossed
from Cassidy&apos;s, clutching a naggin bottle by the neck. The oldest people.
Wandered far away over all the earth, multiplying, dying, being born everywhere.
It lay there now. Now it could bear no more. Dead: an old woman&apos;s: the grey sunken cunt of the world.</p>
<p> Desolation.</p>
<p> Grey horror seared his flesh. Folding the page into his pocket he turned
into Eccles Street, hurrying homeward. Cold oils slid along his veins, chilling
his blood: age crusting him with a salt cloak. Well, I am here now.

<p> Quick warm sunlight came running from Berkeley Road, swiftly, in slim
sandals, along the brightening footpath. Runs, she runs to meet me, a girl with gold hair on the wind.</p>
<p> Two letters and a card lay on the hallfloor. He stooped and gathered them.
Mrs Marion Bloom. His quickened heart slowed at once. Bold hand. Mrs Marion &nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Poldy!</p>
<p> Entering the bedroom he halfclosed his eyes and walked through warm yellow twilight towards her tousled head.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who are the letters for? {sm, 69</p>
<p> He looked at them. Mullingar. Milly.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A letter for me from Milly, he said carefully, and a card to you. And a letter for you.</p>
<p> He laid her card and letter on the twill bedspread near the curve of her knees.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Do you want the blind up?</p>
<p> Letting the blind up by gentle tugs halfway his backward eye saw her glance
at the letter and tuck it under her pillow.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That do? he asked, turning.</p>
<p> She was reading the card, propped on her elbow.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 60}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; She got the things, she said.</p>
<p> He waited till she had laid the card aside and curled herself back slowly with a snug sigh.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Hurry up with that tea, she said. I&apos;m parched.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The kettle is boiling, he said.</p>
<p> But he delayed to clear the chair: her striped petticoat, tossed soiled
linen: and lifted all in an armful on to the foot of the bed.</p>
<p> As he went down the kitchen stairs she called:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Poldy!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Scald the teapot.</p>
<p> Boiling sure enough: a plume of steam from the spout. He scalded and rinsed
out the teapot and put in four full spoons of tea, tilting the kettle then to
let the water flow in. Having set it to draw he took off the kettle, crushed the
pan flat on the live coals and watched the lump of butter slide and melt. While
he unwrapped the kidney the cat mewed hungrily against him. He let the
bloodsmeared paper fall to her and dropped the kidney amid the sizzling butter
sauce. Pepper. He sprinkled it through his fingers, ringwise, from the chipped eggcup.</p>
<p> Then he slit open his letter, glancing down the page and over. Thanks: new
tam: Mr Coghlan: lough Owel picnic: young student: Blazes Boylan&apos;s seaside girls.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 70}</font> </p>

smiling. Silly Milly&apos;s birthday gift. Only nine she was then. No, wait:

<br> <i>I&apos;d rather have you without a farthing</i>
<br> <i>Than Katey Keogh with her ass and garden.</i></p>
<p> Poor old professor Goodwin. Dreadful old case. Still he was a courteous old
chap. Oldfashioned way he used to bow Molly off the platform. And the little
mirror in his silk hat. The night Milly brought it into the parlour. O,
<br><font color="green">{u22, 61}</font>
<br> look what I found in professor Goodwin&apos;s hat! All we laughed. Pert little piece she was.</p>
<p> He prodded a fork into the kidney and slapped it over: then fitted the
teapot on the tray. Its hump bumped as he took it up. Everything on it? Bread
and butter, four, sugar, spoon, her cream. Yes. He carried it upstairs, his thumb hooked in the teapot handle.</p>
<p> Nudging the door open with his knee he carried the tray in and set it on the chair by the bedhead.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What a time you were! she said.</p>
<p> She set the brasses jingling as she raised herself briskly, an elbow on the
pillow. He looked calmly down on her bulk and between her large soft bubs,
sloping within her nightdress like a shegoat&apos;s udder. The warmth of her
couched body rose on the air, mingling with the fragrance of the tea she poured.</p>
<p> A strip of torn envelope peeped from under the dimpled pillow. In the act of
going he stayed to straighten the bedspread.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who was the letter from? he asked.</p>
<p> Bold hand. Marion.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O, Boylan, she said. He&apos;s bringing the programme.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What are you singing?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>L&agrave; ci darem</i> with J.C. Doyle, she said, and <i>Love&apos;s Old Sweet Song</i>.

<p> Her full lips, drinking, smiled. Rather stale smell that incense leaves next day.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Would you like the window open a little?</p>
<p> She doubled a slice of bread into her mouth, asking:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What time is the funeral?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Eleven, I think, he answered. I didn&apos;t see the paper.</p>
<p> Following the pointing of her finger he took up a leg of her soiled drawers
from the bed. No. Then, a twisted grey garter looped round a stocking: rumpled, shiny sole.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; No: that book.</p>
<p> Other stocking. Her petticoat.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It must have fell down, she said.</p>
<p> He felt here and there. <i>Voglio e non vorrei.</i> Wonder if she pronounces
that right: <i>voglio</i>. Not in the bed. Must have slid down. He stooped and
lifted the valance. The book, fallen, sprawled against the bulge of the orangekeyed chamberpot.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 62}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Show here, she said. I put a mark in it. There&apos;s a word I wanted to ask you.</p>
<p> She swallowed a draught of tea and, having wiped her fingertips smartly on
the blanket, began to search the text with the hairpin till she reached the word.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Met him what? he asked.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Here, she said. What does that mean?</p>
<p> He leaned downward and read near her polished thumbnail.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Metempsychosis?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes. What&apos;s that?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Metempsychosis, he said, frowning. It&apos;s Greek: from
the Greek. That means the transmigration of souls.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O, rocks! she said. Tell us in plain words.</p>

prong of the fork under the kidney he detached it and turned it over on its
back. Only a little burned. He tossed it off the pan on to a plate and let the scanty brown gravy trickle over it.</p>
<p> Cup of tea now. He sat down, cut and buttered a slice of the loaf. He shore
away the burnt flesh and flung it to the cat. Then he put a forkful into his
mouth, chewing with discernment the toothsome pliant meat. Done to a turn. A
mouthful of tea. Then he cut

dies of bread, sopped one in the gravy and put it in his mouth. What was that
about some young student and a picnic? He creased out the letter at his side,
reading it slowly as he chewed, sopping another die of bread in the gravy and raising it to his mouth.</p>
<p class="set">Dearest Papli</p>
<p> Thanks ever so much for the lovely birthday present. It suits me splendid.
Everyone says I&apos;m quite the belle in my new tam. I got mummy&apos;s lovely
box of creams and am writing. They are lovely. I am getting on swimming in the
photo business now. Mr Coghlan took one of me and

send when developed. We did great biz yesterday. Fair day and all the beef to
the heels were in. We are going to lough Owel on Monday with a few friends to
make a scrap picnic. Give my love to mummy and to yourself a big kiss and
thanks. I hear them at the piano downstairs. There is to be concert in the

<br> Greville Arms on Saturday. There is a young student comes here some
evenings named Bannon his cousins or something are big swells he sings
Boylan&apos;s (I was on the pop of writing Blazes Boylan&apos;s) song about
those seaside girls. Tell him silly Milly sends my best respects. Byby again and lots of love.</p>

<p> Fifteen yesterday. Curious, fifteenth of the month too. Her first birthday
away from home. Separation. Remember the morning she was born, running to knock
up Mrs Thornton in Denzille street. Jolly old woman. Lots of babies she must
have helped into the world. She knew from the first poor little Rudy
wouldn&apos;t live. Well, God is good, sir. She knew at once. He would be eleven now if he had lived.</p>
<p> His vacant face stared pitying at the postscript. Excuse bad writing. Hurry.
Piano downstairs. He sopped other dies of bread in the gravy and ate piece after
piece of kidney. Twelve and six a week. Not much. Still, she might do worse.
Musichall stage. Young student. He drank a draught of cold tea to wash down his
meal. Then he read the letter again: twice.</p>
<p> O well: she knows how to mind herself. But if not? No, nothing had happened.
Of course it might. Wait in any case till it did. A wild piece of goods. Her
slim legs running up the staircase. Destiny. Ripening now. Vain: very.</p>
<p> He smiled with troubled affection at the kitchen window. Day I caught her in
the street pinching her cheeks to make them red. On the <i>Erin&apos;s King</i>
that day round the Kish. Damned old tub pitching about. Not a bit funky. Her
pale blue scarf loose in the wind with her hair.</p>
<p class="set"><i>All dimpled cheeks and curls,</i>
<br> <i>Your head it simply swirls</i>.</p>
<p> Seaside girls. Torn envelope. Hands stuck in his trousers&apos; pockets,
<font color="red"><sup><small>(5</small></sup></font><font color="black">jarvey

singing. Swurls, he says. Pier with lamps, summer evening, band.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 65}</font> </p>
<p class="set"><i>Those girls, those girls,</i>
<br> <i>Those lovely seaside girls.</i></p>
<p> Milly too. Young kisses: the first. Far away now past. Mrs Marion. Reading
lying back now, counting the strands of her hair.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 75}</font> </p>
<p> A soft qualm, regret, flowed down his backbone, increasing. Will happen,
yes. Prevent. Useless: can&apos;t move. Girl&apos;s sweet light lips. Will
happen too. He felt the flowing qualm spread over him. Useless to move now. Lips
kissed, kissing, kissed. Full gluey woman&apos;s lips.</p>
<p> Better where she is down there: away. Might take a trip down there. August
bank holiday, only five and six return. Six weeks off however. Might work a press pass. Or through M&apos;Coy.</p>
<p> The cat, having cleaned all her fur, returned to the meatstained paper,
nosed at it and stalked to the door. She looked back at him, mewing. Wants to go out. Let her wait.</p>
<p> He felt heavy, full: then a gentle loosening of his bowels. He stood up,
undoing the waistband of his trousers. The cat mewed to him.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Miaow! he said in answer. Wait till I&apos;m ready.</p>
<p> Heaviness: hot day coming. Too much trouble to fag up the stairs to the landing.</p>
<p> A paper. He liked to read at stool.

<p> In the table drawer he found an old number of <i>Titbits</i>. He folded it
under his armpit, went to the door and opened it. The cat went up in soft
bounds. Ah, wanted to go upstairs, curl up in a ball on the bed.</p>
<p> Listening, he heard her voice:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Come, come, pussy. Come.</p>
<p> He went out through the backdoor into the garden: stood to listen towards
the next garden. No sound. Perhaps hanging clothes out to dry. Fine morning.</p>
<p> He bent down to regard a lean file of spearmint growing by the wall.

Just had a wash and brush up. Wonder have I time for a bath this morning.</p>
<p> Deep voice that fellow Dlugacz has. Agendath what is it? Now, my miss. Enthusiast.</p>
<p> He kicked open the door of the jakes. Better be careful not to get these
trousers dirty for the funeral. He went in, bowing his head under the low
lintel. Leaving the door ajar, amid the stench of mouldy limewash and stale
cobwebs he undid his braces. Before sitting down he peered through a chink up at the nextdoor windows. Nobody.</p>
<p> Asquat on the cuckstool he folded out his paper, turning its pages over on
his bared knees. Something new and easy. Our prize titbit: <i>Matcham&apos;s
Masterstroke</i>. Written by Mr Philip Beaufoy, Playgoers&apos; Club, London.
Payment at the rate of one guinea a column has been made to the writer. Three
and a half. Three pounds three. Three pounds, thirteen and six.</p>

patiently

Biting her nether lip hooking the placket of her skirt. Timing her. 9.15. Did
Roberts pay you yet? 9.20. What had Gretta Conroy on? 9.23. What possessed me to
buy this comb? 9.24. I&apos;m swelled after that cabbage. A speck of dust on the
patent leather of her boot: rubbing smartly in turn each welt against her
stockinged calf. Morning after the bazaar dance when May&apos;s band played
Ponchielli&apos;s dance of the hours. Explain that: morning hours, noon, then
evening coming on, then night hours. Washing her teeth. That was the first
night. Is that Boylan well off? He has money. Why? I noticed he had a good rich
smell off his breath dancing. No use humming then. Allude to it. Strange kind of
music that last night. The mirror was in shadow. She rubbed her handglass
briskly on her woollen vest against her full wagging bub. Peering into it. Lines
in her eyes. It wouldn&apos;t pan out somehow.</p>
<p> Evening hours, girls in grey gauze. Night hours then: black with daggers and
eyemasks. Poetical idea: pink, then golden, then grey, then black. Still, true to life also. Day: then the night.</p>
<p> He tore away half the prize story sharply and wiped himself with it. Then he
girded up his trousers, braced and buttoned himself. He pulled back the shaky
door of the jakes and came forth from the gloom into the air.</p>

carefully his black trousers: the ends, the knees, the houghs of the knees. What
time is the funeral? Better find out in the paper.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 78}</font> </p>
<p> A creak and a dark whirr in the air high up. The bells of George&apos;s
church. They tolled the hour: loud dark iron.</p>
<p class="set"><i>Heigho! Heigho!</i>
<br> <i>Heigho! Heigho!</i>
<br> <i>Heigho! Heigho!</i></p>
