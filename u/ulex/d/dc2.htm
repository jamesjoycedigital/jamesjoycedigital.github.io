<p> Mr Leopold Bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls. He
liked thick giblet soup, nutty gizzards, a stuffed roast heart,
liverslices<a target="foot" id="fdd0001">&ordm;</a> fried with crustcrumbs,
fried cods&apos; roes. Most of all he liked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to
his palate a fine tang of faintly scented urine.</p>
<p> Kidneys were in his mind as he moved about the kitchen softly, righting her
breakfast things on the humpy tray. Gelid light and air were in the kitchen but
out of doors gentle summer morning everywhere. Made him feel a bit peckish.</p>
<p> The coals were reddening.</p>
<p> Another slice of bread and butter: three, four: right. She didn&apos;t like
her plate full. Right. He turned from the tray, lifted the kettle off the hob
and set it sideways on the fire. It sat there, dull and squat, its spout stuck out.</p>
<p> The<a target="foot" id="fdd0002">&ordm;</a> cat walked stiffly round a leg of the table with tail on high.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Mkgnao!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O, there you are, Mr Bloom said, turning from the fire.</p>
<p> The cat mewed in answer and stalked again stiffly round a leg of the table, mewing.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom watched curiously, kindly the lithe black form. Clean to see: the
gloss of her sleek hide, the white button under the butt of her tail, the green
flashing eyes. He bent down to her, his hands on his knees.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Milk for the pussens, he said. </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Mrkgnao! the cat cried.</p>
<p> They call them stupid. They understand what we say better than we understand them. She understands all she wants to.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 54}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Afraid of the chickens she is, he said mockingly. Afraid
of the chookchooks. I never saw such a stupid pussens as the pussens.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Mrkrgnao! the cat said loudly.</p>
<p> She blinked up out of her avid eyes, mewing plaintively and long, showing
him her milkwhite teeth. He watched the dark eyeslits narrowing with greed till
her eyes were green stones. Then he went to the
dresser,<a target="foot" id="fdd0005">&ordm;</a> poured milk on a saucer and set it for her slowly on the floor.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Gurrhr! she cried, running to lap.</p>
<p> He watched the bristles shining wirily in the weak light. Wonder is it true
if you clip them they can&apos;t mouse after. Why? They shine in the dark,
perhaps, the tips. Or kind of feelers in the dark, perhaps.</p>
<p> He listened to her licking lap. Thursday: good day for a mutton kidney at
Buckley&apos;s. Fried with butter, a shake of pepper. Or better a pork kidney at
Dlugacz&apos;s. While the kettle is boiling. She lapped slower, then licking the
saucer clean. Why are their tongues so rough? To lap better, all porous holes.
Nothing she can eat? He glanced round him. No.</p>
<p> He went up the staircase to the hall, paused by the bedroom door. She might
like something tasty. Thin bread and butter she likes in the morning. Still perhaps: once in a way.</p>
<p> He said softly in the bare hall.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I&apos;m going round the corner. Be back in a minute.</p>
<p> And when he had heard his voice say it he added:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You don&apos;t want anything for breakfast? </p>
<p> A sleepy soft grunt answered:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Mn.</p>
<p> No. She didn&apos;t want anything. He heard then a warm heavy sigh, softer,
as she turned over and the loose brass quoits of the bedstead jingled. Must get
those settled really. Pity. All the way from Gibraltar.
<a name="un3007j" href="../../FF/unbs/un3all.htm#un3007j">Wonder what her father
gave for it</a>. Old style. Ah yes! of course. Bought it at the governor&apos;s
auction. Got a short knock. Hard as nails at a bargain, old Tweedy. Yes, sir. At
Plevna that was. I rose from the ranks, sir, and I&apos;m proud of it. Still he
had brains enough to make that corner in stamps. Now that was farseeing.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 55}</font> </p>
<p> His hand took his hat from the peg. Stamps: stickyback pictures. Daresay
lots of officers are in the swim too. Course they do. The sweated legend in the
crown of his hat told him mutely: Plasto&apos;s high grade ha. He
peeped<a target="foot" id="fdd0009">&ordm;</a> quickly inside the leather headband. White slip of paper. Quite safe.</p>
<p> On the doorstep he felt in his hip pocket for the latchkey. Not there. In
the trousers I left off. Creaky wardrobe. No use disturbing her. She turned over
sleepily that time. He pulled the halldoor to after him very quietly, more, till
the footleaf dropped<a target="foot" id="fdd0011">&ordm;</a> gently over
the<a target="foot" id="fdd0012">&ordm;</a>
threshold,<a target="foot" id="fdd0013">&ordm;</a> a limp lid. Looked shut. All right till I come back anyhow.</p>
<p> He crossed to the bright side. The sun was nearing the steeple of
George&apos;s church. Be a warm day I fancy. Specially in these black clothes
feel it more. Black conducts, reflects, (refracts is it?) the heat. His eyelids
sank quietly often as he walked in happy warmth. Makes you feel young. Somewhere
in the east; early morning: set off at dawn. Walk along a strand, strange land,
come to a city gate, sentry there, old ranker too, old  Tweedy&apos;s big
moustaches,<a target="foot" id="fdd0016">&ordm;</a> leaning on a long kind of a
spear. Wander through awned streets. Turbaned faces going by. Dark caves of
carpet shops, big man, Turk, seated
crosslegged<a target="foot" id="fdd0017">&ordm;</a> smoking a coiled pipe. Cries
of sellers in the streets. Drink water scented with fennel, sherbet. Dander
along all day. Getting on to sundown. The shadows of the mosques
among<a target="foot" id="fdd0019">&ordm;</a> the pillars: priest with a scroll
rolled up. A shiver of the trees, signal, the evening wind. I pass on. Fading
gold sky. A mother watches me<a target="foot" id="fdd0020">&ordm;</a> from her
doorway. She calls her children home in their dark language. High wall: beyond
strings twanged. Night sky,<a target="foot" id="fdd0021">&ordm;</a> moon,
violet, colour of Molly&apos;s new garters. Strings. Listen. A girl playing one
of those instruments what do you call them: dulcimers. I pass.</p>
<p> Probably not a bit like it really. Kind of stuff you read: in the track of
the sun. Sunburst on the titlepage. He smiled, pleasing himself. What Arthur
Griffith said about the headpiece over the <i>Freeman</i> leader: a homerule sun
rising up in the northwest from the laneway behind the bank of Ireland. He
prolonged his pleased smile. Ikey touch that: homerule sun rising up in the northwest.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 56}</font> </p>
<p> He approached Larry O&apos;Rourke&apos;s. From the cellar grating floated up
the flabby gush of porter. Through the open doorway the bar squirted out whiffs
of ginger, teadust, biscuit mush. Good house, however: just the end of the city
traffic. For instance M&apos;Auley&apos;s down there: n.g. as position. Of
course if they ran a tramline along the North Circular from the cattle market to
the quays value would go up like a shot.</p>
<p> Baldhead over the blind. Cute old codger. No use canvassing him for an ad.
Still he knew his own business best. There he is, sure enough, my bold Larry,
leaning against the sugarbin in his shirtsleeves watched the aproned curate
swabbing up with mop and bucket. Simon Dedalus takes him off to a tea, with his
eyes screwed up. Do you know what I&apos;m going to tell you? What&apos;s that,
Mr O&apos;Rourke? Do you know what? The Russians, they are only an eight o&apos;clock breakfast for the Japanese.</p>
<p> Stop and say a word: about the funeral perhaps. Sad thing about  poor Dignam, Mr O&apos;Rourke.</p>
<p> Turning into Dorset Street he said freshly in greeting through the doorway:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Good day, Mr O&apos;Rourke.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Good day to you.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Lovely weather, sir.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; &apos;Tis all that.</p>
<p> Where do they get the money? Coming up redheaded curates from the
county<a target="foot" id="fdd0022">&ordm;</a> Leitrim, rising empties in the
cellar. Then, lo and behold, they blossom out as publicans. Save it they
can&apos;t. Off the drunks perhaps. What is that, a bob here and there, dribs
and drabs. On the wholesale orders perhaps. Doing a double shuffle with the town
travellers. Square it you with the boss and we&apos;ll split the job, see?</p>
<p> How much would that tot to off the porter in the month? Say ten barrels of
stuff. Say he got ten per cent off. O<a target="foot" id="fdd0023">&ordm;</a>
more. Fifteen.<a target="foot" id="fdd0024">&ordm;</a></p>
<p> He halted before Dlugacz&apos;s window, staring at the hanks of sausages,
polonies, black and white. Fifteen<a target="foot" id="fdd0027">&ordm;</a>
multiplied by. The figures whitened in his
mind<a target="foot" id="fdd0028">&ordm;</a> unsolved: displeased, he let them
fade. The shiny links,<a target="foot" id="fdd0029">&ordm;</a> packed with
<br><font color="green">{u22, 57}</font>
<br> forcemeat, fed his gaze and he breathed in tranquilly the lukewarm breath
of cooked spicy pigs&apos;<a target="foot" id="fdd0030">&ordm;</a> blood.</p>
<p> A kidney oozed bloodgouts on the willow patterned dish: the last. He stood
near the nextdoor servant at the counter. Would she buy it too, calling the
items from a slip in her chapped hand?<a target="foot" id="fdd0031">&ordm;</a>
Washingsoda. And a pound and a half of sausages. His eyes rested on her vigorous
hips. Strong pair of arms. Whacking a carpet on the clothesline. She does whack
it by George.  The way her crooked skirt swings at each whack.</p>
<p> The ferreteyed porkbutcher folded the sausages he had snipped off with
blotchy fingers, sausagepink. Sound meat
there:<a target="foot" id="fdd0032">&ordm;</a> like a stallfed heifer. He took a
page up from the pile of cut sheets: the<a target="foot" id="fdd0034">&ordm;</a>
model farm at Kinnereth on the lakeshore of Tiberias. I thought he was.
Farmhouse, wall round it, blurred cattle cropping. He held the page from him:
interesting: read it nearer, the title, the blurred cropping cattle, the page
rustling. A young white heifer. Those mornings in the cattle
market,<a target="foot" id="fdd0035">&ordm;</a> the beasts lowing in their pens,
flop and fall of dung, the breeders in hobnailed boots trudging through the
litter, slapping a palm on a meaty hindquarter, there&apos;s a prime one,
unpeeled switches in their hands. He held the page aslant patiently, bending his
senses and his will, his soft subject gaze at rest. The crooked skirt
swinging,<a target="foot" id="fdd0036">&ordm;</a> whack by whack by whack.</p>
<p> The porkbutcher snapped two sheets from the pile, wrapped up her sausages and made a red grimace.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Now, my miss, he said.</p>
<p> She tendered a coin, smiling boldly, holding her thick wrist out.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Thank you, my miss. And one shilling threepence change. For you, please?</p>
<p> Mr Bloom pointed quickly. To catch up and walk behind her if she went
slowly, behind her moving hams. Hurry up, damn it. She stood outside the shop in
sunlight and turned lazily to the right. He sighed down his nose: they never
understand. Sodachapped hands. Crusted toenails too. Brown scapulars in tatters,
defending her both ways. The sting of disregard glowed to weak pleasure within
his breast. For another: a constable off duty cuddling her in Eccles<a target="foot" id="fdd0037">&ordm;</a> Lane.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Threepence, please.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 58}</font> </p>
<p> His hand accepted the moist tender gland and slid it into a  sidepocket.
Then it fetched up three coins from his trousers&apos; pocket and laid them on
the rubber prickles. They lay, were read quickly and quickly slid, disc by disc, into the till.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Thank you, sir. Another time.</p>
<p> A speck of eager fire from foxeyes thanked him. He withdrew his gaze after
an instant. No: better not: another time.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Good morning, he said, moving away.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Good morning, sir.</p>
<p> No sign. Gone. What matter?</p>
<p> He walked back along Dorset Street, reading gravely. Agendath Netaim:
planters&apos; company. You pay eighty<a target="foot" id="fdd0038">&ordm;</a>
marks and they plant a dunam of land for you with olives, oranges, almonds or
citrons. Olives cheaper: oranges need artificial irrigation. Every year you get
a sending of the crop. Your name entered for life as owner in the book of the
union. Can pay ten down and the balance in yearly instalments. Bleibtreustrasse
34, Berlin, W.<a target="foot" id="fdd0039">&ordm;</a> 15.</p>
<p> Nothing doing.<a target="foot" id="fdd0040">&ordm;</a> Still an idea behind it.</p>
<p> He looked at the cattle, blurred in silver heat.
Silverpowdered<a target="foot" id="fdd0041">&ordm;</a> olivetrees. Quiet long
days: pruning,<a target="foot" id="fdd0042">&ordm;</a> ripening. Olives are
packed in jars, eh? I have a few left from Andrews. Mollie spitting them out.
Knows the taste of them now. Oranges in tissue paper packed in crates. Citrons
too. Wonder is poor Citron still in saint Kevin&apos;s parade. And Mastiansky
with the old cither. Pleasant evenings we had then. Mollie in Citron&apos;s
basket chair. Nice to hold, cool waxen fruit, hold in the hand, lift it to the
nostrils and smell the perfume. Like that, heavy, sweet, wild perfume. Always
the same, year after year. They fetched high prices
too,<a target="foot" id="fdd0043">&ordm;</a> Moisel told me. Arbutus Place:
Pleasants Street: pleasant old times. Must be without a flaw, he said. Coming
all that way: Spain, Gibraltar, Mediterranean, the Levant. Crates lined up on
the quayside at Jaffa, chap ticking them off in a book, navvies handling them barefoot in soiled dungarees.</p>
<p> A cloud began to cover the sun slowly,<a target="foot" id="fdd0044">&ordm;</a> wholly. Grey. Far.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 59}</font> </p>
<p> No, not like that. A barren land, bare waste. Vulcanic lake, the dead sea:
no fish, weedless, sunk deep in the earth. No wind
could<a target="foot" id="fdd0045">&ordm;</a> lift those waves, grey metal,
poisonous foggy waters. Brimstone they called it raining down: the cities of the
plain: Sodom, Gomorrah,<a target="foot" id="fdd0046">&ordm;</a> Edom. All dead
names. A dead sea in a dead land, grey and old. Old now. It bore the oldest, the
first race. A bent hag crossed from Cassidy&apos;s clutching a naggin bottle by
the neck. The oldest people. Wandered far away over all the earth, multiplying,
dying, being born everywhere. It lay there now. Now it could bear no more. Dead:
an old woman&apos;s: the grey sunken cunt of the world.</p>
<p> Desolation.</p>
<p> Grey horror seared his flesh<a target="foot" id="fdd0048">&ordm;</a>.
Folding the page into his pocket he turned into
Eccles<a target="foot" id="fdd0049">&ordm;</a> Street, hurrying homeward. Cold
oils slid along his veins, chilling his blood: age crusting him with a salt
cloak. Well, I am here now. Yes, I am here now. Blotchy brown brick houses.
Number seven still unlet. Why is that? Valuation is only twentyeight. Towers,
Battersby, North, MacArthur: parlour windows plastered with bills. Plasters on a
sore eye. To smell the gentle smoke of tea, fume of the pan, sizzling butter. Be
near her ample bedwarmed flesh. Yes, yes.</p>
<p> Quick warm sunlight came running from Berkeley Road, swiftly, in slim
sandals, along the brightening footpath. Runs, she runs to meet me, a girl with gold hair on the wind.</p>
<p> Two letters and a card lay on the<a target="foot" id="fdd0050">&ordm;</a>
hallfloor. He stooped and gathered them. Mrs Marion Bloom. His
quickened<a target="foot" id="fdd0051">&ordm;</a> heart slowed at once. Bold hand. Mrs Marion&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Poldy! &mdash;</p>
<p> Entering the bedroom he halfclosed his eyes and walked through warm yellow twilight towards her tousled head.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who are the letters for? {sm, 69</p>
<p> He looked at them. Mullingar. Milly.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A letter for me from Milly, he said carefully, and a card to you. And a letter for you.</p>
<p> He laid her card and letter on the twill bedspread near the curve of her knees.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Do you want the blind up?</p>
<p> Letting the blind up by gentle tugs halfway his backward eye saw her glance
at the letter and tuck it under her pillow.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That do? he asked, turning.</p>
<p> She was reading the card, propped on her elbow.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 60}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; She got the things, she said.</p>
<p> He waited till she had laid the card aside and curled herself back slowly with a snug sigh.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Hurry up with that tea, she said. I&apos;m parched.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The kettle is boiling, he said.</p>
<p> But he delayed to clear the chair: her striped petticoat, tossed soiled
linen: and lifted all in an armful on to the foot of the bed.</p>
<p> As he went down the kitchen stairs she called:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Poldy!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Scald the teapot.</p>
<p> Boiling sure enough: a plume of steam from the spout. He scalded and rinsed
out the teapot and put in four full spoons of tea, tilting the kettle then to
let the<a target="foot" id="fdd0052">&ordm;</a> water flow in. Having set it to
draw<a target="foot" id="fdd0053">&ordm;</a> he took off the kettle and crushed
the pan flat on the live coals and watched the lump of butter slide and melt.
While he unwrapped the kidney the cat mewed hungrily against. He let the
bloodsmeared paper fall to her and dropped the kidney amid the sizzling butter
sauce. Pepper. He sprinkled it ringwise through his fingers from the chipped eggcup.</p>
<p> Then he slit open his letter, glancing down the page and over. Thanks: new
Tam: Mr Coghlan: lough Owel picnic: young student: Blazes Boylan&apos;s seaside girls. </p>
<p> The tea was drawn. He filled his own moustache cup, sham crown Derby,
smiling. Silly Milly&apos;s birthday gift. Only ten she was then. No, wait:
eight. I gave her the necklace she broke. He smiled, pouring:</p>
<p class="set"><i>O, Milly Bloom, you are my darling.</i>
<br> <i>You are my lookingglass</i><a target="foot" id="fdd0055">&ordm;</a> <i>from night to morning.</i>
<br> <i>I&apos;d rather have you without a farthing</i>
<br> <i>Than Katey Keogh with her ass and garden.</i></p>
<p> Poor old professor Goodwin. Dreadful old case. Still he was a courteous old
chap. Oldfashioned way he used to bow Molly off the platform. And the little
mirror<a target="foot" id="fdd0056">&ordm;</a> in his silk hat. The night Milly brought it into the parlour. O,
<br><font color="green">{u22, 61}</font>
<br> look what I found in professor Goodwin&apos;s hat! All we laughed. Pert little piece she was.</p>
<p> He prodded a fork into the kidney and slapped it over: then fitted the
teapot on the tray. Its hump bumped as he took it up. Everything on it? Bread
and butter, four, sugar, spoon, her cream. Yes. He carried it upstairs, his thumb hooked in the teapot handle.</p>
<p> Nudging the door open with his knee he carried the tray in and set it on the chair by the bedhead.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What a time you were! she said.</p>
<p> She set the brasses jingling as she raised herself briskly, an elbow on the
pillow. He looked calmly down on her bulk and between her large soft bubs,
sloping within her nightdress like a shegoat&apos;s udder. The warmth of her
couched body rose on the air, mingling with the fragrance of the tea she poured.</p>
<p> A strip of torn envelope peeped from under the dimpled pillow. In the act of
going he stayed to straighten the bedspread.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who was the letter from? he asked.</p>
<p> Bold hand. Marion.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O, Boylan, she said. He&apos;s bringing the programme.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What are you singing?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>L&agrave; ci darem</i> with J.C. Doyle, she said, and <i>Love&apos;s Old Sweet Song</i>. </p>
<p> Her full lips, drinking, smiled. Rather stale smell that incense leaves next day.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Would you like the window open a little?</p>
<p> She doubled a slice of bread into her mouth, asking:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What time is the funeral?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Eleven, I think, he answered. I didn&apos;t see the paper.</p>
<p> Following the pointing of her finger he took up a leg of her soiled drawers
from the bed. No. Then, a twisted grey garter looped round a stocking: rumpled, shiny sole.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; No: that book.</p>
<p> Other stocking. Her petticoat.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It must have fell down, she said.</p>
<p> He felt here and there. <i>Voglio e non vorrei.</i> Wonder if she pronounces
that right: <i>voglio</i>. Not in the bed. Must have slid down. He stooped and
lifted the valance. The book, fallen, sprawled against the bulge of the orangekeyed chamberpot.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 62}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Show here, she said. I put a mark in it. There&apos;s a word I wanted to ask you.</p>
<p> She swallowed a draught of tea and, having wiped her fingertips smartly on
the blanket, began to search the text with the hairpin till she reached the word.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Met him what? he asked.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Here, she said. What does that mean?</p>
<p> He leaned downward and read near her polished thumbnail.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Metempsychosis?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes. What&apos;s that?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Metempsychosis,<a target="foot" id="fdd0058">&ordm;</a> he
said, frowning. It&apos;s Greek; from the Greek. That means the transmigration of souls.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O, rocks! she said. Tell us in plain words.</p>
<p> He smiled, glancing askance at her mocking
eyes<a target="foot" id="fdd0059">&ordm;</a>. Young still. The same young eyes.
The first night after the charades at Dolphin&apos;s Barn. He turned over the
smudged pages. <i>Ruby:</i> a tale of circus life. That we live after death. Our
souls. That a man&apos;s soul after he
dies,<a target="foot" id="fdd0061">&ordm;</a> Dignam&apos;s soul&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Did you finish it? he asked.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, she said. There&apos;s nothing smutty in it. Is she
in love with the first fellow all the time?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Never read it. Do you want another?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes. Get another of Paul de Kock&apos;s. Nice name he has.</p>
<p> She poured more tea into her cup, watching it<a target="foot" id="fdd0062">&ordm;</a> flow sideways.</p>
<p> Reincarnation: that&apos;s the word.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Some people believe, he said, that we go
on<a target="foot" id="fdd0064">&ordm;</a> living in another body after death,
that we lived before. They call it reincarnation. That we all lived before on
the earth thousands of years ago or some other planet. They say we have
forgotten it. Some say they remember their past lives.</p>
<p> The sluggish cream wound curdling spirals through her tea. Better remind her
of the word: metempsychosis. An example would be better. An example?</p>
<p> <i>The</i><a target="foot" id="fdd0065">&ordm;</a> <i>Bath of the Nymph</i>
over the bed. Given away with the easter number
<br><font color="green">{u22, 63}</font>
<br> of <i>Photo Bits</i>: splendid<a target="foot" id="fdd0066">&ordm;</a>
masterpiece in art colours. Tea before you put milk in. Not unlike her with her
hair down: slimmer. Three and six I gave for the frame. She said it would look
nice over the bed. Naked nymphs: Greece: and for instance all the people that lived then.</p>
<p> He turned the pages back.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Metempsychosis, he said, is what the ancient Greeks called
it. They used to believe you could be changed into an animal or a tree, for
instance. What they called nymphs for example.</p>
<p> Her spoon ceased to stir up the sugar. She gazed straight before her, inhaling through her arched nostrils.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There&apos;s a smell of burn, she said. Did you leave anything on the fire?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The kidney! he cried suddenly. </p>
<p> He fitted the book roughly into his inner pocket and hurried out towards the
smell, stepping hastily down the stairs with a flurried stork&apos;s legs.
Pungent smoke shot up in an angry jet from a side of the pan. By prodding a
prong of the fork under the kidney he detached it and turned it over on its
back. Only a little burnt. He tossed it off the pan on to a plate and let the scanty brown gravy trickle over it.</p>
<p> Cup of tea now. He sat down, cut and buttered a slice of the loaf. He shore
away the burnt flesh and flung it to the cat. Then he put a forkful into his
mouth, chewing with discernment the toothsome pliant meat. Done to a turn. A
mouthful of tea. Then he cut many dies of bread, sopped one in the gravy and put
it in his mouth. What was that about some young student and a picnic? He creased
out the letter at his side, reading it slowly as he chewed, sopping another die
of bread in the gravy and raising it to his mouth.</p>
<p class="set">Dearest Papli<a target="foot" id="fdd0067">&ordm;</a></p>
<p> Thanks ever so much for the lovely birthday present. It suits me splendid.
Everyone says I am quite the belle in my new tam. I got mummy&apos;s lovely box
of creams and am writing.<a target="foot" id="fdd0068">&ordm;</a> They are
lovely. I am getting on swimming in the photo business now. Mrs Coghlan took one
of me and Mrs. Will send when developed. We did great biz yesterday. Fair day
and all the beef to the heels were in. We are going to lough Owel on Monday with
a few friends to make a scrap picnic. Give my love to mummy and to yourself a
big kiss and thanks. I hear them at the piano downstairs. There is to be concert in the

on Saturday. There is a young student comes here some evenings named Bannon his
cousins or something are big swells and
he<a target="foot" id="fdd0070">&ordm;</a> sings Boylan&apos;s (I was on the pop
of writing Blazes Boylan&apos;s) song about those seaside girls. Tell him silly
Milly sends my best respects. Byebye again and lots of love</p>
<p> Your fond daughter<a target="foot" id="fdd0072">&ordm;</a></p>
<p class="deep">Milly<a target="foot" id="fdd0073">&ordm;</a></p>
<p> P.S. Excuse bad writing am in hurry. </p>
<p> Fifteen yesterday. Curious, fifteenth of the month too. Her first birthday
away from home. Separation. Remember the morning she was born, running to knock
up Mrs Thornton in Denzille Street. Jolly old woman. Lot of babies she must have
helped into the world. She knew from the first poor little Rudy wouldn&apos;t
live. Well, God is good, sir. She knew at once. He would be twelve now if he had lived.</p>
<p> His vacant face stared pityingly at the postscript. Excuse bad writing.
Hurry. Piano downstairs. He sopped other dies of bread in the gravy and ate
piece after piece of kidney. Twelve and six a week. Not much. Still, she might
do worse. Musichall<a target="foot" id="fdd0074">&ordm;</a> stage. Young
student. He drank a draught of cold tea to wash down his meal. Then he read the letter again: twice.</p>
<p> O, well: she knows how to mind herself. But if not? No, nothing had
happened. Of course it might. Wait in any case till it did. A wild piece of
goods. Her slim legs running up the staircase. Destiny. Ripening now. Vain: very.</p>
<p> He smiled with troubled affection at the kitchen window. Day I caught her in
the street pinching her cheeks to make them red. On the <i>Erin&apos;s King</i>
that day round the Kish. Damned old tub pitching about. Not a bit funky. Her
pale blue scarf loose in the wind with her hair.</p>
<p class="set"><i>All dimpled cheeks and curls</i>
<br> <i>Your head it simply swirls</i></p>
<p> Seaside<a target="foot" id="fdd0075">&ordm;</a> girls. Torn envelope. Hands
stuck in his trousers&apos; pockets, singing. <i>Swurls</i>, he says. Pier with
lamps, summer evening, band.<a target="foot" id="fdd0076">&ordm;</a>
<br><font color="green">{u22, 65}</font> </p>
<p class="set"><i>Those girls, those girls,</i>
<br> <i>Those lovely seaside girls.</i></p>
<p> Milly too. Young kisses: the first. Far away now past. Mrs Marion. Reading,
lying back now, counting the strands of her hair. </p>
<p> A soft qualm,<a target="foot" id="fdd0077">&ordm;</a> regret, flowed down
his backbone, increasing. Will happen, yes. Prevent. Useless: can&apos;t move.
Girl&apos;s sweet light lips. Will happen too. He felt the flowing qualm spread
over him. Useless to move now. Lips kissed,
kissing,<a target="foot" id="fdd0078">&ordm;</a> kissed. Full gluey woman&apos;s lips.</p>
<p> Better where she is down there: away. Might take a trip down there. August
bank holiday, only five and six return. Six weeks off, however. Might work a press pass. Or through M&apos;Coy.</p>
<p> The cat, having cleaned all her fur, returned to the meatstained paper,
nosed at it and stalked to the door. She looked back at him, mewing. Wants to go out. Let her wait.</p>
<p> He felt full, heavy: then a gentle loosening of his bowels. He stood up,
undoing the waistband of his trousers. The cat mewed to him.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Miaow! he said in answer. Wait till I&apos;m ready.</p>
<p> Heaviness: hot day coming. Too much trouble to fag up the stairs to the landing.</p>
<p> A paper. He liked to read at stool.</p>
<p> In the tabledrawer he found an old number of <i>Titbits</i>. He folded it
under his armpit, went to the door and opened it. The cat went up in soft
bounds. Ah, wanted to go upstairs, curl up in a ball on the bed.</p>
<p> Listening, he heard her voice:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Come, come, pussy. Come.</p>
<p> He went out through the backdoor into the garden: stood to listen towards
the next garden. No sound. Perhaps hanging clothes out to dry. Fine morning.</p>
<p> He bent down to regard a lean file of spearmint growing by the wall. Want to
manure the whole place over, scabby soil. A coat of liver of sulphur. All soil like that
<br><font color="green">{u22, 66}</font>
<br> without dung. Loam, what is this that is? The hens in the next garden:
their droppings are very good I heard. Best of all though are the cattle,
specially when they are fed on those oilcakes. Mulch of dung. Reclaim the whole
place. Grow peas in that corner there. Lettuce. Always have fresh greens then.</p>
<p> He walked on. Where is my hat, by the way? Must have put it back on the peg.
Funny<a target="foot" id="fdd0082">&ordm;</a> I don&apos;t remember that.
Picking up the letters. Drago&apos;s shopbell ringing. Queer I was just thinking
that moment. Black
<a name="s19001o" href="../../FF/unbs/s19all.htm#s19001o">brillantined</a> hair
over his collar. Just had a wash and brush up. Wonder have I time for a bath this morning.</p>
<p> Deep voice that fellow Dlugacz has.
Agendath<a target="foot" id="fdd0085">&ordm;</a> what is it? Now, my miss. Enthusiast.</p>
<p> He kicked open the door of the
<a name="un1032ca" href="../../FF/unbs/un1all.htm#un1032ca">jakes</a>. Better be
careful not to get these trousers dirty for the funeral. He went in, bowing his
head under the low lintel. Leaving the door ajar, amid the stench of mouldy
limewash and stale cobwebs he undid his braces. Before sitting down he peered
through a chink up at the nextdoor windows<a target="foot" id="fdd0086">&ordm;</a>. Nobody.</p>
<p> Asquat on the
<a name="un1032ai" href="../../FF/unbs/un1all.htm#un1032ai">cuckstool</a> he
folded out his paper,<a target="foot" id="fdd0087">&ordm;</a> turning its pages
over on his bared knees. Something new and easy. Our prize
titbit:<a target="foot" id="fdd0088">&ordm;</a> <i>Matcham&apos;s
Masterstroke</i>. Written by Mr Philip Beaufoy, Playgoers&apos;
Club<a target="foot" id="fdd0089">&ordm;</a>, London. Payment at the rate of one
guinea a column has been made to the writer. Three and a half. Three pounds
three. Three pounds,<a target="foot" id="fdd0090">&ordm;</a> thirteen and six.</p>
<p> He allowed his bowels to ease themselves quietly as he read, reading
patiently. Life might be so. It did not move or touch him but it was something
quick and neat. He read on. Neat certainly. Matcham often thinks of the
masterstroke by which he won the laughing witch who now. Hand in hand. Smart. He
glanced back through what he had read and envied kindly Mr Beaufoy who had
written it and received payment of three pounds,<a target="foot" id="fdd0095">&ordm;</a> thirteen and six.</p>
<p> Might manage a sketch. Time I used to try jotting down on my cuff what she
said dressing. Biting her nether lip hooking the placket of her skirt. Timing
her. 9.15. Did Roberts pay you yet? 9.20. What had Gretta Conroy on? 9.23. What
possessed me to buy this comb? 9.24. I&apos;m swelled after that cabbage. A
speck of dust on the patent leather of her boot:
rubbing<a target="foot" id="fdd0098">&ordm;</a> smartly in turn each welt
against her stockinged<a target="foot" id="fdd0099">&ordm;</a> calf. Morning
after the bazaar dance when May&apos;s band played Ponchielli&apos;s dance of
the hours. Explain that:<a target="foot" id="fdd0100">&ordm;</a> morning hours,
noon, then evening coming on, then night hours. Washing her teeth. That was the
first night. Is that Boylan well off? He has money. Why? I noticed he had a good
rich<a target="foot" id="fdd0101">&ordm;</a> smell off his breath dancing. No
use humming then. Allude to it. Strange kind of music that last night. The
mirror was in shadow. She rubbed her handglass briskly on her woollen vest
against her full wagging bub. Peering into it. Lines in her eyes. It wouldn&apos;t pan out somehow.</p>
<p> Evening hours, girls in grey gauze. Night hours
then:<a target="foot" id="fdd0102">&ordm;</a> black with daggers and eyemasks.
Poetical idea:<a target="foot" id="fdd0103">&ordm;</a> pink, then golden, then
grey, then black. Still,<a target="foot" id="fdd0104">&ordm;</a> true to life
also. Day:<a target="foot" id="fdd0105">&ordm;</a> then the night.</p>
<p> He tore away half the prize story sharply and wiped himself with it. Then he
girded up his trousers, braced and buttoned himself. He pulled back the shaky
door of the jakes and came forth from the gloom into the air.</p>
<p> In the bright light he eyed carefully his black trousers, the ends, the
knees, the houghs of the knees. What time is the funeral? Better find out in the paper. </p>
<p> A creak and a dark whirr in the air high up. The bells of George&apos;s
church. They tolled the hour: loud dark iron.</p>
<p class="set"><i>Heigho! Heigho!</i>
<br> <i>Heigho! Heigho!</i>
<br> <i>Heigho! Heigho!</i></p>
<p> Quarter to. There again: the overtone following through the air. A third.</p>
<p> Poor Dignam!</p>  </main>
