<p> Mr Leopold Bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls. He
liked thick giblet soup, nutty gizzards, a stuffed roast heart,
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">liver
slices</span></span>
<font color="black">liverslices</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>
fried with crustcrumbs, fried cods&apos; roes. Most of all he liked grilled
mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of faintly scented urine.</p>
<p> Kidneys were in his mind as he moved about the kitchen softly, righting her
breakfast things on the humpy tray. Gelid light and air were in the kitchen but
out of doors gentle summer morning everywhere. Made him feel a bit peckish.</p>
<p> The coals were reddening.</p>
<p> Another slice of bread and butter: three, four: right. She didn&apos;t like
her plate full. Right. He turned from the tray, lifted the kettle off the hob
and set it sideways on the fire. It sat there, dull and squat, its spout stuck out.</p>
<p> The cat walked stiffly round a leg of the table with tail on high.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Mkgnao!</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, there you are, Mr Bloom said, turning from the fire.</p>
<p> The cat mewed in answer and stalked again stiffly round a leg of the table,
mewing. Mr Bloom watched curiously, kindly the lithe black form. Clean to see:
the gloss of her sleek hide, the white button under the butt of her tail, the
green flashing eyes. He bent down to her, his hands on his knees.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Milk for the pussens, he said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Mrkgnao! the cat cried.</p>
<p> They call them stupid. They understand what we say better than we understand
them. She understands all she wants to.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Afraid of the chickens she is, he said
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">in</span></span> mockingly. Afraid
of the chookchooks. I never saw such a stupid pussens as the pussens.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Mrkrgnao! the cat said loudly.</p>
<p> She blinked up out of her avid eyes, mewing plaintively and long, showing
him her milkwhite teeth. He watched the dark eyeslits narrowing with greed till
her eyes were green stones. Then he went to the dresser, poured milk on a saucer and set it for her
<br><font color="green">{ms, 002}</font>
<br> slowly on the floor.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Gurrhr! she cried, running to lap.</p>
<p> He watched the bristles shining wirily in the weak light. Wonder is it true
if you clip them they can&apos;t mouse after. Why? They shine in the dark,
perhaps, the tips. Or kind of feelers in the dark, perhaps.</p>
<p> He listened to her licking lap. Thursday: good day for a mutton kidney at
Buckley&apos;s. Fried with butter, a shake of pepper. Or better a pork kidney at
Dlugacz&apos;s. While the kettle is boiling. She lapped slower, then licking the
saucer clean. Why are their tongues so rough? To lap better, all porous holes.
Nothing she can eat? He glanced round him. No.</p>
<p> He went up the staircase to the hall, paused by the bedroom door. She might
like something tasty. Thin bread and butter she likes in the morning. Still perhaps: once in a way.</p>
<p> He said softly in the bare hall.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I&apos;m going round the corner. Be back in a minute.</p>
<p> And when he had heard his voice say it he added:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You don&apos;t want anything for breakfast?</p>
<p> A sleepy soft grunt answered:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Mn.</p>
<p> No. She didn&apos;t want anything. He heard then a warm heavy sigh, softer,
as she turned over and the loose brass quoits of the bedstead jingled. Must get
those settled really. Pity. All the way from Gibraltar.
<a name="un3007j" href="../../ff/unbs/un3all.htm#un3007j">Wonder what her father
gave for it.</a> Old style. Ah
yes<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span>! of course.
Bought it at the governor&apos;s auction. Got a short knock. Hard as nails at a
bargain, old Tweedy. Yes, sir.
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext"><font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">erased</span></font></span></span>
<font color="black">At Plevna that
was.</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font> I rose from the
ranks, sir, and I&apos;m proud of it. Still he had brains enough to make that
corner in stamps. Now that was farseeing.</p>
<p> His hand took his hat from the peg. Stamps: stickyback pictures. Daresay
lots of officers are in the swim too. Course they do. The sweated legend in the
crown of his hat told him mutely: Plasto&apos;s high grade ha. He peeped quickly
inside the leather headband. White slip of paper. Quite safe.</p>
<p> On the doorstep he felt in his hip pocket for the latchkey. Not there. In
the trousers I left off. Creaky wardrobe. No use disturbing her. She turned over
sleepily that time. He pulled the halldoor to after him very quietly,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 003}</font>
<br> more, till the footleaf dropped gently over the threshold, a limp lid.
Looked shut. All right till I come back anyhow.</p>
<p> He crossed to the bright side. The sun was nearing the steeple of
George&apos;s church. Be a warm day I fancy. Specially in these black clothes
feel it more. Black conducts, reflects, (refracts is it?) the heat. His eyelids
sank quietly often as he walked in happy warmth. Makes you feel young. Somewhere
in the east; early morning: set off at dawn. Walk along a strand, strange land,
come to a city gate, sentry there, old ranker too, old Tweedy&apos;s big
moustaches, leaning on a long kind of a spear. Wander through awned streets.
Turbaned faces going by. Dark caves of
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><font color="black">carpet</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>
shops, big man, Turk, seated crosslegged smoking a coiled pipe. Cries of sellers
in the streets. Drink water scented with fennel, sherbet. Dander along all day.
Getting on to sundown. The shadows of the mosques among the pillars:
<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">erased</span></font>
priest with a scroll rolled up. A shiver of the trees, signal, the evening wind.
I pass on. Fading gold sky. A mother watches me from her doorway. She calls her
children home in their dark language. High wall: beyond strings twanged. Night
sky, moon, violet, colour of

garters. Strings. Listen. A girl playing one of those instruments what do you call them: dulcimers. I pass.</p>
<p> Probably not a bit like it really. Kind of stuff you read: in the track of
the sun. Sunburst on the titlepage. He smiled, pleasing himself. What Arthur
Griffith said about the headpiece over the <u>Freeman</u> leader: a homerule sun
rising up in the northwest from the laneway behind the bank of Ireland. He
prolonged his pleased smile. Ikey touch that: homerule sun rising up in the northwest.</p>
<p> He approached Larry O&apos;Rourke&apos;s. From the cellar grating floated up
the flabby gush of porter. Through the open doorway the bar squirted out
<br><font color="green">{ms, 004}</font>
<br> whiffs of ginger, teadust, biscuit mush. Good house, however: just the end
of the city traffic. For instance M&apos;Auley&apos;s down there: n.g. as
position. Of course if they ran a tramline along the North Circular from the
cattle market to the quays value would go up like a shot.</p>
<p> Baldhead over the blind. Cute old codger. No use canvassing him for an ad.
Still he knew his own business best. There he is, sure enough, my bold Larry,
leaning against the sugarbin in his shirtsleeves watched the aproned curate
swabbing up with mop and bucket. Simon Dedalus takes him off to a tea, with his
eyes screwed up. Do you know what I&apos;m going to tell you? What&apos;s that,
Mr O&apos;Rourke? Do you know what? The Russians, they are only an eight o&apos;clock breakfast for the Japanese.</p>
<p> Stop and say a word: about the funeral perhaps. Sad thing about poor Dignam, Mr O&apos;Rourke.</p>
<p> Turning into Dorset Street he said freshly in greeting through the doorway:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Good day, Mr O&apos;Rourke.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Good day to you.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Lovely weather, sir.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; &apos;Tis all that.</p>
<p> Where do they get the money? Coming up redheaded curates from the county
Leitrim, rising empties in the cellar. Then, lo and behold, they blossom out as
publicans. Save it they can&apos;t. Off the drunks perhaps. What is that, a bob
here and there, dribs and drabs. On the wholesale orders perhaps. Doing a double
shuffle with the town travellers. Square it you with the boss and we&apos;ll
split the job,
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext"><font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">erased</span></font></span></span>
see?</p>
<p> How much would that tot to off the porter in the month? Say ten barrels of
stuff. Say he got ten per cent off. O more. Fifteen.</p>
<p> He halted before Dlugacz&apos;s window, staring at the hanks of sausages,
polonies, black and white. Fifteen multiplied by. The figures whitened in his
mind unsolved: displeased, he let them fade. The shiny links,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 005}</font>
<br> packed with forcemeat, fed his gaze and he breathed in tranquilly the
lukewarm breath of cooked spicy pigs&apos; blood.</p>
<p> A kidney oozed bloodgouts on the willow patterned dish: the last. He stood
near the nextdoor servant at the counter. Would she buy it too, calling the
items from a slip in her chapped
hand<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">:washingsoda</span></span><font color="black">?
Washingsoda</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>. And a

<p> The ferreteyed porkbutcher folded the sausages he had snipped off with blotchy fingers, sausagepink.</p>
<p> Sound meat there: like a stallfed heifer. He took a page up from the pile of
cut sheets: the model farm at Kinnereth on the lakeshore of Tiberias. I thought
he was. Farmhouse, wall round it, blurred cattle cropping. He held the page from
him<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span>: interesting:
read it nearer, the title, the blurred cropping cattle, the page rustling. A
young white heifer. Those mornings in the cattle market, the beasts lowing in
their pens, flop and fall of dung, the breeders in hobnailed boots trudging
through the litter, slapping a palm on a meaty hindquarter, there&apos;s a prime
one, unpeeled switches in their hands. He held the page aslant patiently,
bending his senses and his will, his soft

<p> The porkbutcher snapped two sheets from the pile, wrapped up her sausages and made a red grimace.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Now, my miss, he said.</p>
<p> She tendered a coin, smiling boldly, holding her thick wrist out.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Thank you, my miss. And one shilling threepence change. For you, please?</p>
<p> Mr Bloom pointed quickly. To catch up and walk behind her if she went
slowly, behind her moving hams. Hurry up, damn it. She stood outside the shop in
sunlight and turned lazily to the right. He sighed
<br><font color="green">{ms, 006}</font>
<br> down his nose: they never understand. Sodachapped hands. Crusted toenails
too. Brown scapulars in tatters, defending her both ways. The sting of disregard
glowed to weak pleasure within his breast. For another: a constable off duty cuddling her in Eccles&apos; Lane.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Threepence, please.</p>
<p> His hand accepted the moist tender gland and slid it into a sidepocket. Then
it fetched up three coins from his trousers&apos; pocket and laid them on the
rubber prickles. They lay, were read quickly and quickly slid, disc by disc, into the till.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Thank you, sir. Another time.</p>
<p> A speck of eager fire from foxeyes thanked him. He withdrew his gaze after
an instant. No: better not: another time.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Good morning, he said, moving away.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Good morning, sir.</p>
<p> No sign. Gone. What matter?</p>
<p> He walked back along Dorset Street, reading gravely. Agendath Netaim:
planters&apos; company. You pay eighty marks and they plant a dunam of land for
you with olives, oranges, almonds or citrons. Olives cheaper: oranges need
artificial irrigation. Every year you get a sending of the crop. Your name
entered for life as owner in the book of the union. Can pay ten down and the
balance in yearly instalments. Bleibtreustrasse 34, Berlin, W, 15.</p>
<p> Nothing doing. Still
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><font color="black">an</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>
idea behind it.</p>
<p> He looked at the cattle, blurred in silver heat. Silverpowdered olivetrees.
Quiet long days: pruning, ripening. Olives are packed in jars, eh? I have a few
left from Andrews. Mollie spitting them out. Knows the taste of them now.
Oranges in tissue paper packed in crates. Citrons too. Wonder is poor Citron
still in saint Kevin&apos;s parade. And Mastiansky with the old cither. Pleasant
evenings we had then. Mollie in Citron&apos;s basket chair. Nice to hold, cool
waxen fruit, hold in the hand, lift it to the nostrils and smell the perfume.
Like that, heavy, sweet, wild perfume. Always the same, year after year. They fetched high prices too,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 007}</font>
<br> Moisel told me. Arbutus Place: Pleasants Street: pleasant old times. Must
be without a flaw, he said. Coming all that way: Spain, Gibraltar,
Mediterranean, the Levant. Crates lined up on the quayside at Jaffa, chap
ticking them off in a book, navvies handling them barefoot in soiled dungarees.</p>
<p> A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly. Grey. Far.</p>
<p> No, not like that. A barren land, bare waste. Vulcanic lake, the dead sea:
no fish, weedless, sunk deep in the earth. No wind could lift those waves, grey
metal, poisonous foggy waters. Brimstone they called it raining down: the cities
of the plain: Sodom, Gomorrah, Edom. All dead names. A dead sea in a dead land,
grey and old. Old now. It bore the oldest, the first race. A bent hag crossed
from Cassidy&apos;s clutching a naggin bottle by the neck. The oldest people.
Wandered far away over all the earth, multiplying, dying, being born everywhere.
It lay there now. Now it could bear no more. Dead: an old woman&apos;s: the grey sunken cunt of the world.</p>
<p> Desolation.</p>
<p> Grey horror seared his flesh. Folding the page into his pocket he turned
into Eccles Street, hurrying homeward. Cold oils slid along his veins, chilling
his blood: age crusting him with a salt cloak. Well, I am here now. Yes, I am
here now. Blotchy brown brick houses. Number seven still unlet. Why is that?
Valuation is only twentyeight.<a target="foot" id="fdz0001">&ordm;</a> Towers,
Battersby, North, MacArthur: parlour windows plastered with bills. Plasters on a
sore eye. To smell the gentle smoke of tea, fume of the pan, sizzling butter. Be
near her ample bedwarmed flesh. Yes, yes.</p>
<p> Quick warm sunlight came running from Berkeley Road, swiftly, in slim
sandals, along the brightening footpath. Runs, she runs to meet me, a girl with gold hair on the wind.</p>
<p> Two letters and a card lay on the hallfloor. He stooped and
<br><font color="green">{ms, 008}</font>
<br> gathered them. Mrs Marion Bloom. His quickened heart slowed at once. Bold
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext"><font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">erased</span></font></span></span>
<font color="black">hand</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>. Mrs Marion&nbsp;&hellip;.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Poldy! -</p>
<p> Entering the bedroom he halfclosed his eyes and walked through warm yellow twilight towards her tousled head.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Who are the letters for?</p>
<p> He looked at them. Mullingar. Milly</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A letter for me from
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Millie</span></span>
<font color="black">Milly</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>,

<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext"><font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">erased</span></font></span></span>
<font color="black">to</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font> you. And a letter for you.</p>
<p> He laid her card and letter on the twill bedspread near the curve of her knees.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do you want the blind up?</p>
<p> Letting the blind up by gentle tugs halfway his backward eye saw her glance
at the letter and tuck it under her pillow</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That do? he asked, turning.</p>
<p> She was reading the card, propped on her elbow.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; She got the things, she said</p>
<p> He waited till she had laid the card aside and curled herself back slowly with a snug sigh.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Hurry up with that tea, she said. I&apos;m parched.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The kettle is boiling, he said.</p>
<p> But he delayed to clear the chair: her striped petticoat, tossed soiled
linen: and lifted all in an armful on to the foot of the bed.</p>
<p> As he went down the kitchen stairs she called:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Poldy!</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Scald the teapot.</p>
<p> Boiling sure enough: a plume of steam from the spout. He scalded and rinsed
out the teapot and put in four full spoons of tea, tilting the kettle then to
let the water flow in. Having set it to draw he took off the kettle and crushed
the pan flat on the live coals and watched the lump of butter slide and melt.
While he unwrapped the kidney the cat mewed hungrily against. He let the
bloodsmeared paper fall to her and dropped the kidney amid
<br><font color="green">{ms, 009}</font>
<br> the sizzling butter sauce. Pepper. He sprinkled it ringwise through his fingers from the chipped eggcup.</p>
<p> Then he

open his letter, glancing down the page and over. Thanks: new Tam: Mr Coghlan:
lough Owel picnic: young student: Blazes Boylan&apos;s seaside girls.</p>
<p> The tea was drawn. He filled his own moustache cup, sham crown Derby,
smiling. Silly

<font color="black">Milly&apos;s</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>
birthday gift. Only ten she was then. No, wait: eight. I gave her the necklace she broke. He smiled, pouring:</p>
<p class="set"><u>O,</u> <u>Milly</u> <u>Bloom,</u> <u>you</u> <u>are</u> <u>my</u> <u>darling.</u>
<br> <u>You</u> <u>are</u> <u>my</u> <u>lookingglass</u> <u>from</u> <u>night</u> <u>to</u> <u>morning.</u>
<br> <u>I&apos;d</u> <u>rather</u> <u>have</u> <u>you</u> <u>without</u> <u>a</u> <u>farthing</u>
<br> <u>Than</u> <u>Katey</u> <u>Keogh</u> <u>with</u> <u>her</u> <u>ass</u> <u>and</u> <u>garden.</u></p>
<p> Poor old professor Goodwin. Dreadful old case. Still he was a courteous old
chap. Oldfashioned way he used to bow Molly off the platform. And the little
mirror in his silk hat. The night Milly brought it into the parlour. O, look
what I found in professor Goodwin&apos;s hat! All we laughed. Pert little piece she was.</p>
<p> He prodded a fork into the kidney and slapped it over: then fitted the
teapot on the tray. Its hump bumped as he took it up. Everything on it? Bread
and butter, four, sugar, spoon, her cream. Yes. He carried it upstairs, his thumb hooked in the teapot handle.</p>
<p> Nudging the door open with his knee he carried the
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">c</span></span> tray in and set it on the chair by the bedhead.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What a time you were! she said.</p>
<p> She set the brasses jingling as she raised herself briskly, an elbow on the
pillow. He looked calmly down on her bulk and between her large soft bubs,
sloping within her nightdress like a shegoat&apos;s udder. The warmth of her
couched body rose on the air, mingling with the fragrance of the tea she poured.</p>
<p> A strip of torn envelope peeped from under the dimpled pillow. In the act of
going he stayed to straighten the bedspread.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Who
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">is</span></span>
<font color="black">was</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font> the letter from? he asked.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 010}</font> </p>
<p> Bold hand. Marion.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, Boylan, she said. He&apos;s bringing the programme.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What are you singing?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>L&agrave;</u> <u>ci</u> <u>darem</u> with J.C. Doyle,
she said, and <u>Love&apos;s</u> <u>Old</u> <u>Sweet</u> <u>Song</u>.</p>
<p> Her full lips, drinking, smiled. Rather stale smell that incense leaves next day.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Would you like the window open a little?</p>
<p> She doubled a slice of bread into her mouth, asking:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What time is the funeral?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Eleven, I think, he answered. I didn&apos;t see the paper.</p>
<p> Following the pointing of her finger he took up a leg of her soiled drawers
from the bed. No. Then, a twisted grey garter looped round a stocking: rumpled, shiny sole.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No: that book.</p>
<p> Other stocking. Her petticoat.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It must have fell down, she said.</p>
<p> He felt here and there. <u>Voglio</u> <u>e</u> <u>non</u> <u>vorrei.</u>
Wonder if she pronounces that right: <u>voglio</u>. Not in the bed. Must have
slid down. He stooped and lifted the valance.

sprawled against the bulge of the orangekeyed chamberpot.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Show here, she said. I put a mark in it. There&apos;s a word I wanted to ask you.</p>
<p> She swallowed a draught of tea and, having wiped her fingertips smartly on
the blanket, began to search the text with the hairpin till she reached the word.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Met him what? he asked</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Here, she said. What does that mean?</p>
<p> He leaned downward and read near her polished thumbnail.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Metempsychosis?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes. What&apos;s that?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Metempsychosis, he said, frowning. It&apos;s Greek; from
the Greek. That means the transmigration of souls.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, rocks! she said. Tell us in plain words.</p>
<p> He smiled, glancing askance at her mocking eyes. Young still. The same young
eyes. The first night after the charades at Dolphin&apos;s Barn. He turned over
the smudged pages. <u>Ruby:</u> a tale of circus life. That we live after death. Our souls. That a man&apos;s soul
<br><font color="green">{ms, 011}</font>
<br> after he dies, Dignam&apos;s soul&nbsp;&hellip;.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Did you finish it? he asked</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, she said. There&apos;s nothing smutty in it. Is she
in love with the first fellow all the time?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Never read it. Do you want another?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes. Get another of Paul de Kock&apos;s. Nice name he has.</p>
<p> She poured more tea into her cup, watching it flow sideways.</p>
<p> Reincarnation: that&apos;s the word.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Some people believe, he said, that we go on living in
another body after death, that we lived before. They call it reincarnation. That
we all lived before on the earth thousands of years ago or some other planet.
They say we have forgotten it. Some say they remember their past lives.</p>
<p> The sluggish cream wound curdling spirals through her tea. Better remind her
of the word: metempsychosis. An example would be better. An example?</p>
<p> <u>The</u> <u>Bath</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>Nymph</u> over the bed. Given
away with the easter number of <u>Photo</u> <u>Bits</u>: splendid masterpiece in
art colours. Tea before you put milk in. Not unlike her with her hair down:
slimmer. Three and six I gave for the frame. She said it would look nice over
the bed. Naked nymphs: Greece: and for instance all the people that lived then.</p>
<p> He turned the pages back.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Metempsychosis, he said, is what the ancient Greeks
called it. They used to believe you could be changed into an animal or a tree,
for instance. What they called nymphs for example.</p>
<p> Her spoon ceased to stir up the sugar. She gazed straight before her, inhaling through her arched nostrils.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; There&apos;s a smell of burn, she said. Did you leave anything on the fire?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The kidney! he cried suddenly.</p>
<p> He fitted the book roughly into his inner pocket and hurried out towards the
smell, stepping hastily down the stairs with a flurried

legs. Pungent smoke shot up in an angry jet from a
<br><font color="green">{ms, 012}</font>
<br> side of the pan. By prodding a prong of the fork under the kidney he
detached it and turned it over on its back. Only a little burnt. He tossed it
off the pan on to a plate and let the scanty brown gravy trickle over it.</p>
<p> Cup of tea now. He sat down, cut and buttered a slice of the loaf. He shore
away the burnt flesh and flung it to the cat. Then he put a forkful into his
mouth, chewing with discernment the toothsome pliant meat. Done to a turn. A
mouthful of tea. Then he cut many dies of bread, sopped one in the gravy and put
it in his mouth. What was that about some young student and a picnic? He creased
out the letter at his side, reading it slowly as he chewed, sopping another die
of bread in the gravy and raising it to his mouth.</p>
<p> Dearest Papli</p>
<p> Thanks ever so much for the lovely birthday present. It suits me splendid.
Everyone says I am quite the belle in my new tam. I got mummy&apos;s lovely box
of creams and am writing. They are lovely. I am getting on swimming in the photo
business now. Mrs Coghlan took one of me and Mrs. Will send when developed. We
did great biz yesterday. Fair day and all the beef to the heels were in. We are
going to lough Owel on Monday with a few friends to make a scrap picnic. Give my
love to mummy and to yourself a big kiss and thanks. I hear them at the piano
downstairs. There is to be concert in
<a name="un1023e" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1023e">the Greville Arms</a>
on Saturday. There is a young student
<font color="red"><sup><small>|2</small></sup></font><font color="black">comes</font><font color="red"><sup><small>2|</small></sup></font>
here some evenings named Bannon his cousins or something are big swells and he
sings Boylan&apos;s (I was on the pop of writing Blazes
<br><font color="green">{ms, 013}</font>
<br> Boylan&apos;s) song about those seaside girls. Tell him silly Milly sends
my best respects. Byebye again and lots of love</p>
<p class="center">Your fond daughter
<br> Milly</p>
<p class="pStDir">P.S. Excuse bad writing am in hurry.</p>
<p> Fifteen yesterday. Curious, fifteenth of the month too. Her first birthday
away from home. Separation. Remember the morning she was born, running to knock
up Mrs Thornton in Denzille Street. Jolly old woman. Lot of babies she must have
helped into the world. She knew from the first poor little Rudy wouldn&apos;t
live. Well, God is good, sir. She knew at once. He would be twelve now if he had lived.</p>
<p> His vacant face stared pityingly at the postscript. Excuse bad writing.
Hurry. Piano downstairs. He sopped other dies of bread in the gravy and ate
piece after piece of kidney. Twelve and six a week. Not much. Still, she might
do worse. Musichall stage. Young student. He drank a draught of cold tea to wash
down his meal. Then he read the letter again: twice.</p>
<p> O, well: she knows how to mind herself. But if not? No, nothing had
happened. Of course it might. Wait in any case till it did. A wild piece of
goods. Her slim legs running up the staircase. Destiny. Ripening now. Vain: very.</p>
<p> He smiled with troubled affection at the kitchen window. Day I caught her in
the street pinching her cheeks to make them red. On the <u>Erin&apos;s</u>
<u>King</u> that day round the Kish. Damned old tub pitching about. Not a bit
funky. Her pale blue scarf loose in the wind with her hair.</p>
<p class="set"><u>All</u> <u>dimpled</u> <u>cheeks</u> <u>and</u> <u>curls</u>
<br> <u>Your</u> <u>head</u> <u>it</u> <u>simply</u> <u>swirls</u></p>
<p class="flush">Seaside girls. Torn envelope. Hands stuck in his trousers&apos;
pockets, singing. <u>Swurls</u>, he says. Pier
<br><font color="green">{ms, 014}</font>
<br> with lamps, summer evening, band.</p>
<p class="set"><u>Those</u> <u>girls,</u> <u>those</u> <u>girls,</u>
<br> <u>Those</u> <u>lovely</u> <u>seaside</u> <u>girls</u></p>
<p> Milly too. Young kisses: the first. Far away now past. Mrs Marion. Reading,
lying back now, counting the strands of her hair.</p>
<p> A soft qualm, regret, flowed down his backbone, increasing. Will happen,
yes. Prevent. Useless: can&apos;t move. Girl&apos;s sweet light lips. Will
happen too. He felt the flowing qualm spread over him. Useless to move now. Lips
kissed, kissing, kissed. Full gluey woman&apos;s lips.</p>
<p> Better where she is down there: away. Might take a trip down there. August
bank holiday, only five and six return. Six
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">y</span></span> weeks off,
however. Might work a press pass. Or through M<sup><small>c</small></SUP>Coy.</p>
<p> <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">He felt full and heavy: wind then a gentle loosenin</span></span></p>
<p> The cat, having cleaned all her fur, returned to the meatstained paper,
nosed at it and stalked to the door. She looked back at him, mewing. Wants to go out. Let her wait.</p>
<p> He felt full,
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">heavin</span></span> heavy: then a
gentle loosening of his bowels. He stood up, undoing the waistband of his trousers. The cat mewed to him.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Miaow! he said in answer. Wait till I&apos;m ready.</p>
<p> Heaviness: hot day coming. Too much trouble to fag up the stairs to the landing.</p>
<p> A paper. He liked to read at stool.</p>
<p> In the tabledrawer he found an old number of <u>Titbits</u>. He folded it
under his armpit, went to the door and opened it. The cat went up in soft
bounds. Ah, wanted to go upstairs, curl up in a ball on the bed.</p>
<p> Listening, he heard her voice:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Come, come, pussy. Come.</p>
<p> He went out through the backdoor into the garden: stood
<br><font color="green">{ms, 015}</font>
<br> to listen towards the next garden. No sound. Perhaps hanging clothes out to dry. Fine morning.</p>
<p> He bent down to regard a lean file of spearmint growing by the wall. Want to
manure the whole place over, scabby soil. A coat of liver of sulphur. All soil
like that without dung. Loam, what is this that is? The hens in the next garden:
their droppings are very good I heard. Best of all though are the cattle,
specially when they are fed on those oilcakes. Mulch of dung. Reclaim the whole
place. Grow peas in that corner there. Lettuce. Always have fresh greens then.</p>
<p> He walked on. Where is my hat, by the way? Must have put it back on the peg.
Funny I don&apos;t remember that. Picking up the letters. Drago&apos;s

ringing. Queer I was just thinking that moment. Black
<a name="s19001o" href="../../ff/unbs/s19all.htm#s19001o">brillantined</a> hair
over his collar. Just had a wash and brush up. Wonder have I time for a bath this morning.</p>
<p> Deep voice that fellow Dlugacz has. Agendath what is it? Now, my miss. Enthusiast.</p>
<p> He kicked open the door of the
<a name="un1032ca" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1032ca">jakes</a>. Better be
careful not to get these trousers dirty for the funeral. He went in, bowing his
head under the low lintel. Leaving the door ajar, amid the stench of mouldy
limewash and stale cobwebs he undid his braces. Before sitting down he peered
through a chink up at the nextdoor windows. Nobody.</p>
<p> Asquat on the
<a name="un1032ai" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1032ai">cuckstool</a> he
folded out his paper, turning its pages over on his bared knees. Something new
and easy. Our prize titbit: <u>Matcham&apos;s</u> <u>Masterstroke.</u> Written
by Mr Philip Beaufoy, Playgoers&apos; Club, London. Payment at the rate of one
guinea a column has been made to the writer. Three and a half. Three pounds
three. Three pounds, thirteen and
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext"><font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">unread</span></font></span></span>
six.</p>
<p> He allowed his bowels to ease
<br><font color="green">{ms, 016}</font>
<br> themselves quietly as he read, reading patiently. Life might be so. It did
not move or touch him but it was something quick and neat. He read on. Neat
certainly. Matcham often thinks of the masterstroke by which he won the laughing
witch who now. Hand in hand. Smart. He glanced back through what he had read and
envied kindly Mr Beaufoy who had written it and received payment of three pounds, thirteen and six.</p>
<p> Might manage a sketch. Time I used to try jotting down on my cuff what she
said dressing. Biting her nether lip hooking the placket of her skirt. Timing
her. 9.15. Did Roberts pay you yet? 9.20. What had Gretta Conroy on? 9.23. What
possessed me to buy this comb? 9.24. I&apos;m swelled after that cabbage. A
speck of dust on the patent leather of her boot: rubbing smartly in turn each
welt against her stockinged calf. Morning after the bazaar dance when May&apos;s
band played Ponchielli&apos;s dance of the hours. Explain
<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">erased</span></font>
that: morning hours, noon, then evening coming on, then night hours. Washing her
teeth. That was the first night. Is that Boylan well off? He has money. Why? I
noticed he had a good rich smell off his breath dancing. No use humming then.
Allude to it. Strange kind of music that last night. The mirror was in shadow.
She rubbed her handglass briskly on her woollen vest against her full wagging
bub. Peering into it. Lines in her eyes. It wouldn&apos;t pan out somehow.</p>
<p> Evening hours, girls in grey gauze. Night hours then: black with daggers and
eyemasks. Poetical idea: pink, then golden, then grey, then black. Still, true to life also. Day: then the night.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 017}</font> </p>
<p> He tore away half the prize story sharply and wiped himself with it. Then he
girded up his trousers, braced and buttoned himself. He pulled back the shaky
door of the jakes and came forth from the gloom into the air.</p>
<p> In the bright light he eyed carefully his black trousers, the ends, the
knees, the houghs of the knees. What time is the funeral? Better find out in the paper.</p>
<p> A creak and a dark whirr in the air high up. The bells of George&apos;s
church. They tolled the hour: loud dark iron.</p>
<p class="set"><u>Heigho!</u> <u>Heigho!</u>
<br> <u>Heigho!</u> <u>Heigho!</u>
<br> <u>Heigho!</u> <u>Heigho!</u></p>
<p> Quarter to. There again: the overtone following through the air. A third.</p>
