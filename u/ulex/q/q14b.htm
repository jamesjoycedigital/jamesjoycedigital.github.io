<p class="pStDir">(The Mabbot street entrance of nighttown, before which
stretches an uncobbled tramsiding set with skeleton tracks, red and green
will-o&apos;-the wisps and danger signals. Rows of grimy houses with gaping
doors. Rare lamps with faint rainbow fans. Round a halted ice gondola stunted
men and women squabble. They grab wafers between which are wedged lumps of coral
and copper snow. Sucking, they scatter slowly, children. The swancomb of the
gondola, highreared, forges on through the murk, white and blue under a lighthouse. Whistles call and answer.</p>

slung between two railings, counting. A form sprawled against a dustbin and
muffled by its arm and hat snores. On a step a gnome totting among rubbish
crouches to shoulder a sack of rags and bones. A crone standing by with a smoky
oillamp rams her last bottle in the maw of his sack. He heaves his booty, tugs
askew his peaked cap and hobbles off mutely. The crone makes back for her lair,
swaying her lamp. A bandy child, asquat on the doorstep with a paper
shuttlecock, crawls sidling after her in spurts, clutches her skirt, scrambles
up. A drunken navvy grips with both hands the railings

<br> of an area, lurching heavily. At a corner two night watch in shoulder
capes, their hands upon their staff holsters, loom tall. A plate crashes: a
woman screams: a child wails. Oaths of a man roar, mutter, cease. Figures
wander, lurk, peer from warrens. In a room lit by a candle stuck in a bottleneck

clasping, climbs in spasms. From the top spur he slides down. Jacky Caffrey
clasps to climb. The navvy lurches against the lamp. The twins scuttle off in

me a hand a second, sergeant&nbsp;&hellip;.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>First Watch</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">Name and address.</p>
<p class="pStDir">(Corny Kelleher, weepers round his hat, appears among the bystanders)</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Bloom</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">(quickly) O, the very man. (he whispers) Simon Dedalus&apos;
son. A bit sprung. Get those policemen to move those loafers back.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Second Watch</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">Night, Mr Kelleher.</p>

<p class="pSpeech">(to the watch, with drawling eye) That&apos;s all right. I
know him. Won a bit on the races. Gold cup. Throwaway (he laughs).
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">t</span></span> Twenty to one. Do you follow me?</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>First Watch</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">(turns to the crowd) Here, what are you all gaping at? Move on out of that.</p>
<p class="pStDir">(The crowd disperses slowly, muttering, down the lane)</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Corny Kelleher</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">Leave it to me, sergeant. That&apos;ll be all right (he
laughs, shaking his head) We were often as bad ourselves or worse. What? Eh, what?</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>First Watch</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">(laughs) I suppose so.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Corny Kelleher</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">(nudges the second watch) Come and wipe your name off the slate. What, eh, do you follow me?</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Second Watch</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">(genially) Ah, sure we were too</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Corny Kelleher</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">(winking) Boys will be boys. I&apos;ve a car round there.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Second Watch</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">All right, Mr Kelleher. Good night.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Corny Kelleher</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">I&apos;ll see to that.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Bloom</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">(shakes hands with both of the watch in turns) Thank you very
much. Thank you. (he
<a name="s15045au" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15045au">mumbles</a>
confidentially) We don&apos;t want any scandal, you understand. Father is a
wellknown highly respected citizen. Just a little wild oats, you understand.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>First Watch</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">O. I understand, sir.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Second Watch</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">That&apos;s all right, sir.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>First Watch</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">It was only in case of corporal injuries I&apos;d have to report it at the station.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Bloom</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">(nods rapidly) Naturally. Quite right. Only your duty.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Second Watch</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">It&apos;s our duty.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 83}</font> </p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Corny Kelleher</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">Good night, men.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>The Watch</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">(saluting together) Night, gentlemen.</p>
<p class="pStDir">(They move off
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">)</span></span> with slow heavy tread)</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Bloom</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">(blows) Providential you came on the scene. You have a car&nbsp;&hellip;?</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Corny Kelleher</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">laughs, pointing his thumb over his right shoulder) Two
commercials that were standing fizz in Jammets. Like princes, faith. One of them
lost two quid on the race. Drowning his grief. And were on for a time with the
girls. So I landed them up on Brophy&apos;s car and down to nighttown.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Bloom</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">I was just going home by Gardiner street when I happened to&nbsp;&hellip;.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Corny Kelleher</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">(laughs) Sure they wanted me to join in with the mots. No, by
God, says I, my dancing days are done. Not for old stagers like myself and
yourself (he laughs again and leers with lacklustre eye) Thanks be to God we
have it in the house, what, eh, do you follow me? Hah,
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Hah</span></span> hah, hah!</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Bloom</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">(laughs) Ha, he, he! Yes. Matter of fact I was just visiting
an old friend of mine there, Virag, you don&apos;t know him (poor fellow,
he&apos;s laid up for the past week) and we had a liquour together and I was
just making my way home&nbsp;&hellip;...</p>
<p class="pStDir">(The horse <a name="s15014af" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15014af">neighs</a>)</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>The Horse</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">Hohohohohohoh! Hohohohome!</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Corny Kelleher</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">Sure it was Brophy the jarvey there that told me after we
left the two commercials in Mrs Cohen&apos;s and I got off to see. Will I give
him a lift home. Where does he live. Somewhere in Cabra, what?
<br><font color="green">{ms, 84}</font> </p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Bloom</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">No, in Sandycove, I believe, from what he let drop.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Corny Kelleher</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">(scratches his nape) Sandycove! (he bends down and calls to
Stephen) Eh! (he calls again) Eh! He&apos;s covered with shavings anyhow. Take
care they didn&apos;t lift anything off him.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Bloom</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">No, no, no. I have his money and his hat here and stick.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Corny Kelleher</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">Ah, well, he&apos;ll get over it. No bones broken. Well,
I&apos;ll get along. (he laughs) I&apos;ve a rendezvous in the morning. Burying the dead. Safe home!</p>

<p class="pSpeech">Good night. I&apos;ll just wait and take him along in a few&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="pStDir">(Corny Kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it. The horseharness jingles.)</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Corny Kelleher</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">(from the car) Night</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Bloom</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">Night.</p>
<p class="pStDir">(The carman chucks the reins and raises his whip
encouragingly. Corny Kelleher on the sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign
of mirth. The jarvey joins in the mute merriment nodding from the farther seat.
Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply. With thumb and palm Corny Kelleher
reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue. With a slow nod
Bloom conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs. The car
jingles round the corner of the lane. Corny Kelleher again reassures with his
hand. Bloom with his hand assures Corny Kelleher that he is reassured. The
tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter. Bloom, holding in his hand
Stephen&apos;s muddied hat and ashplant, stands irresolute. Then he bends
<br><font color="green">{ms, 85}</font>
<br> to him and shakes him by the shoulder.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Bloom</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">Eh! Ho! (There is no answer. He bends again) Mr Dedalus!
(There is no answer) The name if you call.
Sonambulist<a target="foot" id="fqz0303">&ordm;</a>. (He bends again and,
hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate form) Stephen!
(There is no answer. He calls again) Stephen!</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Stephen</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">(frowns) Who? Black panther, (he sighs and stretches himself,
then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels)
<br> Who drive Fergus now
<br> And pierce wood&apos;s woven shade..?</p>
<p class="pStDir">(He turns on his left side, sighing, doubling himself together)</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Bloom</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">Poetry. Well educated. Pity (He bends again and undoes the
buttons of Stephen&apos;s waistcoat) To breathe. (he brushes the woodshavings
from Stephen&apos;s clothes with light hand and fingers) One pound seven. Not hurt anyhow (he listens) What?</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Stephen</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">(murmurs) Shadows the woods
<br> White breast dim sea.</p>
<p class="pStDir">(He stretches out his arms, sighs again and curls his body.
Bloom, holding the muddied hat and ashplant, stands erect. A dog barks in the
distance. Bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant. He looks down on Stephen&apos;s face and form)</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Bloom</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">Face reminds of his poor mother. In the shady wood. The deep
white breast. Ferguson, I think I caught. A girl. Some girl. Best thing could happen him.</p>
<p class="pStDir">(Silent, thoughtful, alert he stands on guard. Against the
dark wall a figure appears
slowly<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span>, a boy of
eleven in an Eton suit, holding a book in his hand. He reads inaudibly, smiling.)</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Bloom</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">(wonderstruck, calls inaudibly)</p>
<p class="pchar"><u><a name="s15000bg" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15000bg">Rudy</a></u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">(gazes, unseeing, in to Bloom&apos;s eyes and goes on
reading, smiling. He has diamond buttons. A squirrel peeps out of his waistcoat pocket.)
