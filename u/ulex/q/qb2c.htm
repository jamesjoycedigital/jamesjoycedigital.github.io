<p class="flush">Well, ladies &amp; gentlemen &amp; toastmaster general, your health &amp; song &amp; <a name="n17090f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n17all.htm#n17090f">Erin go dry</a>! To stir up love and fizz I lift this bridle&apos;s cup of her champagne dimmydouce, tightfit for my snowybreasted, and while my pearlies in their sparkling wisdom are nippling its
<a name="n08070c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08070c">bubblets</a> I swear and let you swear, by the round of our dear old Snaggletooth&apos;s solidbowl, I never will prove I&apos;m untrue to your liking (swear!) so long as my hole looks down. That&apos;s that.</p>
<p> So I&apos;m not forgetting <a name="n17012a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n17all.htm#n17012a">my inner man</a> for I&apos;m leaving my darling proxy behind for you, Dave the Dancer, a squamous runaway and a dear old pal of mine too! for He&apos;s the mightiest penumbrella I ever <a name="n10140d" href="../../ff/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10140d">flourished</a> beyond the shadow of a post! Be sure and link him,
my treasure, as often as you learn so long as there&apos;s nothing between you but the plain deal Manilla table only don&apos;t encourage him to cry lessontimes over Leperstown. Talk of wolf in a stomach, by all that&apos;s verminous! I knew I smelt the <a name="n18100g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n18all.htm#n18100g">garlic league</a>. Why, <a name="n10103a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10103a">bless
me</a> quick Here he is darling Dave just in time as if he fell out of space, all draped in mufti, coming back from his continence, after a bad passage by the 11.32, with the pork&apos;s pate in his paw and the gulls laughing lime on his natural skunk, blushing like <a name="sa0741e" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0741e">Pat&apos;s</a> pig, begob! He&apos;s not ashamed to carry out
<a name="n17022e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n17all.htm#n17022e">the testimonicals he got</a> in Paddyouare as a Home cured emigrant for all to see. Bearer may leave the church, signed, Figura Porca. He&apos;s the sneaking likeness of me, faith, and every biter&apos;s bit as nasal a romeo as I am, for ever cracking quips on himself<a target="foot" id="fqz0014">&ordm;</a> that merry, the jeenjakes,
he&apos;d soon arise mother&apos;s roses with bedewing tears onto anny living girl&apos;s laftercheeks. He&apos;s a jarry queer fish betimes, I grant, but, lice and all and <a name="n17015b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n17all.htm#n17015b">semicoloured</a> and stainedglasses, I&apos;m enormously fond of that foreigner, I&apos;ll say I am. We&apos;re as thick and thin now as two tubular jawballs.
<a name="n12024a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n12all.htm#n12024a">I hate him about heresy</a>. But I love him. I love his portugal&apos;s nose. Isn&apos;t he after touching every distinguished Irishman he could ever distinguish from a Yourishman for the half of a crown and peace? <a name="n17105c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n17all.htm#n17105c">Bravo, chief!</a> Sure there&apos;s nobody else to touch the darling
at all <a name="n17033f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n17all.htm#n17033f">for sheer dare</a> with that potful of Spanish breens on him! A sollytan fine cemented brick! Dave knows I have the highest respect of anyone in my own smooth way for David Crozier. The most important man! Ho, by the holy, someone has shaved his rough diamond skull for him as clean as Nuntius&apos; piedish! He&apos;s the spatton
spit, so he is, of the old crusader, <a name="n17152c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n17all.htm#n17152c">Shemuel Tulliver</a>! Hold hard till you hear him clicking his bull&apos;s bones. You&apos;re welcome back, Wilkins! to red berries in the frost. Give us your dyed hand here, frater!! I&apos;m better pleased than &pound;10. Faith, I&apos;m proud
<br><font color="green">{ms, 123v}</font>
<br> of you, french davit! You&apos;ve surpassed yourself! This is my aunt Julia Bride out of the <a name="sa0301av" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0301av">Babes in the Wood</a> dying to have you languish to scandal in her bosky old manor. languishtoscandal boskgold<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps"><sub>unread</sub></span></font> You haven&apos;t seen her since she went
into boy&apos;s smallclothes. Embrace her out of pure luck before she goes off in pure love. I&apos;d give 3/- to the canon to see you <a name="sa0511q" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0511q">kiss her as if she was a crucifix</a>. Turn around, Skeezy Sammy, till we see are you still full of poetry. <a name="n17028b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n17all.htm#n17028b">Can you sing us a stave encore on
your</a> <a name="n17032b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n17all.htm#n17032b">jubalharp</a>, eh, Mr Jinglejoys? Give us your imitation of the death of Nelson. What, sir? <u>Taurus periculosus morbus pediculosus miserere mei et miseribilibus!</u> Hoho! Begob, there&apos;s not so much green in his <a name="sa0641cs" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0641cs">Ireland&apos;s eye</a>. The bark is still there but
the molars are gone. Did you note that worried expressionism on his phonograph? Areesh! Areesh! And did you twig the sham leaf creeping down his blousyfrock? My oldfellow&apos;s uncle Caius Codinhand, that was garotted, used to chop that tongue of his, japlatin, with my younkle&apos;s owlseller, that went stonebothered Wolfe Woodenbeard, in the tower of Balbus as brisk, man, as I&apos;d scoff up
lobscouse. But it&apos;s all deafman&apos;s duff to me, begob. Sam knows miles better than me how to work the miracle. He&apos;ll soon tune your Erin&apos;s ear for you to read the roman&apos;s &mdash; while I&apos;m away from wherever thou art, going in for my examinations. Pick your stops with fondest. And mind you tie the two strings of your nicenames. And pull up your words as much as you can.
His hearing is doubting just as my seeing is believing. So Let him blink for himself where you speak the west ticklish. Fond Namer let me never see thee blame a kiss for shame a knee.</p> </p>  </main>
