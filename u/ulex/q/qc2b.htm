<p class="pdi">&mdash; You are most kind as ever, dear relative, Shaun said. But come &mdash; my good feet. Farewell awhile till we meet to part no more. So here goes. You watch my smoke.</p>
<p> Repulsing all attempts at first aid I perceived Shaun to give himself some sort of a kick or prod up while all the daughters of February Filldyke voiced their approval in the customary manner by dropping to their knees &amp; clapping together the flats of their hands. Going Shaun then I saw to take from the gentlest weeper amongst all the wailers the familiar yellow label into which he let
fall a tear, smothered a sigh, choked a cough, checked a sob, spat a spit &amp; <a name="n10020e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10020e">blew his own trumpet</a>. Next he licked its stickyback side and stamped the badge of belief to his brow, waved a hand across the sea as notice to quit, but
<br><font color="green">{ms, 33}</font>
<br> in selfrighting himself he toppled to the left and, making a brandnew start, couriered off adown his way following which he quickly was lost to sight though still, of course, to memory dear.</p>
<p> May the good people speed you, rural Shaun, stout fellow that you are, ay, and heart &amp; soul of Shamrogueshire! May your bawny hair grow fairer &amp; rarer, our own only whiteheaded boy! Just by nature &amp; natural by design had you but been spared to us you will be long looked after from last to first as the beam of light we follow receding on your pilgrimage to the antipodes of the past,
you, who so often consigned your tidings of great joy into our never to<a target="foot" id="fqz0007">&ordm;</a> late to love box, dear Shaun of all, our true pennyatimer! There are men still unclaimed by the death angel who will pray fervently that they may never depart this earth of ours till you come marching home. Life, it is true, will
<br><font color="green">{ms, 34}</font>
<br> be a dream without you, a slip of the time between a date and a date from tonight to yesterday morning. But you did your strong 9 furlong mile in slick &amp; slapstick style &mdash; a deed that will be talked of for centuries &mdash; And already the sombrer portion of the gloom is gone. Brave footsore Shaun! Hold to! Win out, sir! The silent cock shall crow at last. The west will shake the
east awake. Walk while you have the night for the noon cometh wherein every post shall sleep.</p> </p>  </main>
