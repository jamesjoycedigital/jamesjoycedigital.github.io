<p class="pStDir">(<a name="s15013be" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15013be">Faithful
Place</a>, rows of grimy houses with gaping doors. Little men and women squabble
for ices round a halted gondola. They receive wafers between which are wedged
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">c</span></span> lumps of coral and
coppery snow. The little men and women scatter slowly, sucking the melting
coloured snow. They are children. The high reared comb of the gondola pushes on
through the dark, passing under the lamplight, white and blue. Whistles are
heard in the distance. On a step a
<a name="s15024av" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15024av">ragpicker</a>
crouches to shoulder a sack. A hag standing by with a guttering oillamp rams a
last bottle in the neck of his sack. He shoulders it and lurches off mutely,
tugging his peaked cap askew on his eyes. The hag goes back into her lair
swaying her lamp. A child asquat on the doorstep with a paper shuttlecock
scrambles up to clutch her skirt. A drunken navvy
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">holds</span></span> grips with
both hands the railings of an area, swaying heavily to and fro. At a corner two
night patrols, in body capes, stand tall and silent. A plate is heard to crash:
a woman&apos;s scream follows. Figures, male and female, continue to pass
through the murk, round corners, into doorways. |xIn an openwindowed room, lit
by a candle stuck in a bottleneck, two sluts
<a name="s15041bk" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15041bk">combs the natts out
of another slut&apos;s hair</a>.|x* Heads are thrust out of windows to listen. A
child is heard crying. The oaths of a man are roared out indistinctly. They die
away. A girl&apos;s voice
<a name="s15013f" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15013f">sings</a> out, high and hoarse, from a lane:</p>
<p class="set"><u>I gave it to Kitty</u>
<br> <u>Because she was pretty</u>
<br> <u>The leg of the duck</u>
<br> <u>The leg of the duck,</u>
<br><font color="green">{ms, 2}</font> </p>
<p> Three redcoats, swaggersticks held in their oxters, turn about
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">and</span></span> towards the
voice and, without halting, emit in chorus a loud fart from their mouths.
Laughter of men in the lane. A woman calls:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Signs on you, dirtyarse.</p>
<p> The redcoats<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span>
turn as before and reply. They march on. The girl&apos;s voice rises higher:</p>
<p class="set"><a name="s15010l" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15010l">I gave it to Nelly
<br> To stick in her belly
<br> The leg of the duck
<br> The leg of the duck.</a></p>
<p> The redcoats halt with the patrol and talk. A girl with hair on the wind
rushes across the street, flapping from her arms. She
shrieks<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span>, laughing,
rushing and is engulfed in a doorway. A burly navvy follows with long strides.
He <a name="s15027bj" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15027bj">stumbles</a> on
the steps but recovers and plunges into the doorway after her. Weaker shrieks of
laughter are heard: they stop. A young man in
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">a</span></span> black with a wide
hat, pointing ahead with a flourish of his stick, passes through the figures,
talking. A broader young man wearing a jockey cap walks beside
him<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span>. A sneer of
disconcent is seen on his beaked face. An elderly woman seated on a doorstep looks up as they pass and calls.</p>
<p class="flush">They pass on, unseeing. She calls after them:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Trinity

<p> Still unheeded <a name="s15021k" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15021k">she

<p> Stephen gives the stick quickly and slowly

<p> They pass out of sight. A barefoot urchin scrambles to a street
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">c</span></span> lamp and climbs it
in <a name="s15027bl" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15027bl">jerks</a>. From
the top he slides down to his ring of urchin friends. Another starts to climb.
The navvy, leaving hold of the railings, lurches against the lamp. The urchin
slides down: all scuttle off in the darkness. The navvy, swaying, presses a
forefinger against a wing of his nose. Swaying, he ejects from the other nostril
<br><font color="green">{ms, 4}</font>
<br> a jet of snot.</p>
<p> <a name="s15000x" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15000x">Bloom</a> comes
round the corner hastily and stops. In one hand he has a lukewarm paper parcel
containing a

and a tablet of Fry&apos;s chocolate. He frowns slightly and hesitates. A

<p> A handsome woman in scarlet Turkish

covers her face and hair leaving free only her large dark eyes.</p>

<p> He breathes in deep agitation, wavering. Questions rise to his lips: He
swallows them down. He wishes to fall down at her slippers. He wishes to tell
her that he bought the crubeen, the trotter, the bread, and the chocolate for
her supper. He wishes and unwishes, is

<p> She turns away in disdain. He follows. She is gone. The elderly woman seizes
his sleeve. Instinctively he tightens his grip on the crubeen and trotter. The
woman pours into his ear a fetid husky message.</p>

<p> Bloom passed into the lower street. The housedoors are open.
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Women</span></span> Gaudy women
loll in the lighted halls or about the doors smoking cigarettes. The odour of
the <a name="s15020l" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15020l">sicksweet weed</a>
floats round Bloom. Kisses are chirped towards him. Ashamed, fluttered he tries to hide his parcel.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Bloom</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">I cannot go back. In which house have they gone? And this parcel. Useless waste.</p>
<p> He perceives the dog. An idea strikes him. He returns a few yards to a dark
corner, followed by the terrier and opens the parcel. He throws the crubeen
softly in the corner. He would like to eat the trotter but, after a moment,
throws it down regretfully and the bread. The terrier, snarling with famine,
gluts himself greedily, crunching the bones.</p>
<p> Bloom goes forward again. New louder kisses are chirped to him. A piano
sounds. He stands before the house, listening. The kisses fly about him, twittering.</p>

A blond feeble whore, Florrie Talbot, in a mildewed gown of strawberry, lolls
over the other sofa corner, listening, a heavy

<p> Lynch offers her one. She stretches up and lights it over the gasjet. With
his poker he lifts up a side of her gown boldly.</p>

<p> Litpold Virag, Bloom&apos;s double, wearing Stephen&apos;s hat, Buck
Mulligan&apos;s primrose vest, and a brown

nakedness knocking about</a>, what?|x* You perceive that she is not wearing what
you like. At the same time she is in walking costume and I always understood

<p class="pchar"><u>Bloom</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">But she is lean.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Virag</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">Well then, the third. She is covered with a considerable
layer of fat. You perceive that she has in front two protuberances which are of
a respectable size and on the other side, lower down, two protuberances which
are even larger. That suits your taste, eh?</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Bloom</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">The stye I dislike.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Virag</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">Perhaps it is a wart. I presume you remember what I told you on that subject.</p>

<p> Bloom uncertainly watches the everflying moth.</p>
<p class="flush">Henry Flower, stands between Bloom and Virag, both of whom
<br><font color="green">{ms, 13}</font>
<br> he resembles. He is dressed in a black velvet cloak under which he holds a dulcimer.</p>

<p> Cardinal Simon Dedalus appears in the doorway. He is in red, shoes, socks,

berretta. Seven cardinal sins also in red hold up his train.</p>

<p> He retires, his face twisted to one side. Bloom advances and taking the
chocolate from his pocket offers it to Zoe Higgins.</p>
<p class="flush">She takes a piece and nibbles.

and chews. Kate Lawrence offers a piece to Bloom.</p>

a massive whoremistress, enters the room. She is dressed in a black evening gown
and carries a fan which she flutters. Her eyes are heavily carboned. She has an
incipient moustache. Her

hard insistency. Her large fan winnows cooler wind towards her face and neck and bosom.</p>
