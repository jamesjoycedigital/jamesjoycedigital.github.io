<p class="pStDir">(Nighttown. Rows of grimy houses with gaping doors. Rare smoky
lamps. Little men and women squabble for ices round a halted gondola. They grab
wafers between which are wedged lumps of coral and copper snow. The stunted men
and women scatter slowly, sucking up the melting coloured snow. They are
children. The highreared comb of the gondola forges on through the dark, passing
under a lighthouse,
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">d</span></span> white and blue.

<p class="pStDir">On a step a ragpicker crouches to shoulder a sack. A crone,
standing by with a guttering oillamp rams her last bottle in the maw of his
sack. He shoulders his booty and hobbles off mutely, tugging a peaked cap askew
on his eyes. The crone makes back for her lair, swaying her lamp. A bandy child,
asquat on the doorstep with a paper shuttlecock crawls sidling after her in
jerks and, clutching at her skirt, scrambles up. A drunken navvy grips with both
hands the railings of<a target="foot" id="fqz0100">&ordm;</a> an area, swaying
heavily to and fro. At a corner two night patrols in shouldercapes, their hands
upon their staff holsters, stand (loom) tall and silent. A plate is heard to
crash: a woman&apos;s scream follows: a child is heard wailing. Heads are thrust
out of their cells, listening. Oaths of a man are roared out indistinctly. They
cease. Figures, male, female, wander through the murk, round turnings, into
warrens. In an openwindowed room lit by a candle, stuck in a bottleneck, a slut
combs out the tatts of another slut&apos;s hair. A girl&apos;s voice, still young, sings out from a lane.)</p>

halting, emit in chorus from their mouths a volleyed fart. Laughter of men from the lane. A hoarse hag retorts.)</p>

<p class="pStDir">(The redcoats turn as before and counterretort, marching on.
Near the lamp their tunics are bloodbright, their blond skulls close cropped.
Biscuitcaps set on the side lobes look like empty ballsockets. The girl&apos;s voice rises higher)</p>

<p class="pStDir">(The redcoats halt with the patrol in talk. A girl with hair
on the wind rushes across the street, her batshawl wingflapping from her arms.
She shrieks, laughing, rustling and is engulfed in a doorway. A burly porter
pursues her with booted strides. He stumbles on the steps but recovers and
plunges into gloom after her. Weaker shrieks of laughter are heard. They are
suffocated. A young man in black with a wide hat passes through the figures,
talking animatedly, pointing ahead with his stick.
A<a target="foot" id="fqz0102">&ordm;</a> broader young man wearing a jockey cap
walks beside him, a sneer of discontent on his beaked face. An elderly procuress
lolled against a doorframe looks out and calls in a husky whisper)</p>

hands, his head going back till both hands are a span or so from his breast,
downturned, in planes intersecting, the fingers about to part, the left being higher)</p>

<p class="pSpeech">Which is the jug of bread? It skills not. Illustrate thou. Here, take your crutch.</p>
<p class="pStDir">(They pass out of sight. An urchin scrambles to a streetlamp
and, clasping, climbs it in spasms. From the spur at the top he slides down to
his ring of urchin friends. The navvy, leaving hold of the railings, lurches
against the lamp. The urchin slides down. All scuttle off in the darkness. The
navvy, swaying, presses a forefinger against a wing of his nose. Swaying, he
ejects from the farther nostril a long liquid jet of snot. Then, shouldering the
lamp, he staggers away through the crowd, with his flaring cresset. Bloom comes
round a corner hastily and stops, out of breath. In each hand he holds a paper
parcel, one containing a lukewarm pig&apos;s crubeen and a cold sheep&apos;s
trotter, sprinkled with wholepepper, the other two slices of quarten loaf and a
cake of Fry&apos;s chocolate. He frowns, hesitates.</p>

his lips. He swallows them down. He wishes to sink to the ground near her
slippers to tell her that he bought the crubeen and trotter, the bread and
chocolate for her supper. He wishes, unwishes, is cold, warm, knows, knows not,
stands helpless, spellbound by her eyes and dress. Beneath her turreted turban a
coin gleams on her forehead. Her anklets are linked together by a fetterchain.
Beside her a camel waits with hood and palanquin,

<p class="pSpeech">Technic (he taps his volumes energetically) Caustic. They
must be starved. Snip off with a horsehair under the denned neck. But to change
the venue have you made up your mind yet whether you like or dislike women in
male costume? (with a dry sneer) You intended one entire year to the study of
the religious problem. From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step.
Pyjamas, let us say, or those complicated combinations, camiknickers.</p>
<p class="pStDir">(Bloom looks uncertainly at the three whores, then at the
mauveveiled light, hearing the everflying moth. Virag, turning the pages of his
volumes, prompts into his ear in a pig&apos;s whisper. Bloom repeats here and there with silent lips)</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Virag</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">Insects of the day spend their brief existence chiefly in
reiterated coition. The smell of the female lures them. But night insects like
this one, which follow light follow an illusion. Their movements are automatic.
They no longer pursue, seize and fecundate the female. See. That is his sun,
<a name="s15023ao" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15023ao">a midnight sun</a>.
It suits him. Nightbird nightsun. (Still turning the pages he whispers more loudly and rapidly)</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Bloom</u><a target="foot" id="fqz0154">&ordm;</a></p>
<p class="pSpeech">(repeats). Yes. That bee too the other day was butting
against his shadow on the wall. Finally he dazed himself and drowsed me. Then in
a dazed condition he wandered down into my shirt and reached my belly. Yes, it was well I awoke.

<p class="pchar"><u>Bloom</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">Naturally a woman&apos;s case is worse. That is why they fear
all vermin, all creeping things. They feel themselves always open. Yet we have
Eve and the serpent. One of those contradictions. Well, first of all, it is not
a historical fact. Also the reason is obvious. Those serpents too are gluttons
for woman&apos;s milk. Wind their way through miles of forest to suck her breast dry. Just like a baby.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Virag</u></p>

<p class="pchar"><u>Bloom</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">I beg your pardon? Ah. So. Spontaneously to seek out the
saurian&apos;s lair in order to entrust their teats to his avid suction.

the seven cardinal sins, also in red, hold up his train, peeping under it. He
wears a battered silk hat sideways on his head. His thumbs are stuck in his
armpits and the palms outspread. Round his neck hangs a rosary of corks ending
on his breast in a corkscrew cross. He proclaims with bloated pomp.)</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>The Cardinal</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">Conservio lies captured
<br> He lies in the lowest dungeons
<br> With manacles and chains around his limbs

puffed out. Then, unable to repress his merriment he

<p class="pSpeech">What if it were aphrodisiac? But no, I bought it. Vanilla too
is a sedative. Mnemotechnic. Possibly confused light confuses the memory. Seems
to influence the taste of this chocolate. Influence of colour. Red influences
lupus, I think. Lupus, yes. Mnemo. And encourages hypocondriasis. Choice of
colours is important therefore, suggestive. The character of women, any they
have, is largely influenced by the line, style and texture of their clothes. My
black figure here is too sad. Let me eat and rejoice (smiling, he eats the
tablet) Or is it because I haven&apos;t tasted chocolate for a long time. It
seems new. Aphrodisiac. Serious thing that about

second according to the law of falling bodies. I have felt a twinge of sciatica
in my left glutear muscle. The rain. Long exposure on the rocks in the late dewy
evening may have brought it on at my age. Would, O would, I were young again!
