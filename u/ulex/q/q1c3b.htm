<p class="pStDir">(A<a target="foot" id="fqz0172">&ordm;</a> nymph, with hair
unbound, lightly clad in teabrown artcolours, advances from her grotto and
passing under interlacing yews, stands over Bloom. She stands and looks down at
him with Marion&apos;s glances but softer.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>The Yews</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">(their leaves whispering together) Sister. Our sister. Ssh!</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>The Nymph</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">(softly) Mortal
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">(he tries to lift his
head)</span></span> Mortal, you found me in evil company, highkickers, coster
picnicmakers, pugilists, popular generals and
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">immortal</span></span> immoral
panto favourites, La Amora and Karini, on cheap paper that smelt of petroleum. I
was surrounded by the stale jokes of clubmen, pointless anecdotes to disturb the
emotions of raw adults, and advertisements for transparencies, and rubber goods.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Bloom</u><a target="foot" id="fqz0174">&ordm;</a></p>
<p class="pSpeech">You mean <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">in</span></span> <u>Photo Bits</u>?</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>The</u><a target="foot" id="fqz0175">&ordm;</a> <u>Nymph</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">Exactly. You bore me away. You framed me in oak and tinsel.
You placed me above your marriage couch.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Bloom</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">(tenderly) I did. Because you were beautiful, O immortal. My
eyes were glad to look upon you. I longed to praise you and to pray</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>The Nymph</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">During the dark night I heard another praise.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Bloom</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">(quickly) Yes, yes. Sleep reveals the worst aspect of
everybody, children perhaps excepted. Steelwine is said to cure snoring. For the
rest there is that English invention the Wonderworker the pamphlet of which I
received some days ago. (he sighs) &apos;Twas ever thus. Frailty, thy name is marriage.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>The Yews</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">Ssh!</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>The Nymph</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">(places her little fingers in her ears) And words also.
Spoken (she bends her head) Which are not in the dictionary.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Bloom</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">(hesitates) No? But you understood them?</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>The Nymph</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">(covers her face with her hands) And what have I not seen in
that chamber! What must my eyes look down on!</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Bloom</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">(apologetically) I know. I quite understand. The quoits are
loose. Soiled personal linen also, wrong side up with care. Sh? Yes. And that
absurd porcelain utensil which has only one handle.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>The Nymph</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">Worse. Still worse.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>The Yews</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">(mingling their boughs, whispering) Listen. Whisper. She is
right, our sister. We grew by Poulaphouca waterfall. We gave shade on langourous summer days.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>John Wyse Nolan</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">(in the background in Irish national forester&apos;s uniform
doffs his plumed hat) Prosper! Give shade on
languorous<a target="foot" id="fqz0176">&ordm;</a> days, trees of Ireland!</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>The Yews</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">(murmuring) Who came to Poulaphouca with the high school
excursion? Who left his comrades to seek our shade?</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Bloom</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">(nervously) I was only sixteen.
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Even</span></span> A jolting car
then sufficed And then the heat. The sunspots that summer. The tipsycake.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>The Yews</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">(rustling) She is right, our sister. Whisper. Who profaned our silent shade?</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>The Nymph</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">(coyly<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">)</span></span>,
through parting fingers) There? In the open air?</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>The Yews</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">(sweeping downward) Sister, yes. And on our virgin sward.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>The Nymph</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">(parting her fingers wide) O, infamy!</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Bloom</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">Youth. A natural phenomenon. The flesh. The image of Lotty
Clarke seen through the curtains at her night toilette. Besides, that day no-one
saw.<a target="foot" id="fqz0178">&ordm;</a></p>
<p class="pStDir">(A calf thrusts a white hornless head through the foliage)</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>The Calf</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">Me. It was shown to me. But I was too young to understand.</p>
<p class="pStDir">(His Honour, Sir Frederick Falkiner, recorder of Dublin, in
judicial garb appears seated under the yewtrees
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">)</span></span> He bears in his arms an umbrella sceptre.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>The Recorder</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">(hotly) A most scandalous corruption of minors. Let him be
taken from the place where he now stands or crawls and detained in Mountjoy
<br><font color="green">{ms, 16}</font>
<br> prison<a target="foot" id="fqz0179">&ordm;</a> during His Majesty&apos;s
pleasure. Scandalous! And may the Lord have mercy.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Bloom</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">(earnestly) Believe me. I respect true modesty, rich and
rare. Once in the monkey house in the Zoo a girl was watching a lewd chimpanzee,
her hand crossed at her pelvic basin. I stood. I looked, I stared with
intention. But, believe me, her deep artless blush unmanned me. (I turned away and left the precincts.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>The Recorder</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">(blows his nose, tearfully) Poor calf! So to blast all her
future life! To cast that shadow over her cowhood.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>The Calf</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">(mournfully) I never reached the age of cowhood. I ate the
yewleaves. I died poisoned in my prime.</p>
<p class="pStDir">(Two globes of tears roll slowly from the prominent eyes)</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>The Nymph</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">(Assuming the form of a poor old woman, a milkcan on her arm,
keening) To have seen what I have seen! (she assumes the form of a queen, young
and haughty) See what I have seen! (she assumes the form of a madonna in blue
and white with joined hands and downcast eyes) A shame in my sight (she assumes
the form of a young girl with a plait of yellow hair) <u>Das unbeschreiblich, hier ist&apos;s getan</u></p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Bloom</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">(abjectly, pawing the ground) Yes, yes, yes, yes. Enemas too
I have administered. One third of a pint of infusion of quassia to which a tablespoonful of rocksalt has been added.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>The Nymph</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">In my presence! And the rest!</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Bloom</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">Yes, yes, I admit it. I have paid homage where the back changes name. It overpowers me.</p>
<p class="pSpeech">Even to sit where a woman was lately seated, especially with
divaricated thighs, diffuses through me immense satisfaction. I find it so full,
so characteristic of the female body.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>The Yews</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">Ssh! Sister, speak!</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>The Nymph</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">(withdraws her hands slowly and reveals her face, pale,
within a nun&apos;s wimple) low and softly) But the face is the mirror of the
female soul. Tranquilla convent. Feast of Mount Carmel. Tenderness. Love. Beauty. Purity.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Bloom</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">(Starts suddenly to his feet)</p>
<p class="pSpeech">Begone! You are no immortal. Omelette without eggs. (he
grasps her hand firmly within the folds of her garment) Fair play, madam. I see
your pruning knife too. What? The fox and sour grapes, is it? (She vanishes. He
calls after her loudly) We pay on the nail for what little we get. The labourer is worthy of his stud fee.</p>
<p class="pStDir">(The<a target="foot" id="fqz0183">&ordm;</a> figure of Bella Cohen stands before him)</p>
<p class="pSpeech">You are <a name="s15039c" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15039c">pass&eacute;e</a>, I see. Ss.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Bella</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">(comfortably) Which of yous was playing the dead march?</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Zoe</u><a target="foot" id="fqz0184">&ordm;</a></p>
<p class="pSpeech">Me. Ever see me running? Mind your cornflowers (she darts to
the piano and plays banged chords on the keyboard with crossed arms)</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Lynch</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">Beethoven.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Zoe</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">The cat&apos;s rambles through the slag. (darting back as
suddenly to the table) Eh? Who&apos;s making love to my sweeties. What&apos;s
yours is mine and what&apos;s mine is my own</p>
<p class="pStDir">(she grabs the last of the chocolate. Kitty, disconcerted,
coats her teeth with the silver paper)<a target="foot" id="fqz0185">&ordm;</a></p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Bloom</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">(gently) Give me back that potato, will you?</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Zoe</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">(tossing her head)
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Give</span></span> Forfeits.
What&apos;s yours is mine &amp; what&apos;s mine is my own.
<br> <a name="s15010aj" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15010aj">Give a thing and take it back

<br> God&apos;ll send you down below.</a></p>

<br> Never go to God again
<br> See a man, behind the chapel
