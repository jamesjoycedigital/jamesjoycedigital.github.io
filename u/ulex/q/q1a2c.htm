<p class="pStDir">(Nighttown. Rows of grimy houses with gaping doors. Rare smoky
lamps. Little men and women squabble for ices round a halted gondola. They
receive wafers between which are wedged lumps of coral and copper snow. The
little men and women scatter slowly, sucking up the melting coloured snow. They
are children. The highreared comb of the gondola pushes on through the dark,
passing under the lamplight white and blue. Whistles are heard from afar, calling, then answering.)</p>

<p class="pStDir">On a step a ragpicker crouches to shoulder a sack. A crone
standing by with a guttering oillamp rams her last bottle in the maw of the
sack. He shoulders it and lurches off mutely tugging his peaked cap askew on his
eyes. The crone makes back for her lair, swaying her lamp. A bandy child asquat
on the doorstep with a paper shuttlecock crawls sidling after her in jerks and,
clutching her skirt, scrambles up. A drunken navvy grips with both hands the
railings of<a target="foot" id="fqz0011">&ordm;</a> an area swaying heavily to
and fro. At a corner two night patrols in shoulder capes, their hands upon their
staffholsters, stand tall and silent. A plate is heard to crash: a woman scream
follows. A child is heard crying. Heads are thrust out of windows listening.
Oaths of a man are roared out indistinctly. They cease. Figures, male and female
pass through the murk, round corners, into doorways. In an openwindowed room,
lit by a candle stuck in a bottleneck, a slut combs out the
<a name="un4023ap" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4023ap">tatts</a> of another

<p class="pStDir">(The redcoats halt with the patrol in talk. A girl with hair
on the wind rushes across the street, her batshawl wingflapping from her arms.
She shrieks, laughing, rushing, and is engulphed in a doorway. A burly navvy
pursues with long strides. He stumbles on the steps but recovers and plunges
into the doorway after her. Weaker shrieks of laughter are heard. They stop. A
young man in black with a wide hat pointing ahead with a flourish of his stick
passes through the figures, talking. A<a target="foot" id="fqz0012">&ordm;</a>
broader young man wearing a jockey cap walks beside him, a sneer of discontent
on his beaked face. An elderly procuress lolled against a doorframe looks out as
they pass and calls in a husky whisper)</p>

<p class="pStDir">(They pass out of sight. A barefoot urchin scrambles to a
street lamp and, clasping, climbs it in spasms. From the top he slides down to
his ring of urchin friends. Another starts to climb. The navvy, leaving hold of
the railings, lurches against the lamp. The urchin slides down. All scuttle off
in the darkness. The navvy, swaying, presses a forefinger against a wing of his
nose. Swaying he ejects from the farther nostril a long dribbling jet of snot.
Then, shouldering the lamp, he staggers away through the crowd with his flaring
<a name="un4023aa" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4023aa">cresset</a>.) Bloom
comes round a corner hastily and stops. In each hand he holds a paper parcel,
one containing a lukewarm pig&apos;s crubeen and a cold sheep&apos;s trotter
sprinkled with wholepepper, the other two slices of quartern loaf and a tablet
of Fry&apos;s chocolate. He<a target="foot" id="fqz0015">&ordm;</a> frowns

chocolate for her supper. He wishes, unwishes, is cold, warm, knows, knows not,
stands helpless, spellbound by her eyes and dress. Beneath her turreted turban a
coin gleams on her brow. Her anklets are linked together by a fetterchain.

<p class="pStDir">(His Eminence Cardinal Simon Dedalus appears in the doorway. He is all in red, soutane,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 19}</font>
<br> shoes and socks. (Seven dwarf acolytes, the seven cardinal sins, also in
red hold up his train, peeping under it) He wears a battered silk hat sideways
on his head. <a name="s15031bh" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15031bh">His
thumbs are stuck in his armpits</a> and the palms of his hands outspread. Round
his neck hangs a rosary of corks ending on his breast in a corkscrew
cross.<a target="foot" id="fqz0080">&ordm;</a> Then he proclaims with bloated pomp).</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>The Cardinal</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">Conservio lies captured.
<br> He lies in the lowest dungeons
<br> With manacles and chains around his limbs
<br> Weighing upwards of three tons.
<br> He looks at all for a moment, his right eye closed tight, his left cheek
puffed out, struggling to suppress his merriment. (He rocks from side to side and chants with broad rollicking humour:)
<br> O the poor little fellow
<br> His legs they were yellow
<br> He was plump fat &amp; heavy &amp; brisk as a snake
<br> But some bloody savage
<br> To graise his white cabbage
<br> He murdered Nell Flaherty&apos;s duckloving drake.</p>

<p class="pSpeech">Thanks be to Jesus they&apos;re not unanimous. If they were
they&apos;d walk me off the face of the earth.</p>
<p class="pStDir">(He shuffles off comically, shaking his head from side to
side, shrinking quickly to the size of his trainbearers. The dwarf acolytes,
giggling, peeping, zigzag behind him.
His<a target="foot" id="fqz0081">&ordm;</a> voice is heard, merciful, beautiful, male, eternal,</p>

<p class="pchar"><u>Zoe</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">O Thank your mother for the rabbits.

<p class="pStDir">( She tosses him a piece of chocolate. He catches it in his
mouth and chews. Kitty Ricketts offers a piece to Bloom. He declines with a deprecating gesture but then accepts)</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Bloom</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">What if it were aphrodisiac? But no, I bought it. Vanilla too
is a sedative. Mnemno&mdash;technic. Possibly the confused light here confuses
the memory. It seems to influence also the taste of this chocolate. Influence of
colours. This colour influences lupus, I think. Lupus, yes. Mnemnotechnic. It
encourages hypochondriacs out of their state. The choice of colours is important, suggestive.</p>

character of women, any they have, is largely influenced by the style, hue and
texture of their garments.</a> My black figure here is too sad. Let us eat and
rejoice. Or is it because I have not tasted chocolate for a long time. Aphrodisiac. A serious

never. Tomorrow I shall look for some truffles.</p>
