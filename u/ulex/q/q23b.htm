<p class="pSpeech">It was providential you came on the scene.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Corny Kelleher</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">(laughs) Two commercials that were standing fizz in Jammet&apos;s wanted to have a go
<br><font color="green">{ms, 27}</font>
<br> with<a target="foot" id="fqz0229">&ordm;</a> the girls. So we drove down to
to nighttown. And sure they wanted me to join in. But that&apos;s not for old
stagers like me and yourself (he laughs drooping) We have it in the house, eh, what?</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Bloom</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">(laughs) Ha, he, he. Yes. Matter of fact, I was just passing
down Buckingham street there and I happened to see a crowd</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Corny Kelleher</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">Sure it was the jarvey, there, told me and I got off to see.
Will I give him a lift home? Where does he live? Somewhere in Cabra, what?<a target="foot" id="fqz0230">&ordm;</a></p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Bloom</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">No, he lives in Sandycove, I believe. From what he said.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Corny Kelleher</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">Sandycove! (he bends down) Eh? (he calls again) He&apos;s
covered with shavings anyhow. Take care they didn&apos;t lift anything off him.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Bloom</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">No, no, no. I have his money. And his hat and his stick.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Corny Kelleher</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">Ah, well, he&apos;ll get over it. No bones broken. Well,
I&apos;ll get along. (he laughs) On the job tomorrow. Night. Safe home! Night. Safe home.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Bloom</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">Good night.</p>
<p class="pStDir">(Corny Kelleher goes to the car and mounts it. The jarvey
whips the horse. The horse harness jingles)</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Corny Kelleher</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">(from the car) Night.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Bloom</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">Night.</p>
<p class="pStDir">(The car jingles away. The jingling harness is heard. The
jingling grows fainter. Bloom, holding Stephen&apos;s muddied hat and ashplant,
stands irresolute. He bends towards<a target="foot" id="fqz0231">&ordm;</a>
Stephen and shakes him lightly by the shoulder)</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Bloom</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">Mr Dedalus! (There is no answer. He bends more.) Mr Dedalus!
(There is no answer. Hesitatingly he places his mouth nearer the prostrate
figure) Stephen! (There is no answer. He calls more loudly) Stephen!</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Stephen</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">(thickly) Who? (he sighs and stretches
himself<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">)</span></span> he murmurs)
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Will go drive with Fergus now</span></span>
<br> <a name="s19004d" href="../../ff/unbs/s19all.htm#s19004d">Will go drive with Fergus now
<br> And pierce the deep</a>&nbsp;&hellip; (he turns on his left side, doubling together)</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Bloom</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">(brushes the woodshavings from Stephen&apos;s clothes with
light hand and
fingers<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">)</span></span>. He
murmurs) &pound;1-16-7. Air will do him good. Poet, of course.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Stephen</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech"><a name="s19004d" href="../../ff/unbs/s19all.htm#s19004d">Shadows on the woods
<br> And the white breast of the dim sea.</a></p>
<p class="pStDir">(Stephen sighs long, curling his body. Bloom, holding the
muddied hat and ashplant, stands erect. A dog bays in the distance. Bloom
tightens and relaxes his grip on the
ashplant.<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">)</span></span> He looks down on Stephen&apos;s form)</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Bloom</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">(murmurs) The deep wood&apos;s shadow&nbsp;&hellip; The dim
breast. Ferguson, he said, some girl

looks down, silent, on guard).</p> </p>  </main>
