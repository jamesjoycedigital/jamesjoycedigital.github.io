<p class="pStDir">(Nighttown. Rows of grimy houses with gaping doors. Rare smoky
lamps. Little men and women squabble for ices round a halted gondola. They
receive wafers between which are wedged lumps of coral and copper snow. The
little men and women scatter slowly, sucking up the melting coloured snow. They
are children. The highreared comb of the gondola pushes on through the dark,
passing under the lamplight white and blue. Whistles are heard from afar, calling, then answering.)</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>The Whistles</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">Wait my love and I&apos;ll be with you.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>The Answers</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">Down behind the stable.</p>
<p class="pStDir">On a step a ragpicker crouches to shoulder a sack. A crone
standing by with a guttering oillamp rams her last bottle in the neck of the
sack. He shoulders it and lurches off mutely tugging his peaked cap askew on his
eyes. The crone makes back for her lair, swaying her lamp. A child asquat on the
doorstep with a paper shuttlecock crawls sidling after her in jerks and,
clutching her skirt, scrambles up. A drunken navvy grips with both hands the
railings of<a target="foot" id="fqz0011">&ordm;</a> an area swaying heavily to
and fro. At a corner two night patrols in shoulder capes, their hands upon their
staffholsters, stand tall and silent. A plate is heard to crash: a woman scream
follows. A child is heard crying. Oaths of a man are roared out indistinctly.
They cease. Figures, male and female pass through the murk, round corners, into
doorways. In an openwindowed room, lit by a candle stuck in a bottleneck, a slut
combs out the
<a name="un4023ap" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4023ap">tatts</a> of another
slut&apos;s hair. A girl&apos;s voice, high, still young, sings out from a lane)</p>

<br><font color="green">{ms, 2}</font> </p>
<p class="pStDir">(Two redcoats, swaggersticks tight in their oxters, face about
towards the voice and, without halting, emit in chorus a loud fart from their
mouths Laughter of men from the lane. A hoarse hag retorts.)</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>The Hag</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">Signs on yous, dirty arse. More power the Kildare girl.</p>
<p class="pStDir">(The redcoats turn as before and answer. They march on. Near
the lamp their tunics are bloodbright, their blond heads closecropped, their
biscuitcaps set on the side lobes are round ballsockets. The girl&apos;s voice rises higher)</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>The Girl</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">I gave it to Nelly
<br> To stick in her belly
<br> The leg of the duck
<br> The leg of the duck.</p>
<p class="pStDir">(The redcoats halt with the patrol in talk. A girl with hair
on the wind rushes across the street, her shawl wingflapping from her arms. She
shrieks, laughing, rushing, and is engulphed in a doorway. A burly navvy pursues
with long strides. He stumbles on the steps but recovers and plunges into the
doorway after her. Weaker shrieks of laughter are heard. They stop. A young man
in black with a wide hat pointing ahead with a flourish of his stick passes
through the figures, talking. A<a target="foot" id="fqz0012">&ordm;</a> broader
young man wearing a jockey cap walks beside him, a sneer of discontent on his
beaked face. An elderly procuress lolled against a doorframe looks out as they pass and calls in a husky whisper)</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>The Procuress</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">Sst! Come here till I tell you. Maidenhead inside. Sst!</p>
<p class="pStDir">(They pass on unseeing. She calls after them scornfully)</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>The Procuress</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">Trinity medicals. Fallopian tube.</p>
<p class="pStDir">(Still unheeded she spits her venom. A redhaired girl seated
with a friend on a step draws her shawl quickly across her nostrils as she
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">narrates</span></span> relates)</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>The Redhaired Girl</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">And says the one: I seen you in Faithful

<p class="pchar">And her walking with two fellows the one time.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Lynch</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">So that?</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Stephen</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">So that the art of gesture renders visible not the lay sense
but the first formal rhythm. Who wants a gesture to illustrate a loaf, a jug?
This movement illustrates the loaf and jug of bread, or wine, I mean, in Omar.

<p class="pchar"><u>Lynch</u><a target="foot" id="fqz0014">&ordm;</a></p>
<p class="pSpeech">Damn your yellow stick.</p>
<p class="pStDir">(Stephen gives the stick quickly and slowly holds out his
hands, his head going back till both hands are a span or so from his breast,
down&mdash;turned, in planes at an angle, their fingers about to part, the left hand being higher)</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Lynch</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">Which is the jug of bread? Illustrate Thou. Here take your crutch.</p>
<p class="pStDir">(They pass out of sight. A barefoot urchin scrambles to a
street lamp and, clasping, climbs it in spasms. From the top he slides down to
his ring of urchin friends. Another starts to climb. The navvy, leaving hold of
the railings, lurches against the lamp. The urchin slides down. All scuttle off
in the darkness. The navvy, swaying, presses a forefinger against a wing of his
nose. Swaying he ejects from the farther nostril a long dribbling jet of snot.
Bloom comes round a corner hastily and stops. In each hand he holds a
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">lukewarm</span></span> paper
parcel, one containing a lukewarm pig&apos;s crubeen, the other a cold
sheep&apos;s trotter sprinkled with wholepepper, the other two slices of
quartern loaf and a tablet of Fry&apos;s chocolate.
He<a target="foot" id="fqz0015">&ordm;</a> frowns slightly and hesitates. A
stooped bearded figure appears beside him, garbed in a long caftan embroidered
with dogs&apos; heads and wearing a smokingcap with crimson tassel.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Rudolph</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">Half crown wasted. I told you not go with drunken goys ever.

<p class="pSpeech">I know</p>
<p class="pStDir">(He looks down, conscious of error feeling through the paper a warm crubeen and a cold trotter.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Rudolph</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">What are you doing? Are you not my son Leopold?</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Bloom</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">Yes, father.</p>

<p class="pSpeech">Harriers. Only that once.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Rudolph</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">Once! All mud head to foot. Cut your hand open.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Bloom</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">(weakly) They asked me to race them. It was muddy. I slipped.</p>

<p class="pSpeech">(with contempt) Goim nachez. Nice spectacles for your mother.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>The Mother&apos;s Voice</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">(in shrill alarm) O, blessed Redeemer!
Where<a target="foot" id="fqz0017">&ordm;</a> were you at all?</p>
<p class="pStDir">(Bloom looks down at his clothes. A handsome woman in Turkish
costume stands before him. Opulent curves fill her scarlet trousers and jacket.
A white yashmak, violet in the night, covers her face and hair, leaving free only her large dark eyes)</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Marion</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">Poldy!</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Bloom</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">Who?</p>
<p class="pStDir">(He breathes in deep agitation wavering Questions throng to
his lips. He swallows them down. He wishes to sink to the ground near her
slippers to tell her that he bought the crubeen and trotter, the bread and
chocolate for her supper. He wishes, unwishes, is cold, warm, knows, knows not,
stands helpless, spellbound by her eyes and dress. Beneath her turreted turban a
coin gleams on her brow. Her anklets are linked together by a fetterchain.
Beside her a camel waits with hood and palanquin,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 5}</font>
<br> a ladder of innumerable steps leading to his hump. A slow friendly mockery steals into her eyes)</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Marion</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">Poldy!</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Bloom</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">Yes</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Marion</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech"><u>Ti trema un poco il cuore?</u></p>
<p class="pStDir">(She saunters away in disdain. He follows, followed by a
sniffing terrier. She is gone. The elderly procuress seizes his sleeve.
Instinctively he tightens his grip on the crubeen and trotter. The procuress
pours into his ear a fetid husky message.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>The Procuress</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">Ten shillings a maidenhead. Fresh thing that was never touched. Fifteen.</p>
<p class="pStDir">(Her mouldy sweat promises secret obscenities. She indicates
the<a target="foot" id="fqz0019">&ordm;</a> doorway. He looks. In the dark hall
furtive, rainbedraggled, Bridie Kelly stands. She calls to him)</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Bridie</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">Any good in your mind?</p>
<p class="pStDir">(He thinks of giving the crubeen and trotter to the procuress.
Gerty<a target="foot" id="fqz0020">&ordm;</a> MacDowell limps to his side.
Leering she draws from behind her something and shows it to him coyly. It is her bloodied clout. She whispers)</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Gerty MacDowell</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">You did that.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Bloom</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">I? It is mistaken identity. When?</p>

<p class="pSpeech">(pawing his coat) Dirty married man! I love you doing that.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>The Procuress</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">(hurriedly) Come. Don&apos;t be all night. You won&apos;t get
a virgin in the flash houses. Come before the polis sees us. 67 is a bitch.</p>
<p class="pStDir">(Mrs Breen stands in the middle of the street. She throws open
her mouth, eyes and arms, astonished)</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Mrs Breen</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">You down here! O, wait till I see Molly.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Bloom</u></p>

place round there for pig&apos;s feet. Feel how hot.</p>
<p class="pStDir">(Richie Goulding appears weighted to one side by the black
legal bag of Colles and Ward on which a skull and crossbones are painted in
white limewash. He opens it and shows it full of white puddings, kippered herring and tightpacked pills)</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Richie</u></p>

<p class="pchar"><u>Bloom</u><a target="foot" id="fqz0022">&ordm;</a></p>
<p class="pSpeech">(cautiously) Don&apos;t attract the attention of the public.
I want to tell you a little secret about how I came to be here. You must never
tell. Not even Molly. I have a particular reason.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Mrs Breen</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">O, not for worlds.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Bloom</u></p>
<p class="pStDir">(Bloom shakes himself free of the procuress and walks on with
Mrs Breen. The dog slinks at their heels sniffing)</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Bloom</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech">(mysteriously) Do you remember a long long time ago just

you wore that new hat Denis bought for you that didn&apos;t become you half as
well as the toque with the bird on it and Molly was eating a sandwich of spiced
beef out of Mrs Joe Gallaher&apos;s lunch basket and laughing because Rogers and
Maggot O&apos;Reilly were mimicking the cock as we passed a farmhouse and Marcus
Tertius Moses, the tea merchant, drove past us with his daughter (Dancer Moses

<p class="pStDir">(She fades from his side. He walks on alone, displeased,
uncertain, mistrustful, excited towards hell&apos;s gates. In an archway a woman

feet planted apart pisses noisily. Outside a shuttered pub a group of loiterers
listen to the end of a story which a brokensnouted man relates with rasping

<p class="pSpeech">(guffawing) O, jays! Jays, that&apos;s a good one! Glauber salts. O, jays, into the porter!</p>
<p class="pStDir">(They laugh in all voices, indifferent to the scene about

corner, followed by the tracking terrier. He opens the parcel and

landing a door is thrown open. A man in shirt and trousers crosses the landing.
His braces undone dangling behind give him the gait of a twotailed ape. Bloom,
averting his face, follows Zoe into the parlour with a shade of mauve
tissuepaper so that the light is dim. A moth flies round and round colliding
against it. On the mantelshelf lie two large china dogs. On the flanks of each
is painted a woodland glade. Between them is a vase with peacock feathers. In
the grate is a japanese parasol firescreen. On a rug of matted sheepskin before
the hearth Lynch sits crosslegged, his cap back to the front. He beats time
slowly to the music with the brass poker in his hand. Kitty Lawrence a bony
pallid whore in street costume, sits on the edge of a table swinging her leg.
Lynch indicates derisively the couple at the piano.</p>

the series of empty fifths. A blond feeble goosefat whore in a mildewed gown of

<p class="pSpeech">As a matter of fact it is of no importance whether Benedetto
Marcello found it or made it. The rite is the poet&apos;s rest. It may be an
ancient Greek song to Demeter or it may illustrate the eighteenth psalm <u>Coeli

apart as the hyperphrygian and the mixolydian and of texts so divergent as the
haihooping of priests round David&apos;s altar, round Ceres&apos; altar and
David&apos;s tip from the stable to his chief bassoonist concerning God&apos;s

venue have you made up your mind yet whether you like or dislike women in male
costume. (with a dry sneer) You intended to devote one whole year and no more to
the study of the religious problem. From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a
step. Pyjamas, let us say, or those new complicated combinations camiknickers.</p>
<p class="pStDir">(Bloom looks uncertainly at Kitty Lawrence, Zoe Higgins and
Florrie Talbot, then at the mauveveiled light. Uncertainly he watches and hears
the everflying moth.) Virag (whispers in his ear), turning the pages of his volumes Bloom nods, repeats)</p>

<p class="pSpeech">(repeats) Yes. And that bee, as I observed the other day, was
buzzing against his own shadow on the wall. He dazed himself finally and drowsed
me. That&apos;s it. In a dazed condition he wandered down into my shirt and
reached my belly. Yes, it was well I woke.
Naturally,<a target="foot" id="fqz0074">&ordm;</a> a woman&apos;s case is still

feel themselves always open. Yet Eve did not fear the serpent. One of those
contradictions. Well first of all it is not a historical fact. Also the reason

encourages hypochondriacs out of their state. The choice of colours is important, suggestive.</p>
