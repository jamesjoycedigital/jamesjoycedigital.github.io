<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, ladies on gentlemen and toastmaster general, health to song for Erin go dry! To stir up love&apos;s young fizz I tilt with this bridle&apos;s cup champagne, dimmydouce, to her peepair of hideseek at hers, tightsqueezed on my snowybreasted, and while my pearlies in their sparkling wiseheight are nippling her bubblets I swear (and let you swear!) by the bumper round of
our own old Snaggletooth&apos;s solidbowl I ne&apos;er will prove I&apos;m untrue to your liking (theare!) so long as my hole looks down.</p>
<p> So gullaby, me poor Isley! But I&apos;m not for forgetting my inner man monophone for I&apos;m leaving my darling proxy behind for your consolering, <a name="sa0511as" href="../../FF/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0511as">lost</a> Dave the Dancekerl, a squamous runaway and a dear old man pal of mine too. He&apos;s the mightiest penumbrella I ever flourished on beyond the shadow of a post!
<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font> Be sure and link him, my treasure, as often as you learn provided there&apos;s nothing between you but a plain deal table only don&apos;t encourage him to cry lessontimes over Leperstown. Talk of wolf in a stomach, by all that&apos;s verminous! Isn&apos;t Ireland a small place after all. I knew I smelt the garlic league.
Why, bless me quick, here he is, darling Dave, just in time as if he fell out of space, all draped in mufti, coming home to mourn mountains blindtofold from his old continence after a bad passage by the 11.32, with the pork&apos;s pate in his paw and the gulls laughing lime on his natural skunk, blushing like Pat&apos;s pig, begob! He&apos;s not too tom well ashamed to carry out
onaglibtoographikelly the testimonicals he gave twenty annies for, showing his three white feathers, as a home cured emigrant in Paddyouare far below on the sealevel. Bearer may leave the church, signed, Figura Porca, Magnafica. He&apos;s the sneaking likeness of me, faith, in <a name="n14072e" href="../../FF/fnbs/n14all.htm#n14072e">miniature</a> and every biter&apos;s

<br> bit as nasal a romeo as I am, for ever cracking quips on himself, that merry, the jeenjakes, he&apos;d soon arise mother&apos;s roses mid bedewing tears with those wild wet lashes onto anny living girl&apos;s laftercheeks. He&apos;s a jarry queer fish betimes, I grant, but, lice and all and semicoloured stainedglasses, I&apos;m enormously full of that foreigner, I&apos;ll say I am. We&apos;re
as thick and thin now as two tubular jawballs. I hate him about his henesy but I love him. I love his portugal&apos;s nose That&apos;s the nasturtum now that saved many a poor sinker from water on the grave. Isn&apos;t he after borrowing all before him touching every distinguished Irishman he could ever distinguish before &amp; behind from a Yourishman for the customary half of a crown and peace?
Brayvo, senior chief! Famose! Sure there&apos;s nobody else in touch anysides to hold his candle for the darling at all for sheer dare with that prison potful of Spanish breens on him like the knave of trifles! A jollytan fine cemented brick and the prince of goodfellows! Dave knows I have the highest of respect of anyone in my own smooth way for that intellectual debtor David Crozier. The most
important man! <u>Servos!</u> Ho, by the holy! Someone has shaved his rough diamond skull for him as clean as Nuntius&apos; piedish! He&apos;s the spatton spit, so he is, of Shemuel Tulliver, the old crusader! when he took off the paudeen. That was to let the crowd of Flu Flux Fans behind him see me proper. Ah, he&apos;s very thoughtful that way. He is, really. Hold hard till you hear him clicking
his bull&apos;s bones! You&apos;re welcome back, Wilkins, to red berries in the frost! Hat yourself! Give us your dyed hand here, frother. Where&apos;s your watch? I&apos;m better pleased than ten guidneys. Faith, I&apos;m proud of you, french davit! You&apos;ve surpassed

<br> yourself. This is my aunt Julia Bride dying to have you languish to scandal in her bosky old manor. <u>Servorum!</u> You haven&apos;t seen her since she stepped into her youth&apos;s smallclothes. She has plenty of room for the both of us. Hat yourself well &amp; Embrace her by all means when you stop scratching and tell her in your agglutinative I was asking for her. She fell in love with
our picture when we were stabled together in the Black Watch together, me &amp; you, hungry &amp; angry, &amp; pinch me. Always saying we had the wrinkles of a snailcharmer and the slits and smellers of a fellow that fell foul of the county de Luna, &amp; the meathtraps of the first vegetarian. out of pure tuppenny luck before she goes off out of pure threefold funk. I&apos;d give three shillings
a pound to the canon to shadow you kissing her liberally all over as if she was a crucifix. It&apos;s good for her labials. There&apos;s nothing like a mistletouch for finding a queen&apos;s earring. Turn around, skeezy Sammy, till we feel are you still fond of poetry. Could you wheedle a staveling encore out of your imitationer&apos;s jubalharp, eh, Mr Jinglejoys? Grunt us your foreboden article
introducing the death of Nelson. in coloraturas. What, sir? <u>Taurus periculosus morbus pediculosus miserere mei in miseribilibus!</u> Hoho! Begob, there&apos;s not so much green in his Ireland&apos;s eye! The bark is still there but the molars have gone. Areesh! Areesh! The misery billyboots I used to lend him before we split. Did you note that worried expressionism on his megalogue! A full
octavio beyond me! Did you hear his 3 blowrings rattlemaking? And did you twig the shamlooking leaf creeping ghastly down his blousyfrock? My oldfellow&apos;s uncle that was garotted, Caius Codinhand, used to chop that tongue of his, japlatin, with my younkle&apos;s owlseller, Wolfe Woodenbeard, that went stone bothered in the tower of Balbus as brisk, man, as I&apos;d scoff up lobscouse. But
it&apos;s all deafman&apos;s duff to me, begob. Sam knows miles better than me how to work the miracle. And I see he&apos;s dropping the stammer out of his bladder since I sent him to grow a muff camomise his feet down on the river airy after he earned the reputation of being swift He&apos;ll soon tune your Erin&apos;s ear for you to read the roman while I&apos;m away from wherever thou art going
in for my varsatile examinations. So pick your stops with fondness. And mind you

<br> tie the two strings of your nicenames. And pull up your furbelows as farabove as you&apos;re waisthigh. His hearing is doubting just as my seeing is believing. So let him blink for himself where you speak the best<a target="foot" id="fqz0015">&ordm;</a> ticklish. Fond namer, let me never see thee blame a kiss for shame a knee.</p> </p>  </main>
