<p class="pStDir">(Night town. Rows of grimy houses with gaping doors. Rare
smoky lamps. Little men and women squabble for ices round a halted gondola. They
receive wafers between which are wedged lumps of coral and coppery snow. The
little men and women scatter slowly, sucking up the melting coloured snow. They
are children. The high reared comb of the gondola pushes on through the dark,
passing under the lamplight, white and blue. Whistles are heard in the distance
calling and answering:
<a name="s15009aq" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15009aq">Wait, my loves, and
I&apos;ll be with you</a>. On a step a
<a name="s15024av" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15024av">ragpicker</a>
crouches to shoulder a sack. A crone standing by with a guttering oillamp rams a
last bottle in the neck of his sack. He shoulders it and lurches off mutely,
tugging his peaked cap askew on his eyes. The hag goes back into her lair
swaying her lamp. A bandylegged child asquat on the doorstep with a paper
shuttlecock crawls
<a name="s15018bl" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15018bl">sidling</a> after
her in <a name="s15027bl" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15027bl">jerks</a>
and, clutching her skirt scrambles up<a target="foot" id="fqz0001">&ordm;</a>. A
drunken navvy grips with both hands the railings of an area, swaying heavily to
and fro. At a corner two night patrols, in shoulder capes, stand tall and silent
their hands at rest on their staff
<a name="s15021o" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15021o">holsters</a>. A plate
is heard to crash: a woman&apos;s scream follows. Figures, male and female,
continue to pass through the murk, round corners, into doorways. In an
openwindowed room, lit by a candle stuck in a bottleneck, a slut
<a name="s15041bk" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15041bk">combs the natts out
of another slut&apos;s hair</a>. Heads are thrust out of windows to listen. A
child is heard crying. The oaths of a man are roared out indistinctly. They die
away. A girl&apos;s voice
<a name="s15013f" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15013f">sings</a> out, high, still young, from a lane:</p>
<p class="set"><u>I gave it to Molly</u>
<br> <u>Because she was jolly</u>
<br> <u>The leg of the duck</u>
<br> <u>The leg of the duck,</u>
<br><font color="green">{ms, 2}</font> </p>
<p> Two redcoats, swaggersticks tight in their oxters, turn about towards the
voice and, without halting, emit in chorus a loud fart from their mouths.
Laughter of men in the lane. A hoarse hag calls:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Signs on you, dirtyarse.
<a name="s15025be" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15025be">More power</a>,
<a name="s15017b" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15017b">the Kildare girl</a>.</p>
<p> The redcoats turn as before and reply. They march on. The girl&apos;s voice rises higher:</p>
<p class="set"><a name="s15010l" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15010l">I gave it to Nelly
<br> To stick in her belly
<br> The leg of the duck
<br> The leg of the duck.</a></p>
<p> The redcoats halt beside the patrol and talk. Their tunics are bloodbright
near the lamp, their blond
<a name="s15018cp" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15018cp">heads
closecropped</a>, their
<a name="s15018cq" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15018cq">biscuit caps</a> set
on the side lobes are round ballsockets. A girl with hair on the wind rushes
across the street, her shawl flapping from her arms. She shrieks, laughing,
rushing and is engulfed in a doorway. A burly navvy pursues with long strides.
He <a name="s15027bj" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15027bj">stumbles</a> on
the steps but recovers and plunges into the doorway after her. Weaker shrieks of
laughter are heard: they stop. A young man in black with a wide hat, pointing
ahead with a flourish of his stick, passes through the figures, talking. A
broader young man wearing a jockey cap walks beside him. A sneer of disconcent
is seen on his beaked face. An elderly woman lolled against a doorframe looks
out as they pass and calls in a discreet whisper.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Sst! (wait)
<a name="s15020ao" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15020ao">Come here till I
tell you</a> <a name="un1032cv" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1032cv">Maidenhead</a> inside. Sst!</p>
<p class="flush">They pass on, unseeing. She calls after them:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Trinity

<p> Still unheeded <a name="s15021k" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15021k">she
spits</a>. A redhaired girl seated with a friend on a doorstep draws her shawl
rapidly across her nostrils as she relates: narrates rapidly:</p>

<p> Stephen gives the stick quickly and slowly

<p class="pSpeech">Which is the jug of bread? Illustrate Thou. Here take your stick.</p>
<p> They pass out of sight. A barefoot urchin scrambles to a street lamp and
clasping climbs it in
<a name="s15027bl" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15027bl">jerks</a>. From the
top he slides down to his ring of urchin friends. Another starts to climb. The
navvy, leaving hold of the railings, lurches against the lamp. The urchin slides
down: all scuttle off in the darkness. The navvy, swaying, presses a forefinger
against a wing of his nose. Swaying, he ejects from the other nostril
<br><font color="green">{ms, 4}</font>

<p> <a name="s15000x" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15000x">Bloom</a> comes
round the corner hastily and stops. In each hand he has a paper parcel, one

and a tablet of Fry&apos;s chocolate. He frowns slightly and hesitates. A

long caftan embroidered with dog&apos;s heads and wearing a smoking cap with crimson tassel.</p>

<p class="pSpeech">Half crown wasted. I told you not go with drunken goys ever.</p>

<p class="pSpeech">(in shrill alarm) O, blessed Redeemer, where were you at all?</p>
<p> Bloom looks down at his clothes and bestows the chocolate &amp; bread in a sidepocket.</p>
<p> A handsome woman in Turkish costume stands before him. Her opulent curves
fill out her scarlet trousers and jacket. A white yashmak violet in the night,
covers her face and hair leaving free only her large dark eyes.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u><a name="s15000y" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15000y">Marion Bloom</a></u></p>

<p> He breathes in deep agitation, wavering. Questions throng to his lips: He
swallows them down. He wishes to sink to the ground near her slippers. He wishes
to tell her that he bought the crubeen, the trotter, the bread, and the
chocolate for her supper. He wishes and unwishes, is warm, then cold, knows then
knows not, stands helpless, spellbound by her eyes and dress. Beneath her
turreted turban <a name="s15022g" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15022g">a coin
gleams on her brow</a>. Her
<a name="s15022c" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15022c">anklets</a> are linked
together by a fetterchain. Beside her a
<a name="s15035ag" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15035ag">camel</a> waits,
with hood and palanquin, a ladder of countless steps reaching to his
<a name="s15035ag" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15035ag">hump</a>. A slow friendly mockery steals into her eyes.</p>

<p class="pSpeech">Yes.</p>
<p class="pchar"><u>Marion</u></p>
<p class="pSpeech"><u>Ti trema un poco il core?</u></p>
<p> She saunters away in disdain. He follows followed by a sniffing terrier. She
is gone. The elderly woman seizes his sleeve. Instinctively he tightens his grip
on the crubeen and trotter. The woman pours into his ear a fetid husky message.</p>

<p> Bloom passes through the swamp into the lower street. The housedoors are
open. Gaudy women loll in the lighted halls or about the doors smoking

cigarettes. The odour of the

corner, followed by the terrier and opens the parcel. He throws the crubeen
softly in the corner. He would like to eat the trotter but, after a moment,
throws it down regretfully. The terrier, snarling with famine, gluts himself
greedily, crunching the bones. Two raincaped watch
