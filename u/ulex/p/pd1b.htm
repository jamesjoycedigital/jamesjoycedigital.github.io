<p class="pdi">&mdash; Could you, of course, dear Shaun, I knew, read the strangelooking language of this letter to His Majesty?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I, replied Shaun, could play it. But it is awful in its handwriting. It is a piece of scribble.</p>
<p> Letter written by Shem, brother of Shaun, for Alp, mother of Shaun, about Hek, father of Shaun.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Dear Shaun, I said, since you came to the use of language have you not millions of times used language ten times as worse as the language used up by your Shem.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I would not like, Shaun replied, to swear but I doubt it. She, the mother, was put up to it by him, <a name="n08084a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08084a">the iniquity</a>.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You could come near it, dear Shaun, I suppose<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span>? I asked.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No-one could, Shaun replied, for its being incendiary.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 13}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But I suppose you could use worse yourself dear Shaun, I supposed, if you only would take the trouble of so doing?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Undoubtedly so, Shaun replied, &amp; by the powers of war I could easily do it any time I liked even with my left hand and much worse than my brother Shem only for I would never take so much trouble in doing so. And by all <span class="strike"><span class="striketext"><a name="n09073d" href="../../ff/fnbs/n09all.htm#n09073d">Mind you, he</a> was in the deepest of earnest

<p> Mind you, he was in the deepest of earnest about it though his jaw was too heavy to talk a lot only, in looking up to find out what age he might be by the polar star, he overbalanced by weight of the barrel and rolled backwards with his curious mode of motion a fairish way enough behind the times in the direction of

<p> Well, thou art passing hence, dear Shaun, from friends and parents dear but may the moss of prosperousness gather you rolling home! May foggy dews bediamondise your hoops! May the fireplug of filiality safeguard your bunghole! We know you were loth to leave us but, sure, you will turn up some day when your pocket is empty and anyway in any case may the grass grow quickly under your feet or the
daisies grow lightly over your toes!<a target="foot" id="fpz0006">&ordm;</a></p> </p>  </main>
