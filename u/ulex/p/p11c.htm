<p class="pStDir">By no pomp of pride or mark of mightiness is the wellbeing of
a people more surely proven than by tribute of solicitude for its own
continuance and where this quality either is lacking or is set small store by we
cannot with justice esteem a nation so little provident, however wide her realm,
be she ruled never so wisely. For what boots it to gather and to garner for
none, or weaklings shall come after? Or is that wisdom, to extol his meat above
the man himself, the dead which serves for life above the living, which death
should serve? Plainly nought and no. If care for progress be absent in vain were
the rooftree raised or threshold laid.</p>
<p> Yet what <a name="s14038o" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14038o">boon</a>
of all can vye with the bounty of increase. Where it is found
<a name="s14013co" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14013co">the land teems</a>,
where not, is bare: or the heath and hillside, this but that the abundant
wheatfield of heavy awns, the fertile loam of
<a name="un4054an" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4054an">fallows</a>, the
herds numbered and blessed. So was it commanded to the patriarch to increase and
multiply and it was promised him his seed should not fail but be numerous: and
even the pagans saluted on meeting amid the press a matron with child for, if
command and promise from on high warrant and if the wise of mankind at all times
and everywhere establish it, (and even the rudest know this awe), revered
motherhood should be above all else and its abode a temple inviolate.</p>
<p> Such was, witness the writers of Story, the practice in our land from the
earliest times where leechcraft was ever held high in honour. The sick, the
wayfarer, the stricken were the objects of wise care. Not to speak of their
hostels, their sweating chambers &amp; leperyards and plaguegraves, their houses
of sorrow, their greatest leeches: as the Shiels than whom none was wiser, the
O&apos;Lees and the O&apos;Hickeys with many others, record in their books the
lore of herbs and maladies with their cures as we may read with much instruction
how the trembling hand was made whole and how the withering
<br><font color="green">{ms, 2}</font>
<br> the boyconnell too and the wave or loose flux. Now surely in such and so
varied learning we shall not miss a tender care for birth. And in fact so it
was. Before born the babe had bliss. Within the womb he won worship. A couch and
food were set for her than should bear him and clean clothes and the service of
midwives and what drugs were needed or surgical tools in the high bright
wellbuilt fair home of mothers when, being then far gone, she drew thither to lie in, her term come.</p>
<p> Nor has this wont stopped short of our time. The hospitals of the Coombe,
Rotunda of the National Maternity Hospitals, stand among us, where day following
day is fostered the neverfailing fount of life so that the tale of creatures
shall not ever lessen, for nature renews it of her bounty giving, if but to her
one gift be given, an hundredfold yield. In this greater than we and in her
strength greater for the earth will suffer that chasms rend her
<a name="s14073ad" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14073ad">loins</a> and the
sea be sundered to her depths yet show no worse, so strong in them is nature,
while her chief child faints under a light load, wailing comes to birth and is
born bondchild into woe. But woe unto them that know not such woe. Sweet woe
whereof joy comes. If hallowed the ground where lie our dead thrice hallowed be
that house where life burgeons to new life, love bears fruit and flower.</p>

Horne</a> is master. There are white spotless couches set, (three score and

with hands of comfort and he rejoices to look upon his home where those wombs

that that to him seen sudden face hers so young then had seemed. Light her eyes

Doctor O&apos;Hare some tidings sent. Earnest mien then her face took which awhile ere had shone roseate.

<br> With veiled eyes looking low poor Doctor O&apos;Hare was in heaven, she
told. Sorry was Bloom to hear that. In his hat high grave deep he looked. Nurse
Callan sighed ruing fate for one so good yet God&apos;s will to question
unwilling. Bloom she told how this in Scotland had passed, the dire cause

to know. Hard her case nurse Callan said, hard the birth, if born, would be.
Bloom on mat with hat hearkened. U.P. Josie ringletted hair he knew but
nature&apos;s law strong, stern. Rueful he heard of pangs outdrawn: Woman&apos;s

says he, if the bull&apos;s Irish. Irish she is, says Mr Stephen, and he sent

about. An Irish <a name="s14072a" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14072a">bull
in an English chinashop</a>. I conceive you, says Mr Dixon, and that same bull
was sent to our island by the bravest cattlebreeder of them all that was farmer
a certain Nicholas with an emerald ring in his nose. True for you, says Mr Lynch
<a name="s14025f" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14025f">cross</a> the table,
and a bullseye into the bargain A sleeker and a plumper bull never shit on
shamrock. He had golden horns a coat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath
so that all the women of the country leaving their pots and rolling pins
followed after him, hanging daisychains on his horns. Before he came Farmer
Nicholas, that was a eunuch, had him properly gelded by seven cowcatchers that
were no better off than himself Be off now, says he, with a farmer&apos;s
blessing and with<a target="foot" id="fpz0005">&ordm;</a> he
<a name="s14031f" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14031f">slapped his

by our Virgin Mother but to make up for that he taught him a trick worth two of
the other so that maid, wife and widow to this day all affirm they would rather

four fields of all Ireland. Another then
<a name="s14011c" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14011c">put in his word</a>:
and they dressed him up, says he, in a shift and petticoat with a tippet round
his neck and built a barn for him with a fine manger in it full of the best
grass for by this time our bull was grown so fat and heavy that he could scarce
walk to pasture. To remedy which they brought him his good feed of fodder in
their apronlaps, and, as soon as his belly was full, he used to rear up on his
hind quarters to show them a mystery and roar and bellow to that extent they
were struck with wonder. Ay, says a third, but worse than that he grew so
pampered he would have nought in the land but green grass growing for himself
and the native herd (for green was the only colour that was
<a name="s14031j" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14031j">to his mind</a>) and
if ever he got scent of a

was sowing as much as a handful of mustard or a bag of rapeseed he&apos;d run

<p> Our worthy acquaintance Mr Malachi Mulligan now appeared in the doorway as
student was concluding his apologue accompanied with a friend of his a young
gentleman, <a name="s14035an" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14035an">his name
Mr Seymour</a> who had lately come up to town, it being his intention to take a
<a name="s14035am" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14035am">cornetcy</a> and so
to the wars. He was kind enough to express some relish
<a name="s14032aa" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14032aa">of it</a> and all
the more as it
<a name="s14024ae" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14024ae">jumped with</a> a
<a name="s14022v" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14022v">project</a> of his own
for the very evil which had been
<a name="s14032v" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14032v">touched on</a>.
Whereat After this
<a name="s14058m" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14058m">homily</a> he removed
from his hat a handkerchief with which he had sheltered it.
<a name="s14008b" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14008b">They</a>
<a name="s14008b" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14008b">both</a> had been

had been taken water as might be seen by large spots of moisture on Mr
Mulligan&apos;s suit, a hodden grey worsted which was now somewhat
<a name="s14032u" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14032u">piebald</a> &mdash; he
handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards which he had had printed
at Thom&apos;s on which was this legend printed in flowing italics:

Fertiliser.</a> His
<a name="s14022v" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14022v">project</a>, as he
went on to expound, was to withdraw from the round of idle pleasures such as
form the chief business of
<a name="s14035al" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14035al">sir fopling</a> in
town and to devote himself to the noblest task for which the bodily organism is
destined. He had been
<a name="s14032ad" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14032ad">led into this
thought</a> by a
<a name="s14048a" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14048a">consideration</a> of
the causes of sterility caused both by inhibition and prohibition, whether the
inhibition in its turn was due to
<a name="s14032i" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14032i">conjugal vexations</a>
or to motives of thrift, whether the prohibition proceeded from defects
congenital or from propensities acquired. It grieved him, he said, sorely to see
the nuptial couch defrauded of its
<a name="s14014b" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14014b">dearest pledges</a>
and to reflect upon so many

of her nature. His
<a name="s14022v" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14022v">project</a> was very
favourably entertained by his audience and Mr Mulligan

while he drove home his point with the scholarly by an apt verse from the
classics, which <a name="s14035y" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14035y">as it
dwelt upon his memory</a> was a conclusive confirmation of his contention, Talis

not a little upon</a> his elegance he now
<a name="s14032an" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14032an">applied himself

passage that had lately befallen him</a>, and

was, which he <a name="s14032bk" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14032bk">could

table, asked for whom were the

and then, seeing Mr Bloom, he made him a civil bow and said,

condition</a> from woman&apos;s woe, poor body, and he

sigh</a> to know if
<a name="s14032n" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14032n">her happiness had yet
taken place</a>. One of the company there
<a name="s14032ae" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14032ae">rallied him upon</a>
his plan, asking Mr Mulligan by asking, when was it known
<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font> he
smote himself below the diaphragm, saying with an admirable imitation of Mother

<a name="s14032ac" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14032ac">This was so happy a
conceit that it renewed the storm of</a> mirth and threw the whole room into the
<a name="s14032bq" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14032bq">most violent
agitations of delight</a>. He had run on in the same vein but that his mimicking
was arrested by a <a name="s14035w" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14035w">larum</a> in the antechamber.</p>
<p> The young gentleman having treated himself and his listener,

than</a> the Glasgow student, to some

<p> At this point the listener who was none other than the student from Aberdeen
<a name="s14022ac" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14022ac">congratulated</a> in
the liveliest fashion
<a name="s14022ac" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14022ac">with</a> the young
gentleman and, interrupting the narrative at a salient point,

opportunely. <a name="s14039o" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14039o">There
wanted nothing</a> but this cup to crown my felicity. But was I left with only a

had wrote</a> therein. Gazing upon the picture with
<a name="s14039j" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14039j">a world of</a>

in such an <a name="s14042ak" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14042ak">artless

affection gave eloquence to his words and, having replaced the locket, he

frequent cases of copulation between women and the males of brutes his authority
being his own avouchment in support of fables such as that of the Minotaur which
the elegant Roman poet has presented for us. The impression which his words made
on a mobile assembly was immediate but shortlived. It was effaced as easily as
it had been evoked but the impression made on the mobile assembly was easily
effaced by an allocution from Mr Candidate Mulligan

wellconducted elderly gentleman of cleanly habits. Contemporaneously with this
jest an argument having arisen between Mr Delegate Madden and Mr Candidate Lynch
respecting the juridical and theological dilemma in the case of one Siamese twin
predeceasing its yokefellow the question was referred by mutual consent to Mr
Deacon Dedalus. Hitherto silent, whether the better to show that curial
authority in whose garb he was vested or in obedience to an inward voice

contained the required refreshment and made a

it by pouring a lot of it out with a considerable degree of attentiveness not to upset any of it about the place.</p>
<p> The debate which ensued was, in its scope and progress, an epitome of life.
The debaters were the keenest in the land. The theme they were engaged on was
the loftiest for debate. The common hall of Horne&apos;s house had never beheld an assembly so representative
<br><font color="green">{ms, 3}</font>
<br> and<a target="foot" id="fpz0019">&ordm;</a> so varied nor had the old walls
of that establishment ever heard a language so encyclopaedic. Crotthers, in the
striking highland garb, his face glowing with the briny airs of Caledonia, sat
facing Lynch, whose countenance bore already the signs of
<a name="s14048ar" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14048ar">premature</a> vice
and preternatural cynicism. Below these at the foot of the board and on either
side of it the figure of Bannon in his traveller&apos;s kit contrasted finely
with the primrose elegance and easy manners of Malachi Roland St John Mulligan.
The chair of the resident himself stood vacant before the hearth but on either
side. Next the Scotchman was the place assigned to Costello, the eccentric while
beside him in stolid silence sat the squat person of Madden of Thurles. Lastly
at the head of the table was the young poet whose found a refuge from his
<a name="s14014a" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14014a">labours</a> of
pedagogy in the the convivial atmosphere of Socratic discussion while to right
and left of him were the flippant prognosticator, fresh from the hippodrome, and
the indominatable wanderer, soiled with the dust of conflicts and stained with
the mire of an indelible dishonour, but in whose heart no lure or peril or
&mdash; or degradation could ever efface the the image that
<a name="s14083b" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14083b">voluptuous</a>
<a name="s14083j" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14083j">female loveliness</a>
which the pencil of Lafayette has preserved for posterity.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 4}</font> </p>
<p> It<a target="foot" id="fpz0020">&ordm;</a> had better be said here that the
transcendentalism to which Mr Stephen Dedalus&apos; contentions would appear to
prove him incurably
<a name="s14077d" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14077d">addicted</a> runs
counter to accepted scientific methods. Science, it cannot be too often
repeated, deals with phenomena. The man of science has to face hard facts and
explain them as best he can. There are, it is true, some questions which science
cannot answer &mdash; at present &mdash; like the first problems submitted by Mr
Bloom as to the problem played by sex in birth. Must we accept the opinion of
<a name="s14077aa" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14077aa">Empedocles of
Trinacria</a> that
<a name="s14077ba" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14077ba">the right ovary is

<a name="s14062be" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14062be">spermatozoa</a> the
differentiating factors or is it as the more advanced embryologists
<a name="s14072e" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14072e">Lusk</a>, Leopold,
Herschel, Valenti, opine, a mixture of both. The second problem raised by the
same gentleman is even more vital: infant mortality. It is interesting because,
as he very pertinently remarks in this connection,
<a name="s14020bf" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14020bf">we are all born in
the same way but we all die in different ways</a>. Dr Mulligan blames the
hygienic conditions in which our
<a name="s14001bj" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14001bj">greylunged
citizens</a> contract
<a name="s14001bl" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14001bl">adenoids</a>,
pulmonary complaints, etcetera by inhaling germs that lurk in
<a name="s14001bl" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14001bl">dust</a>. Dr
Crotthers attributes it to neglect whether private or official. Although the
former is undoubtedly true the case he mentions of
<a name="s14070a" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14070a">nurses forgetting to
remove the sponges from the peritoneal cavity</a> is. An ingenious explanation
is offered by Mr Lynch that both natality &amp; mortality like all other
phenomena tidal movements, lunar phases, blood temperature, diseases in general,
everything, in fact, in nature&apos;s vast world from the extinction of
<br><font color="green">{ms, 5}</font>

one of the many flowers which beautify our parks is subject to a
<a name="s14071p" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14071p">law of number</a> as
yet unascertained. But the plain &amp; straight question a child born of normal
healthy parents and apparently a healthy child and properly looked after
unaccountably dies in early childhood or youth (though other children born of
the same marriage do not) must certainly, as the poet says, must give us pause.
Nature, we may be sure, has her own good reasons for what she does &amp; in all
probability these deaths are due to some
<a name="s14071q" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14071q">law of
anticipation</a> by which organisms in which morbous
<a name="s14070ar" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14070ar">germs have taken up
their residence</a> (science has now proved conclusively that only the plasmic
substance can be said to be immortal) tend to disappear at an increasingly early
stage of development, thereby securing
<a name="s14070ao" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14070ao">a survival of the
fittest</a>. Mr Dedalus&apos; remark that an omnivorous being which can
masticate, deglute, digest and apparently pass in the ordinary fashion aliments
so various as cancrenous females of middle age, pottlebellied solicitors
<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font>
might find a gastric relief in an innocent meal of staggering bob reveals in a
very unsavoury light the tendency alluded to above. For the enlightenment of
those who perhaps are not so intimately acquainted with the secrets of the civic
abattoir as this morbidminded esthete seems
<br><font color="green">{ms, 6}</font>
<br> to<a target="foot" id="fpz0022">&ordm;</a> be it should perhaps be stated
that staggering bob, in the vile jargon of our licensed victuallers, signifies
the flesh of a calf newdropped from its mother. In a recent controversy with Mr
Bloom he is reported as having stated that once a woman has let the cat into the
bag she must let it out again or give it life (as he phrased it) to save her
own. At the risk of her own
<a name="un4021at" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4021at">was the crushing
rejoinder</a>, none the less effective for the moderate tone in which it was
delivered. Meanwhile the skill and patience of the doctors had brought about a

had been a <a name="s14055l" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14055l">weary weary
while</a> both for patient and physician. All that medical skill could do was
