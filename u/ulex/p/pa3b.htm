<p> Methought as I was going asleep somewhere<a target="foot" id="fpz0009">&ordm;</a> in nonland of where&apos;s please I heard as &apos;twere the peal of midnight&apos;s chimes from out the belfry of the cute old speckled church tolling so faint atwelve as nighthood rendered all animated British objects nonviewable to human watchers save &apos;twere perchance anon some glistery gleam darkling
adown surface of affluvial flowandflow as again might seem garments of laundry reposing a greensward close at hand in full expectation. And as I was going along in a dream as dozing I was dawdling, arrah, methought broadmouth was heard and all vociferated, echoating: Shaun! Shaun! Post the post! With a high voice and, O, the higher on high the deeper and low. I heard him so. And lo methought
somewhat came of the noise and somewho seemed amove among allmurk now &apos;twas as clump, now mayhap. When lo was light and now &apos;twas as flasher now more as the glow. Ah, in unlitness &apos;twas in verity, &apos;twas his belted lamp. Ay, he who so swayed a will of a wisp before me, dressed like an earl in just the correct wear, in a
<br><font color="green">{ms, 36}</font>
<br> classy <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">freeswinging</span></span> o&apos;coat of far <a name="n08098h" href="../../ff/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08098h">superior ruggedness</a> freeswinging from his shoulther and thickwelted brogues on him hammered to suit the Irish people and climate and his jacket of woollies with green and white and yellow effects out of it and a softrolling lapel to
it and red sealingwax buttons and his invulnerable burlap waistcoat and the overshirt <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">she</span></span> he showed inside of it, snowy <a name="n10136i" href="../../ff/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10136i">starspangled</a> zephyr with a decidedly surplice front and the most successfully carried trousers now you ever
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">saw</span></span>, breaking over the ankle and hugging the shoeheel everything the best &mdash; none other from (Ah, then<a target="foot" id="fpz0010">&ordm;</a> may the blessings of God and Mary and Patrick and Brigid be tumbling all over him!) other than (and may his hundred thousand welcome letters multiply, ay, and plultiply!) Shaun himself!</p>
<p> Had I the concordant wiseheads of Messrs Gregory and Lyons alongside of Dr Tarpey&apos;s and the reverend Mr MacDougall&apos;s but I, poor ass, am but as their fourpart ass. Yet methought Shaun (holy messenger angels be uninterruptedly nudging him among and along the winding ways
<br><font color="green">{ms, 37}</font>
<br> of random ever!) Shaun in proper person (now may all the backsliding constellations continue to form his changeable timetable!) stood before me. And I tell you my word that young fellow looked the stuff. Now without deceit it is hardly too much to say he was looking grand, so fired smart, in much more than his usual health, he was immense, topping swell for he was after having a great time in
a porterhouse where he had recruited his strength by means of his three principal meals, his breakfast of half a pound of bacon and eggs, then came his dinner of a half a pound of round steak with some chops thrown in by the proprietoress and gravy and a splendid spanished onion and then finally to his regret his supper, vitellusit, bacon with <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">some
cold breast of veal</span></span> I don&apos;t mean to say for the moment that he was gluttonous but he liked his feed a lot</a>. And he was so jaunty with a schoolgirl&apos;s complexion sitting pretty over his face and he was plainly out on the mash for he sproke.</p>
<p> When lo meheard I saw the voice of Shaun how so it sighed to scented nightlife
<br><font color="green">{ms, 38}</font>
<br> as softly as the loftly marconimasts from Clifden sigh open tireless secrets to Nova Scotia&apos;s listing sisterpoles.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Alas alone alanna aroon! Shaun yawned, addressing himself and complaining of the fact of him earning his bread in the sweat of his feet as, having moistened his mouth on the quiet and scooped his molars and grinders clean with his two forefingers, he sank down at once upon the <a name="n10007g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10007g">native heath</a> he loved, covered with
virgin bush. <a name="n06019p" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06019p">Well, I&apos;m</a> <a name="n06019p" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06019p">shot seeing myself in this trim!</a> How all too unworthy am I, a mere mailman of peace, for such eminence, or promenade rather, to be more exact, as to be the bearer of these missive on His Majesty&apos;s service. I cannot recollect ever having done
anything of the kind to deserve of such.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But have we until now ever besought you, dear Shaun, we remember who it was, to begin with, who gave you the permit?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Everybody, Shaun replied. My heaviest cross it is. I have it from Saint Columkille&apos;s prophecies.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Then, we explained, you possibly might be so by order?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Forgive me, Shaun replied from his liquid lips, it was condemned
<br><font color="green">{ms, 39}</font>
<br> for me in the prophecies and there is a power over me that is put upon me from on high and so as it is I have nothing in view to look forward at and I am hopeless to do anything concerning.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Honest Shaun, we agreed, a whisper reaches us that in the end it may well turn out to be you who will bear these public letter.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; As, Shaun replied<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span> patly, to that I have the power. And that has a lot to do with everything.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Would you mind telling us, Shaun honey, we proposed to such a dear youth, where mostly are you able to work?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I, Shaun replied, mostly am able to walk. I am always telling them now how it was foretold for me to be disbarred from unnecessary servile work of all sorts for otherwise I would get into a blame there. His holy will be done! But believe me I am awful good at the bottom of me. And I can now truthfully declare with my hands on the epistles that I do my reasonable best to
recite my prayers regularly, in fact, always have.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yet one minute&apos;s observation, dear domestic Shaun, as we observe how you have painted
<br><font color="green">{ms, 40}</font>
<br> our town green.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, murder! Shaun replied, smiling the whole way up his sleeve, Well, so be it and I will confess to have. And it wouldn&apos;t be my first time. Somebody may perhaps say I am wrong. But it is grandiose from the prophecies and they were particularly arranged by a gentleman for gentlemen. And it was with my post lamp.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do you mean, we gathered, whether varnish would or verdure?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It is a confounded lie to say it, Shaun, the fiery boy, shouted, naturally incensed. And another time please confine your glaring insinuations to some other body. What on the face of this earth would I be doing besides your varnish? That is more than I can say anyway. So let you and I now drop that. Understand me when I tell you that in the past parcel office so deeply
deplored by my erstwhile friend, Miss Sanders, postmistress in general to the Irish Goat Society, albeit blessed with 22000 sorters out of a biggest possible 22000, too much administrative stationery was ate up by those goats. It is also one of my avowed intentions at some time, when I am not prepared to say, to compose quite a patent savingsbook surrounding this matter, so
<br><font color="green">{ms, 41}</font>
<br> long as I am prepaid.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But what, frank Shaun, we pursued, would be the biography of your softbodied uniform?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; None whatsoever, Shaun replied, though it would be very romantic. All of it, I might say, was handled over by me myself amongst <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the</span></span> my neighbours of every description, entitled the evicted tenants. What I say is and I am no greenhorn, permit me to tell you. Therefore I am as plain as possible enveloped, which you
will shortly receive, <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">in</span></span> care of one of Mooseyears Guinness&apos;s registered barrels.<a target="foot" id="fpz0011">&ordm;</a></p> </p>  </main>
