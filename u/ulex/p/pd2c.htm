<p class="pdi">&mdash; Could you, of course, dear Shaun, we knew, while still in the barrel, read the strangewritten Shem language of those letter for His Majesty.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I, Shaun replied, cd play it backwards like anything with my <a name="n10027k" href="../../ff/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10027k">eyes shut</a> &amp; all. As far as that goes <a name="n10043j" href="../../ff/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10043j">I associate myself with yr remarks</a> just now. <a name="n06030d" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06030d">I agree in your description</a> But it is awful
bad on the hand. It is a pinch of scribble. <a name="n03037c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03037c">Flummery</a> is what I wd call it reduced to writing if you were to ask me my pronounced opinion about them bagses of trash which Mr Shem &amp; the mother has written. An infant sailing eggshells on the floor of a wet day wd have more sabby.</p>
<p> Letter, carried by Shaun, son of Hek, written by Shem, brother of Shaun, for Alp, mother of Shem, about Hek, father of Shaun.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Kind Shaun, we all requested, since you came to the use of language have you not, without suggesting for an instant, millions of times used language 10 times as worse as the language used up by yr celebrated brother Shem?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Celebrated? pursued Shaun. <a name="n10070e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10070e">Notorious I rather wd feel inclined in myself to describe him as.</a>
<br><font color="green">{ms, 24}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I wd not like, Shaun replied, to as to <a name="n01042f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01042f">be so insulting to myself as to</a> swear just for the moment <a name="n06034h" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06034h">positively</a> as to the other but let me say <a name="n06080d" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06080d">my belief before my God is</a> that I much doubt it.'Tis
She, the mother, was put up to it by him, the iniquity. That ought to be placed in irons <a name="n06089k" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06089k">into some institution</a> for such matters if he cd first <a name="n10046h" href="../../ff/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10046h">pass the</a> panel <a name="n10046h" href="../../ff/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10046h">doctor</a>. Rot him!
<a name="n10047c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10047c">Flannelfeet!</a> He&apos;s no cousin of mine.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; May we beg you, dear Shaun, we suggested, unravel to me <a name="n10030j" href="../../ff/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10030j">in yr own words</a> to <a name="n10051i" href="../../ff/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10051i">your very humble and yours most respectfully</a> as to how?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <a name="n06093b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06093b">You may &amp; welcome.</a> For three days, Shaun narrated, she kept howling &amp; bawling with him handling the pen with a hiccup. <a name="n06089j" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06089j">It was entirely the latter to blame</a> <a name="n06051h" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06051h">It was given me to assist</a> at
the whole business by grace They lasted 70 hours.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But for what, dear Shaun? we asked <a name="n05059f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05059f">vouchsafe</a> to say.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; For his language, Shaun replied, which he put inside his letter.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But you cd come near it, we suppose, dear Shaun? we supposed.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No-one cd, Shaun replied, as I have said before for it&apos;s being incendiary.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Still <a name="n06047c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06047c">in a way</a> we suppose you that are so brainy in yourself cd use worse yrself, dear ingenious Shaun, we still supposed, if only you wd take the trouble of so doing it.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Undoubtedly that is show, Shaun replied, &amp; by the powers of war I cd do it any time ever I liked as <a name="n07001k" href="../../ff/fnbs/n07all.htm#n07001k">you see</a>, I am extremely ingenious even with my left hand &amp; as easy as a keg of beer &amp; it wd far exceed all what that bogus bolshy Shem is conversant with &amp; 1 of those days I will feel
<a name="n10016g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10016g">moved to</a> do it simply as a work of merit mark my words <a name="n07001i" href="../../ff/fnbs/n07all.htm#n07001i">that will open your eyes</a> for you, boor, only for, as an amateur &amp; <a name="n06020c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06020c">101</a> other things, wd never <a name="n06097j" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06097j">for
anything</a> take
<br><font color="green">{ms, 25}</font>
<br> so much trouble of so doing. And <a name="n06093f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06093f">why so?</a> Because I am altogether too hairy for the like of that. And by all I hold sacred I swear to you on my pipe &amp; oath by the name of Shaun that I will commit to the flames any incendiarist whoever who will try to set a mother of mine on fire. I will soho.</p>
<p> And big <a name="n10022i" href="../../ff/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10022i">hottempered</a> husky that he was he all but <a name="n10020c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10020c">broke down</a> over it for, sure, he was the <a name="n10050b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10050b">soft</a> of the world. Mind you, he was in the deepest of earnest about it orthough him jawr felt too hleepy to halk urthing
further <a name="n01029o" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01029o">Like that only</a> he stopped short &amp;, in looking up upon <a name="n01066b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01066b">the heavens as they were</a> to find out what age he might look by <a name="n10034j" href="../../ff/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10034j">Charles&apos; Wain</a>, he overbalanced by the mighty fine weight of the barrel and, as
the wisest course, collapsed together &amp; rolled backwards in a twinkling <a name="n10031k" href="../../ff/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10031k">via</a> Sane&apos;s corner out of further earshot, with his curious <a name="n10017a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10017a">slipashod</a> mode of motion a fairish &amp; easy way enough behind the times in the direction of MacAuliffe&apos;s
<a name="n05119g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05119g">crucet house</a>, before he was really uprighted.</p>
<p> Well, <a name="n07a02e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n07all.htm#n07a02e">it is to be regretted</a> that thou art passing hence, dear Shaun, from carnal relations &amp; familiar places, more is the pity, but, for all your deeds of goodness, as <a name="n05146i" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05146i">the humbler classes</a> can tell <a name="n06027n" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06027n">it is hardly
we can part you</a> may the moss of prosperousness gather you rolling home! May foggy dews bediamondise your hooprings! May the fireplug of filiality reinsure your bunghole! Well we know you were loth to leave, <a name="n06015h" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06015h">winding your horn</a>, right <a name="n10062e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10062e">royal post</a>, but, sure, treasure, you
<br><font color="green">{ms, 26}</font>
<br> will turn up some <a name="n10118h" href="../../ff/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10118h">boxing</a> day or other with yr pockets turned inside out, pending which in any case may the grass grow quickly under yr feet or the daisies trip lightly over yr toes.<a target="foot" id="fpz0008">&ordm;</a></p> </p>  </main>
