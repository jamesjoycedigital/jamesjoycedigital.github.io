Leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed that they had had ado each with

spoke to him fully gently. But, said he, or it be long too she will bring forth
by God His bounty and have joy for she hath waited marvellous long. And the
franklin that had drunken said, Expecting each moment to be her next. Also he
took the cup that stood tofore him for him needed never none asking nor desiring
of him to drink and Now drink, said he, fully
delectably<font color="red"><sup><small>(4</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>4)</small></sup></font>
and he quaffed as far as he might to their both&apos;s health for he was a
passing good man of his lustiness. And sir Leopold that was the goodliest guest
that ever sat in scholars&apos; hall and that was the meekest man and the
kindest that ever laid husbandly hand under hen and that was the very

<p> Now let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent
<br><font color="green">{u21, 432}</font>
<br> to be drunken an they might. There was a sort of scholars along either side
the board, that is to wit, Dixon yclept junior
<font color="red"><sup><small>(4</small></sup></font><font color="black">of

medicine<font color="red"><sup><small>(4</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>4)</small></sup></font>
and the franklin that hight Lenehan and one from Alba Longa, one Crotthers, and
young

that had mien of a frere that was at head of the board and Costello that men
clepen Punch Costello all long of a mastery of him erewhile gested (and of all

he was the most drunken that demanded still of more mead) and beside the meek
sir Leopold. But on young Malachi they waited for that he promised to have come
and such as intended to no goodness said how he had broke his avow. And sir
Leopold sat with them for he bore fast friendship to sir Simon and to this his
son young Stephen and for that his languor becalmed him there after longest
wanderings insomuch as they feasted him for that time in the honourablest
manner. Ruth red him, love led on with will to wander, loth to leave.</p>
<p> For they were right witty scholars. And he heard their aresouns each gen
other as touching birth and righteousness, young Madden maintaining that put
such case it were hard the wife to die (for so it had fallen out a matter of
some year agone with a woman of Eblana in Horne&apos;s house that now was
trespassed out of this world and the self night next before her death all
leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her
case<font color="red"><sup><small>(4</small></sup></font><font color="black">)</font><font color="red"><sup><small>4)</small></sup></font>.
And they said farther she should live because in the

the woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that were of this
imagination affirmed how young Madden had said truth for he had conscience to
let her die. And not few and of these was young Lynch were in doubt that the
world was now right evil governed as it was never other howbeit the mean people
believed it otherwise but the law nor his judges did provide no remedy. This was
scant said but all cried with one acclaim the wife should live and the babe to
die. And they waxed hot upon that head what with argument and what for their
drinking but the franklin Lenehan was prompt to pour them ale so that at the least way mirth
<br><font color="green">{u21, 433}</font>
<br> might not lack. Then young Madden showed all the whole affair

that she was dead and how for holy religion sake her goodman husband would not

us and nature has other ends than we. Then said Dixon junior to Punch Costello

of him was that he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she were or wife or maid

reason of a strange humour which he would not bewray and also for that he rued

that he had heard of those nefarious deeds and how, as he heard hereof counted,
he had besmirched the lily virtue of a confiding female which was corruption of
minors and they all intershowed it too, waxing merry

for he was the eternal son and ever virgin. Thereat mirth grew in them the more

as they might all mark and shrank together and his pitch that was before so
haught uplift was now of a sudden quite plucked down and his heart shook within
the cage of his breast as he tasted the rumour of that storm. Then did some mock
and some jeer and Punch Costello fell hard again to his yale which Master
<br><font color="green">{u22, 377}</font>
<br> Lenehan vowed he would do after and he was indeed but a word and a blow on
any the least colour. But the braggart boaster cried that an old Nobodaddy was
in his cups it was muchwhat indifferent and he would not lag behind his lead.
But this was only to dye his desperation as cowed he crouched in Horne&apos;s
hall. He drank indeed at one draught to pluck up a heart of any grace for it
thundered long rumblingly over all the heavens so that Master Madden, being
godly certain whiles, knocked him on his ribs and Master Bloom, at the
braggart&apos;s side, spoke to him calming words to slumber his great fear,
advertising how it was no other thing but a hubbub noise that he heard, the
discharge of fluid, look you, having taken
place<font color="red"><sup><small>(4</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>4)</small></sup></font>
and all of the order of a natural phenomenon.</p>
<p> But was young Boasthard&apos;s fear vanquished by Calmer&apos;s words? No,
for he had in his bosom
<font color="red"><sup><small>(4</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">that
gnawing rat Wretchedness</span></span> <font color="black">a spike named
Bitterness</font><font color="red"><sup><small>4)</small></sup></font> which
could not by words be done away. And was he then neither calm like the one nor
godly like the other? He was neither as much as he would have liked to be
either. But could he not have endeavoured to have found again as in his youth

Why<font color="red"><sup><small>(4</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>4)</small></sup></font>
he could not but hear unless he had plugged him up the tube Understanding (which
he had not done). For through that tube he saw that he was in the land of
Phenomenon where he must for a certain one day die as he was like the rest too a
passing show. And would he not accept to die like the rest and pass away? By no
means would he though he must nor would he make more shows according as
<br><font color="green">{u21, 440}</font>
<br> men do with wives which Phenomenon has commanded them to do by the book
Law. Then wotted he nought of that other land which is called

Frank (that was his name), &apos;tis all about Kerry cows that are to be

with their bully beef, a pox on it. There&apos;s as good fish in this tin as
ever came out of it and very friendly he offered to take of some salty sprats

familiar with the justiciary and the parish beadle than with his volumes. One

and a bullseye into the bargain, says he, and a plumper and a portlier bull,
says he, never shit on shamrock. He had horns galore, a coat of cloth of gold
and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his nostrils so that the women of our
island, leaving doughballs and rollingpins, followed after him hanging his
bulliness in daisychains. What for that, says Mr Dixon, but before he came over
farmer Nicholas that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by

german the lord Harry tells you and take a farmer&apos;s blessing, and with that
he slapped his posteriors very soundly. But the slap and the blessing stood him
friend, says Mr Vincent, for to make up he taught him a trick worth two of the
other so that maid, wife, abbess and widow to this day affirm that they would
rather any time of the month whisper in his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get
a lick on the nape from his

holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young ravisher in the four fields
of all Ireland. Another then put in his word: And they dressed him, says he, in
a point shift and petticoat with a tippet
<font color="red"><sup><small>(4</small></sup></font><font color="black">and
girdle</font><font color="red"><sup><small>4)</small></sup></font> and ruffles

and rubbed him all over with spermacetic oil and built stables for him at every
turn of the road with a gold manger in each full of the best hay in the market
so that he
<font color="red"><sup><small>(4</small></sup></font><font color="black">could</font><font color="red"><sup><small>4)</small></sup></font>
doss and dung to his heart&apos;s content. By this time the father of the

he would

<font color="black">suffer</font><font color="red"><sup><small>4)</small></sup></font>
nought to grow in all the land but green grass for himself (for that was the
only colour to his mind) and there was a board put up on a hillock in the middle of the

is the grass that grows on the ground. And, says Mr Dixon, if ever he got scent
of a cattleraider in Sligo or a husbandman that was sowing as much as a handful
of mustard or a bag of rapeseed out he&apos;d run amok over half the countryside
rooting up with his horns

says Mr Vincent, and the lord Harry called farmer Nicholas all the old Nicks in
the world and an old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house and
I&apos;ll make that animal smell hell, says he, with the help of that good
pizzle my father left me. But one evening, says Mr Dixon, when the lord Harry
was cleaning his royal pelt to go to dinner after winning a boatrace (he had
spade oars for himself but the first rule of the course was that the others were
to row with pitchforks) he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull
and on picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he found
sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous champion bull of
the Romans, Bos Bovum, which is good bog Latin for

some relish of it
<font color="red"><sup><small>(4</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">and</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>4)</small></sup></font>
all the more as it jumped with a project of his own for the cure of the very
evil that had been touched on. Whereat he handed round to the company a set of

project, as he went on to expound, was to withdraw from the round of idle
pleasures such as form the chief business of sir Fopling Popinjay and sir
Milksop Quidnunc in town and to devote himself to the noblest task for which our
bodily organism has been framed. Well, let us hear of it, good my friend, said Mr Dixon. Come, be

consideration of the causes of sterility, both the inhibitory and the
prohibitory, whether the inhibition in its turn were due to conjugal vexations
or to

balance</font><font color="red"><sup><small>4)</small></sup></font> as well as
whether the prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from proclivities
acquired. It grieved him plaguily, he said, to see the nuptial couch defrauded
of its dearest pledges: and to reflect upon so many agreeable females with rich
jointures, a prey

the vilest bonzes, who hide their flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial
cloister or lose their womanly bloom in the embraces of some unaccountable
muskin when they might multiply the inlets of happiness, sacrificing the
inestimable jewel of their sex when a hundred pretty fellows were at hand to
caress, this, he assured them, made his heart weep. To

proposed to set up there a national fertilising farm to be named Omphalos and to
offer his dutiful yeoman services for the fecundation of any female of what

homily which he delivered with much warmth of asseveration Mr Mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief with

favourably entertained by his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though
Mr Dixon of Mary&apos;s excepted to it, asking with a finicking air did he
purpose also to carry coals to Newcastle. Mr Mulligan however made court to the
scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which, as it dwelt upon his
memory, seemed to him a sound and cogent support of his contention:

he now applied himself to his dress with animadversions of some heat upon the
sudden shower while the company lavished their encomiums upon the project he had
advanced. The young gentleman, his friend, overjoyed as he was at a passage that
had
<font color="red"><sup><small>(4</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">late</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>4)</small></sup></font>
befallen
him<font color="red"><sup><small>(4</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>4)</small></sup></font>
could not forbear to tell it his nearest neighbour. Mr Mulligan, now perceiving
the table, asked for whom were those loaves and fishes and, seeing the stranger,
he made him a civil bow and said, Pray, sir, was you in need of any professional
assistance we could give? Who, upon his offer, thanked him very heartily, though
preserving his proper distance, and replied that he was come there about a lady,
now an inmate of Horne&apos;s
house<font color="red"><sup><small>(4</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>4)</small></sup></font>
that was in an interesting condition, poor body, from woman&apos;s woe (and here
he fetched a deep sigh) to know if her happiness had yet taken place. Mr Dixon,
to turn the table, took on to ask of Mr Mulligan himself whether his incipient
ventripotence, upon which he rallied him, betokened an ovoblastic gestation in
the prostatic utricle or male womb or was
due<font color="red"><sup><small>(4</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>4)</small></sup></font>

<br> a wolf in the stomach. For answer Mr Mulligan smote himself bravely below
the diaphragm, exclaiming with an admirable droll mimic of Mother Grogan (the
most excellent creature of her sex though &apos;tis pity she&apos;s a trollop):
There&apos;s a belly that never bore a bastard. This was so happy a conceit that
it renewed the

He had run on in the same vein of mimicry but for some larum in the antechamber.</p>

congratulated in the liveliest fashion with the young gentleman and,
interrupting the narrative at a salient point, having desired his visavis with a
polite beck to have the obligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at
the same time by a questioning poise of the head (a whole century of polite
breeding had not achieved so nice a gesture) to which was united an equivalent
but contrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was ever
done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it. <i>Mais bien sur</i>, said
he cheerily. That you may and very opportunely. There wanted nothing but this
cup to crown my felicity. But was I left with but a crust in my wallet and
<font color="red"><sup><small>(4</small></sup></font><font color="black">a<a target="foot" id="fpp0133">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>4)</small></sup></font>
cupful of water from the well, my God, I would accept of them and find it in my
heart to kneel down upon the ground and give thanks to the powers above for the
happiness vouchsafed me. With these words he approached the goblet to his
lips<font color="red"><sup><small>(4</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>4)</small></sup></font>
took a complacent draught of the cordial, slicked his hair and, opening his
bosom, out popped a locket that hung from a silk riband, that very picture which
he had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein. Gazing upon those
features with a world of tenderness, Ah, Monsieur, he said, had you but beheld
her at that affecting instant with her dainty tucker and her
<font color="red"><sup><small>(4</small></sup></font><font color="black">new</font><font color="red"><sup><small>4)</small></sup></font>
coquette cap (a gift for her feastday as she told me

in such an artless disorder, of so melting a tenderness, even you, Monsieur, had
been impelled by generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands of
such an enemy or to quit the field for ever.

<br> I declare, I was never so touched in all my life. Thrice happy will he be
whom that amiable creature will bless with her favours. A sigh of affection gave
eloquence to these words and, having replaced the locket in his bosom, he wiped
his eye and sighed again. Beneficent disseminator of blessings to all

malice have been sown and where no right reverence is rendered to mother and
maid in house of Horne. Having delivered himself of this rebuke he saluted those
present on the by and repaired to the door. A murmur of approval arose from all
and some were for ejecting the low soaker without more ado, a design which would
have been effected had he not abridged his transgression by affirming with a
horrid imprecation (for he swore a round hand) that he was as good a son of the
true fold as ever drew breath. Stap my vitals, said he, them was always the
sentiments of honest Frank Costello which I was bred up most particular to

of the proprieties though their fund of strong animal spirits spoke in their

thought of that missing link of creation&apos;s
<br><font color="green">{u21, 453}</font>
<br> chain desiderated by the late ingenious Mr Darwin. It was now for more than
the middle span of our allotted years that he had passed through the thousand
vicissitudes of existence and, being of a wary ascendancy and self a man of
<font color="red"><sup><small>(4</small></sup></font><font color="black">a</font><font color="red"><sup><small>4)</small></sup></font>
rare forecast, he had enjoined his heart to repress all motions of a rising
choler and, by intercepting them with the readiest precaution, foster within his
breast that plenitude of sufferance which base minds jeer at,
<font color="red"><sup><small>(4</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>4)</small></sup></font>

themselves wits at the cost of feminine delicacy to them he would concede
neither to bear the name nor to herit the tradition of a proper breeding: while
for such that, having lost all forbearance, can lose no

<font color="black">and</font><font color="red"><sup><small>4)</small></sup></font>

a gentlewoman when she was about her lawful occasions. To conclude, while from
the sister&apos;s words he had reckoned upon a speedy delivery he was, however,
it must be owned, not a little alleviated by the intelligence that the issue so
auspicated after
<font color="red"><sup><small>(4</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">a

ordeal</font><font color="red"><sup><small>4)</small></sup></font> of such
duress now testified once more to the mercy as well as to the bounty of the Supreme Being.</p>
<p> Accordingly he broke his mind to his
neighbour<font color="red"><sup><small>(4</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>4)</small></sup></font>
saying that, to express his notion of the thing, his opinion (who ought not
perchance to express one) was that one must have a cold constitution and a
frigid genius not to be rejoiced by this freshest news of the fruition of her
confinement since she had been in such pain through no fault of hers. The dressy
young blade said it was her husband&apos;s that put her in that expectation or
at least it ought to be unless she were another Ephesian matron. I must acquaint you, said Mr Crotthers,

preferring through his nose a request to have word of Wilhelmina, my life, as he

<br> calls her. I bade him hold himself in readiness for that the event would
burst anon. &apos;Slife, I cannot but extol the virile potency of the old bucko
that could still knock another child out of her. All fell to praising of it,
each after his
<font color="red"><sup><small>(4</small></sup></font><font color="black">own</font><font color="red"><sup><small>4)</small></sup></font>
fashion, though the same young blade held with his former view that another than

<font color="black">had
been</font><font color="red"><sup><small>4)</small></sup></font> the man in the
gap, a clerk in orders or an itinerant vendor of articles needed in every
household. Singular, muttered the guest to himself, the wonderfully unequal
faculty of metempsychosis possessed by them, that the puerperal

and the dissecting theatre should be the seminaries of such frivolity, that the
mere acquisition of academic titles should suffice to transform in a pinch of
time these votaries of levity into exemplary practitioners of an art which most
men anywise eminent have esteemed the noblest. But, he further added, it is
mayhap to relieve the pentup feelings that in common oppress them for I have
more than once observed that birds of a feather laugh together.</p>
<p> But with what fitness, let it be asked, has this alien, whom the concession
of a gracious prince has admitted to civic rights, constituted himself the lord
paramount of our

<font color="black">internal</font><font color="red"><sup><small>4)</small></sup></font>
polity? Where is now that gratitude which loyalty should have counselled? During
the recent war whenever the enemy had a temporary advantage with their granados
did he not seize that moment to discharge his piece against the empire
<font color="red"><sup><small>(4</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">in</span></span>
<font color="black">of</font><font color="red"><sup><small>4)</small></sup></font>
which he is a tenant at will while he trembled for the security of his four per
cents? Has he forgotten this as he forgets
<font color="red"><sup><small>(4</small></sup></font><font color="black">all</font><font color="red"><sup><small>4)</small></sup></font>
benefits received? Or is it that from being a deluder of others he has become at
last his own dupe as he is, if report belie him not, his own and his only
enjoyer? Far be it from candour to violate the bedchamber of a respectable lady,
the daughter of a gallant major, or to cast the most distant reflections upon
her virtue but if he challenges attention there (as it was indeed highly his
interest not to have done) then be it so. Unhappy woman, she has been too long
and too persistently denied her legitimate prerogative to listen to his
objurgations with any other feeling than the derision of the desperate. He says
this, a censor of morals, a very pelican in his

In the question of the grazing lands his peevish asperity is notorious and in Mr
Cuffe&apos;s hearing brought upon him from an indignant rancher a scathing
retort couched in terms as straightforward as they were bucolic. It ill becomes
him to preach that gospel. Has he not nearer home a seedfield that lies fallow
for the want of

ploughshare? A habit reprehensible at puberty is second nature and an opprobrium
in middle life. If he must dispense his balm of Gilead to restore to health a
generation of unfledged profligates let his practice consist better with the
doctrines that now engross him. His marital breast is the repository of secrets
which decorum is reluctant to adduce. The lewd suggestions of some faded beauty
may console him for a

which, when rooted in its native orient, throve and flourished and was abundant
in balm but, transplanted to a clime more temperate, its roots have lost their
quondam vigour while the stuff that comes away from it is stagnant, acid and inoperative.</p>

<br> them? If I call them into life across the waters of Lethe will not the poor
ghosts troop to my call? Who supposes it? I, Bous Stephanoumenos,

in bloom: the air drooped with their

The gods too are ever kind, Lenehan said. If I had poor luck with Bass&apos;s
mare perhaps this draught of his may serve me more propensely. He was laying his
hand upon a winejar: Malachi saw it and withheld his act, pointing to the
stranger
<font color="red"><sup><small>(4</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">then</span></span>
<font color="black">and</font><font color="red"><sup><small>4)</small></sup></font>
to the scarlet label. Warily, Malachi whispered, preserve a druid silence. His
soul is far away. It is as painful perhaps to be awakened from a vision as to be
born. Any object, intensely regarded, may be a gate of access to the
incorruptible eon of the gods. Do you not think it, Stephen? Theosophos told me
so, Stephen answered, whom in a previous existence Egyptian priests initiated
into the mysteries of karmic law. The lords of the moon, Theosophos told me, an

<p> However, as a matter of fact though, the preposterous surmise about him

<font color="black">or

entirely due to a misconception of the shallowest character, was not the case at
all. The individual whose visual organs while the above was going

<font color="black">observations</font><font color="red"><sup><small>4)</small></sup></font>

and<font color="red"><sup><small>(4</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>4)</small></sup></font>
perceiving that he was endeavouring to help himself to the
thing<font color="red"><sup><small>(4</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>4)</small></sup></font>
he involuntarily determined to help him himself and so he accordingly took hold

time, however, a considerable degree of attentiveness in order not to upset any

<br><font color="green">{u22, 397}</font> </p>
<p> The debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome of the
course of life. Neither place nor council was lacking in dignity. The debaters
were the keenest in the land, the theme they were engaged on the loftiest and
most vital. The high hall of Horne&apos;s house had never beheld an assembly so
representative and so varied nor had the old rafters of that establishment ever
listened to a language so encyclopaedic. A gallant scene in truth it made.
Crotthers was there at the foot of the table in his striking Highland garb, his
face glowing from the briny airs of the Mull of Galloway. There too, opposite to
him, was Lynch whose countenance bore already the stigmata of early depravity
and premature wisdom. Next the Scotchman was the place assigned to Costello, the
eccentric<font color="red"><sup><small>(4</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>4)</small></sup></font>
while at his side was seated in stolid repose the squat form of Madden. The

<br><font color="green">{u21, 464}</font>
<br> stood vacant before the hearth but on either flank of it the figure of
Bannon in explorer&apos;s kit of tweed shorts and salted cowhide
brogues<font color="red"><sup><small>(4</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>4)</small></sup></font>
contrasted sharply with the primrose elegance and townbred manners of Malachi
Roland St John Mulligan. Lastly at the head of the board was the young poet who
found a refuge from his labours of pedagogy and metaphysical inquisition in the
convivial atmosphere of Socratic discussion while to right and left of him were
accomodated the flippant prognosticator, fresh from the hippodrome, and that
vigilant wanderer, soiled by the dust of travel and combat and stained by the
mire of an indelible
dishonour<font color="red"><sup><small>(4</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>4)</small></sup></font>

steadfast and constant heart no lure or peril or threat or degradation could
ever efface the image of that voluptuous loveliness which the inspired pencil of
Lafayette has limned for ages yet to come.</p>
<p> It had better be stated here and now at the outset that the perverted
transcendentalism to which Mr S. Dedalus&apos; (Div. Scep.) contentions would
appear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter to accepted
scientific methods. Science, it cannot be too often repeated, deals with
tangible phenomena. The man of science has to face hardheaded facts that cannot
be blinked and explain them as best he can. There may be, it is true, some
questions which science cannot answer &mdash; at present &mdash; such as the
first
problem<font color="red"><sup><small>(4</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>4)</small></sup></font>

too true the case he cites of nurses forgetting to count the sponges in the

into it the wonder is that so many pregnancies and deliveries go off so well as
they do, all things considered and in spite of our human shortcomings which

nature in her intentions. An ingenious suggestion is
<font color="red"><sup><small>(4</small></sup></font><font color="black">that</font><font color="red"><sup><small>4)</small></sup></font>
thrown out by Mr V. Lynch (Bacc. Arith.) that both natality and mortality, as
well as all other phenomena of evolution, tidal movements, lunar phases, blood
temperatures, diseases in general, everything, in fine, in nature&apos;s vast
workshop from the extinction of some remote sun to the blossoming of one of the
countless flowers which beautify our public parks is subject to a law of
numeration as yet unascertained. Still the plain straightforward question why a child of normally healthy parents

and properly looked after succumbs unaccountably in early childhood (though other children of the
<br><font color="green">{u22, 399}</font>
<br> same marriage do not) must certainly, in the poet&apos;s words, give us
pause. Nature, we may rest assured, has her own good and valid reasons for
whatever she does and in all probability such deaths are due to some law of
anticipation by which organisms
<font color="red"><sup><small>(4</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">where</span></span>
<font color="black">in
which</font><font color="red"><sup><small>4)</small></sup></font> morbous germs
have taken up their residence (modern science has conclusively shown that only
the plasmic substance can be said to be immortal) tend to disappear at an
increasingly earlier stage of development, an arrangement which, though
productive of pain to some of our feelings (notably the maternal) is
nevertheless in the long run beneficial to the race in general in securing
thereby the survival of the fittest. Mr S. Dedalus&apos; (Div. Scep.) remark (or
should it be called an interruption?) that an omnivorous being which can
masticate, deglute, digest and apparently pass through the ordinary channel with

<p> There are sins or (let us call them as the world calls them) evil memories
which are hidden away by man in the darkest places of the heart but they abide
there and wait. He may suffer their memory to grow dim, let them be as though
they had not been and all but persuade himself that they were not or at least
were otherwise. Yet a chance word will call them forth suddenly and they will
rise up to confront him in the most various circumstances, a vision or a dream,
or while timbrel and harp soothe his senses or amid the cool silver tranquility
of the evening or at the

observer&apos;s memory. A shaven space of lawn one soft May evening, the
wellremembered grove of lilacs at Roundtown, fragrant slender spectators of the
game but with much real interest in the pellets as they run slowly forward over
the sward or collide and stop, one by its fellow, with a brief alert shock. And
yonder about that grey urn where the water moves at times in thoughtful
irrigation you saw another as fragrant sisterhood, Floey, Atty, Tiny and their
