Manly ruth his errand was that him love led<a target="foot" id="fpz0040">&ordm;</a> to that house.</p>
<p> Of that house A. Horne is lord. Seventy beds keeps he there (where) teeming
mothers are wont that they lie for to bring forth bairns hale as so God&apos;s
angel to Mary quoth. Watchers twey there walk, white sisters in ward sleepless.
Smarts they still, sickness soothing: in <u>twelve</u> moons thrice an hundred.
Truest bedthanes they

<p> In ward wary the watcher hearing come that man mildhearted eft rising with

would fordo with water for his evil sins. Christ&apos;s rood made she on

<p> Loth to irk in Horne&apos;s hall<a target="foot" id="fpz0041">&ordm;</a> hat
holding the seeker stood. On her stow he ere was living with liefest wife and
<a name="s14065b" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14065b">lovesome</a> daughter that then over

meeting he to her bow had not doffed. Her to forgive now he craved with good
ground by her allowed, that that of him swiftseen face, hers, so young then had
looked. Light swift her eyes kindled, bloom of blushes his word winning.</p>
<p> As her eyes then ongot his weeds swart for that sorrow she feared. Glad
after she was that ere adread was. Her he asked if O&apos;Hare Doctor tidings
sent and she
<a name="s14065a" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14065a">grameful</a> him
answered that O&apos;Hare Doctor in heaven was. Sorry was the man a word to hear
<a name="s14023q" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14023q">that him so
heavied</a>. All she there told him, ruing death for so young man algate
unwilling God&apos;s rightwiseness to withsay. She said that he had a fair death
through God&apos;s goodness with masspriest to be
<a name="s14004da" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14004da">shriven him</a>, the
holy housel to eat and sick men&apos;s oil to his limbs. The man then right
earnest asked the nun of which death the dead man was died and the nun answered
him and said that he was died through bellycrab in Mona island three-year agone
come Yule and she prayed to God Allruthful to have his dear soul in his
<a name="s14008t" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14008t">undeathliness</a>. He
heard her sad words, in held hat, sore staring.

<p> Therefore, all men, look to that last end that is thy death and the dust
that gripeth on every man that is born of woman for as he came naked forth of
his mother&apos;s womb so naked shall he wend him at the last for to go as he came.</p>
<p> The man that was come into the house then spoke to the nursing woman and he
asked her how it fared with the woman that lay there in childbed. The good
nursing woman answered him and said that that woman was in throes now full three
days and that it would be a hard birth
<a name="s14010d" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14010d">unneth</a> to bear but
that now in a little it would be. She said thereto that she had seen many births
of women but never was none so hard as was that woman&apos;s birth. Then she set
it forth all to him

for that they were knights

<a name="s14004bf" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14004bf">fully gently</a>.
But, said he, or it be long too she will bring forth by God his bounty and have
joy for she hath waited marvellous long. And the franklin that had
drunken<a target="foot" id="fpz0050">&ordm;</a> said, Expecting each moment to
be her next. Also he took the cup that stood
<a name="s14026b" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14026b">tofore</a> him for him
needed never<a target="foot" id="fpz0051">&ordm;</a> none asking nor desiring of
him to drink and Now drink, said he
<a name="s14004an" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14004an">full delectably</a>,
and he quaffed as far as he might to their both&apos;s health for he was a
passing good man of his lustiness. And sir Leopold that was the goodliest guest
that ever sat in scholars&apos; hall and that was the meekest man and the
kindest that ever laid husbandly hand under hen and that was the very gentlest
knight that ever did minion service to lady gentle pledged him courtly in the
cup. Woman&apos;s woe with wonder weening.</p>
<p> Now let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be
drunken an they might. There was a sort of scholars along either side the board,
that is to wit, Dixon yclept junior with other his fellows Lynch and Madden,
scholars of medicine and the franklin that hight Lenehan and one from Alba
Longa, one Crotthers, and young Stephen, that had mien of a frere, that was at head of the board,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 4}</font>
<br> and Costello that men clepen
<a name="s14051bb" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14051bb">Bighead</a> Costello
all long of a mastery of him erewhile gested (and of all them, reserved young
Stephen, he was the most drunken that demanded still of more mead) and beside
the meek sir Leopold. But on young Malachi they waited for that he promised to
have come and such as intended to no goodness said how he had broke his avow.
And sir Leopold sat with them for he bore fast friendship to sir Simon, and to
this his son young Stephen, and for that his languor
<a name="s14009da" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14009da">becalmed</a> him
there after longest wanderings insomuch as they feasted him for that time in the
honourablest manner. Ruth rede him, love led on with will to wander loth to
leave. Loth to move from Horne&apos;s house</p>
<p> For they were right witty scholars. And he heard their quarrels each gen
other as touching birth and righteousness, young Madden maintaining that put
such case it were hard the wife to die (for so it had fallen out a matter of
some years agone<a target="foot" id="fpz0052">&ordm;</a> with a woman of Eblana
in Horne&apos;s house that now was trespassed out of this world) and the self
night next before her death all they had taken counsel as many as were there.
And they said farther she should live because in the beginning, they said, the
woman should bring forth in pain and travail and wherefore they that were of this imagination affirmed
<br><font color="green">{ms, 5}</font>
<br> how young Madden had said truth for he had conscience to let her die. And
not few &amp;<a target="foot" id="fpz0053">&ordm;</a> of these was young Lynch,
were in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it was never other,
howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise, but the law nor his judges did
provide no remedy. This was scant said but all cried with one acclaim the wife
should live sith she was God&apos;s creature as well as other and the babe to
die. And they waxed hot upon that head, what with argument and what for their
drinking, but the franklin Lenehan was prompt to pour them ale so that at the
least way mirth might not lack. Then young Madden showed all the whole affair
and when they had heard her case how that she was dead and how her goodman
husband for holy religion would not let her death whereby they were one and all
wondrous grieved. To whom young Stephen had these words following: Murmur is eke
oft among low folk.<a target="foot" id="fpz0054">&ordm;</a> Sirs, pity is meet
always, but if meet here for this unborn child how then for those unborn that we
daily do to death. For, sirs, he said, our mickle of lust is brief,
<a name="s14051ah" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14051ah">We are means to
those small creatures.</a> but nature, giving that, had other ends. Then said
Dixon junior to him that hight Punch Costello wist he what ends. But he had
overmuch drunken and the best word he could have of him was that he would ever
dishonest a woman whoso she were; were she wife or maid or leman, if so be it
fortuned him to be delivered of his spleen of lustihood. Whereat young Stephen presently poured him
<br><font color="green">{ms, 6}</font>
<br> mead<a target="foot" id="fpz0055">&ordm;</a> in his cup, saying it was well
said if not well done. And Crotthers of Alba Longa sang praise of that beast the
unicorn of Malachi, after sir Binnetto, how once in the millenium he cometh by
his horn, he all that while, pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they did
malice him, witnessing all and several, by saint Bastard his engines, that he
was able by grace of his privities to do any manner of thing that lay in man to
do. Thereat laughed they all right jocundly only young Stephen and sir Leopold
which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour which he would
not bewray and also for that he rued for her that bare whoso she might be or
wheresoever. Then spake young Stephen orgulous of mother church that would cast
him out, of law of canons, of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of brightness or
by potency of demons as divers fable or

<a name="s14021q" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14021q">Also he showed how on
the ninth day a soul rational was infused</a> and how in all our heavenly mother
foldeth aye souls for God&apos;s greater<a target="foot" id="fpz0056">&ordm;</a>
glory whereas that earthly mother, that was but a dam to bring forth beastly,
should die by canon for so saith he that holdeth the fisherman&apos;s seal, even
that blessed Peter on which rock was holy church for all ages builded. All they
bachelors then asked of sir Leopold would he in like case so jeopard her person
as risk life to save life. A wariness of mind he would answer as fitted all and
<a name="s14062cg" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14062cg">laying hand to
jaw</a> said dissembling, as it was informed him and agreeing also with his
experience of so seldom seen an accident so it was good for that mother Church
<br><font color="green">{ms, 7}</font>
<br> belike<a target="foot" id="fpz0057">&ordm;</a> at one blow had birth and
death pence. That is truth, then said Dixon junior, and, or I err, a pregnant
word.<a target="foot" id="fpz0058">&ordm;</a> In such sort deliverly he scaped
their questions. Which hearing young Stephen was a marvellous glad man and he
averred that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the
Lord<a target="foot" id="fpz0059">&ordm;</a> for he was ever of a wild humour
when he had much drunken, and that he was now in that taking it appeared eftsoons.</p>
<p> But sir Leopold was passing grave, maugre his word, by cause he still had
pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their
<a name="s14014a" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14014a">labour</a> and
moreover he was minded of his good lady Marion that had borne him an only
manchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art could save
so dark is destiny. And<a target="foot" id="fpz0060">&ordm;</a> she was wondrous
stricken of heart for that evil hap and to his burial, sore weeping, did him on
a fair corselet of lamb&apos;s wool, the flower of the flock, lest he might
perish utterly and lie akeled (for it was that time about the midst of the
winter): and now sir Leopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked
upon him, his friend&apos;s son, and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed
happiness and as sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage, for
all accomted<a target="foot" id="fpz0061">&ordm;</a> him of real parts, so
grieved he also in no less measure for young Stephen for that he lived riotously
with those wastrels and murdered his goods with whores.</p>

it. And greater love than this, said he, no man hath that a man lay down his

<p> But was young braggart&apos;s fear vanquished by calmer&apos;s words? No,
for he knew his own wretchedness which could not by words be done away. And was
he then neither calm like the one nor godly like the other? He was neither as
much as he would have liked to be either. But could he not have endeavoured to
have found again as in his youth the natural piety that then he lived withal?
Indeed no for grace was not there to give it. Heard he then in that clap the
voice of the god Bringforth or, what calmer said, a
<a name="s14015o" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14015o">hubbub</a> of
phenomenon? Heard? Why he could not but hear both of those things unless
peradventure he had sealed him up understanding (which he had not done). For
understanding told him that he was in the land of phenomenon where he must
certainly one day die as he was too like the rest a passing show. And would he
not accept to die like the rest and pass away? He would not though he must nor
would he make more shows according as men do with wives which phenomenon has
commanded them to do by his law. Then wotted he nought of that other land which
is called Believe on Me that is the true land of behest which is all delightful
and shall be for ever where there is also no death and no birth, neither wiving
nor mothering at which all shall come as many as believe on it? Yes: Pious had
told him of that land and Chaste had pointed him to the way but the reason was
that in the way he fell in with a certain whore whose name, she said, is
Bird-in-the-Hand of an eyepleasing exterior and she beguiled him wrongways from
the true path by her flatteries to him that
<br><font color="green">{ms, 2}</font>
<br> he was a very pretty man and so she had him in her grot of shame which is
named <u>Two in the Bush</u> or, by some learned also, <u>Carnal Concupiscence</u>.</p>
<p> This was it what all that company that sat there at commons in Manse of
Mothers the most lusted after and if they met with
with<a target="foot" id="fpz0067">&ordm;</a> this whore Bird in the Hand (which
was within all foul plagues, monsters and a devil) they would strain all but
they would <a name="s14015j" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14015j">make at
her</a> and know her. For regarding Believe on Me they said it was nought else
but notion and they could conceive no thought of it for, first, Two in the Bush
whither she ticed them was the very goodliest grot and in it were four bowers
which were called Dalliance and Loth to Brood and Chamber Delights and Harlotry
and, second, for that foul plague Allpox and monsters they cared not for them
for Preservative had given them a stout shield of oxengut and, third, that they
might take no hurt neither from Offspring that was a noxious devil by virtue of
this same shield which was named Killchild. So were they all in their blind
fancy, Mr Godly and Mr Cavil, Mr Ape Swillale, Mr False Franklin, Mr Dainty
Dixon, Young Boasthard and Mr Cautious Calmer. Wherein, O wretched company, were
ye all deceived for that was the voice of the god that was in a most grievous
rage that he would presently lift his arm spill their souls for their abuses and
their spillings done by them contrariwise to his word which forth to bring brenningly biddeth.</p>

to find it about him (for he swore with an oath he had been at pains about it)
but on Stephen&apos;s persuasion he gave over to search and was bidden to sit
near by which he did mighty brisk. He was a kind of sport gentleman that
<a name="s14072ac" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14072ac">went for a</a>
merryandrew or honest pickle and what belonged of women, horseflesh or new
scandal in the town he knew it pat. To tell the truth he was mean in fortunes
and for the most part hankered about the coffeehouses and low taverns with
crimps, ostlers &amp;

tongue, some randy quip he had from a punk or whatnot that every mother&apos;s
son of them would burst their sides. The other, Costello that is, hearing this
talk asked was it poetry or a tale. Faith no, he says, Frank, (that was his

bestquoted cowcatcher in all Muscovy with a bolus or two of physic to take the
bull by the horns. Come, come, says Mr Lynch, plain dealing. He&apos;ll find
himself soon on the horns of a dilemma if he meddles with a bull that&apos;s
Irish, says he. Irish she is, says Mr Stephen, as he sent the ale purling about,
an Irish bull in an English chinashop. I conceive you, says Mr Dixon, It is that
same bull that was sent to our island by a certain Farmer
<br><font color="green">{ms, 3}</font>
<br> Nicholas, the bravest cattlebreeder of them all with an emerald ring in his
nose. True for you, says Mr Lynch cross the table, and a bullseye into the
bargain, says he, and a plumper and a portlier bull never shit on shamrock. He
had horns galore and a coat of cloth of gold and sweet smoky breath coming out
of his nostrils so that the women of our island, leaving pots and rollingpins,
followed after him everywhere, hanging his bulliness in daisychains. What for
that, says Mr Dixon, but before he came farmer Nicholas that was a eunuch had
him properly gelded by seven cowcatchers that were no better off than himself,
So be off now, says he with a farmer&apos;s blessing and do all my cousin german
the lord Harry tells you and with that<a target="foot" id="fpz0074">&ordm;</a>
he slapped his posteriors very soundly. But the slap and the blessing stood him
friend, says Mr Lynch, for to make up he taught him a trick worth two of the
other so that maid, wife, abbess and widow to this day affirm they would rather
any day of the month whisper in his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick
on the neck from his long tongue than lie with the finest strapping young
ravisher in the four fields of all Ireland. Another then put in his word: And
they dressed him, says he, in a loose shift and petticoat with a tippet too and
clipped his forelocks and rubbed him with
<a name="un5007bc" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5007bc">spermacetic</a> oil
and they built a great barn for him with a gold manger in it full of the best
hay in the market for by this time the father of the faithful (for so they called him) was so heavy
<br><font color="green">{ms, 4}</font>
<br> he could scarce walk to pasture. To remedy which our dames and damsels
brought him his fodder in their apronlaps, and, as soon as his belly was full,
he used to rear up on his hind quarters to show their ladyships a mystery and
roar and bellow in bull&apos;s language and they all after him. Ay, says
another, and so pampered was he he would have nought growing in all the land but
green<a target="foot" id="fpz0075">&ordm;</a> grass for himself (for that was
the only colour to his mind) and there was a board put up on a hillock in the
middle of the island with a notice printed on it, saying: By the Lord Harry
Green is the grass that grows on the ground. And if ever he got scent of a
cattleraider in the wilds of Sligo of a husbandman that was sowing as much as a
handful of mustard or a bag of rapeseed he&apos;d run amok over half the
countryside<a target="foot" id="fpz0076">&ordm;</a> rooting up with his horns
whatever was planted and all by Lord Harry&apos;s orders. At first there was bad
blood between them because the lord Harry had a quarrel with his cousin farmer
Nicholas and called him Old Nick and an old whoremaster and I&apos;ll make that
animal <a name="jn2039b" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2039b">smell hell</a>,
says he, with the help of that good
<a name="s12004e" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004e">pizzle</a> my father
left me. But one evening when the lord Harry was
<a name="un5007bd" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5007bd">cleaning his royal
pelt</a> for a great time after winning a boatrace (he had spade oars for
himself but one of the rules of the course was that the others were to row with
pitchforks) he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and on
looking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he found he was a
<a name="un4039cp" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4039cp">lefthand</a>
descendant of the famous Roman champion bull named Bos Bovum which is good
<a name="s14063aa" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14063aa">bog latin</a> for
Boss of the Show. After that the lord Harry
<br><font color="green">{ms, 5}</font>
<br> and the bull of Ireland were as fast friends as an arse and a shirt. They
were, says Mr Lynch, and the end was that the men of the island seeing no help
was toward, as the ungrate women were all of the one mind, made a raft of
timbers, loaded themselves and their chattels aboard, set all masts erect,
spread three sheets in the wind, ran up the Jolly Roger

Mulligan now appeared in the doorway as the student was concluding his apologue
accompanied with a friend of his a young gentleman whom he had just
rencountered, his name Seymour who had lately come up to town, it being his
intention to <a name="s14025i" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14025i">buy a
colour</a> or cornetcy and list for the wars. Mr Mulligan was obliging enough to
express some relish of it and all the more as it jumped with a project of his
own for the cure of the very evil which had been touched on. Whereat (Saying
which), he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards which he had
had printed that day at Thom&apos;s, and on which was printed in flowing italics
the legend: Mr Malachi Mulligan, Fertiliser &amp;

causes of sterility, both the inhibitory and the prohibitory, whether the
inhibition in its turn were due to conjugal vexations or to parsimony as well as
whether the prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from proclivities
acquired. It grieved him

concluded it due to a suppression of latent heat, having advised with certain

there, this flesh of these latter
<a name="s14032bs" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14032bs">prolific</a> being
highly recommended for his purpose, both broiled and stewed. After this homily,
which he delivered with much warmth of asseveration, Mr Mulligan in a

hat a kerchief with which he had sheltered it. They both had been surprised by
the rain, it seems, and for all their mending their pace had taken water as
might be seen from Mr Mulligan&apos;s suit of a hodden grey which was now
somewhat piebald. His project meanwhile was very favourably entertained by his
audience Mr Dixon of Mary&apos;s

asking with a

to the scholarly by an apt
<a name="s14082d" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14082d">quotation</a> from the
classics which as it dwelt upon his memory, seemed a confirmation

of his contention. Talis ac tanta depravatio huius seculi, O quirites, ut

those of ruder wit he drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom
more suitable to their relishes, the buck and doe of the field, the domestic drake and duck.</p>
<p> Valuing himself not a little upon his elegance being indeed
<a name="s14013cd" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14013cd">a proper man of
person</a> he now applied himself to his dress with animadversions of some
spleen upon the sudden shower while the company lavished their encomiums upon
the project he had advanced. The young gentleman, his friend, overjoyed as he
was at a passage that had lately befallen him could not forbear to tell it his
nearest neighbour of it. Mr Mulligan now perceiving the table asked for whom
those loaves and fishes were and then, seeing the stranger, he made him a civil
bow and said, Pray, sir, was you in need of any
professional<a target="foot" id="fpz0080">&ordm;</a> assistance we can give? Who
upon his offer thanked him very heartily, though preserving his proper distance,
and made return that he was come there about a lady of Horne&apos;s house that
was in an interesting condition, poor body, from woman&apos;s woe (and he here
fetched a deep sigh) to hear if her happiness had yet taken place. Mr Dixon
still rallying a little upon that plan
<a name="un5007s" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5007s">took on to ask</a> of
Mr Mulligan whether his incipient
<a name="s14084r" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14084r">ventripotence</a>, on
which he rallied him, betokened

<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font> Mr
Mulligan smote himself bravely below the diaphragm, exclaiming with an admirable
droll mimic of Mother Grogan (the most excellent creature of her sex though
&apos;tis pity she&apos;s a trollop). There&apos;s a belly that never bore a
bastard. This was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storm of mirth and
threw the whole room into the most violent agitations of delight. He had run on in the same vein of mimicries but for

<p> Here the listener who was none other than the student from Perth,
<a name="s14042ah" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14042ah">a little fume of a
fellow</a>, congratulated in the liveliest fashion with the young gentleman,
and, interrupting the narrative at a salient point, and having desired his vis a
vis with a polite beck to have the obligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial
waters at the same time by a questioning poise of the head (a whole century of
polite breeding had not achieved so nice a gesture) to which was united an
equivalent but contrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as
was ever done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it. Mais bien
s&ucirc;r, said he cheerily, That you may and very opportunely. There wanted
nothing but this cup to crown my felicity. But was I left with but a crust in my
wallet and a cupful of water from the well My God I would freely accept of it I
could find it in my heart to kneel down upon the ground and
thanks<a target="foot" id="fpz0081">&ordm;</a> the powers above for the
happiness vouchsafed me. With these words he
<a name="s14041b" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14041b">approached the
goblet</a> to his lips and took a complacent draught of the cordial, slicked his
hair and opening his bosom out popped a locket that hung from a silk ribbon,
that very picture which he had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein.
Gazing upon those features with a world of tenderness, Ah, Monsieur, he said,
had you but beheld her at that affecting instant with her dainty tucker &amp;
the coquette little cap awry, (a gift for her feast day, as she told me
prettily), in such an artless disorder, of so melting a tenderness, even you, Monsieur, I weigh had been impelled by the
<br><font color="green">{ms, 5}</font>
<br> generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands of such an enemy
or to quit the field for ever. I declare, I was never so touched in all my life.
Thrice happy will he be whom that amiable creature will bless with her favours.
A sigh of affection gave eloquence to these words and, having replaced the
locket in his bosom, he wiped his eyes and sighed again. Beneficent distributor
of blessings to all thy creatures, how great &amp; universal must be that
sweetest of thy tyrannies which can hold in thrall, the free &amp; the bond, the
simple swain and the polished coxcomb, the lover in the heyday of reckless
passion and the husband of maturer years.

to God, he exclaimed in anguish, that foresight had but remembered me to take my
cloak along! I could weep to think of it. Then, though it had poured seven
showers, we were neither of us a penny the worse. But, beshrew me, he cried,
clapping hand to his forehead, tomorrow will be a new day. I know of a
clothier&apos;s where I can have for a livre as pretty a cloak as ever kept a
lady from wetting. Tut, cries Le Fecondateur, tripping in, my friend Monsieur
Moore, that most accomplished traveller (I have just cracked a bottle with him)

even the stoutest, cloak. A drenching of that violence, he tells me, has sent

philosopher, to fix my attention, gently tipped with her tongue the edge of my
ear) the first is a bath &mdash; But at this point a bell in the hall, tinkling
most untimely, cut short a discourse which had promised so bravely for the enrichment of our store of knowledge.</p>
<p> Amid the general vacant hilarity of the assembly the bell rang and while all
were conjecturing what might be the cause the good Miss Callan came in and,
having spoken a few words to young Mr Dixon, retired with a profound bow to the
company. The presence even for a moment among a party of debauchees of a woman
endued with every quality of modesty and not less severe than beautiful
refrained even the humour of the most licentious but her departure was the
signal for an outbreak of ribaldry. Strike me silly,

company to excuse his retreat as the nurse had just then informed him that he
was needed in the ward. Merciful providence had been pleased to

<p> To revert to Mr Bloom, who, after his first entry had been conscious of some
impudent mocks he, however, had borne with them as being the fruits of that age
upon which it is commonly charged that it knows not pity. The young
<a name="s14044a" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14044a">sparks</a> were full
of extravagancies,
<a name="s14048ag" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14048ag">it was true</a>,
like overgrown children, and the words of their tumultuary discussions were
difficultly understood and not often nice: their testiness and outrageous mots
were such that his nature resiled from: nor were they scrupulously
<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">unread</span></font>
of the proprieties though their fund of strong animal spirits spoke in their
behalf. But the word of Mr Costello was an unwelcome language for him for in he
nauseated the man that seemed to him a creature of misshapen
<a name="s14040n" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14040n">gibbosity</a> got in
some uncouth way and
<a name="s14058i" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14058i">come, like a
crookback, toothed feet first into the world</a> so as to put him in thought of
that missing link in the chain of beings desiderated by the late ingenious Mr
Darwin. It was <a name="s14047f" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14047f">now for
more than the middle span of our allotted years that</a> he had passed through
the thousand vicissitudes of existence and, being of a wary ascendance and self
a man of rare forecast, he had enjoined his heart to repress all motions of a
rising choler and, by intercepting them with the readiest precaution, foster
within his breast that
<a name="s14009ap" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14009ap">plenitude</a> of
sufferance which <a name="s14045k" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14045k">base
minds jeer at, the hasty scorn and all</a> find tolerable and but tolerable. To
those who create themselves wits at the cost of feminine delicacy to them he
would concede neither to bear the name nor to inherit the tradition of nice
breeding: while for such that, having lost all forbearance, can lose no more,
there remained the sharp antidote of experience to cause their insolency to beat
<br><font color="green">{ms, 2}</font>
<br> an inglorious retreat. Not but what he could feel with mettlesome youth
which, caring nought for the
<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font> of
dotards or the gruntlings of the severe, is ever for eating of the tree forbid
it yet not so far forth as to pretermit humanity upon any condition soever
towards a gentlewoman when she was about her lawful occasions. To conclude,
while from the sister&apos;s words, when questioned, he had reckoned upon a
speedy delivery he was, however, it must be owned, not a little alleviated by
the intelligence that the issue so auspicated after a trial of such duress now
testified once more to the mercy as well as to the bounty of the Supreme Being.</p>
<p> Accordingly he broke his mind to his neighbour saying that to express his
notion of the thing, his opinion (who ought not perhaps to express one) was that
one must have a cold constitution and a cold genius not to be rejoiced by this
freshest news of the fruition of her confinement since she had been in such pain
through no fault of hers. The dressy young spark said it was her husband&apos;s
fault that put her up the spout or at least it ought to be unless she were
another Ephesian matron. I must acquaint you, said Mr Crotthers, clapping on the
table so as to evoke a resonant comment of emphasis,
<a name="s14070m" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14070m">old Glory
Allujerum</a> was round today, a short meagre man with whiskers, preferring a
request to have word of Wilhelmina his life as he calls her. I bade him hold
himself in readiness for that the event would burst anon. For my part I cannot
but extol the virile potency of the old bucko that could still knock another
child out of her. All fell to praising of it, each after his fashion, though the
same young spark held with his former view that another
<br><font color="green">{ms, 3}</font>
<br> than<a target="foot" id="fpz0085">&ordm;</a> he a clerk in orders or
<a name="s14051i" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14051i">an itinerant
vendor</a> of articles necessary in every household was the man in the gap.
Singular, muttered the guest to himself, the wonderfully unequal faculty of
metempsychosis possessed by them, that the puerperal chamber and the dissecting
theatre should be the seminaries of such mirth and that the mere acquisition of
academic honours should suffice to transform in a pinch of time these votaries
of levity into exemplary practitioners of an art which most men anywise eminent
esteem the noblest. But, he further added, it is but to relieve the pentup
feelings that in common oppress them for I have more than once observed that birds of a feather laugh together.</p>
<p> But with what fitness, let it be asked, has this alien whom the concession
of a gracious prince has admitted to civic rights constituted himself the lord
paramount of our domestic polity? Where is now that gratitude which loyalty
should have counselled? During the recent war whenever the enemy had a temporary
advantage with their
<a name="s14024bd" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14024bd">granados</a> did he
not seize <a name="s14080aa" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14080aa">that
moment</a> to discharge his piece against the empire in which he is a tenant at
will while he trembled for the security of his four per cents? Has he forgotten
this as he forgets benefits received? Or is it that from being a deluder of
others he has become his own dupe as he is if report belie him not his own and
his only enjoyer? Far be it from candour to violate the bedchamber of a
respectable lady, the daughter of a gallant major, or to cast the most distant
reflections upon her virtue but if he challenges attention there (as it was
indeed highly his interest not to have done) then be it so. Unhappy woman, she
has been too long and too persistently denied her legitimate
<br><font color="green">{ms, 4}</font>
<br> prerogative<a target="foot" id="fpz0086">&ordm;</a> to listen to his
objurgations with any other feeling than the derision of the desperate. He says
this, a censor of morals,
<a name="s14013s" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14013s">a very pelican in his
piety</a> who did not scruple, oblivious of the
<a name="s14037cb" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14037cb">ties of nature</a>,
to enter into illicit relations with a domestic servant drawn from the lowest
strata of society. Nay, was not the

not shield her

honour. In the question of the grazing lands his
<a name="s14037ca" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14037ca">peevish asperity</a>
is notorious and in Mr Cuffe&apos;s hearing brought upon him from an indignant
cattlebreeder a rebuke as straightforward as they were bucolic. It ill becomes
him to preach that gospel. Has he not himself nearer home a seedfield that lies
fallow for the want of a ploughshare. A habit reprehensible at puberty is
<a name="s14037av" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14037av">second nature</a>
and an opprobrium in middle life. If he must dispense balm of Gilead to restore
to health a generation of unfledged profligates let his practice consist better
with the doctrines that now engross him. His marital breast is the repository of
secrets which decorum is reluctant to adduce. the lewd suggestion of some faded
and beauty may console him for a consort, neglected &amp; debauched, but this
new exponent of natural philosophy and healer of ills is at best an oriental
tree, which when rooted in its native Orient throve abundant in balm, but
transplanted, its roots have lost their vigour while the stuff that comes away
from it is stagnant <a name="s14077ak" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14077ak">acid</a> and inoperative.</p>

the women&apos;s apartment in her company to assist at the prescribed ceremony
of the afterbirth the delegates, chafing under the length &amp; solemnity of

which the simultaneous absence of abigail and officer rendered the easier, broke
out at once into a strife of tongues. In vain the voice of Mr Canvasser Bloom

propitious for the display of that discursiveness which seemed the sole bond of
union among tempers so varied and divergent. Every phase of the situation was

genius of the polished Latin poet has handed down to us. The impression made by
his words on an assembly so mobile was immediate but shortlived. It was effaced

times that Lex talionis a sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring
the immense debtorship for a thing done. Malachi ceased, overcome. The mystery

murdered his brother. Hamlet, the black panther, was himself the ghost of his

reminiscence the staid agent of publicity as he sits there. A score of years are
blown away: He is young Leopold. There in a retrospective arrangement, as in a
mirror within a mirror, he beholdeth himself. That young figure of then is seen
walking on a nipping morning from the old house in Clanbrassil Street to the
high school, his satchel on him bandolier with his books and a goodly hunk of
wheaten loaf. Or it is the same figure, a years gone over, in its first hard hat
(Ah, that was a day!), already on the road, a fullfledged traveller for the
family firm equipped with a orderbook, a scented handkerchief not for show only,
his case of bright trinketware
(<a name="s14051f" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14051f">a thing of the past

generations that have lived. A region where grey twilight ever descends and
never falls on the wide sagegreen pasturefields, shedding her
dusk<a target="foot" id="fpz0090">&ordm;</a> scattering a perennial dew of
stars. She follows her mother with ungainly steps, a mare leading her filly
foal. Twilight phantoms are they yet moulded in prophetic grace of structure,
slim shapely haunches, the supple tendonous neck, the meek apprehensive skull.
They fade, sad phantoms, and all is gone. Agendath is a waste land, a home of
screechowls and the sandblind upupa: Netaim, the golden, is no more. And on the
highway of the clouds they come, muttering thunder of rebellion, the ghosts of
beasts. Huuh! Hark! Huuh! Parallax stalks behind &amp; goads them the
lancinating lightnings of whose brow are scorpions. Elk and yak, the bulls of

it flows about her starborn flesh, and loose it streams, emerald,

sustained on cold currents of interstellar wind, winding, coiling, simply

<p> Francis was<a target="foot" id="fpz0094">&ordm;</a> reminding Stephen of
years before when they had been at school in Conmee&apos;s time. He asked about
Patrick and James and other friends. Where were they now? Neither knew. You have
spoken of the past and its phantoms, Stephen said. Why think of them? If I call
them into life across the waters of Lethe will the poor ghosts not troop to my
call? Who supposes it? I, Bous Stephanoumenos, am lord and giver of their life.

Vincent. The answer and those leaves, Vincent said to him, will adorn you more

of his promise and of his recent loss. He would have withdrawn from the feast
had not the noise of voices allayed the smart. Madden had lost five sesterces on
Sceptre. Lenehan as much more. He told them of the race. The flag fell and,

the field. All hearts were beating even Phyllis waved her scarf She could not
contain herself and cried: Sceptre wins. But on the run home in close order

said with a light sigh, she is not the filly that she was. Never
<a name="un5007ag" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5007ag">by this hand</a>,
shall we behold such another, a queen of them. Do you remember her, Vincent? I
wish you could have seen my queen today, Vincent said. How young she was and
radiant in her tan shoes and frock of muslin. I do not know the right name of
it. The <a name="s14073n" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14073n">chestnuts were
in bloom</a> about us: Shading us, the air was drooping with their persuasive
odour and with

by. In the sunny patches one might have

blithe and mocked at peril. She is more taking then, Her posies too! Mad romp
that she is she had pulled her fill as we lay together. And in your ear, my
friend, he said to Francis, you will not imagine who met us as we left the
field. Conmee himself. He was walking by the hedge reading a

think, with perhaps a witty letter of Glycera&apos;s to tell the page The sweet
creature turned all colours in her confusion, feigning to reprove a slight
disorder of her dress: a slip of undergrowth clung there for the very trees
adore her. When Conmee had passed she glanced at her lovely echo in the little
glass she carries. But he was kind to us: in going by he blessed us. The gods
too are ever kind, Lenehan said. If I had poor luck with Bass&apos;s mare
perhaps this draught of his may serve me more propensely. He was laying his hand
upon a winejar: Malachi saw it and withheld his act: he pointed to the stranger
and then to the scarlet label. Warily, Malachi whispered. Preserve a druid
silence. His soul is far away. It is as painful perhaps to be awakened from a
vision as to be borne. Any object, intensely regarded, may be a gate of access
to the incorruptible eon of the gods. Do you not think it, Stephen? Theosophos
told me so, Stephen answered. Him in a
<a name="s14031e" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14031e">previous existence</a>
Egyptian priests initiated into their mysteries
<a name="s14070ah" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14070ah">of karmic law</a>.
The lords of the moon, Theosophos told me, an orangetawny shipload from planet
Alpha of the lunar chain would not assume the etheric doubles and these were therefore incarnated by the

<br> rubycoloured<a target="foot" id="fpz0096">&ordm;</a> egos from the second constellation.</p>
<p> However, as a matter of fact though the preposterous surmise about him being
in some sort of a
<a name="s14070ak" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14070ak">doldrums</a> or
other which was entirely due to a misconception of the shallowest description,
was not the case at all. The individual whose visual organs

was going on, were at this juncture commencing to exhibit symptoms of animation
was as astute or astuter than any man living and anyone that conjectured the
contrary would have discovered themselves pretty quickly mistaken. During the
last 4 minutes or thereabouts after the momentbefore&apos;s observation about
boyhood days and the turf, he had been staring at a certain amount of number one
beer, bottled by Bass &amp; Co at Burton on Trent and which happened to be
situated right
<a name="s14058e" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14058e">amongst</a> where he
was and was certainly calculated to attract anybody&apos;s eye no matter whom on
account of its scarlet appearance. He was simply and solely
<a name="s14077ai" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14077ai">as it subsequently
transpired</a>, which put
<a name="s14084q" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14084q">an altogether
different complexion on the transaction</a>, recollecting two or three private
transactions of his own which the two others were as mutually innocent of as the
babe unborn. Eventually, however, both their eyes met and perceiving that the
other was endeavouring to help himself out of the bottle he involuntarily
determined to help him himself and so he accordingly took hold of the neck the
glass mediumsized recipient which contained the fluid sought after and made a
capacious hole in it by pouring a lot of it out with at the same time besides, a
considerable degree of attentiveness in order not to upset any of the beer that was in it around the place.</p>
<p> The debate which ensued was, in its scope and progress, an epitome of the
course of life.
<a name="s14083i" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14083i">Neither place nor
council was lacking</a>. The debaters were the keenest in the land. The theme
they were engaged on was the loftiest and most vital. The common hall of
Horne&apos;s house had never beheld an assembly so representative and so varied
nor had the old walls of that establishment ever listened to a language so
encyclopaedic. <a name="un5007ah" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5007ah">A gallant scene it made.</a>

striking highland garb, his face glowing from the briny airs of the Mull of
Galloway, sat opposite to Lynch whose countenance born already the stigmata of
early depravity and premature wisdom. Next the Scotchman was the place assigned
to Costello, the eccentric, while at his side was seated, in stolid repose, the
squat form of Madden of Thurles. The chair of the resident indeed stood vacant
before the hearth but on either side of it the figure of Bannon, in
explorer&apos;s kit of tweed shorts &amp; brogues of
<a name="s14083l" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14083l">salted cowhide</a>
contrasted sharply with the primrose elegance and townbred manners of Malachi
Roland St John Mulligan. Lastly at the head of the board was the young poet who
found a refuge from his labours of pedagogy and metaphysical inquisition in the
convivial atmosphere of Socratic discussion while to right and left of him were
seated the flippant prognosticator, fresh from the hippodrome, and the vigilant
wanderer, soiled by the dust of travel &amp; conflict and stained by the mire of
an indelible disgrace, but from whose steadfast and constant heart no lure or
peril or threat or degradation could ever efface the image of that voluptuous
female loveliness which the inspired pencil of Lafayette has limned for ages to come.</p>
<p> It had better be stated at the
<a name="s14082o" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14082o">outset</a> that the
perverted transcendentalism to which Mr Stephen Dedalus&apos; Div. Scep.
contentions would appear to prove him

addicted runs directly counter to accepted scientific methods. Science, it
cannot be too often repeated, deals with tangible phenomena. The man of science
has to face hardheaded facts
<a name="s14060i" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14060i">that won&apos;t be
blinked</a> and explain them as best he can. There may be, it is true,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 5}</font>
<br> some<a target="foot" id="fpz0098">&ordm;</a> questions which science cannot
answer &mdash; at present &mdash; such as the first problem submitted by Mr
Bloom Mat. Mag. regarding the determination of sex the sex of her child if a
lady happens to become
<a name="s14050n" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14050n">enceinte</a>. Are we
we accept the view of Empedocles of Trinacria that the right ovary is
responsible for the birth of males or the belief which holds that the
<a name="s14084aa" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14084aa">nisus formativus</a>
is the posture of the passive element or again are the too long neglected
spermatozoa the differentiating factors or is it, as more advanced embryologists
such as Lusk, Hertwig, Leopold and Valenti

<a name="s14084v" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14084v">Blumenbach</a>
Spallazani, are inclined to opine, a mixture of both? The other problem raised
by the same inquirer though of a different description is scarcely less vital:
that of infant mortality. It is interesting because as he very pertinently
observes in this connection we are all born in the same way but we all die in
different ways. Cand. Mulligan Hyg et Eug Doc blames the hygienic conditions in
which our greylunged citizens contract adenoids, pulmonary complaints, etc by
inhaling the germs that lurk in dust. These factors and the disgusting spectacle
to which the eyes of women were accustomed of our streets, hideous posters,
denominational ministers,

were accountable for the falling of the race Kallipedia, he prophesied, will
soon be adopted in every house when a birth was expected and all the graces of
life, really good music, agreeable literature, light philosophy, pleasant
pictures, with attendant plastercast reproductions of classical statues such as
Venus and Apollo would permit a prospective mother to pass her preganancy in a
most enjoyable manner. Dr Crotthers Discp. Bac attributes it to neglect, whether
private or official. Although the former is unfortunately only too true the case
he cites of nurses forgetting to count the sponges from the peritoneal cavity is
too rare to be normative. An ingenious explanation is furnished by Mr Lynch B.
Arith. that both natality &amp; mortality, like all other natural phenomena of
<a name="s14062ar" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14062ar">evolution</a>, tidal
movements, lunar phases, blood temperature, diseases in general, everything, in
a word, in nature&apos;s vast workshop from the extinction of some remote sun to
the blossoming of one of the countless flowers which beautify our public parks is subject to a law of
<br><font color="green">{ms, 6}</font>
<br> number<a target="foot" id="fpz0099">&ordm;</a> as yet unascertained. Still
the plain straightforward question why a child of normal healthy parents and
seemingly a healthy child and properly looked after succumbs unaccountably in
early childhood or youth (though other children of the same marriage do not)
must certainly, as the poet sings, give us pause. Nature, we may rest assured,
has her own good
<a name="s14042ad" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14042ad">&amp; cogent</a>
reasons for whatever she does and in all probability such deaths are due to some
law of anticipation by which organisms where morbous germs have taken up their
residence (modern science has conclusively shown that only the plasmic substance
can be said to be immortal) tend to disappear at an increasingly earlier stage
of development, an arrangement which, though productive of pain to some of our
feelings (notably the maternal) is nevertheless, all things considered, in the
long run beneficial to the race in securing thereby the survival of the fittest.
Mr Dedalus&apos; remark (or should it be called an interruption?) that an

which took place in the students&apos; hall of the National Maternity hospital
in Holles Street of which, as is well known, sir A. Horne MB is the
distinguished director he is reported as having stated that once a woman has let
the cat into the bag she must let it out again or give it life (as he phrased
it) to save her own. At the risk of her own was the telling rejoinder of his
interlocutor none the less effective for the moderate tone in which it was delivered.</p>
<p> Meanwhile the skill and patience of the physician had brought about a happy
