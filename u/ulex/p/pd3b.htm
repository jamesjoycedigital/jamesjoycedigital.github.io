<p class="pdi">&mdash; Now could you, of course, decent Shaun, we knew, while still in the barrel, read the strangewritten Shem language of those <a name="n10066i" href="../../ff/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10066i">open</a> letter to His Em?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Read! Shaun replied. I could play it backwards like anything with my eyes shut and all. But it is awful bad on the hand. As far as that goes I associate myself with your remarks just now and quite agree in your description. It is a pinch of scribble. Flummery is what I would call it if you were to ask me my pronounced opinion about them bagses of trash which the mother and
<a name="n11049c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n11all.htm#n11049c">Mr Shem</a> has reduced to writing. <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">A child sail</span></span> An infant sailing eggshells on the floor of a wet day would have more sabby.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 42}</font> </p>
<p> Letter, carried by Shaun, son of Hek, written by Shem, brother of Shaun, for Alp, mother of Shem, about Hek, father of Shaun.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Kind Shaun, we all requested, since you came to the use of language have you not, without suggesting for an instant, millions of times used language ten times as worse as the slanguage used up by your celebrated brother Shem?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Celebrated? Shaun replied. Notorious I rather would feel inclined in myself in the first place to describe him as. But I would not like to be so insulting to my own self as to swear just for the moment positively as to the other but let me say my belief before my God is that I much doubt it. She, the mother, was put up to it by him, the iniquity, that ought to be placed in
irons into some institution for such matters if he could pass the panel doctor. Rot him! Flannelfeet! He&apos;s no cousin of mine. Nor wants to.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; May we petition you, clean Shaun, to unravel in your own words to your very humble and yours most respectfully, we suggested, as to how?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You may and welcome, Shaun replied. For three days she kept howling and bawling and him narrating to the pen with <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">a</span></span> his hiccup. It was entirely the latter to blame. It was given me to assist at the whole business by grace. They lasted fourteen hours.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 43}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But for what, Shaun of grace<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span>? we asked. Vouchsafe to say.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; For his language, Shaun replied, which he put inside his letter.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But you could come near it, we suppose, strong Shaun, we supposed.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No-one could, Shaun replied, as I have before said for it&apos;s being incendiary.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Still in a way, we fancy, you that are so brainy in yourself could use worse yourself, ingenious Shaun, we still fancied, if only you would take the trouble of so doing it.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Undoube</span></span> Undoubtedly but that is show, Shaun replied, and by the powers of war I could do it any time ever I liked as, you see, I am extremely ingenious even with my left hand and as easy as a keg of beer and it would far exceed what that bogus bolshy of a Shem is conversant with and one of those fine days I will be
moved to do it just like a work of merit, mark my words, that will open your eye for you, brother boor, only for as an amateur and a hundred and one other things I would never for anything take so much trouble of so doing. And why so? Because I am altogether a chap too fly and hairy for to do the like of that. And by all I hold sacred I swear to you on my pipe and oath by the name of Shaun that I
will commit to the flames any incendiarist whosoever who would endeavour to set
<br><font color="green">{ms, 44}</font>
<br> to set a mother of mine on fire. I will soho.</p>
<p> And big hottempered husky such as he was he all but broke down over it for, sure, he was the soft of the world. Mind you<a target="foot" id="fpz0012">&ordm;</a> that he was in the dumpest of earnest<a target="foot" id="fpz0013">&ordm;</a> orthough him jawr war hoo hleepy hor halk urthing further. Like that only he stopped short and in looking up upon the heavens as they were to feel out what
age he might find by Charles&apos; Wain he overbalanced by the mighty fine weight of the barrel and, as the wisest course he could take, collapsed together and rolled backwards in half a twinkling via Rattigan&apos;s corner out of further earshot with his highly curious mode of slipashod motion a fairish and easy way enough behind the times in the direction of MacAuliffe&apos;s, the crucet house,
before he was really uprighted.</p>
<p> Well, it is to be regretted that thou art passing hence, dear Shaun, from carnal relations and familiar faces, more is the pity, but for all your deeds of goodness, as our humbler classes can tell, it is hardly we can part you. Musha, be thinking of us sometime or other whenever you find time. And may the moss of prosperousness gather you rolling home! May foggy dews bediamondise your
hooprings! May the fireplug of filiality reinsure your bunghole! &apos;Tis well we know you were loth
<br><font color="green">{ms, 45}</font>
<br> to leave us, winding your hobbledehorn, right royal post, but sure, pulse of our slumber, you will round up some boxing day or other with your pockets turned inside out and from that till this in any case may the grass grow quickly under your feet and the daisies trip lightly over your toes!<a target="foot" id="fpz0014">&ordm;</a></p> </p>  </main>
