Once <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">only in throng they

<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Her</span></span> He her asked if
Doctor O&apos;Hare tidings sent and she with sad look answered
<br><font color="green">{ms, 3v}</font>
<br> that Doctor O&apos;Hare in heaven was. Sorry was the man that to hear. All
she there told him, ruing death of one so young but unwilling God&apos;s
rightwiseness to withsay, that he had a fair death by God&apos;s goodness with

men&apos;s oil. He asked her then right sad of which death he was dead and she
told him he was dead of bellycrab in Mona&apos;s island three years come Yule.
Sad he heard those words, in held hat sore staring.</p>
<p> Therefore, all men, look to this end that is death and the dust that gripeth
on <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">all</span></span> every man
that is born of woman and on all beastkind and fishkin that God made for as he
came forth of his mother&apos;s womb, naked shall he wend him to go as he came.</p>
<p> <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">He then asked</span></span>
The man that was come into the house then spoke to the nun and he asked her how
it fared with the woman that lay in
<a name="s14001w" href="../../FF/unbs/s14all.htm#s14001w">childbed</a>. She
answered him and said that that woman was in

<br> three days</a> and that it would be a hard birth to bear but that now it
would come. And she said that she had seen many births but never was none so
hard as was that
woman&apos;s<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span> birth
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">and</span></span> She set it forth
all to him as she knew the man that nine years agone had lived near that house
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">and</span></span>.
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">He weighed her words as she spoke
for she was not</span></span> and
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">said naught to her</span></span>.
The man hearkened to her words for he wondered at her face that was young to see
but yet was after long years always a maid.</p>
