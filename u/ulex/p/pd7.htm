For who is there who anything of some significance has apprehended but is
conscious that that exterior splendour may be the surface of a downwardtending
lutulent reality or on the contrary anyone so is there unilluminated as not to
perceive that as no nature&apos;s boon can contend against the bounty of
increase so it behoves every most just citizen to become the exhortator and
admonisher of his semblables and to tremble lest what had in the past been by
the nation excellently commenced might be in the future

<br> not with similar excellence accomplished if an inverecund habit shall have
gradually traduced the honourable by ancestors transmitted customs to that

hardihood to rise affirming that no more odious offence can for anyone be

<br> than to oblivious neglect to consign that evangel simultaneously command
and promise which on all mortals with prophecy of abundance or with
diminution&apos;s menace that exalted of reiteratedly procreating function ever irrevocably enjoined?</p>
<p> It is not why therefore we shall wonder if, as the best historians relate,
among the Celts, who nothing that was not in its nature admirable admired, the
art of medicine shall have been highly honoured. Not to speak of hostels,
leperyards, sweating chambers, plaguegraves, their greatest doctors, the
O&apos;Shiels, the O&apos;Hickeys, the O&apos;Lees, have sedulously set down the
divers methods by which the sick and the relapsed found again health whether the
malady had been the trembling withering or loose boyconnell flux. Certainly in
every public work which in it anything of gravity contains preparation should be
with importance commensurate and therefore a plan was by them adopted (whether
by having preconsidered or as the maturation of experience it is difficult in
being said which the discrepant opinions of subsequent inquirers are not up to
the present congrued to render manifest) whereby maternity was so far from all
accident possibility removed that whatever care the patient in that allhardest
of woman hour chiefly required and not solely for the copiously opulent but also
for her who not being sufficiently moneyed scarcely and often not even scarcely
could subsist valiantly and for an inconsiderable emolument was provided.</p>
<p> To her nothing already then and thenceforward was anyway able to be
molestful for this chiefly felt all citizens except with proliferent mothers

<p> Some man that wayfaring was stood by housedoor at night&apos;s oncoming. Of
Israel&apos;s folk was that man that on earth wandering far had fared. Stark
ruth of man his errand that him lone led till that house.</p>
<p> Of that house A. Horne is lord. Seventy beds keeps he there teeming mothers
are wont that they lie for to thole and bring forth bairns hale so God&apos;s
angel to Mary quoth. Watchers twey there walk, white sisters in ward sleepless.
Smarts they still, sickness soothing: in twelve moons thrice an hundred. Truest
bedthanes they twain are, for Horne holding wariest ward.</p>
<p> In ward wary the watcher hearing come that man mildhearted eft rising with

mankind would fordo with water for his evil sins. Christ&apos;s rood made she on

<p> Loth to irk in Horne&apos;s hall hat holding the seeker stood. On her stow

<br> he craved with good ground of her allowed that that of him swiftseen face,
hers, so young then had looked. Light swift her eyes kindled, bloom of blushes his word winning.</p>
<p> As her eyes then ongot his weeds swart therefor sorrow she feared. Glad
after she was that ere adread was. Her he asked if O&apos;Hare Doctor tidings
sent from far coast and she with grameful sigh him answered that O&apos;Hare
Doctor in heaven was. Sad was the man that word to hear that him so heavied in
bowels ruthful. All she there told him, ruing death for friend so young, algate
sore unwilling God&apos;s rightwiseness to withsay. She said that he had a fair
sweet death through God His goodness with masspriest to be shriven, holy housel
and sick men&apos;s oil to his limbs. The man then right earnest asked the nun
of which death the dead man was died and the nun answered him and said that he
was died in Mona island through bellycrab three year agone come Childermas and
she prayed to God the Allruthful to have his dear soul in his undeathliness. He
heard her sad words, in held hat sad staring. So stood they there both awhile in wanhope, sorrowing one with other.</p>
<p> Therefore, everyman, look to that last end that is thy death and the dust

his mother&apos;s womb so naked shall he wend him at the last for to go as he came.</p>
<p> The man that was come into the house then spoke to the nursingwoman and he
asked her how it fared with the woman that lay there in childbed. The
nursingwoman answered him and said that that woman was in throes now full three
days and that it would be a hard birth unneth to bear but that now in a little
it would be. She said thereto that she had seen many births of women but never
was none so hard as was that woman&apos;s birth. Then she set it forth all to
him that time was had lived nigh that house. The man hearkened to her words for
he felt with wonder women&apos;s woe in the travail that they have of motherhood
and he wondered to look on her face that was a young face for any man to see but
yet was she left after long years a handmaid. Nine twelve bloodflows chiding her childless.</p>
<p> And whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and there
<br><font color="green">{u21, 430}</font>
<br> nighed them a mickle noise as of many that sat there at meat. And there
came against the place as they stood a young learning knight yclept Dixon. And
the traveller Leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed that they had had
ado each with other in the house of misericord where this learning knight lay by
cause the traveller Leopold came there to be healed for he was sore wounded in
his breast by a spear wherewith a horrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him
for which he did do make a salve of volatile salt and chrism as much as he might
suffice. And he said now that he should go into that castle for to make merry
with them that were there. And the traveller Leopold said that he should go
otherwhither for he was a man of cautels and a subtile. Also the lady was of his
avis and repreved the learning knight though she trowed well that the traveller
had said thing that was false for his subtility. But the learning knight would
not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have him in aught contrarious to his
list and he said how it was a marvellous castle. And the traveller Leopold went
into the castle for to rest him for a space being sore of limb after many
marches environing in divers lands and sometime venery.</p>
<p> And in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of Finlandy and
it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not move more for
enchantment. And on this board were frightful swords and knives that are made in
a great cavern by swinking demons out of white flames that they fix in the horns
of buffalos and stags that there abound marvellously. And there were vessels
that are wrought by magic of Mahound out of seasand and the
<br><font color="green">{u22, 370}</font>
<br> air by a warlock with his breath that he blares into them like to bubbles.
And full fair cheer and rich was on the board that no wight could devise a
fuller ne richer. And there was a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open
in the which lay strange fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that
this be possible thing without they see it natheless they are so. And these
fishes lie in an oily water brought there from Portugal land because of the
fatness that therein is like to the juices of the olive press. And also it was a
marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a compost out of fecund wheat kidneys out of Chaldee that
<br><font color="green">{u21, 431}</font>
<br> by aid of certain angry spirits that they do into it swells up wondrously
like to a vast mountain. And they teach the serpents there to entwine themselves
up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales of these serpents they brew out a brewage like to mead.</p>
<p> And the learning knight let pour for childe Leopold a draught and halp
thereto the while all they that were there drank every each. And childe Leopold
did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat in amity for he
never drank no manner of mead
<font color="red"><sup><small>|7</small></sup></font><font color="black">which
he then <a name="un4021cu" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4021cu">put
by</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>7|</small></sup></font> and anon full
privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and his neighbour nist
not of his wile. And he sat down in that castle with them for to rest him there awhile. Thanked be Almighty God.</p>
<p> This meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them at the
reverence of Jesu our alther liege Lord to leave their wassailing for there was
above one quick with child, a gentle dame, whose time hied fast. Sir Leopold
heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered what cry that it was whether of
child or woman and I marvel, said he, that it be not come or now. Meseems it
dureth overlong. And he was ware and saw a franklin that hight Lenehan on that
side the table that was older than any of the tother and for that they both were
knights virtuous in the one emprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke
to him fully gently. But, said he, or it be long too she will bring forth by God
His bounty and have joy for she hath waited marvellous long. And the franklin
that had drunken said, Expecting each moment to be her next. Also he took the
cup that stood tofore him for him needed never none asking nor desiring of him
to drink and, Now drink, said he, fully delectably, and he quaffed as far as he
might to their both&apos;s health for he was a passing good man of his
lustiness. And sir Leopold that was the goodliest guest that ever sat in
scholars&apos; hall and that was the meekest man and the kindest that ever laid
husbandly hand under hen and that was the very
<font color="red"><sup><small>|7</small></sup></font><font color="black">truest</font><font color="red"><sup><small>7|</small></sup></font>
knight of the world one that ever did minion
<br><font color="green">{u22, 371}</font>
<br> service to lady gentle pledged him courtly in the cup. Woman&apos;s woe with wonder pondering.</p>
<p> Now let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent
<br><font color="green">{u21, 432}</font>
<br> to be drunken an they might. There was a sort of scholars along either side
the board, that is to wit, Dixon yclept junior of saint Mary Merciable&apos;s
with other his fellows Lynch and Madden, scholars of medicine, and the franklin
that hight Lenehan and one from Alba Longa, one Crotthers, and young Stephen
that had mien of a frere that was at head of the board and Costello that men
clepen Punch Costello all long of a mastery of him erewhile gested (and of all
them, reserved young Stephen, he was the most drunken that demanded still of
more mead) and beside the meek sir Leopold. But on young Malachi they waited for
that he promised to have come and such as intended to no goodness said how he
had broke his avow. And sir Leopold sat with them for he bore fast friendship to
sir Simon and to this his son young Stephen and for that his languor becalmed
him there after longest wanderings insomuch as they feasted him for that time in
the honourablest manner. Ruth red him, love led on with will to wander, loth to leave.</p>
<p> For they were right witty scholars. And he heard their aresouns each gen
other as touching birth and righteousness, young Madden maintaining that put
such case it were hard the wife to die (for so it had fallen out a matter of
some year agone with a woman of Eblana in Horne&apos;s house that now was
trespassed out of this world and the self night next before her death all
leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her case). And they said farther
she should live because in the beginning they said the woman should bring forth
in pain and wherefore they that were of this imagination affirmed how young
Madden had said truth for he had conscience to let her die. And not few and of
these was young Lynch were in doubt that the world was now right evil governed
as it was never other howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the law
nor his judges did provide no remedy. This was scant said but all cried with one
acclaim nay, by our Virgin Mother, the wife should live and the babe to die. In
colour whereof they waxed hot upon that head what with argument and what for
their drinking but the franklin Lenehan was prompt

<br><font color="green">{u21, 433}</font>
<br> might not lack. Then young Madden showed all the whole affair and when he
said how that she was dead and how for holy religion
sake<font color="red"><sup><small>|7</small></sup></font><font color="black">,

<br><font color="green">{u22, 372}</font>
<br> had these words following, Murmur, sirs, is eke oft among lay folk. Both
babe and parent now glorify their Maker, the one in limbo gloom, the other in

said, our lust is brief. We are means to those small creatures within us and
nature has other ends than we. Then said Dixon junior to Punch Costello wist he
what ends. But he had overmuch drunken and the best word he could have of him
was that he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or leman
if it so fortuned him to be delivered of his spleen of lustihead. Whereat
Crotthers of Alba Longa sang young Malachi&apos;s praise of that beast the
unicorn how once in the millennium he cometh by his horn the other all this
while pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they did malice him, witnessing
all and several by saint Foutinus his engines that he was able to do any manner
of thing that lay in man to do. Thereat laughed they all right jocundly only
young Stephen and sir Leopold which never durst laugh too open by reason of a
strange humour which he would not bewray and also for that he rued for her that
bare whoso she might be or wheresoever. Then spake young Stephen orgulous of
mother Church that would cast him out of her bosom, of law of canons, of bigness
wrought by wind of seeds of brightness or by potency of vampires mouth to mouth
or, as Virgilius saith, by the influence of the occident or

peradventure in her bath according to the opinions of Averroes and Moses
Maimonides. He said also how at the end of the second month a human soul was
infused and how in all our holy mother foldeth ever souls for God&apos;s greater
glory whereas that earthly mother which was but a dam to bring forth
<br><font color="green">{u21, 434}</font>
<br> beastly should die by canon for so saith he that holdeth the
fisherman&apos;s seal, even that blessed Peter on which rock was holy church for
all ages founded. All they bachelors then asked of sir Leopold would he in like
case so jeopard her person as risk life to save life. A wariness of mind he
would answer as fitted all and, laying hand to jaw, he said dissembling, as his
wont was, that as it was informed him, who had ever loved the art of physic as
might a layman, and agreeing also with his experience of so seldom seen an
accident it was good for that mother Church belike at one blow had birth and
death pence and in such sort deliverly he scaped their questions. That is truth,
pardy, said Dixon, and, or I err, a pregnant word. Which hearing young Stephen
was a marvellous glad man and he averred that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth
<br><font color="green">{u22, 373}</font>
<br> to the Lord for he was of a wild manner when he was drunken and that he was
now in that taking it appeared eftsoons.</p>
<p> But sir Leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had pity
of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour and as he was
minded of his good lady Marion that had borne him an only manchild which on his
eleventh day on live had died and no man of art could save so dark is destiny.
And she was wondrous stricken of heart for that evil hap and for his burial did
him on a fair corselet of lamb&apos;s wool, the flower of the flock, lest he
might perish utterly and lie akeled (for it was then about the midst of the
winter) and now sir Leopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked
upon him his friend&apos;s son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed
happiness and as sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage (for
all accounted him of real parts) so grieved he also in no less measure for young
Stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and murdered his goods with whores.</p>
<p> About that present time young Stephen filled all cups that stood empty so as
there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed their approach
from him that still plied it very busily who, praying for the intentions of the
sovereign pontiff, he gave them for a pledge the vicar of Christ which also as
he said is vicar of Bray. Now drink we, quod he, of this mazer and quaff ye this mead which is not
<br><font color="green">{u21, 435}</font>
<br> indeed parcel of my body but my soul&apos;s bodiment. Leave ye fraction of
bread to them that live by bread alone. Be not afeard neither for any want for
this will comfort more than the other will dismay. See ye here. And he showed
them glistering coins of the tribute and goldsmiths&apos; notes the worth of two
pound nineteen shilling that he had, he said, for a song which he writ. They all
admired to see the foresaid riches in such dearth of money as was herebefore.
His words were then these as followeth: Know all men, he said, time&apos;s ruins
build eternity&apos;s mansions. What means this? Desire&apos;s wind blasts the
thorntree but after it becomes from a bramblebush to be a rose upon the rood of
time. Mark me now. In woman&apos;s womb word is made flesh but in the spirit of
the maker all flesh that passes becomes the word that shall not pass away. This
is the postcreation. <i>Omnis caro ad te veniet</i>. No question but her name is
puissant who aventried the dear corse of our Agenbuyer, Healer and Herd, our
mighty mother and mother most venerable and Bernardus saith aptly that she hath
an <i>omnipotentiam deiparae supplicem</i>, that is to wit, an almightiness of
petition because she is the second Eve and she won us, saith Augustine too,
whereas that other, our grandam, which we are linked
<br><font color="green">{u22, 374}</font>
<br> up with by successive anastomosis of navelcords sold us all, seed, breed
and generation, for a penny pippin. But here is the matter now. Or she knew him,
that second I say, and was but creature of her creature, <i>vergine madre figlia
di tuo figlio</i>, or she knew him not and then stands she in the one denial or
ignorancy with Peter Piscator who lives in the house that Jack built and with
Joseph the Joiner patron of the happy demise of all unhappy marriages
<i>parceque M. L&eacute;o Taxil nous a dit que qui l&apos;avait mise dans cette
fichue position c&apos;&eacute;tait le sacr&eacute; pigeon, ventre de Dieu!
Entweder</i> transubstantiality <i>oder</i> consubstantiality but in no case
subsubstantiality. And all cried out upon it for a very scurvy word. A pregnancy
without joy, he said, a birth without pangs, a body without blemish, a belly
without bigness. Let the lewd with faith and fervour worship. With will will we withstand, withsay.</p>
<p> Hereupon Punch Costello dinged with his fist upon the board and
<br><font color="green">{u21, 436}</font>
<br> would sing a bawdy catch <i>Staboo Stabella</i> about a wench that was put
in pod of a jolly swashbuckler in Almany which he did &now attack:</p>
<p class="set"><i>The first three months she was not well, Staboo</i>,</p>
<p class="flush">when here nurse Quigley from the door angerly bid them hist ye

to have all orderly against lord Andrew came for because she was jealous that no
gasteful turmoil might shorten the honour of her guard. It was an ancient and a
sad matron of a sedate look and christian walking, in habit dun beseeming her
megrims and wrinkled visage, nor did her hortative want of it effect for
incontinently Punch Costello was of them all embraided and they reclaimed him
with civil rudeness some and with menace of blandishments others whiles all
chode with him, a murrain seize the dolt, what a devil he would be at, thou
chuff, thou puny, thou got in the peasestraw, thou losel, thou chitterling, thou
spawn of a rebel, thou dykedropt, thou abortion thou, to shut up his drunken
drool out of that like a curse of God ape, the good sir Leopold that had for his
cognisance the flower of quiet, margerain gentle, advising also the time&apos;s
occasion as most sacred and most worthy to be most sacred. In Horne&apos;s house rest should reign.</p>
<p> To be short this passage was scarce by when Master Dixon of Mary&apos;s in
Eccles, goodly grinning, asked young Stephen what was the reason why he had not
cided to take friar&apos;s vows and he answered him obedience in the womb,
chastity in the tomb but involuntary poverty all his days. Master Lenehan at
this made return that he had heard of those nefarious deeds and how, as he heard
hereof counted, he had besmirched the lily virtue of a confiding female which
was corruption of minors and they all intershowed it too, waxing merry
<br><font color="green">{u22, 375}</font>
<br> and toasting to his fathership. But he said very entirely it was clean
contrary to their suppose for he was the eternal son and ever virgin. Thereat
mirth grew in them the more and they rehearsed to him his curious rite of
wedlock for the disrobing and deflowering of spouses,

Well met they were, said Master Dixon, but, harkee, better were they named Beau
Mount and Lecher for, by my troth, of such a mingling much might come. Young
Stephen said indeed to his best remembrance they had but the one doxy between
them and she of the stews to make shift with in delights amorous for life ran
very high in those days and the custom of the country approved with it. Greater
love than this, he said, no man hath that a man lay down his wife for his
friend. Go thou and do likewise. Thus, or words to that effect, saith
Zarathustra, sometime regius professor of French letters to the university of
Oxtail nor breathed there ever that man to whom mankind was more beholden. Bring
a stranger within thy tower it will go hard but thou wilt have the secondbest
bed. <i>Orate, fratres, pro memetipso</i>. And all the people shall say, Amen.
Remember, Erin, thy generations and thy days of old, how thou settedst little by
me and by my word and broughtedst in a stranger to my gates to commit
fornication in my sight and to wax fat and kick like Jeshurum. Therefore hast
thou sinned against the light and hast made me, thy lord, to be the slave of
servants. Return, return, Clan Milly: forget me not, O Milesian. Why hast thou
done this abomination before me that thou didst spurn me for a merchant of jalap
and didst deny me to the Roman and to the Indian of dark speech with whom thy
daughters did lie luxuriously? Look forth now, my people, upon the land of
behest, even from Horeb and from Nebo and from Pisgah and from the Horns of
Hatten unto a land flowing with milk and money. But thou hast suckled me with a
<br><font color="green">{u21, 438}</font>
<br> bitter milk: my moon and my sun thou hast quenched for ever. And thou hast
left me alone for ever in the dark ways of my bitterness: and with a kiss of ashes
<br><font color="green">{u22, 376}</font>
<br> hast thou kissed my mouth. This tenebrosity of the interior, he proceeded
to say, hath not been illumined by the wit of the septuagint nor as much as
mentioned for the Orient from on high Which brake hell&apos;s gates visited a
darkness that was foraneous. Assuefaction minorates atrocities (as Tully saith
of his darling Stoics) and Hamlet his father showeth the prince no blister of
combustion. The adiaphane in the noon of life is an Egypt&apos;s plague which in
the nights of prenativity and postmortemity is their most proper <i>ubi</i> and
<i>quomodo</i>. And as the ends and ultimates of all things accords in some mean
and measure with their inceptions and originals, that same multiplicit
concordance which leads forth growth from birth accomplishing by a retrogressive
metamorphosis that minishing and ablation towards the final which is agreeable
unto nature so is it with our subsolar being. The aged sisters draw us into
life: we wail, batten, sport, slip, clasp, sunder, dwindle, die: over us dead
they bend. First saved from water of old Nile, among bulrushes, a bed of
fasciated wattles: at last the cavity of a mountain, an occulted sepulchre amid
the conclamation of the hillcat and the ossifrage. And as no man knows the
ubicity of his tumulus nor to what processes we shall thereby be ushered nor
whether to Tophet or to Edenville in the like way is all hidden when we would
backward see from what region of remoteness the whatness of our whoness hath fetched his whenceness.</p>
<p> Thereto Punch Costello roared out mainly, <i>Etienne chanson</i> but he
loudly bid them lo, wisdom hath built herself a house, this vast majestic vault,
the crystal palace of the Creator all in applepie order, a penny for him who finds the pea.</p>

<p> A black crack of noise in the street here, alack, bawled back. Loud on left
Thor thundered: in anger awful, the hammerhurler. And Master Lynch bade him have
a care to witwanton as the god self was angered for his hellprate and paganry.
And he that had erst challenged to be so doughty waxed pale as they might all
mark and shrank together and his pitch that was before so haught uplift was now
of a sudden quite plucked down and his heart shook within the cage of his breast
as he tasted the rumour of that storm. Then did some mock and some jeer and
Punch Costello fell hard again to his yale which Master
<br><font color="green">{u22, 377}</font>
<br> Lenehan vowed he would do after and he was indeed but a word and a blow on
any the least colour. But the braggart boaster cried that an old Nobodaddy was
in his cups it was muchwhat indifferent and he would not lag behind his lead.
But this was only to dye his desperation as cowed he crouched in Horne&apos;s
hall. He drank indeed at one draught to pluck up a heart of any grace for it
thundered long rumblingly over all the heavens so that Master Madden, being
godly certain whiles, knocked him on his ribs upon that crack of doom and Master
Bloom, at the braggart&apos;s side, spoke to him calming words to slumber his
great fear, advertising how it was no other thing but a hubbub noise that he
heard, the discharge of fluid from the thunderhead, look you, having taken
place, and all of the order of a natural phenomenon.</p>
<p> But was young Boasthard&apos;s fear vanquished by Calmer&apos;s words? No,
for he had in his bosom a spike named Bitterness which could not by words be
done away. And was he then neither calm like the one nor godly like the other?
He was neither as much as he would have liked to be either. But could he not
have endeavoured to have found again as in his youth the bottle Holiness that
then he lived withal? Indeed no for Grace was not there to find that bottle.
Heard he then in that clap the voice of the god Bringforth or, what Calmer said,
a hubbub of Phenomenon? Heard? Why, he could not but hear unless he had plugged
him up the tube Understanding (which he had not done). For through that tube he
saw that he was in the land of Phenomenon where he must for a certain one day
die as he was like the rest too a passing show. And would he not accept to die
like the rest and pass away? By no means would he though he must nor would he make more shows according as
<br><font color="green">{u21, 440}</font>
<br> men do with wives which Phenomenon has commanded them to do by the book
Law. Then wotted he nought of that other land which is called Believe-on-Me,
that is the land of promise which behoves to the king Delightful and shall be
for ever where there is no death and no birth neither wiving nor mothering at
which all shall come as many as believe on it? Yes, Pious had told him of that
land and Chaste had pointed him to the way but the reason was that in the way he
fell in with a whore of an eyepleasing exterior whose name, she said, is
Bird-in-the-Hand and she beguiled him wrongways from the true path by her
flatteries that she said to him as, Ho, you pretty man, turn aside hither and I
will show you a brave place, and she lay at him so flatteringly that she had him
in her grot which is named Two-in-the-Bush or, by some learned, Carnal Concupiscence.</p>
<p> This was it what all that company that sat there at commons in Manse of
Mothers the most lusted after and if they met with this whore Bird-in-the-Hand
<br><font color="green">{u22, 378}</font>
<br> (which was within all foul plagues, monsters and a wicked devil) they would
strain the last but they would make at her and know her. For regarding
Believe-on-Me they said it was nought else but notion and they could conceive no
thought of it for, first, Two-in-the-Bush whither she ticed them was the very
goodliest grot and in it were four pillows on which were four tickets with these
words printed on them, Pickaback and Topsyturvy and Shameface and Cheek by Jowl
and, second, for that foul plague Allpox and the monsters they cared not for
them for Preservative had given them a stout shield of oxengut and, third, that
they might take no hurt neither from Offspring that was that wicked devil by
virtue of this same shield which was named Killchild. So were they all in their
blind fancy, Mr Cavil and Mr Sometimes Godly, Mr Ape Swillale, Mr False
Franklin, Mr Dainty Dixon, Young Boasthard and Mr Cautious Calmer. Wherein, O
wretched company, were ye all deceived for that was the voice of the god that
was in a very grievous rage that he would presently lift his arm and spill their
souls for their abuses and their spillings done by them contrariwise to his word
which forth to bring brenningly biddeth.

<p> So Thursday sixteenth June Patk. Dignam laid in clay of an apoplexy and
after hard drought, please God, rained, a bargeman coming in by water a fifty
mile or thereabout with turf saying the seed won&apos;t sprout, fields athirst,
very sadcoloured and stunk mightily, the quags and tofts too. Hard to breathe
and all the young quicks clean consumed without sprinkle this long while back as
no man remembered to be without. The rosy buds all gone brown and spread out
blobs and on the hills nought but dry flag and faggots that would catch at first
fire. All the world saying, for aught they knew, the big wind of last February
that did havoc the land so pitifully a small thing beside this barrenness. But
by and by, as said, this evening after sundown, the wind sitting in the west,
biggish swollen clouds to be seen as the night increased and the weatherwise
poring up at them and some sheet lightnings at first and after, past ten of the
clock, one great stroke with a long thunder and in a brace of shakes all scamper
pellmell within door for the smoking shower, the men making shelter for their
straws with a clout or kerchief, womenfolk skipping off with kirtles catched up
soon as the pour came. In Ely place, Baggot street, Duke&apos;s lawn, thence

and other rogues of the game or with a chanceable catchpole or a tipstaff often
at nights till broad day of whom he picked up between his sackpossets much loose
gossip. He took his ordinary at a boilingcook&apos;s and if he had but gotten
into him a mess of broken victuals or a platter of tripes with a bare tester in
his purse he could always bring himself off with his tongue, some randy quip he
had from a punk or whatnot that every mother&apos;s son of them would burst
their sides. The other, Costello, that is, hearing this talk asked was it poetry
or a tale. Faith, no, he says, Frank (that was his name), &apos;tis all about
Kerry cows that are to be butchered along of the plague. But they can go hang,
says he with a wink, for me with their bully beef, a pox on it. There&apos;s as
good fish in this tin as ever came out of it and very friendly he offered to
take of some salty sprats that stood by which he had eyed wishly in the meantime
and found the place which was indeed the chief design of his embassy as he was
sharpset. <i>Mort aux vaches</i>, says Frank then in the French language that
had been indentured to a brandy shipper that has a winelodge in Bordeaux and he
spoke French like a gentleman too. From a child this Frank had been a donought
that his father, a headborough, who could ill keep him to school to learn his
letters and the use of the globes, matriculated at the university to study the
mechanics but he took the bit between his teeth like a raw colt and was more
familiar with the justiciary and the parish beadle than with his volumes. One
time he would be a playactor, then a sutler or a welsher, then he was for the
ocean sea or to foot it on the roads with the Romany folk, kidnapping a
squire&apos;s heir by favour of moonlight or fecking maids&apos; linen or
choking chickens behind a hedge. He had been off a hundred times and back again
with naked pockets as many more to his father the headborough who shed a pint of
tears as often as he saw him. What, says Mr Leopold with his hands across, that
was earnest to know the drift of it, will they slaughter all? I protest I saw
them but this day morning going to the Liverpool boats, says he. I can scarce
believe &apos;tis so bad, says he. And he had experience of
<br><font color="green">{u21, 444}</font>
<br> the like brood beasts and of springers, greasy hoggets and wether wools
having been some years before actuary for Mr Joseph Cuffe, a worthy salesmaster
that drove his trade for live stock and meadow auctions hard by Mr Gavin
Low&apos;s yard in Prussia street. I question with you there, says he. More
<br><font color="green">{u22, 381}</font>
<br> like &apos;tis the hoose or the timber tongue. Mr Stephen, a little moved
but very handsomely, told him no such matter and that he had dispatches from the
emperor&apos;s chief tailtickler thanking him for the hospitality, that was
sending over Doctor Rinderpest, the bestquoted cowcatcher in all Muscovy with a
bolus or two of physic to take the bull by the horns. Come, come, says Mr
Vincent, plain dealing. He&apos;ll find himself on the horns of a dilemma if he
meddles with a bull that&apos;s Irish, says he. Irish by name and irish by
nature, says Mr Stephen, and he sent the ale purling about. An Irish bull in an
English chinashop. I conceive you, says Mr Dixon. It is that same bull that was
sent to our island by farmer Nicholas, the bravest cattle breeder of them all
with an emerald ring in his nose. True for you, says Mr Vincent cross the table,
and a bullseye into the bargain, says he, and a plumper and a portlier bull,
says he, never shit on shamrock. He had horns galore, a coat of cloth of gold
and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his nostrils so that the women of our
island, leaving doughballs and rollingpins, followed after him hanging his
bulliness in daisychains. What for that, says Mr Dixon, but before he came over
farmer Nicholas that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of
doctors who were no better off than himself. So be off now, says he, and do all
my cousin german the lord Harry tells you and take a farmer&apos;s blessing, and
with that he slapped his posteriors very soundly. But the slap and the blessing
stood him friend, says Mr Vincent, for to make up he taught him a trick worth
two of the other so that maid, wife, abbess and widow to this day affirm that
they would rather any time of the month whisper in his ear in the dark of a
cowhouse or get a lick on the nape from his long holy tongue than lie with the
finest strapping young ravisher in the four fields of all Ireland. Another then
put in his word: And they dressed him, says he, in a point shift and petticoat
with a tippet and girdle and ruffles on his
<br><font color="green">{u21, 445}</font>
<br> wrists and clipped his forelock and rubbed him all over with spermacetic
oil and built stables for him at every turn of the road with a gold manger in
each full of the best hay in the market so that he could doss and dung to his
heart&apos;s content. By this time the father of the faithful (for so they
called him) was grown so heavy that he could scarce walk to pasture. To remedy
which our cozening dames and damsels brought him his fodder in their apronlaps
and as soon as his belly was full he would rear up on his hind quarters to show
their ladyships a mystery and roar and bellow out of him in bulls&apos; language
and they all after him. Ay, says another, and so pampered was he that he would
suffer nought to grow in all the land but green grass for himself (for that was
the only colour to his mind) and there was a board put up on a hillock in the middle of the
<br><font color="green">{u22, 382}</font>
<br> island with a printed notice, saying: By the lord Harry green is the grass
that grows on the ground. And, says Mr Dixon, if ever he got scent of a
cattleraider in Roscommon or the wilds of Connemara or a husbandman in Sligo
that was sowing as much as a handful of mustard or a bag of rapeseed out
he&apos;d run amok over half the countryside rooting up with his horns whatever
was planted and all by lord Harry&apos;s orders. There was bad blood between
them at first, says Mr Vincent, and the lord Harry called farmer Nicholas all
the old Nicks in the world and an old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his
house and I&apos;ll meddle in his matters, says he. I&apos;ll make that animal
smell hell, says he, with the help of that good pizzle my father left me. But
one evening, says Mr Dixon, when the lord Harry was cleaning his royal pelt to
go to dinner after winning a boatrace (he had spade oars for himself but the
first rule of the course was that the others were to row with pitchforks) he
discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and on picking up a
blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he found sure enough that he
was a lefthanded descendant of the famous champion bull of the Romans, <i>Bos
Bovum</i>, which is good bog Latin for boss of the show. After that, says Mr
Vincent, the lord Harry put his head into a cow&apos;s drinkingtrough in the
presence of all his courtiers and pulling it out again told them all his new
name. Then, with the water running off him, he got into an old smock and skirt that
<br><font color="green">{u21, 446}</font>
<br> had belonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls&apos;
language to study but he could never learn a word of it except the first
personal pronoun which he copied out big and got off by heart and if ever he
went out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write it up on what took
his fancy, the side of a rock or a teahouse table or a bale of cotton or a
corkfloat. In short he and the bull of Ireland were soon as fast friends as an
arse and a shirt. They were, says Mr Stephen, and the end was that the men of
the island, seeing no help was toward as the ungrate women were all of one mind,
made a wherry raft, loaded themselves and their bundles of chattels on
shipboard, set all masts erect, manned the yards, sprang their luff, heaved to,
spread three sheets in the wind, put her head between wind and water, weighed
anchor, ported her helm, ran up the jolly Roger, gave three times three
<font color="red"><sup><small>|7</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">and</span></span><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>7|</small></sup></font>

pushed off in their bumboat

<a name="un4021ch" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4021ch">put to
sea</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>7|</small></sup></font> to recover
the main of America. Which was the occasion, says Mr Vincent, of the composing
by a boatswain of that rollicking chanty:</p>
<p class="diset">&mdash; <i>Pope Peter&apos;s but a pissabed.</i>
<br> <i>A man&apos;s a man for a&apos; that.</i></p>
<p> Our worthy acquaintance, Mr Malachi Mulligan, now appeared in the
<br><font color="green">{u22, 383}</font>
<br> doorway as the students were finishing their apologue accompanied with a
friend whom he had just rencountered, a young gentleman, his name Alec Bannon,
who had late come to town, it being his intention to buy a colour or a cornetcy
in the fencibles and list for the wars. Mr Mulligan was civil enough to express
some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a project of his own for the
cure of the very evil that had been touched on. Whereat he handed round to the
company a set of pasteboard cards which he had had printed that day at Mr
Quinnell&apos;s bearing a legend printed in fair italics: <i>Mr Malachi
Mulligan, Fertiliser and Incubator, Lambay Island.</i> His project, as he went
on to expound, was to withdraw from the round of idle pleasures such as form the
chief business of sir Fopling Popinjay and sir Milksop Quidnunc in town and to
devote himself to the noblest task for which our bodily organism has been
framed. Well, let us hear of it, good my friend, said Mr Dixon. Come, be
<br><font color="green">{u21, 447}</font>
<br> seated, both. &apos;Tis as cheap sitting as standing. Mr Mulligan accepted
of the invitation and, expatiating on his design, told his hearers that he had
been led into this thought by a consideration of the causes of sterility, both
the inhibitory and the prohibitory, whether the inhibition in its turn were due
to conjugal vexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as whether the
prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from proclivities acquired. It
grieved him plaguily, he said, to see the nuptial couch defrauded of its dearest
pledges: and to reflect upon so many agreeable females with rich jointures, a
prey for the vilest bonzes, who hide their flambeau under a bushel in an
uncongenial cloister or lose their womanly bloom in the embraces of some
unaccountable muskin when they might multiply the inlets of happiness,
sacrificing the inestimable jewel of their sex when a hundred pretty fellows
were at hand to caress, this, he assured them, made his heart weep. To curb this
inconvenient (which he concluded due to a suppression of latent heat) having
advised with certain counsellors of
worth<font color="red"><sup><small>|7</small></sup></font><font color="black">,
having <a name="un6013af" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6013af">inspected
into</a> this
matter,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>7|</small></sup></font> he had
resolved to purchase in fee simple for ever the freehold of Lambay island from
its holder count Anthony Considine, a gentleman of note much in favour with our
high church party. He proposed to set up there a national fertilising farm to be
named <i>Omphalos</i> and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the
fecundation of any female of what grade of life soever who should there direct
to him with the desire of fulfilling the functions of her natural. Money was no
object, he said, nor would he take a penny for his pains. The poorest
kitchenwench no less than the opulent lady of fashion, if so be their constructions and their tempers
<br><font color="green">{u22, 384}</font>
<br> were warm persuaders for their petitions, would find in him their man. For
his nutriment, he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a diet of
savoury tubercles and fish and coneys there, the flesh of these latter prolific
rodents being highly recommended for his purpose, both broiled and stewed with a
blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum chillies. After this homily which he
delivered with much warmth of asseveration Mr Mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief with
<br><font color="green">{u21, 448}</font>
<br> which he had shielded it. They both, it seems, had been overtaken by the
rain and for all their mending their pace had taken water, as might be observed
by Mr Mulligan&apos;s smallclothes of a hodden grey which was now somewhat
piebald. His project meanwhile was very favourably entertained by his auditors
and won hearty eulogies from all though Mr Dixon of Mary&apos;s excepted to it,
asking with a finicking air did he purpose also to carry coals to Newcastle. Mr
Mulligan however made court to the scholarly by an apt quotation from the
classics which, as it dwelt upon his memory, seemed to him a sound and cogent
support of his contention: <i>Talis ac tanta depravatio hujus seculi, O
quirites, ut matresfamiliarum nostrae lascivas cujuslibet semiviri libici
titillationes testibus ponderosis atque excelsis erectionibus centurionum
Romanorum magnopere anteponunt</i> while for those of ruder wit he drove home
his point by analogies of the animal kingdom more suitable to their stomach, the
buck and doe of the forest glade, the farmyard drake and duck.</p>
<p> Valuing himself not a little upon his elegance, being indeed a proper man of
his person, this talkative now applied himself to his dress with animadversions
of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics while the company
lavished their encomiums upon the project he had advanced. The young gentleman,
his friend, overjoyed as he was at a passage that had befallen him, could not
forbear to tell it his nearest neighbour. Mr Mulligan, now perceiving the table,
asked for whom were those loaves and fishes and, seeing the stranger, he made
him a civil bow and said, Pray, sir, was you in need of any professional
assistance we could give? Who, upon his offer, thanked him very heartily, though
preserving his proper distance, and replied that he was come there about a lady,
now an inmate of Horne&apos;s house, that was in an interesting condition, poor
body, from woman&apos;s woe (and here he fetched a deep sigh) to know if her
happiness had yet taken place. Mr Dixon, to turn the table, took on to ask of Mr
Mulligan himself whether his incipient ventripotence, upon which he rallied him,
betokened an ovoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was
due as with the noted physician, Mr Pugin Meldon, to
<br><font color="green">{u21, 449}</font>
<br> a wolf in the stomach. For answer Mr

smote himself bravely below the diaphragm, exclaiming with an admirable droll
mimic of Mother Grogan (the most excellent creature of her sex though &apos;tis
pity she&apos;s a trollop): There&apos;s a belly that never bore a bastard. This
was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storms of mirth and threw the whole
room into the most violent agitations of delight. The spry rattle had run on in
the same vein of mimicry but for some larum in the antechamber.</p>
<p> Here the listener who was none other than the Scotch student, a little fume
of a fellow, blond as tow, congratulated in the liveliest fashion with the young
gentleman and, interrupting the narrative at a salient point, having desired his
visavis with a polite beck to have the obligingness to pass him a flagon of
cordial waters at the same time by a questioning poise of the head (a whole
century of polite breeding had not achieved so nice a gesture) to which was
united an equivalent but contrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as
plainly as was ever done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it.
<i>Mais bien sur</i>, noble stranger, said he
cheerily<font color="red"><sup><small>|7</small></sup></font><font color="black">,
<i>et</i> <a name="un5019am" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5019am"><i>mille

That you may and very opportunely. There wanted nothing but this cup to crown my
felicity. But, gracious heaven, was I left with but a crust in my wallet and a
cupful of water from the well, my God, I would accept of them and find it in my
heart to kneel down upon the ground and give thanks to the powers above for the
happiness vouchsafed me
<font color="red"><sup><small>|7</small></sup></font><font color="black">by the

these words he approached the goblet to his lips, took a complacent draught of
the cordial, slicked his hair and, opening his bosom, out popped a locket that
hung from a silk riband, that very picture which he had cherished ever since her
hand had wrote therein. Gazing upon those features with a world of tenderness,
Ah, Monsieur, he said, had you but beheld her
<font color="red"><sup><small>|7</small></sup></font><font color="black">as I
did <a name="un7023m" href="../../ff/unbs/un7all.htm#un7023m">with these

affecting instant with her dainty tucker and her new coquette cap (a gift for
her feastday as she told me) in such an artless disorder, of so melting a
tenderness, &apos;pon my conscience, even you, Monsieur, had been impelled by
generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands of such an enemy or to quit the field for ever.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 450}</font>
<br> I declare, I was never so touched in all my life. God, I thank thee, as the
author of my days! Thrice happy will he be whom so amiable a creature will bless
with her favours. A sigh of affection gave eloquence to these words and, having
replaced the locket in his bosom, he wiped his eye and sighed again. Beneficent
disseminator of blessings to all Thy creatures, how great and universal must be
that sweetest of Thy tyrannies which can hold in thrall the free and the bond,
the simple swain and the polished coxcomb, the lover in the heyday of reckless
passion and the husband of maturer years. But
<br><font color="green">{u22, 386}</font>
<br> indeed, sir, I wander from the point. How mingled and imperfect are all our
sublunary joys. Maledicity! Would to God that foresight had remembered me to
take my cloak along! I could weep to think of it. Then, though it had poured
seven showers, we were neither of us a penny the worse. But beshrew me, he
cried, clapping hand to his forehead, tomorrow will be a new day and, thousand
thunders, I know of a <i>marchand de capotes</i>, Monsieur Poyntz, from whom I
can have for a livre as snug a cloak

kept a lady from wetting. Tut, tut! cries Le F&eacute;condateur, tripping in, my

has sent more than one luckless fellow in good earnest posthaste to another
world. Pooh! A livre! cries Monsieur Lynch. The clumsy things are dear at a sou.
One umbrella, were it no bigger than a fairy mushroom, is worth ten such
stopgaps. No woman of any wit would wear one. My dear Kitty told me today that
she would dance in a deluge before ever she would starve in such an ark of
salvation for, as she reminded me (blushing piquantly and whispering in my ear
though there was none to snap her words but giddy butterflies) dame Nature, by
the divine blessing, has implanted it in our hearts and it has become a
household word that <i>il y a deux choses</i> for which the innocence of our
original garb, in other circumstances a breach of the proprieties, is the
fittest, nay, the only garment. The first, said she
<br><font color="green">{u21, 451}</font>
<br> (and here my pretty philosopher, as I handed her to her coach, to fix my
attention, gently tipped with her tongue the outer chamber of my ear) the first
is a bath&nbsp;&hellip; but at this point a bell tinkling in the hall cut short
a discourse which promised so bravely for the enrichment of our store of knowledge.</p>
<p> Amid the general vacant hilarity of the assembly a bell rang and while all
were conjecturing what might be the cause Miss Callan entered and, having spoken
a few words in a low tone to young Mr Dixon, retired with a profound bow to the
company. The presence even for a moment among a party of debauchees of a woman
endued with every quality of modesty and not less severe than beautiful
refrained the humorous sallies even of the most licentious but her departure was
the signal for an outbreak of ribaldry. Strike me silly, said Costello, a low
fellow who was fuddled. A monstrous fine bit of cowflesh! I&apos;ll be sworn she
has rendezvoused you. What, you dog? Have you a way with them? Gad&apos;s bud.
Immensely so, said Mr Lynch. The bedside manner it
<br><font color="green">{u22, 387}</font>
<br> is that they use in the Mater hospice. Demme, does not Doctor O&apos;Gargle
chuck the nuns there under the chin. As I look to be saved I had it from my
Kitty who has been wardmaid there any time these seven months. Lawksamercy,
doctor, cried the young blood in the primrose vest, feigning a womanish simper
and with immodest squirmings of his body, how you do tease a body! Drat the man!
Bless me, I&apos;m all of a wibblywobbly. Why, you&apos;re as bad as dear little
Father Cantekissem, that you are! May this pot of four half choke me, cried
Costello, if she ain&apos;t in the family way. I knows a lady what&apos;s got a
white swelling quick as I claps eyes on her. The young surgeon, however, rose
and begged the company to excuse his retreat as the nurse had just then informed
him that he was needed in the ward. Merciful providence had been pleased to put
a period to the sufferings of the lady who was <i>enceinte</i> which she had
borne with a laudable fortitude and she had given birth to a bouncing boy. I
want patience, said he, with those who, without wit to enliven or learning to
instruct, revile an ennobling profession which, saving the reverence due to the
Deity, is the greatest power for happiness upon the earth.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 452}</font>
<br> I am positive when I say that if need were I could produce a cloud of
witnesses to the excellence of her noble exercitations which, so far from being
a byword, should be a glorious incentive in the human breast. I cannot away with
<font color="red"><sup><small>|7</small></sup></font><font color="black">them.</font><font color="red"><sup><small>7|</small></sup></font>
What? Malign such an
one<font color="red"><sup><small>|7</small></sup></font><font color="black">,
<a name="un7023u" href="../../ff/unbs/un7all.htm#un7023u">the amiable Miss</a>
Callan,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>7|</small></sup></font> who is the
lustre of her own sex and the astonishment of ours and at an instant the most
momentous that can befall a puny child of clay? Perish the thought! I shudder to
think of the future of a race where the seeds of such malice have been sown and
where no right reverence is rendered to mother and maid in house of Horne.
Having delivered himself of this rebuke he saluted those present on the by and
repaired to the door. A murmur of approval arose from all and some were for
ejecting the low soaker without more ado, a design which would have been
effected had he not abridged his transgression by affirming with a horrid
imprecation (for he swore a round hand) that he was as good a son of the true
fold as ever drew breath. Stap my vitals, said he, them was always the
sentiments of honest Frank Costello which I was bred up most particular to
honour thy father and thy mother that had the best hand to a rolypoly or a hasty
pudding as you ever see what I always looks back on with a loving heart.</p>
<p> To revert to Mr Bloom who, after his first entry had been conscious of some
impudent mocks which he, however, had borne with as being the fruits of that age
upon which it is commonly charged that it knows not pity. The young
<br><font color="green">{u22, 388}</font>
<br> sparks, it is true, were as full of extravagancies as overgrown children:
the words of their tumultuary discussions were difficultly understood and not
often nice: their testiness and outrageous <i>mots</i> were such that his
intellects resiled from: nor were they scrupulously sensible of the proprieties
though their fund of strong animal spirits spoke in their behalf. But the word
of Mr Costello was an unwelcome language for him for he nauseated the wretch
that seemed to him a cropeared creature of a misshapen gibbosity born out of
wedlock and thrust like a crookback toothed and feet first into the world, which
the dint of the surgeon&apos;s pliers in his skill lent indeed a colour to, so
as it put him in thought of that missing link of creation&apos;s
<br><font color="green">{u21, 453}</font>
<br> chain desiderated by the late ingenious Mr Darwin. It was now for more than
the middle span of our allotted years that he had passed through the thousand
vicissitudes of existence and, being of a wary ascendancy and self a man of a
rare forecast, he had enjoined his heart to repress all motions of a rising
choler and, by intercepting them with the readiest precaution, foster within his
breast that plenitude of sufferance which base minds jeer at, rash judgers scorn
and all find tolerable and but tolerable. To those who create themselves wits at
the cost of feminine delicacy (a habit of mind which he never did hold with) to
them he would concede neither to bear the name nor to herit the tradition of a
proper breeding: while for such that, having lost all forbearance, can lose no
more, there remained the sharp antidote of experience to cause their insolency
to beat a precipitate and inglorious retreat. Not but what he could feel with
mettlesome youth which, caring nought for the mows of dotards or the gruntlings
of the severe, is ever (as the chaste fancy of the Sacred Writer expresses it)
for eating of the tree forbid it yet not so far forth as to pretermit humanity
upon any condition soever towards a gentlewoman when she was about her lawful
occasions. To conclude, while from the sister&apos;s words he had reckoned upon
a speedy delivery he was, however, it must be owned, not a little alleviated by
the intelligence that the issue so auspicated after an ordeal of such duress now
testified once more to the mercy as well as to the bounty of the Supreme Being.</p>
<p> Accordingly he broke his mind to his neighbour, saying that, to express his
notion of the thing, his opinion (who ought not perchance to express one) was
that one must have a cold constitution and a frigid genius not to be rejoiced by
this freshest news of the fruition of her confinement since she had been in such
pain through no fault of hers. The dressy young blade said it was her
husband&apos;s that put her in that expectation or at least it ought to be
unless she were another Ephesian matron. I must acquaint you, said Mr Crotthers,
<br><font color="green">{u22, 389}</font>
<br> clapping on the table so as to evoke a resonant comment of emphasis, old
Glory Alelujerum was round again today, an elderly man with dundrearies,
preferring through his nose a request to have word of Wilhelmina, my life, as he
<br><font color="green">{u21, 454}</font>
<br> calls her. I bade him hold himself in readiness for that the event would
burst anon. &apos;Slife, I&apos;ll be round with you. I cannot but extol the
virile potency of the old bucko that could still knock another child out of her.
All fell to praising of it, each after his own fashion, though the same young
blade held with his former view that another than her conjugial had been the man
in the gap, a clerk in orders, a linkboy (virtuous) or an itinerant vendor of
articles needed in every household. Singular, communed the guest with himself,
the wonderfully unequal faculty of metempsychosis possessed by them, that the
puerperal dormitory and the dissecting theatre should be the seminaries of such
frivolity, that the mere acquisition of academic titles should suffice to
transform in a pinch of time these votaries of levity into exemplary
practitioners of an art which most men anywise eminent have esteemed the
noblest. But, he further added, it is mayhap to relieve the pentup feelings that
in common oppress them for I have more than once observed that birds of a feather laugh together.</p>
<p> But with what fitness, let it be asked, has this alien, whom the concession
of a gracious prince has admitted to civic rights, constituted himself the lord
paramount of our internal polity? Where is now that gratitude which loyalty
should have counselled? During the recent war whenever the enemy had a temporary
advantage with their granados did he not seize that moment to discharge his
piece against the empire of which he is a tenant at will while he trembled for
the security of his four per cents? Has he forgotten this as he forgets all
benefits received? Or is it that from being a deluder of others he has become at
last his own dupe as he is, if report belie him not, his own and his only
enjoyer? Far be it from candour to violate the bedchamber of a respectable lady,
the daughter of a gallant major, or to cast the most distant reflections upon
her virtue but if he challenges attention there (as it was indeed highly his
interest not to have done) then be it so. Unhappy woman, she has been too long
and too persistently denied her legitimate prerogative to listen to his
objurgations with any other feeling than the derision of the desperate. He says
this, a censor of morals, a very pelican in his
<br><font color="green">{u21, 455}</font>
<br> piety, who did not scruple, oblivious of the ties of nature, to attempt
illicit intercourse with a female domestic drawn from the lowest strata of
society! Nay, had the hussy&apos;s scouringbrush not been her tutelary angel it had gone with her as hard as with
<br><font color="green">{u22, 390}</font>
<br> Hagar, the Egyptian! In the question of the grazing lands his peevish
asperity is notorious and in Mr Cuffe&apos;s hearing brought upon him from an
indignant rancher a scathing retort couched in terms as straightforward as they
were bucolic. It ill becomes him to preach that gospel. Has he not nearer home a
seedfield that lies fallow for the want of a ploughshare? A habit reprehensible
at puberty is second nature and an opprobrium in middle life. If he must
dispense his balm of Gilead to restore to health a generation of unfledged
profligates let his practice consist better with the doctrines that now engross
him. His marital breast is the repository of secrets which decorum is reluctant
to adduce. The lewd suggestions of some faded beauty may console him for a
consort neglected and debauched but this new exponent of morals and healer of
ills is at his best an exotic tree which, when rooted in its native orient,
throve and flourished and was abundant in balm but, transplanted to a clime more
temperate, its roots have lost their quondam vigour while the stuff that comes
away from it is stagnant, acid and inoperative.</p>
<p> The news was imparted with a circumspection recalling the ceremonial usages
of the Sublime Porte by the second female infirmarian to the junior medical
officer in residence, who in his turn announced to the delegation that an heir
had been born. When he had betaken himself to the women&apos;s apartment to
assist at the prescribed ceremony of the afterbirth the delegates, chafing under
the length and solemnity of their vigil and hoping that the joyful occurrence
would palliate a licence which the simultaneous absence of abigail and officer
rendered the easier, broke out at once into a strife of tongues. In vain the
voice of Mr Canvasser Bloom was heard endeavouring to urge, to mollify, to restrain. The moment was too
<br><font color="green">{u21, 456}</font>
<br> propitious for the display of that discursiveness which seemed the only
bond of union among tempers so divergent. Every phase of the situation was
successively eviscerated: the prenatal repugnance of uterine brothers, the
Caesarean section, posthumity with respect to the father and, that rarer form,
with respect to the mother, the fratricidal case known as the Childs murder and
rendered memorable by the impassioned plea of Mr Advocate Bushe which secured
the acquittal of the wrongfully accused, the rights of primogeniture and
king&apos;s bounty touching twins and triplets, miscarriages and infanticides,
simulated and dissimulated, acardiac <i>foetus in foetu</i>, aprosopia due to a
congestion, the agnatia of certain chinless Chinamen (cited by Mr Candidate Mulligan) in consequence of
<br><font color="green">{u22, 391}</font>
<br> defective reunion of the maxillary knobs along the medial line so that (as
he said) one ear could hear what the other spoke, the benefits of anesthesia or
twilight sleep, the prolungation of labour pains in advanced gravidancy by
reason of pressure on the vein, the premature relentment of the amniotic fluid
(as exemplified in the actual case) with consequent peril of sepsis to the
matrix, artificial insemination by means of syringes,

parents</font><font color="red"><sup><small>7|</small></sup></font> &mdash; in a
word all the cases of human nativity which Aristotle has classified in his
masterpiece with chromolithographic illustrations. The gravest problems of
obstetrics and forensic medicine were examined with as much animation as the
most popular beliefs on the state of pregnancy such as the forbidding to gravid
women to step over a country stile lest, by her movement, the navelcord should
strangle her creature and the injunction upon her in the event of a yearning,
ardently and ineffectually entertained, to place her hand against that part of
her person which long usage has consecrated as the seat of castigation. The
abnormalities of harelip, breastmole, negro&apos;s inkle strawberry mark
<br><font color="green">{u21, 457}</font>
<br> and portwine stain were alleged by one as a <i>prima facie</i> and natural
hypothetical explanation of swineheaded (the case of Madame Grissel Steevens was
not forgotten) or doghaired infants occasionally born. The hypothesis of a
plasmic memory, advanced by the Caledonian envoy and worthy of the metaphysical
traditions of the land he stood for, envisaged in such cases an arrest of
embryonic development at some stage antecedent to the human. An outlandish
delegate sustained against both these views with such heat as almost carried
conviction the theory of copulation between women and the males of brutes, his
authority being his own avouchment in support of fables such as that of the
Minotaur which the genius of the elegant Latin poet has handed down to us in the
pages of his metamorphoses. The impression made by his words was immediate but
shortlived. It was effaced as easily as it had been evoked by an allocution from
Mr Candidate Mulligan in that vein of pleasantry which none better than he knew
how to affect postulating as the supremest object of desire a nice clean old
man. Contemporaneously a heated argument having arisen between Mr Delegate
Madden and Mr Candidate Lynch regarding the juridical and theological dilemma in
the event of one Siamese twin predeceasing the other
<br><font color="green">{u22, 392}</font>
<br> the difficulty by mutual consent was referred to Mr Canvasser Bloom for
instant submittal to Mr Coadjutor Deacon Dedalus. Hitherto silent, whether the
better to show that curious dignity of the garb with which he was invested or in
obedience to an inward voice, he delivered briefly, and as some thought
perfunctorily, the ecclesiastical ordinance forbidding man to put asunder what God has joined.</p>
<p> But Malachias&apos; tale began to freeze them with horror. He conjured up
the scene before them. The secret panel beside the chimney slid back and in the
recess appeared &mdash; Haines! He had a portfolio full of Celtic literature in
one hand, in the other a phial marked <i>Poison</i>. Surprise, horror, loathing
were depicted on all faces while he eyed them with a ghastly grin. I anticipated
some such reception, he began with an eldritch laugh, for which, it seems,
history is to blame. Yes, it is true. I am the murderer
<br><font color="green">{u21, 458}</font>
<br> of Samuel Childs. And how I am punished! The inferno has no terrors for me.
Tare and ages, what way would I be resting at all, he muttered thickly, and I
tramping Dublin this while back with my share of songs and himself after me the
like of a soulth or a bullawurrus? My hell, and Ireland&apos;s, is in this life.
It is what I tried to obliterate my crime. Distractions, rookshooting, the Erse
language (he recited some), laudanum (he raised the phial to his lips), camping
out. In vain! His spectre stalks me. Dope is my only hope&nbsp;&hellip; Ah!
Destruction! The black panther! With a cry he suddenly vanished and the panel
slid back. An instant later his head appeared in the door opposite and said:
Meet me at Westland row station at ten past eleven. He was gone! Tears gushed
from the eyes of the dissipated host. The seer raised his hand to heaven,
murmuring: The vendetta of Mananaun! The sage repeated: <i>Lex talionis</i>. The
sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship
for a thing done. Malachias, overcome by emotion, ceased. The mystery was
unveiled. Haines was the third brother. His real name was Childs. The black
panther was himself the ghost of his own father. He drank drugs to obliterate.
For this relief much thanks. The lonely house by the graveyard is uninhabited.
No soul will live there. The spider pitches her web in the solitude. The
nocturnal rat peers from his hole. A curse is on it. It is haunted. Murderer&apos;s ground.</p>
<p> What is the age of the soul of man? As she hath the virtue of the chameleon
to change her hue at every new approach, to be gay with the merry and mournful
with the downcast, so too is her age changeable as her mood. No longer is
Leopold, as he sits there, ruminating, chewing the cud of
<br><font color="green">{u22, 393}</font>
<br> reminiscence, that staid agent of publicity and holder of a modest
substance in the funds. He is young Leopold, as in a retrospective arrangement,
a mirror within a mirror (hey, presto!), he beholdeth himself. That young figure
of then is seen, precociously manly, walking on a nipping morning from the old
house in Clanbrassil street to the high school, his booksatchel on him
bandolierwise, and in it a goodly hunk of wheaten loaf, a mother&apos;s thought.
Or it is the same figure, a year or so gone over, in his first hard hat (ah, that was a day!),
<br><font color="green">{u21, 459}</font>
<br> already on the road, a fullfledged traveller for the family firm, equipped
with an orderbook, a scented handkerchief (not for show only), his case of
bright trinketware (alas, a thing now of the past!), and a quiverful of
compliant smiles for this or that halfwon housewife reckoning it out upon her
fingertips or for a budding virgin shyly acknowledging (but the heart? tell me!)
his studied baisemoins. The scent, the smile but more than these the dark eyes
and oleaginous address brought home at duskfall many a commission to the head of
the firm seated with Jacob&apos;s pipe after like labours in the paternal ingle
(a meal of noodles, you may be sure, is aheating), reading through round horned
spectacles some paper from the Europe of a month before. But hey, presto, the
mirror is breathed on, and the young knighterrant recedes, shrivels, dwindles to
a tiny speck within the mist. Now he is himself paternal and these about him
might be his sons. Who can say? The wise father knows his own child. He thinks
of a drizzling night in Hatch street, hard by the bonded stores there, the
first. Together (she is a poor waif, a child of shame, yours and mine and of all
for a bare shilling and her luckpenny) together they hear the heavy tread of the
watch as two raincaped shadows pass the new royal university. Bridie! Bridie
Kelly! He will never forget the name, ever remember the night, first night, the
bridenight. They are entwined in nethermost darkness, the willer with the
willed, and in an instant (<i>fiat!</i>) light shall flood the world. But hold!
Back! It must not be! In terror the poor girl flees away through the murk. She
is the bride of darkness, a daughter of night. She dare not bear the sunnygolden
babe of day. No, Leopold! Name and memory solace thee not. That youthful
illusion of thy strength was taken from thee &mdash; and in vain. No son of thy
loins is by thee. There is none now to be for Leopold what Leopold was for Rudolph.</p>
<p> The voices blend and fuse in clouded silence: silence that is the infinite
of space: and swiftly, silently the soul is wafted over regions of cycles of
generations that have lived. A region where grey twilight ever descends, never
falls on wide sagegreen pasturefields, shedding her dusk, scattering a perennial
<br><font color="green">{u22, 394}</font>
<br> dew of stars. She follows her mother
<br><font color="green">{u21, 460}</font>
<br> with ungainly steps, a mare leading her filly foal. Twilight phantoms are
they yet moulded in prophetic grace of structure, slim shapely haunches, a
supple tendonous neck, the meek apprehensive skull. They fade, sad phantoms: all
is gone. Agendath is a waste land, a home of screechowls and the sandblind
upupa. Netaim, the golden, is no more. And on the highway of the clouds they
come, muttering thunder of rebellion, the ghosts of beasts. Huuh! Hark! Huuh!
Parallax stalks behind and goads them, the lancinating lightnings of whose brow
are scorpions. Elk and yak, the bulls of Bashan and of Babylon, mammoth and
mastodon, they come trooping to the sunken sea, <i>Lacus Mortis</i>. Ominous,
revengeful zodiacal host! They moan, passing upon the clouds, horned and
capricorned, the trumpeted with the tusked, the lionmaned, the giantantlered,
snouter and crawler, rodent, ruminant and pachyderm, all their moving moaning multitude, murderers of the sun.</p>
<p> Onward to the dead sea they tramp to drink, unslaked and with horrible
gulpings, the salt somnolent inexhaustible flood. And the equine portent grows
again, magnified in the deserted heavens, nay to heaven&apos;s own magnitude
till it looms, vast, over the house of Virgo. And, lo, wonder of metempsychosis,
it is she, the everlasting bride, harbinger of the daystar, the bride, ever
virgin. It is she, Martha, thou lost one, Millicent, the young, the dear, the
radiant. How serene does she now arise, a queen among the Pleiades, in the
penultimate antelucan hour, shod in sandals of bright gold, coifed with a veil
of what do you call it gossamer! It floats, it flows about her starborn flesh
and loose it streams emerald, sapphire, mauve and heliotrope, sustained on
currents of cold interstellar wind, winding, coiling, simply swirling, writhing
in the skies a mysterious writing till, after a myriad metamorphoses of symbol,
it blazes, Alpha, a ruby and triangled sign upon the forehead of Taurus.</p>
<p> Francis was reminding Stephen of years before when they had been at school
together in Conmee&apos;s time. He asked about Glaucon, Alcibiades, Pisistratus.
Where were they now? Neither knew. You have spoken of the past and its phantoms, Stephen said. Why think of
<br><font color="green">{u21, 461}</font>
<br> them? If I call them into life across the waters of Lethe will not the poor
ghosts troop to my call? Who supposes it? I, Bous Stephanoumenos,
bullockbefriending bard, am lord and giver of their life. He encircled his
gadding hair with a coronal of vineleaves, smiling at Vincent. That answer and
those leaves, Vincent said to him, will adorn you more fitly when something
more, and greatly more, than a capful of light odes can call your genius father. All who wish you well hope this for
<br><font color="green">{u22, 395}</font>
<br> you. All desire to see you bring forth the work you meditate. I heartily
wish you may not fail them. O no, Vincent, Lenehan said, laying a hand on the
shoulder near him, have no fear. He could not leave his mother an orphan. The
young man&apos;s face grew dark. All could see how hard it was for him to be
reminded of his promise and of his recent loss. He would have withdrawn from the
feast had not the noise of voices allayed the smart. Madden had lost five
drachmas on Sceptre for a whim of the name: Lenehan as much more. He told them
of the race. The flag fell and, huuh, off, scamper, the mare ran out freshly
with O. Madden up. She was leading the field: all hearts were beating. Even
Phyllis could not contain herself. She waved her scarf and cried: Huzzah!
Sceptre wins! But in the straight on the run home when all were in close order
the dark horse Throwaway drew level, reached, outstripped her. All was lost now.
Phyllis was silent: her eyes were sad anemones. Juno, she cried, I am undone.
But her lover consoled her and brought her a bright casket of gold in which lay
some oval sugarplums which she partook. A tear fell: one only. A whacking fine
whip, said Lenehan, is W. Lane. Four winners yesterday and three today. What
rider is like him? Mount him on the camel or the boisterous buffalo the victory
is still his. But let us bear it as was the ancient wont. Poor Sceptre! he said
with a light sigh. She is not the filly that she was. Never, by this hand, shall
we behold such another. By gad, sir, a queen of them. Do you remember her,
Vincent? I wish you could have seen my queen today, Vincent said, how young she
was and radiant in her yellow shoes and frock of muslin, I do not know the right
name of it. The chestnuts that shaded us were in bloom: the air drooped with their
<br><font color="green">{u21, 462}</font>
<br> persuasive odour and with pollen floating by us. In the sunny patches one
might easily have cooked on a stone a batch of those buns with Corinth fruit in
them that Periplepomenos sells in his booth near the bridge. But she had nought
for her teeth but the arm with which I held her and in that she nibbled
mischievously when I pressed too close. A week ago she lay ill, four days on the
couch, but today she was free, blithe, mocked at peril. She is more taking then.
Her posies too! Mad romp that she is, she had pulled her fill as we reclined
together. And in your ear, my friend, you will not think who met us as we left
the field. Conmee himself! He was walking by the hedge, reading, I think a
brevier book with, I doubt not, a witty letter in it from Glycera or Chloe to
keep the page. The sweet creature turned all colours in her confusion, feigning
to reprove a slight disorder in her dress: a slip of
<br><font color="green">{u22, 396}</font>
<br> underwood clung there for the very trees adore her. When Conmee had passed
she glanced at her lovely echo in the little mirror she carries. But he had been
kind. In going by he had blessed us. The gods too are ever kind, Lenehan said.
If I had poor luck with Bass&apos;s mare perhaps this draught of his may serve
me more propensely. He was laying his hand upon a winejar: Malachi saw it and
withheld his act, pointing to the stranger and to the scarlet label. Warily,
Malachi whispered, preserve a druid silence. His soul is far away. It is as
painful perhaps to be awakened from a vision as to be born. Any object,
intensely regarded, may be a gate of access to the incorruptible eon of the
gods. Do you not think it, Stephen? Theosophos told me so, Stephen answered,
whom in a previous existence Egyptian priests initiated into the mysteries of
karmic law. The lords of the moon, Theosophos told me, an orangefiery shipload
from planet Alpha of the lunar chain would not assume the etheric doubles and
these were therefore incarnated by the rubycoloured egos from the second constellation.</p>
<p> However, as a matter of fact though, the preposterous surmise about him
being in some description of a doldrums or other or mesmerised which was
entirely due to a misconception of the shallowest character, was not the case at
all. The individual whose visual organs while the above was going on, were at this juncture commencing
<br><font color="green">{u21, 463}</font>
<br> to exhibit symptoms of animation was as astute if not astuter than any man
living and anybody that conjectured the contrary would have found themselves
pretty speedily in the wrong shop. During the past four minutes or thereabouts
he had been staring hard at a certain amount of number one Bass bottled by
Messrs Bass and Co at Burton-on-Trent which happened to be situated amongst a
lot of others right opposite to where he was and which was certainly calculated
to attract anyone&apos;s remark on account of its scarlet appearance. He was
simply and solely, as it subsequently transpired for reasons best known to
himself, which put quite an altogether different complexion on the proceedings,
after the moment before&apos;s observations about boyhood days and the turf,
recollecting two or three private transactions of his own which the other two
were as mutually innocent of as the babe unborn. Eventually, however, both their
eyes met and, as soon as it began to dawn on him that the other was endeavouring
to help himself to the thing, he involuntarily determined to help him himself
and so he accordingly took hold of the mediumsized glass recipient which
contained the fluid sought after and made a capacious hole in it by pouring a
lot of it out with, also at the same time, however, a considerable degree of
attentiveness in order not to upset any of the beer that was in it about the place.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 397}</font> </p>
<p> The debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome of the
course of life. Neither place nor council was lacking in dignity. The debaters
were the keenest in the land, the theme they were engaged on the loftiest and
most vital. The high hall of Horne&apos;s house had never beheld an assembly so
representative and so varied nor had the old rafters of that establishment ever
listened to a language so encyclopaedic. A gallant scene in truth it made.
Crotthers was there at the foot of the table in his striking Highland garb, his
face glowing from the briny airs of the Mull of Galloway. There too, opposite to
him, was Lynch whose countenance bore already the stigmata of early depravity
and premature wisdom. Next the Scotchman was the place assigned to Costello, the
eccentric, while at his side was seated in stolid repose the squat form of Madden. The chair of the resident indeed
<br><font color="green">{u21, 464}</font>
<br> stood vacant before the hearth but on either flank of it the figure of
Bannon in explorer&apos;s kit of tweed shorts and salted cowhide brogues
contrasted sharply with the primrose elegance and townbred manners of Malachi
Roland St John Mulligan. Lastly at the head of the board was the young poet who
found a refuge from his labours of pedagogy and metaphysical inquisition in the
convivial atmosphere of Socratic discussion while to right and left of him were
accomodated the flippant prognosticator, fresh from the hippodrome, and that
vigilant wanderer, soiled by the dust of travel and combat and stained by the
mire of an indelible dishonour, but from whose steadfast and constant heart no
lure or peril or threat or degradation could ever efface the image of that
voluptuous loveliness which the inspired pencil of Lafayette has limned for ages yet to come.</p>
<p> It had better be stated here and now at the outset that the perverted
transcendentalism to which Mr S. Dedalus&apos; (Div. Scep.) contentions would
appear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter to accepted
scientific methods. Science, it cannot be too often repeated, deals with
tangible phenomena. The man of science like the man in the street has to face
hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked and explain them as best he can. There
may be, it is true, some questions which science cannot answer &mdash; at
present &mdash; such as the first problem submitted by Mr L. Bloom (Pubbl.
Canv.) regarding the future determination of sex. Must we accept the view of
Empedocles of Trinacria that the right ovary is responsible for the birth of
males or are the too long neglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the
differentiating factors or is it, as most embryologists incline to opine, such
as Culpepper, Spallanzani, Blumenbach, Lusk, Hertwig, Leopold and Valenti, a
mixture of both. This would be tantamount to a cooperation
<br><font color="green">{u22, 398}</font>
<br> (one of nature&apos;s favourite devices) between the <i>nisus
formativus</i> of the nemasperm on the one hand and on the other a happily
chosen position, <i>succubitus felix</i>, of the passive element. The other
problem raised by the same inquirer is scarcely less vital: infant mortality. It
is interesting because, as he pertinently remarks, we are all born in the same way but we all
<br><font color="green">{u21, 465}</font>
<br> die in different ways. Mr M. Mulligan (Hyg. et Eug. Doc.) blames the
sanitary conditions in which our greylunged citizens contract adenoids,
pulmonary complaints etc by inhaling the bacteria which lurk in dust. These
factors, he alleges, and the revolting spectacles offered by our streets,
hideous publicity posters, religious ministers of all denominations, mutilated
soldiers and sailors, exposed scorbutic cardrivers, the suspended carcasses of
dead animals, paranoic bachelors and unfructified duennas &mdash; these, he
said, were accountable for any and every fallingoff in the calibre of the race.
Kalipedia, he prophesied, would soon be generally adopted and all the graces of
life, genuinely good music, agreeable literature, light philosophy, instructive
pictures, plastercast reproductions of the classical statues such as Venus and
Apollo, all these little attentions would enable ladies who were in a particular
condition to pass the intervening months in a most enjoyable manner. Mr J.
Crotthers (Disc. Bacc.) attributes some of these demises to abdominal trauma in
the case of women workers subjected to heavy labours in the workshop and to
marital discipline in the home but by far the vast majority to neglect, private
or official. Although the former is undoubtedly only too true the case he cites
of nurses forgetting to count the sponges in the peritoneal cavity is too rare
to be normative. In fact when one comes to look into it the wonder is that so
many pregnancies and deliveries go off so well as they do, all things considered
and in spite of our human shortcomings which often balk nature in her
intentions. An ingenious suggestion is that thrown out by Mr V. Lynch (Bacc.
Arith.) that both natality and mortality, as well as all other phenomena of
evolution, tidal movements, lunar phases, blood temperatures, diseases in
general, everything, in fine, in nature&apos;s vast workshop from the extinction
of some remote sun to the blossoming of one of the countless flowers which
beautify our public parks is subject to a law of numeration as yet
unascertained. Still the plain straightforward question why a child of normally healthy parents
<br><font color="green">{u21, 466}</font>
<br> and seemingly a healthy child and properly looked after succumbs
unaccountably in early childhood (though other children of the
<br><font color="green">{u22, 399}</font>
<br> same marriage do not) must certainly, in the poet&apos;s words, give us
pause. Nature, we may rest assured, has her own good and valid reasons for
whatever she does and in all probability such deaths are due to some law of
anticipation by which organisms in which morbous germs have taken up their
residence (modern science has conclusively shown that only the plasmic substance
can be said to be immortal) tend to disappear at an increasingly earlier stage
of development, an arrangement which, though productive of pain to some of our
feelings (notably the maternal) is nevertheless in the long run beneficial to
the race in general in securing thereby the survival of the fittest. Mr S.
Dedalus&apos; (Div. Scep.) remark (or should it be called an interruption?) that
an omnivorous being which can masticate, deglute, digest and apparently pass
through the ordinary channel with pluterperfect imperturbability such
multifarious aliments as cancrenous females emaciated by parturition, corpulent
professional gentlemen not to speak of jaundiced politicians and chlorotic nuns
might possibly find gastric relief in an innocent collation of staggering bob
reveals as nought else could and in a very unsavoury light the tendency above
alluded to. For the enlightenment of those who are not so intimately acquainted
with the minutiae of the municipal abattoir as this morbidminded esthete and
embryo philosopher who for all his overweening bumptiousness in things
scientific can scarcely distinguish an acid from an alkali prides himself on
being it should perhaps be stated that staggering bob in the vile parlance of
our lowerclass licensed victuallers signifies the cookable and eatable flesh of
a calf newly dropped from its mother. In a recent public controversy with Mr L.
Bloom (Pubb. Canv.) which took place in the commons&apos; hall of the National
Maternity Hospital, 29, 30 and 31 Holles street, of which, as is well known, Dr
A. Horne (Lic. in Midw., F.K.Q.C.P.I.) is the able and popular master, he is
reported by eyewitnesses as having stated that once a woman has let the cat into
the bag (an esthetic allusion, presumably, to one of the most complicated and marvellous of all
<br><font color="green">{u21, 467}</font>
<br> nature&apos;s processes, the act of sexual congress) she must let it out
again or give it life, as he phrased it, to save her own. At the risk of her own
was the telling rejoinder of his interlocutor none the less effective for the
moderate and measured tone in which it was delivered.</p>
<p> Meanwhile the skill and patience of the physician had brought about a happy
accouchement. It had been a weary weary while both for patient and doctor. All
that surgical skill could do was done and the brave woman had manfully helped.
She had. She had fought the good fight and now she was very very happy. Those
who have passed on, who have gone before, are happy
<br><font color="green">{u22, 400}</font>
<br> too as they gaze down and smile upon the touching scene. Reverently look at
her as she reclines there with the motherlight in her eyes, that longing hunger
for baby fingers, (a pretty sight it is to see) in the first bloom of her new
motherhood, breathing a silent prayer of thanksgiving to One above, the
Universal Husband. And as her loving eyes behold her babe she wishes only one
blessing more, to have her dear Doady there with her to share her joy, to lay in
his arms that mite of God&apos;s clay, the fruit of their lawful embraces. He is
older now (you and I may whisper it) and a trifle stooped in the shoulders yet
in the whirligig of years a grave dignity has come to the conscientious second
accountant of the Ulster bank, College Green branch. O Doady, loved one of old,
faithful lifemate now, it may never be again, that faroff time of the roses!
With the old shake of her pretty head she recalls those days. God, how beautiful
now across the mist of years! But their children are grouped in her imagination
about the bedside, hers and his, Charley, Mary Alice, Frederick Albert (if he
had lived), Mamy, Budgy (Victoria Frances), Tom, Violet Constance Louisa,
darling little Bobsy (called after our famous hero of the South African war,
lord Bobs of Waterford and Candahar) and now this last pledge of their union, a
Purefoy if ever there was one, with the true Purefoy nose. Young hopeful will be
christened Mortimer Edward after the influential third cousin of Mr Purefoy in
the Treasury Remembrancer&apos;s office, Dublin Castle. And so time wags on: but
father Cronion has dealt lightly here. No, let no sigh break from that bosom,
dear gentle Mina. And Doady, knock the ashes
<br><font color="green">{u21, 468}</font>
<br> from your pipe, the seasoned briar you still fancy when the curfew rings
for you (may it be the distant day!) and dout the light whereby you read in the
sacred book for the oil too has run low and so with a tranquil heart to bed, to
rest. He knows and will call in His own good time. You too have fought the good
fight and played loyally your man&apos;s part. Sir, to you my hand. Well done, thou good and faithful servant.</p>
<p> There are sins or (let us call them as the world calls them) evil memories
which are hidden away by man in the darkest places of the heart but they abide
there and wait. He may suffer their memory to grow dim, let them be as though
they had not been and all but persuade himself that they were not or at least
were otherwise. Yet a chance word will call them forth suddenly and they will
rise up to confront him in the most various circumstances, a vision or a dream,
or while timbrel and harp soothe his senses or amid the cool silver tranquility
of the evening or at the feast at midnight when he is now filled with wine. Not
to insult over him will the vision come as over one that lies
<br><font color="green">{u22, 401}</font>
<br> under her wrath, not for vengeance to cut him off from the living but
shrouded in the piteous vesture of the past, silent, remote, reproachful.</p>
<p> The stranger still regarded on the face before him a slow recession of that
false calm there, imposed, as it seemed, by habit or some studied trick, upon
words so embittered as to accuse in their speaker an unhealthiness, a
<i>flair</i>, for the cruder things of life. A scene disengages itself in the
observer&apos;s memory, evoked, it would seem, by a word of so natural a
homeliness as if those days were really present there (as some thought) with
their immediate pleasures. A shaven space of lawn one soft May evening, the
wellremembered grove of lilacs at Roundtown, purple and white, fragrant slender
spectators of the game but with much real interest in the pellets as they run
slowly forward over the sward or collide and stop, one by its fellow, with a
brief alert shock. And yonder about that grey urn where the water moves at times
in thoughtful irrigation you saw another as fragrant sisterhood, Floey, Atty,
Tiny and their darker friend with I know not what of arresting in her pose then,
Our Lady of the Cherries, a comely brace of them pendent from an ear, bringing out the foreign
<br><font color="green">{u21, 469}</font>
<br> warmth of the skin so daintily against the cool ardent fruit. A lad of four
or five in linseywoolsey (blossomtime but there will be cheer in the kindly
hearth when ere long the bowls are gathered and hutched) is standing on the urn
secured by that circle of girlish fond hands. He frowns a little just as this
young man does now with a perhaps too conscious enjoyment of the danger but must
needs glance at whiles towards where his mother watches from the
<i>piazzetta</i> giving upon the flowerclose with a faint shadow of remoteness
or of reproach (<i>alles verg&auml;ngliche</i>) in her glad look.</p>
<p> Mark this farther and remember. The end comes suddenly. Enter that
antechamber of birth where the studious are assembled and note their faces.
Nothing, as it seems, there of rash or violent. Quietude of custody rather,
befitting their station in that house, the vigilant watch of shepherds and of
angels about a crib in Bethlehem of Juda long ago. But as before the lightning
the serried stormclouds, heavy with preponderant excess of moisture, in swollen
masses turgidly distended, compass earth and sky in one vast slumber, impending
above parched field and drowsy oxen and blighted growth of shrub and verdure
till in an instant a flash rives their centres and with the reverberation of the
thunder the cloudburst pours its torrent so and not otherwise was the
transformation, violent and instantaneous, upon the utterance of the Word.</p>
<p> Burke&apos;s! Outflings my lord Stephen, giving the cry, and a tag and bobtail
<br><font color="green">{u22, 402}</font>
<br> of all them after, cockerel, jackanapes, welsher, pilldoctor, punctual
Bloom at heels, with a universal grabbing at headgear, ashplants, bilbos, Panama
hats and scabbards, Zermatt alpenstocks and what not. A dedale of lusty youth,
noble every student there. Nurse Callan taken aback in the hallway cannot stay
them nor smiling surgeon coming downstairs with news of placentation ended, a
full pound if a milligramme. They hark him on. The door! It is open? Ha! They
are out tumultuously, off for a minute&apos;s race, all bravely legging it,
Burke&apos;s of Denzille and Holles their ulterior goal. Dixon follows, giving
them sharp language but raps out an oath, he too, and on. Bloom stays with nurse
a thought to send a kind word to happy mother up there. Doctor Diet and Doctor
Quiet. Looks she too not other now? Ward of watching in Horne&apos;s house has
told its tale in that washedout pallor. Then all being gone, a glance of
motherwit helping, he whispers close in going: Madam, when for thee?</p>
<p> The air without is impregnated with raindew moisture, life essence
celestial, glistening on Dublin stone there under starshiny coelum. God&apos;s
air, the Allfather&apos;s air, scintillant cessile air. Breathe it deep into
thee. By heaven, Theodore Purefoy, thou hast done a doughty deed and no botch!
Thou art, I vow, the remarkablest progenitor barring none in this chaffering

let scholarment and all Malthusiasts go hang. Thou art all their daddies,
Theodore. Art drooping under thy load, bemoiled with butcher&apos;s bills at
home and ingots (not thine!) in the countinghouse? Head up! For every
newbegotten thou shalt gather thy homer of ripe wheat. See, thy fleece is
drenched. Dost envy Darby Dullman there with his Joan? A canting jay and a
rheumeyed curdog is all their progeny. Pshaw, I tell thee! He is a mule, a dead
gasteropod, without vim or stamina, not worth a cracked kreutzer. Copulation
without population! No, say I! Herod&apos;s slaughter of the innocents were the
truer name. Vegetables, forsooth, and sterile cohabitation! Give her beefsteaks,
red, raw, bleeding! She is a hoary pandemonium of ills, enlarged glands, mumps,
quinsy, bunions, hayfever, bedsores, ringworm, Derbyshire neck, warts, bilious
attacks, gallstones, cold feet, varicose veins. A truce to threnes and trentals
and jeremies and all such congenital defunctive music. Twenty years of it,
regret them not. With thee it was not as with many that will and would and wait
