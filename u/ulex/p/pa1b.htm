<p class="flush">
<br><font color="green">{ms, 9}</font> </p>
<p class="flush">Hark!</p>
<p class="flush">Tolv two eleven cater ten sax. Hark! Pedwar pemp. Foify three. Twelve!</p>
<p> Methought &apos;twas the peal of midnight&apos;s chime from out the belfry of the cute old speckled church sounding so faint a twelve as darkness rendered all British objects nonviewable to human watcher save perchance anon some glistery gleam adown surface of the fluvial flowandflow or again it might some articles of laundry reposing the greensward close by in full expectation. And methought
broadmouth was heard, and all vociferated, echoating: Shaun! Shaun! Post the post! And lo methought somewho seemed <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">to</span></span> amove among allmurk, now &apos;twas as a clump, now <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">&apos;twas a flasher, anon more as the glow.</span></span> mayhap. When lo there was light and now &apos;twas a flasher, now
more as the glow. Ah, &apos;twas in verity &apos;twas his belted lamp. And he who swayed a will of a wisp before me, coat on shoulder, was none other than (the blessings of God and Mary and Patrick be all over him!) other than (may his hundred thousand welcome letters multiply &amp; plultiply!) Shaun himself.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 10}</font> </p>
<p> Had I the concordant wiseheads of Messrs Gregory &amp; Lyons along with Dr Tarpey&apos;s and the Reverend Mr MacDougall&apos;s but I, poor ass, am but as their fourpart ass. Yet methought Shaun (holy angels be uninterruptedly nudging him along the winding roads of random ever!) Shaun in proper person (may the sliding constellations <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">b</span></span>
continue to be his considering compass!) was before me for he spake. And lo meheard I saw the voice of Shaun how it sighed to the scented nightlife as softly as the loftly telegraph masts from Clifden sigh open secrets to Nova Scotia&apos;s listing sisterpoles.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Alas! Shaun said, staring upon the native soil he loved, how all too unworthy am I for such eminence, or promenade, to be exact, as to be the bearer of this letter on His Majesty&apos;s service</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <a name="n09146d" href="../../ff/fnbs/n09all.htm#n09146d">But have I asked you,</a> dear Shaun, I remembered who it was who gave you the permit?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I, Shaun replied to me, have it from Saint Columkille&apos;s prophecies.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Then, I explained, you might be so <a name="n09011a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n09all.htm#n09011a">by order</a>?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Forgive me, Shaun replied, it was
<br><font color="green">{ms, 11}</font>
<br> made known in the prophecies and there is a power over me that is put upon me from on high.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Dear Shaun, I agreed, what then if it were you who will maybe bear this letter?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; As, Shaun replied, to that I have the power.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Tell me, please, dear Shaun, I said, where are you mostly able to work?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I, Shaun replied, am mostly able to walk. It was foretold for me never to work but, believe me, I say my prayers regularly.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yet one minute&apos;s conversation, dear Shaun, for I observe you have painted the town green.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, I have, Shaun replied to me, it is grandiose from the prophecies. With my post lamp.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do you mean, I gathered, whether verdure will or pure varnish?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; In, Shaun replied, the past postal office albeit blessed with 22,000 sorters out of a possible 22,000 too much administrative stationery was eaten by goats. It is also one of my avowed intentions at some time to make a book surrounding that matter.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And what<a target="foot" id="fpz0004">&ordm;</a> dear Shaun, I continued, would be the biography of your softbodied uniform?
<br><font color="green">{ms, 12}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; None whatsoever, Shaun replied. All of it was handed over by myself among my neighbours of every description, entitled the evicted tenants. Therefore I am plainly enveloped, as you shortly see, in one of Guinness&apos;s registered barrels.<a target="foot" id="fpz0005">&ordm;</a></p> </p>  </main>
