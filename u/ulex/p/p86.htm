<p> But was young Boasthard&apos;s fear vanquished by Calmer&apos;s words? No,
for he<a target="foot" id="fpp0077">&ordm;</a> had in his bosom a spike named
Bitterness which could not by words be done away. And was he then neither calm
like the one nor godly like the other? He was neither as much as he would have
liked to be either. But could he not
<a name="s14024ao" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14024ao">have endeavoured to
have found</a> again as in his youth the bottle Holiness
<a name="s14023dg" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14023dg">that then he lived
withal</a>? Indeed no<a target="foot" id="fpp0078">&ordm;</a> for Grace was not
there to find that bottle. Heard he then in that clap the voice of the god
Bringforth or, what Calmer said, a
<a name="s14015o" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14015o">hubbub</a> of
Phenomenon? Heard? Why, he<a target="foot" id="fpp0079">&ordm;</a> could not but
hear unless he had plugged him<a target="foot" id="fpp0080">&ordm;</a> up the
tube Understanding (which he had not done). For through that tube he saw that he
was in the land of Phenomenon where he must for a certain one day die as he was
like the rest too a passing show. And would he not accept to die like the rest
and pass away? By no means would he
<font color="red"><sup><small>(u17</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">and</span></span>
though he must nor would
he<font color="red"><sup><small>u86)</small></sup></font>
<a target="foot" id="fpp0081">&ordm;</a> make more shows according as men do
with wives which Phenomenon has commanded them to do by the book Law. Then
<a name="s14023ci" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14023ci">wotted</a> he nought
of that other land which is called Believe-on-Me, that is
<a name="s14023m" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14023m">the land of promise
which behoves to</a> the king Delightful and shall be for ever where there is no death

<br> and no birth neither wiving nor mothering at which all shall come as many
as believe on it? Yes, Pious had told him of that land and Chaste had pointed
him to the way but the reason was that in the way he

True for you, says Mr Vincent
<a name="s14025f" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14025f">cross</a> the table,
and a bullseye into the bargain, says he, and a plumper and a portlier bull,
says he, never shit on shamrock. He had horns galore, a coat of
cloth<a target="foot" id="fpp0104">&ordm;</a> of gold and a sweet smoky breath
coming out of his nostrils so that the women of our island, leaving doughballs
and rollingpins, followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains. What
for that, says Mr Dixon, but before he came over farmer Nicholas that was a
eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who were no better off
than himself. So be off now, says he, and do all my cousin german the
lord<a target="foot" id="fpp0105">&ordm;</a> Harry tells
you<a target="foot" id="fpp0106">&ordm;</a> and take a farmer&apos;s blessing,
and with that he
<a name="s14031f" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14031f">slapped his
posteriors</a> very soundly. But the slap and the blessing
<a name="s14031n" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14031n">stood him friend</a>,
says Mr Vincent, for to make up<a target="foot" id="fpp0107">&ordm;</a> he
taught him a trick worth two of the other so that maid, wife, abbess and widow
to this day affirm that they would rather any time of the month whisper in his
ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the nape from his long holy
tongue than lie with the finest strapping young
<a name="s14024au" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14024au">ravisher</a> in the
four fields of all Ireland. Another then
<a name="s14011c" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14011c">put in his word</a>:
And they dressed him, says he,<a target="foot" id="fpp0108">&ordm;</a> in a
point shift and petticoat with a tippet and girdle and ruffles on his wrists and
clipped his forelock and rubbed him all over with
<a name="un5007bc" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5007bc">spermacetic</a> oil
and built stables for him at every turn of the road with a gold manger in each
full of the best hay in the market so that he could doss and dung to his
heart&apos;s content. By this time the father of the faithful (for so they
called him<a target="foot" id="fpp0109">&ordm;</a>) was grown so heavy that he
could scarce walk to pasture. To remedy which our
<a name="un5019h" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5019h">cozening</a> dames and
damsels brought him his fodder in their apronlaps and as soon as his belly was
full he would rear up on his hind quarters to show their ladyships a mystery and
roar and bellow out of him in bulls&apos; language and they all after him. Ay,
says another, and so pampered was he that he would suffer nought to grow in all
the land but green grass for himself (for that was the only colour
<a name="s14031j" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14031j">to his mind</a>) and
there was a board put up on a hillock in the

in Roscommon or the

or a <a name="s14025aa" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14025aa">husbandman</a>

countryside rooting up with his horns
whatever<a target="foot" id="fpp0111">&ordm;</a> was planted and all by lord
Harry&apos;s orders. There was bad blood between them at
first,<a target="foot" id="fpp0112">&ordm;</a> says Mr Vincent, and the lord
Harry called farmer Nicholas all the old Nicks in the world and an old
whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house and I&apos;ll

he, with the help of that good

<a name="un5007bd" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5007bd">cleaning his royal
pelt</a> to go to dinner after winning a boatrace (he had spade oars for himself
but the first rule of the course was that the others were to row with
pitchforks) he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and on
picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he found sure
enough that he was a
<a name="un4039cp" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4039cp">lefthanded</a>
descendant of the famous champion bull of the Romans, <i>Bos Bovum</i>, which is
good <a name="s14063aa" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14063aa">bog Latin</a>
for boss of the show. After that, says Mr Vincent, the lord Harry put his head
into a cow&apos;s drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers and
pulling it<a target="foot" id="fpp0113">&ordm;</a> out again told them all his
new name. Then, with the water running off him, he got into an old smock and
skirt that had belonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the
bulls&apos; language to study but he could never learn
a<a target="foot" id="fpp0114">&ordm;</a> word of it except the first personal
pronoun which he copied out big and got off by heart and if ever he went out for
a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write it

certain counsellors of worth and
<a name="un6013af" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6013af">inspected into</a>

<a name="s14037bq" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14037bq">fee simple</a> for

Tory gentleman of note much in favour with our

He proposed to set up there a national fertilising farm to be named

was no object, he said, nor would he take a penny for his pains. The poorest
kitchenwench no less than the opulent lady of fashion, if so be their
constructions and their tempers were warm persuaders for their petitions, would
find in him their man. For his nutriment he
<a name="un6013d" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6013d">shewed</a> how he
would feed himself exclusively upon a diet of savoury tubercles and fish and
coneys there, the flesh of these latter
<a name="s14032bs" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14032bs">prolific</a> rodents
being highly recommended for his purpose, both broiled and stewed with a blade of mace
<br><font color="green">{u17, 358}</font>
<br> and a pod or two of capsicum chillies. After this

Malachias, overcome by emotion, ceased. The mystery was unveiled. Haines was the
third brother. His real name was Childs. The black panther was himself the ghost
of his own father. He drank drugs to obliterate. For this relief much thanks.

turned all colours in her confusion, feigning to reprove a slight disorder in

was laying his hand upon a winejar: Malachi saw it and withheld his act,

<p> The debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome of the
course of life.
<a name="s14083i" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14083i">Neither place nor
council was lacking</a> in dignity. The debaters were the keenest in the land,
the theme they were engaged on the loftiest and most vital. The high hall of
Horne&apos;s house had never beheld an assembly so representative and so varied
nor had the old rafters of that establishment ever listened to a language so
encyclopaedic. <a name="un5007ah" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5007ah">A
gallant scene in truth it made</a>. Crotthers
<a name="s14081at" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14081at">was there</a> at the
foot of the table in his striking Highland garb, his face glowing from the briny
airs of the Mull of Galloway. There too,<a target="foot" id="fpp0221">&ordm;</a>
opposite to him,<a target="foot" id="fpp0222">&ordm;</a> was Lynch whose
countenance bore already the stigmata of early depravity and
<a name="s14048ar" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14048ar">premature</a>
wisdom. Next the Scotchman was the place assigned to Costello, the eccentric,
while at his side was seated in stolid repose the squat form of Madden. The
chair of the resident indeed stood vacant before the hearth but on either flank
of it the figure of Bannon in explorer&apos;s kit of tweed shorts and
<a name="s14083l" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14083l">salted cowhide</a>
brogues contrasted sharply with the primrose elegance
and<a target="foot" id="fpp0223">&ordm;</a> townbred manners of Malachi Roland
St John Mulligan. Lastly at the head of the board was the young poet who found a
refuge from his
<a name="s14014a" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14014a">labours</a> of
pedagogy and metaphysical inquisition in the convivial atmosphere of Socratic
discussion, while to right and left of him were
accommodated<a target="foot" id="fpp0224">&ordm;</a> the flippant
prognosticator, fresh from the hippodrome, and that vigilant wanderer, soiled by
the dust of travel and combat and stained by the mire of an indelible dishonour,
but from whose<a target="foot" id="fpp0225">&ordm;</a> steadfast and constant
heart no lure or peril or threat or degradation could ever efface the image of
that <a name="s14083b" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14083b">voluptuous</a>
<a name="s14083j" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14083j">loveliness</a> which
the inspired pencil of Lafayette has limned for ages yet to come.</p>
<p> It had better be stated here and now at the
<a name="s14082o" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14082o">outset</a> that the
perverted transcendentalism to which Mr S. Dedalus&apos; (Div. Scep.)
contentions would appear to prove him
<a name="s14081o" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14081o">pretty badly</a>
<a name="s14077d" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14077d">addicted</a> runs
directly counter to accepted scientific methods. Science, it cannot be too often
repeated, deals with tangible phenomena. The man of science like
<a name="un4021bo" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4021bo">the man in the
street</a> has to face hardheaded facts
<a name="s14060i" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14060i">that cannot be
blinked</a> and explain them as best he can. There may be, it is true, some
questions<a target="foot" id="fpp0226">&ordm;</a> which science cannot answer
&mdash; at present &mdash; such as the first problem submitted by Mr L. Bloom
(Pubb. Canv.) regarding the future determination of sex. Must we accept the view
of <a name="s14077aa" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14077aa">Empedocles of
Trinacria</a> that
<a name="s14077ba" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14077ba">the right ovary</a>
(the postmenstrual period, assert others)
<a name="s14077ba" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14077ba">is responsible for
the birth of males</a> or are the too long neglected
<a name="s14062be" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14062be">spermatozoa</a> or
nemasperms the differentiating factors or is it, as most embryologists incline
to opine, such as
<a name="s14074bm" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14074bm">Culpepper</a>,
Spallanzani,
<a name="s14084v" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14084v">Blumenbach</a>,
<a name="s14072e" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14072e">Lusk</a>, Hertwig,
Leopold and Valenti, a mixture of both?<a target="foot" id="fpp0227">&ordm;</a>
This would be tantamount to a cooperation (one of nature&apos;s favourite
devices) between the
<a name="s14084aa" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14084aa"><i>nisus
formativus</i></a> of the nemasperm on the one hand and on the other a happily
<br><font color="green">{u17, 371}</font>
<br> chosen position, <i>succubitus felix</i>, of the passive element. The other
problem raised by the same inquirer is scarcely less vital: infant mortality. It
is interesting because, as he pertinently remarks,
<a name="s14020bf" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14020bf">we are all born in
the same way but we all die in different ways</a>. Mr M. Mulligan (Hyg. et Eug.

manner. Mr J. Crotthers (Disc. Bacc.) attributes some of these demises to
abdominal trauma in the case of women workers subjected to heavy labours in the
workshop and to marital discipline in the home but by far the vast majority to
neglect, private or official, culminating in the

the atrocious crime of
