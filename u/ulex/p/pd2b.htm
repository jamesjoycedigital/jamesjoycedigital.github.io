<p class="pdi">&mdash; Could you, of course, dear Shaun, I knew, while still in the barrel, read the <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">strangewriting</span></span> strangewritten Shem language of those letter for His Majesty.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I, Shaun replied, cd play it like anything. But it is awful for the hand. It is a pinch of scribble. An infant sailing eggshells on the floor of a wet day wd have more sabby.</p>
<p> Letter, carried by Shaun, son of Hek, written by Shem, brother of Shaun, for Alp, mother of Shem, about Hek, father of Shaun.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Dear Shaun, I requested, since you came to the use of language have you not, without suggesting for an instant, millions of times used language 10 times as worse as the language used up by yr brother Shem?
<br><font color="green">{ms, 24}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I wd not like, Shaun replied, to swear just for the moment as to that but let me say I doubt it. She, the mother, was put up to it by him, the iniquity.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Will you not, dear Shaun, I suggested, describe as to how?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; For three days, Shaun replied, she kept howling &amp; bawling with him handling the pen with a hiccup. It lasted 70 hours.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But for what, dear Shaun? I asked.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; For his language, Shaun replied, which he put inside his letter.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But you cd come near it, <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">dear Shaun, I replied</span></span> I suppose, dear Shaun? I supposed.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No-one cd, Shaun replied, for it&apos;s being incendiary.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Still I suppose you cd use worse yrself, dear Shaun, I still supposed, if only you wd take the trouble of so doing it.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Undoubtedly so, Shaun replied, &amp; by the powers of war I cd do it any time I liked even with my left hand &amp; as easily as a keg of beer &amp; much worse than what my bogus brother Shem is conversant <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">in</span></span> with only for, as an amateur &amp; other things, I never wd take
<br><font color="green">{ms, 25}</font>
<br> so much trouble of so doing. And by all I hold sacred I swear by the name of Shaun that I will commit to the flames any incendiarist whoever who will try to set a mother of mine on fire. I will soho.</p>
<p> Mind you, he was in the deepest of earnest about it although him jaw war too hearvy to halk a lot only, in looking up to find out what age he might look by the polar star, he overbalanced by the mighty fine weight of the barrel and, as the wisest course, rolled backwards round Sane&apos;s corner out of further earshot, with his curious mode of motion a fairish &amp; easy way enough behind the
times in the direction of MacAuliffe&apos;s, before he was really uprighted.</p>
<p> Well, thou art passing hence, dear Shaun, from carnal relations &amp; familiar places, more is the pity, but, for all your deeds of goodness, may the moss of prosperousness gather you rolling home! May foggy dews bediamondise your hooprings! May the fireplug of filiality reinsure your bunghole! Well we know you were loth to leave but, sure, treasure, you
<br><font color="green">{ms, 26}</font>
<br> will turn up some day or other as soon as yr pockets are empty, pending which in any case may the grass grow <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">l</span></span> quickly under yr feet or the daisies trip lightly over yr toes.<a target="foot" id="fpz0008">&ordm;</a></p> </p>  </main>
