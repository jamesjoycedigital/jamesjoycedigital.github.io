<p> Some man that wayfaring was stood by housedoor at night&apos;s oncoming. Of
Israel&apos;s folk was that man that on earth wandering far had fared. Manly
ruth his errand was that him to that house.</p>
<p> Of that house A. Horne is lord. Seventy beds keeps he there (where) teeming
mothers are wont that they lie for to bring forth bairns hale so God&apos;s
angel to Mary quoth. Watchers twey there walk, white sisters of sleepless ward.
Smarts they still, the young soothing: in <u>twelve</u> moons thrice an hundred.
Truest bedthanes they
<a name="s14033ad" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14033ad">twain</a> are, for Horne holding wariest ward.</p>
<p> In ward wary the watcher hearing come that man mildhearted to him her door
wide undid. Lo, levin leaping lightened in eyeblink Ireland&apos;s western
welkin. Full she dread that God the Wreaker all mankind would fordo with water
for their evil sins. Christ&apos;s rood made she on breastbone and him hest that
he would rathe infare under her thatch. That man her will wotting worthful went in Horne&apos;s house.</p>
<p> Loth to irk in Horne&apos;s house hat holding the seeker stood. On her land
he ere was living with liefest wife and small daughter that then over
<br><font color="green">{ms, 2}</font>
<br> land and seafloor nine years had long outwandered. Once her in throng
meeting he to her bow had not doffed. Her to forgive now he craved with good
ground by her allowed, that that of him swiftseen face, hers, so young then had
seemed. Light swift her eyes kindled, bloom of blushes his word winning.</p>
<p> As her eyes then ongot his weeds swart for that sorrow she feared. Glad
after she was that ere adread was. Her he asked if Doctor O&apos;Hare tidings
sent and she with sorrowful look him answered that Doctor O&apos;Hare in heaven
was. Sorry was the man eke that to hear. All she there told him, ruing death for
so young man yet unwilling God&apos;s rightwiseness to withsay. She said that he
had a fair death through God&apos;s goodness with masspriest to
<a name="s14004da" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14004da">shriven</a>, the
holy housel to eat and sick men&apos;s oil. The man then right earnest asked the
nun of which death the
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">m</span></span> dead man was died
and the nun answered him and said that he was died through bellycrab in Mona
island three-year agone come Yule and she prayed God to have his dear soul in
<a name="s14008t" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14008t">undeathliness</a>. He
heard her sad words, in held hat, sore staring.

<p> Therefore, all men, look to that last end that is your death and the dust
that gripeth on every man that is born of woman for as he came naked forth of
his mother&apos;s womb so naked shall he wend him at the last for to go as he came.</p>
<p> The man that was come into the house then spoke to the woman and he asked
her how it fared with the woman that lay there in childbed. The good woman
answered him and said that that woman was in throes now full three days and that
it would be a hard birth to bear but that now in a little it would be. She said
thereto that she had seen many births of women but never was none so hard as was
that woman&apos;s birth. Then she set it forth all to him as she knew the man
that of oldtime had lived nigh that house. The man hearkened to her words for he
felt with wonder women&apos;s woe in the travail that they have and he wondered
to look on her face that was young for any man to see but yet was she left after
long years a handmaid. Nine twelve bloodflows chiding her childless.</p>

<p class="pStDir">And<a target="foot" id="fpz0042">&ordm;</a> whiles they spoke
the door of the chamber upon their left was opened and there nighed them near a
mickle noise as of many that had assembled them at meat and made merry to their
much desport. And there came against the place as they stood a young scholar of
medicine, hardy and noble, that men clepen Dixon junior for him thought that had
come. And he knew sir Leopold sithen they had had ado each with other in the
house of our mother of misericord where this scholar lay. And he said him that
he should in with them for to
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">maken</span></span> make merry and
sir Leopold in hope to scape said him how he should go otherwhere for he was a
man of cautels and a subtile. And the good nun was of his avis and repreved this
scholar though she trowed well he not said sooth but thing that was false for
his subtility. But this scholar would not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne
have him neither in aught contrarious to his will and sir Leopold went with him
into this chamber. And he was fain to rest him for a space being sore of limb
after many marches environing and sometime venery.
<br><font color="green">{ms, v}</font>
<br><font color="green">{ms, 1}</font> </p>
<p> In<a target="foot" id="fpz0046">&ordm;</a> this chamber sat at board a
fellowship of scholars the most lustiest who hailed sir Leopold crying, Welcome,
pardee. With right goodly cheer was this board
<br><font color="green">{ms, 2}</font>
<br> decked<a target="foot" id="fpz0047">&ordm;</a> of salted fishes withouten
heads and oil of the fatness of the olive and the lifegiving bread of fecund
wheat and meadflasks a great plenty. And these scholars all with one accord bid
sit sir Leopold and this scholar let pour to him a draught of fellowship and
halp thereto whereof sir Leopold for to pleasure him took apertly somewhat in
amity for he never drank drank no manner of mead but anon full privily he voided
it the more part into his neighbour glass, he nothing of that will perceiving.
So sat sir Leopold with those drunken scholars. Loth to move from Horne&apos;s house.</p>
<p> This meanwhile this good nun stood by the door and begged them at the
reverence of Jesu our alther liege lord to leave their wassailing for there was
one above, a gentle dame, whose time hied fast. I marvel, said sir Leopold, it
be not come or now meseems it dureth overlong. And he was ware and saw a
franklin that hight Lenehan on that side the board that was older than any of
the tother and for that they were knights
<a name="s14023da" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14023da">venturous</a> in the one emprise and eke by cause that he
<br><font color="green">{ms, 3}</font>
<br> was<a target="foot" id="fpz0049">&ordm;</a> elder he spoke to him
<a name="s14004bf" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14004bf">fully gently</a>.
But, said he, or it be long too she will bring forth by God his bounty and have
joy for she hath waited marvellous long. And the franklin said, Expecting each
moment to be her next. Also he took the cup that stood
<a name="s14026b" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14026b">tofore</a> him for him
needed none asking nor desiring of him to drink and Now drink, said he, and he
quaffed as far as he might to their both&apos;s health for he was a passing good
man of his lustiness. And sir Leopold that was the meekest knight that ever sat
in scholars&apos; hall and that was the meekest man that ever laid hand under
hen and that was the gentlest knight that ever did minion service to lady gentle
pledged him courtly in the cup. Woman&apos;s woe with wonder weening.</p>
<p> Now let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be
drunken an they might. There was a sort of scholars, that is to wit, Dixon
yclept junior with other his fellows Lynch and Madden, scholars of medicine and
the franklin that hight Lenehan and one from Alba Longa, one Crotthers, and
young Stephen, that had mien of a frere, that was at head of the board,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 4}</font>
<br> and Costello that men clepen Punch Costello all long of a mastery of him
erewhile gested (and of all them, reserved young Stephen, he was the most
drunken that demanded still of more mead) and beside the meek sir Leopold. But
on young Malachi they waited for that he promised to have come and such as
intended to no goodness said how he had broke his avow. And sir Leopold sat with
them for he bore fast friendship to sir Simon, and to this his son young
Stephen, and for that his languor
<a name="s14009da" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14009da">becalmed</a> him
there after longest wanderings insomuch as they feasted him for that time in the
honourablest manner. Ruth rede him, love led on with will to wander loth to leave.</p>
<p> For they were right witty scholars. And he heard their quarrels each gen
other as touching birth and righteousness, young Madden maintaining that put
such case it were hard the wife to die (for so it had fallen out with a woman of
Eblana in Horne&apos;s house that now was trespassed out of this world) and the
self night next before her death all they had taken counsel as many as were
there. And they said farther she should live because in the beginning, they
said, the woman should bring forth in pain and travail and wherefore they that were of this imagination affirmed
<br><font color="green">{ms, 5}</font>
<br> how young Madden had said truth for he had conscience to let her die. And
of these was young Lynch, were in doubt that the world was now right evil
governed as it was never other, howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise,
but the law nor <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">its</span></span>
his judges did provide no remedy. This was scant said but all cried with one
acclaim the wife should live sith she was God&apos;s creature as well as other
and the babe to die. And they waxed hot upon that head, what with argument and
what for their drinking, but the franklin Lenehan was prompt to pour them ale so
that at the least way mirth might not lack. Then young Madden showed all the
whole affair and when they had heard her case how that she was dead and how her
goodman husband would not let her death for holy religion whereby they were one
and all wondrous grieved. To whom young Stephen had these words following: Sirs,
pity is meet always, but if meet here for this unborn child how then for those
unborn that we daily do to death. For, sirs, he said, our lust is brief, but
nature, giving that, had other ends. Then said Dixon junior to him that hight
Punch Costello wist he what ends. But he had overmuch drunken and the best word
he could have of him was that he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she were;
were she wife or maid or leman, if so be it fortuned him to be delivered of his
lustihood. Whereat young Stephen presently poured him
<br><font color="green">{ms, 6}</font>
<br> mead<a target="foot" id="fpz0055">&ordm;</a> in his cup, saying it was well
said if not well done. And Crotthers of Alba Longa sang praise of that beast the
unicorn, after sir Binnetto, how once in the millenium he cometh by his horn, he
all that while, pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they did malice him,
witnessing all and several, by
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">his</span></span> saint Bastard
his engines, that he was able by grace of his privities to do any manner of
thing that lay in man to do. Thereat laughed they all right jocundly only young
Stephen and sir Leopold which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange
humour which he would not bewray and also for that he rued for her that bare
whoso she might be. Then spake young Stephen orgulous of mother church that
would cast him out, of law of canons, of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of
brightness or by demons as divers fable.
<a name="s14021q" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14021q">Also he showed how on
the ninth day a soul rational was infused</a> and how in all our heavenly mother
foldeth aye souls for glory whereas that earthly mother, that was but a dam to
bring forth beastly, should die by canon. All they bachelors then asked of sir
Leopold would he in like case so jeopard her person as risk life to save life. A
wariness of mind he would answer as fitted all and said dissembling, as it was
informed him and agreeing also with his experience of so seldom seen an accident so it was good for that mother Church
<br><font color="green">{ms, 7}</font>
<br> belike<a target="foot" id="fpz0057">&ordm;</a> at one blow had birth and
death pence. In such sort deliverly he scaped their questions. Which hearing
young Stephen was a marvellous glad man and he averred for he was ever of a wild
humour when he had much drunken, and that he was now in that taking it appeared eftsoons.</p>
<p> But sir Leopold was passing grave, maugre his word, by cause he still had
pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their
<a name="s14014a" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14014a">labour</a> and
moreover he was minded of his good lady Marion that had borne him an only
manchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art could save
and she was wondrous stricken of heart for that evil hap and to his burial, sore
weeping, did him on a fair corselet of lamb&apos;s wool, the flower of the
flock, lest he might perish utterly and lie akeled (for it was that time about
the midst of the winter): and now sir Leopold that had of his body no manchild
for an heir looked upon him, his friend&apos;s son, and was shut up in sorrow
for his forepassed happiness and as sad as he was that him failed a son of such
gentle courage, for all accomted<a target="foot" id="fpz0061">&ordm;</a> him of
real parts, so grieved he also in no less measure for young Stephen for that he
lived riotously with wastrels and murdered his goods with whores.</p>

still plied it very busily, who, praying for the intention of the sovereign
pontiff he gave them for a pledge the vicar of Christ which also, as he said,

he had for certain sweet airs he had composed that were printed. They all
admired to see that riches and his words were these as followeth. For, he said,

He gave them then an excellent hymen song by those delicate poets Master John
Fletcher and Master Francis Beaumont that is in their <u>Maid&apos;s Tragedy</u>
that was writ for a like twining of lovers: <u>To bed, to bed</u> was the burden
to be played sweetly upon the virginals. Well met they were, said Master Dixon,
but, by my troth, better were they named Beau Mount and Lecher for of such a
mingling much might come. Master Stephen said indeed to his best remembrance
they had but the one doxy between them and she of the stews to make shift with
in delights noble for life ran very high in those days and the custom of the
country approved with it. And greater love than this, said he, no man hath that
a man lay down his wife for his friend. Go thou and do likewise for thus, or
words to that effect, spake Zarathustra, sometime regius professor of French
letters to the university of Oxtail nor breathed there ever that sage to whom
mankind was more beholden. <u>Orate, pro me.</u> Seek unto him, he said, and I
will bring you unto the land of behest, he said, even from Horeb and from Pisgah
and from Sinai mount and from the Horns of Hatten unto a land flowing with

And as, said he, the ends and finalities of
<a name="s14055am" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14055am">all things</a>
accord in some mean and measure with their inceptions and originals, that same manifold

<br> concordance<a target="foot" id="fpz0065">&ordm;</a> which has led forth
growth from birth accomplishing by a retrogressive metamorphosis that

towards the final most consonant with the nature of that which suffers nature so
is it with us from cradle to the grave. Over our birth the aged sisters bend:
We, wail, batten, live, clasp, sunder, dwindle, die: over us dead they bend.
First saved from water of old Nile, among the bulrushes, a wattled bed: at last;
on Horeb on Bachar a cave that the jackals inhabit. And as no man knows the

whether to Tophet or to Edenville in the like way is all hidden when we would

<p> Noise checked further words. Loud on left Thor thundered: in anger awful,
the hammerhurler. And Master Lynch bade him have a care to witwanton as the god
was angered for his hellprate: and he that had erst challenged to be so doughty
waxed pale as they might all mark and shrank together as he tasted that storm
and his heart shook within the cage of his breast. Then some mocked and Punch
Costello fell to drinking which Master Lenehan vowed he would do after and he
was indeed but a word and a blow. But the braggart boaster cried that old
Nobodaddy was in his cups he would not lag behind his lead
<br><font color="green">{ms, 5}</font>
<br> but<a target="foot" id="fpz0066">&ordm;</a> this was only to dye his
desperation as cowed he crouched in Horne&apos;s house. He drank indeed and at
one draught to pluck up a heart of any grace for it thundered long rumblingly
over all the heavens so that Master Madden, being godly certain whiles, knocked
him on his breast and Master Bloom at the braggart&apos;s side spoke to him
calming words to slumber his great fear advertising how it was but a hubbub

<p> But was young braggart&apos;s fear vanquished by calmer&apos;s words? No,
for he knew his own wretchedness which could not by words be done away. And was
he then neither calm like the one nor godly like the other? He was neither as
much as he would have liked to be either. But could he not have endeavoured to
have found again as in his youth the natural piety that then he lived withal?
Indeed no for grace was not there to give it. Heard he then in that clap the
voice of the god Bringforth or, what calmer said, a
<a name="s14015o" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14015o">hubbub</a> of
phenomenon? Heard? Why he could not but hear both of those things unless
peradventure he had sealed him up understanding (which he had not done). For
understanding told him that he was in the land of phenomenon where he must
certainly one day die as he was too like the rest a passing show. And would he
not accept to die like the rest and pass away? He would not though he must nor
would he make more shows according as men do with wives which phenomenon has
commanded them to do by his law. Then wotted he nought of that other land which
is called Believe on Me that is the true land of behest which is all delightful
and shall be for ever where there is also no death and no birth, neither wiving
nor mothering at which all shall come as many as believe on it? Yes: Pious had
told him of that land and Chaste had pointed him to the way but the reason was
that in the way he fell in with a certain whore whose name, she said, is
Bird-in-the-Hand of an eyepleasing exterior and she beguiled him wrongways from
the true path by her flatteries to him that
<br><font color="green">{ms, 2}</font>
<br> he was a very pretty man and so she had him in her grot of shame which is
named <u>Two in the Bush</u> or, by some learned also, <u>Carnal Concupiscence</u>.</p>
<p> This was it what all that company that sat there at commons in Manse of

they would <a name="s14015j" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14015j">make at
her</a> and know her. For regarding Believe on Me they said it was nought else
but notion and they could conceive no thought of it for, first, Two in the Bush
whither she ticed them was the very goodliest grot and in it were four bowers
which were called Dalliance and Loth to Brood and Chamber Delights and Harlotry

<p> So<a target="foot" id="fpz0068">&ordm;</a> Thursday sixteenth June after
hard drought, please God, rained, a bargeman coming in by water with some turf
saying, no seed would sprout, the fields athirst, very sadcoloured and stunk
mightily, the quags. No use watering them and on the hills nought but dry flag
that would catch at first fire and, for aught they knew, the big wind of last
February that did havoc the land so pitifully a small thing beside this
barrenness. But by and by, as said, this evening
(<a name="s14009db" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14009db">past ten of the
clock</a>) after sundown, the wind sitting in the west, biggish swollen clouds
to be seen and some lightnings at first and after (v.s.) one great crack with a
long thunder and all running pellmell within doors for the smoking shower, the
men making cover for their straws with a clout or kerchief, womenfolk all ahurry
with kirtles up soon as the pour came. In Ely place, Baggot street, thence
through Merrion green up to Holles street a swash of water running that was
before <a name="s14025al" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14025al">brave dry</a>
but no crack after that first. Over against duke&apos;s Lawn Ma. Mulligan met
Seymour of Trinity that was new got to town from Mullingar with the stage, he
bound home and he to Andrew Horne&apos;s but would tell him of a skittish wench
and so both together on to Horne&apos;s. There Bloom sitting snug with a party
of wags, likely fellows, among them Dixon jun., Ja. Lynch, doc. Madden, and

<p> With<a target="foot" id="fpz0070">&ordm;</a> this came up Lenehan to the
hither end of the table to say how the letter was in that night&apos;s gazette
and he made a show to find it about him (for he swore with an oath he had been
at pains about it) but on the persuasion of Stephen he gave over to search and
was bidden to sit near by which he did mighty brisk. He was a kind of sport
gentleman that <a name="s14072ac" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14072ac">went
for a</a> merryandrew or honest pickle and what belonged of women, horseflesh or
new scandal in the town he knew it pat. To tell the truth he was mean in
fortunes and for the most part hankered about the cookshops and low taverns with
crimps, ostlers |x&amp;
<a name="s14074al" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14074al">bookies</a>|x* and
rogues of of<a target="foot" id="fpz0071">&ordm;</a> the game</a>, often at
nights till broad day, of whom he picked up loose gossip. He took his ordinary
at a boiling cook&apos;s and if he had but gotten a mess of broken victuals into
him or a bare tester in his purse in any company he could always bring himself
off with his tongue, some randy quip he had from a punk or whatnot that every
mother&apos;s son of them would burst their sides. The other, Costello that is,
hearing this talk asked was it poetry or a tale. Faith no, Frank, he says, (that
was his name). &apos;Tis all about Kerry cows that are to be butchered along of
the plague. But they can go hang, says he, for me with their bully beef, a pox
on it. There&apos;s as good fish in this tin as ever came out of it and very
friendly he offered to take of some salty sprats that stood by which he had been
looking wishly on for this was indeed the chief design of his embassy. Mort aux vaches, says Frank then in the French
<br><font color="green">{ms, 2}</font>
<br> tongue<a target="foot" id="fpz0072">&ordm;</a> that had been articled to a
wineshipper in Bordeaux and he spoke French like a gentleman too. From a child
this Frank had been a donought, one time he would be a divine, then a welsher,
then <a name="s14043f" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14043f">he was for</a>
the sea or to tramp the roads with the romany folk, to feck linen of the maids
choking chickens behind a hedge. What, says Mr Leopold, that was earnest to know
the drift of it, will they slaughter all. I saw them but this morning going to
the English boats, says he. I can scarce believe &apos;tis so bad. He had
experience too of the like brood cattle and springers, and greasy hoggets and of
Gavin Low&apos;s meadow auctions having been at one time of life
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">an</span></span> actuary for Mr
Joseph Cuffe&apos;s, a worthy salesmaster that drove his trade for cattle and
meadow auctions hard by Mr Gavin Low&apos;s yard in Prussia street. More like,
says he, &apos;tis the hoose or the timber tongue. Mr Stephen, a little moved
but very handsomely told him no such matter and that he had dispatches from the
emperor&apos;s chief tailtickler that was sending over the bestquoted cowcatcher
in all Muscovy with a bolus or two of physic to take the bull by the horns.
Come, come, says Mr Lynch, plain dealing. He&apos;ll find himself soon on the
horns of a dilemma if he meddles with an Irish bull, says he. Irish she is, says
Mr Stephen, as he sent the ale purling about, an Irish bull in an English
chinashop. I conceive you, says Mr Dixon, It is that same bull that was sent to our island by a certain Farmer
<br><font color="green">{ms, 3}</font>
<br> Nicholas, the bravest cattlebreeder of them all with an emerald ring in his
nose. True for you, says Mr Lynch, and a bullseye into the bargain, says he, and
a plumper and a portlier bull never shit on shamrock. He had horns galore and a
coat of cloth of gold and sweet smoky breath coming out of his nostrils so that
the women of our island, leaving pots and rollingpins, followed after him
everywhere, hanging his bullship in daisychains. What for that, says Mr Dixon,
but before he came farmer Nicholas that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by
seven cowcatchers that were no better off than himself, So be off now, says he
with a farmer&apos;s blessing and he slapped his posteriors very soundly. But
the slap and the blessing stood him friend, says Mr Lynch, for to make up he
taught him a trick worth two of the other so that maid, wife, abbess and widow
to this day affirm they would rather any day of the month whisper in his ear in
the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the neck from his long tongue than lie
with the finest strapping young ravisher in the four fields of all Ireland.
Another then put in his word: And they dressed him, says he, in a loose shift
and petticoat with a tippet too and clipped his forelocks and rubbed him with
macasser oil and they built a great barn for him with a gold manger in it full
of the best hay in the market for by this time the father of the faithful (for so they called him) was so heavy
<br><font color="green">{ms, 4}</font>
<br> he could scarce walk to pasture. To remedy which our dames and damsels
brought him his fodder in their apronlaps, and, as soon as his belly was full,
he used to rear up on his hind quarters to show their ladyships a mystery and
roar and bellow in bull&apos;s language and they all after him. Ay, says
another, and so pampered was he he would have nought growing in all the land but
grass for himself <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">and when he was
full up</span></span> (for that was the only colour to his mind) and there was a
board put up on a hillock in the middle of the island with a notice printed on
it, saying: Green is the grass that grows on the ground. And if ever he got
scent of a husbandman that was sowing as much as a handful of mustard or a bag
of rapeseed he&apos;d run amok rooting up with his horns whatever was planted
and all by Lord Harry&apos;s orders. At first there was bad blood between them
because the lord Harry had a quarrel with his cousin farmer Nicholas and called
him Old Nick and an old whoremaster and I&apos;ll dish that animal
<a name="jn2039b" href="../../ff/unbs/jn2all.htm#jn2039b">smell hell</a>, says
he, with the help of that good
<a name="s12004e" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004e">pizzle</a>. But one
morning when the lord Harry was dressing for a great time after winning a
boatrace (he had oars for himself but one of the rules was that the others were
to row with pitchforks) he discovered a wonderful likeness in himself to the
bull and on looking up his family tree he found he was the lineal descendant of
the famous Roman bull that was named Boss of the Show. After that the lord Harry
<br><font color="green">{ms, 5}</font>
<br> and the bull of Ireland were as fast friends as an arse and a shirt. They
were, says Mr Lynch, and the end was that the men of the island seeing no help
was toward, as the ungrate women were all of the one mind, made a raft of
timbers, loaded themselves and their chattels aboard, set all masts erect,
spread three sheets in the wind, ran up the Jolly Roger and pushed off for the
main of America in search of, which was the occasion of the composing by a boatswain of the famous seachanty:</p>

<p> Our<a target="foot" id="fpz0077">&ordm;</a> worthy acquaintance Mr Mal
Mulligan now appeared in the doorway as the student was concluding his apologue
accompanied with a friend of his a young gentleman, his name Seymour who had
lately come up to town, it being his intention to take a cornetcy and list for
the wars. Mr Mulligan was obliging enough to express some relish of it and all
the more as it jumped with a project of his own for the cure of the very evil
which had been touched on. Whereat (Saying which), he handed round to the
company a set of
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">cards</span></span> pasteboard
cards that he had had printed that day at Thom&apos;s, and on which was printed
in flowing italics the legend: Mr Malachi Mulligan, Fertiliser, Lambay. His
project, as he went on to expound, was to withdraw from the round of idle
pleasures such as form the chief business of sir fopling in town and to devote
himself to the noblest task for which our bodily organism has been framed. He
had been led into this thought by a consideration of the causes of sterility,
both the inhibitory and the prohibitory, whether the inhibition in its turn were
due to conjugal vexations or to parsimony as well as whether the prohibition
proceeded from defects congenital or from proclivities acquired. It grieved him,
he said, sorely to see the nuptial couch defrauded of its dearest pledges: and
to reflect upon so many agreeable females with rich jointures who lose their
bloom in a cloister when they might multiply the inlets of happiness,
sacrificing the inestimable jewel of their sex so sadly when a hundred pretty
fellows were at hand to caress had been to him, he assured them, a thorn in the flesh. To meet
<br><font color="green">{ms, 2}</font>
<br> this<a target="foot" id="fpz0078">&ordm;</a> inconvenient he had advised
having advised with certain counsellors of worth, he concluded to be due to a
suppression of latent heat, he had resolved to purchase the freehold of Lambay
island from count Anthony Considine, a gentleman of note much in favour with our
high church party, and there to set up a national fertilising farm to be named
the Ladies&apos; Friend, he offering his dutiful yeoman service to any female of
what grade of life
<a name="s14048c" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14048c">soever</a> who should
there direct to him, with the desire of fulfilling the functions of
<a name="s14031a" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14031a">her natural</a>. For
his nourishment, he said, he would subsist exclusively on the fish and coneys
there, this latter flesh being highly recommended for his purpose, both broiled
and stewed. After this homily, which he delivered with much warmth of
asseveration, Mr Mulligan removed from his hat a kerchief with which he had
sheltered it. They both had been surprised by the rain, it seems, and for all
their mending their pace had taken water as might be seen from Mr
Mulligan&apos;s suit of a hodden grey which was now somewhat piebald. His
project meanwhile was very favourably entertained by his audience except for Mr
Dixon asking did he purpose also carrying coals to Newcastle. Mr Mulligan
however made court to the scholarly by an apt
<a name="s14082d" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14082d">quotation</a> from the
classics which as it dwelt upon his memory, seemed a
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">conclusion</span></span>
confirmation of his contention. Talis ac tanta depravatio huius seculi, O
quirites, ut matronae nostrae lascivas cuiuslibet libici titillationes testibus
ponderosis atque excelsis erectionibus centurionum Romanorum
<br><font color="green">{ms, 3}</font>
<br> magnopere<a target="foot" id="fpz0079">&ordm;</a> anteponunt, while for
those of ruder wit he drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom
more suitable to their relishes, the buck and doe of the field, the domestic drake and duck.</p>
<p> Valuing himself not a little upon his person he now applied himself to his
person with animadversions of some spleen upon the sudden shower while the
company lavished their encomiums upon the project he had advanced. The young
gentleman, his friend, overjoyed as he was at a passage that had lately befallen
him could not forbear to tell it his nearest neighbour of it. Mr Mulligan now
perceiving the table asked for whom those loaves and fishes were and then,
seeing the stranger, he made him a civil bow and said, Pray, sir, was you in
need <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">an</span></span> of any
assistance we can give? Who upon his offer thanked him very heartily, though
preserving his proper distance, and made return that he was come there about a
lady of Horne&apos;s house that was in an interesting condition, poor body, from
woman&apos;s woe (and here he fetched a deep sigh) to hear if her happiness had
yet taken place. Mr Dixon still rallying a little upon that plan asked when was
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">it known that</span></span>
<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font> Mr
Mulligan smote himself bravely below the diaphragm, exclaiming with an admirable
mimic of Mother Grogan (the most excellent creature of her sex though &apos;tis
pity she&apos;s a trollop). There&apos;s a belly that never bore a bastard. This
was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storm of mirth and threw the whole
room into the most violent agitations of delight. He had run on in the same vein of mimicries but for
<br><font color="green">{ms, 4}</font>
<br> some larum in the antechamber.</p>
<p> Here the listener who was none other than the student from Perth,
<a name="s14042ah" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14042ah">a little fume of a
fellow</a>, gratulated in the liveliest manner with the young gentleman, and,
interrupting the narrative at a salient point, and having desired his vis a vis
with a polite beck to have the obligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial
waters at the same time by a questioning poise of the head (a whole century of
polite breeding had not achieved so nice a gesture) to which was united an
equivalent but contrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as
was ever done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it. Mais bien
s&ucirc;r, said he cheerily, That you may and very opportunely. There wanted
nothing but this cup to crown my felicity. But was I left with but a crust in my
wallet and a cupful of water from the well I could find it in my heart to kneel
down upon the ground and thanks<a target="foot" id="fpz0081">&ordm;</a> the
powers above for the happiness vouchsafed me. With these words he took a
complacent draught of the cordial, slicked his hair and opening his bosom out
popped a locket that hung from a silk ribbon, that very picture which he had
cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein. Gazing upon those features with
a world of tenderness, Ah, Monsieur, he said, had you but beheld her at that
affecting instant, in such an artless disorder, of so melting a tenderness, even you, Monsieur, had been impelled by the
<br><font color="green">{ms, 5}</font>
<br> generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands of such an enemy
or to quit the field for ever. I declare, I was never so touched in all my life.
Thrice happy will he be whom that amiable creature will bless with her favours.
A sigh of affection gave eloquence to these words and, having replaced the
locket in his bosom, he wiped his eyes and sighed again. Beneficent distributor
of <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the</span></span> blessings to
all thy creatures, how great &amp; universal must be that sweetest of thy
tyrannies which can hold in thrall, the free &amp; the bond, the simple swain

Would to God, he cried in anguish, that foresight had but remembered me to take
my cloak along! Then, though it had poured seven showers, we were neither of us
a penny the worse. But, beshrew me, he cried, clapping hand to his forehead
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">(brow)</span></span>, tomorrow
will be a new day. I know of a clothier&apos;s where I can have for a livre as
pretty a cloak as ever kept a lady from wetting. Tut, cries Le Fecondateur,

<br><font color="green">{ms, 6}</font>
<br> things<a target="foot" id="fpz0083">&ordm;</a> are not worth a sou. No
woman of any wit would wear them. My dear Kitty told me she would dance in a
deluge before ever she would starve in such an ark of salvation for as she
reminded me (and this she whispered in my ear though there was none to hear her
but butterflies) Dame Nature has implanted it in our hearts and it has become a
household word that <u>il y a deux choses</u> for which the innocence of our
original garb, in other circumstances a breach of the proprieties, is the
fittest, indeed the only garment. The first, said she (and here my pretty
philosopher, to draw my attention, gently tipped with her tongue the edge of my
ear) the first is a bath &mdash; But at this point a bell in the hall, ringing
most untimely, cut short a discourse which had promised so bravely for the enrichment of our store of knowledge.</p>
<p> Amid the general vacant hilarity of all the bell rang and while all were
conjecturing what might be the cause the good Miss Callan came in and, having
spoken a few words to young Mr Dixon, retired with a low bow to the company. The
presence even for a moment among a party of debauchees of a woman endued with
every quality of modesty and not less severe than beautiful refrained even the
humour of the most licentious but her departure was the signal for an outbreak
of ribaldry. Strike me silly, Dixon, said
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the</span></span> Costello, I
believe she has rendezvoused you. What, you dog? You succeed with them?
Immensely so, said Mr Lynch. The bedside manner it is that

<p> To revert to Mr Bloom, who, after his first entry had been conscious of some
impudent mocks <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">which</span></span>
he, however, had borne with as being the fruits of that age against which it is
commonly charged that it knows not pity, these words were for him an unwelcome
language. The students were full of extravagancies,
<a name="s14048ag" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14048ag">it was true</a>, and
the words of their tumultuary discussions were difficultly understood and not
often nice: their testiness and outrageous mots were such that his nature
resiled from: nor were they scrupulously
<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">unread</span></font>
of the proprieties though their fund of strong animal spirits spoke in their
behalf. But the word of Mr Costello was an unwelcome language for him for in he
nauseated the man that seemed to him a misshapen creature got in some uncouth
way and prematurely born so as to put him in thought of that missing link in the
chain of beings desiderated by the late ingenious Mr Darwin. It was
<a name="s14047f" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14047f">now for more than the
middle span of our allotted years that</a> he had passed through the thousand
vicissitudes of existence and, being of a wary ascendance and self a man of the
rarest forecast, he had enjoined his heart to repress all motions of a rising
choler and, by intercepting them with the readiest precaution, foster within his
breast that
<a name="s14009ap" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14009ap">plenitude</a> of
sufferance which <a name="s14045k" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14045k">base
minds jeer at, the hasty scorn and all</a> find tolerable and but tolerable. To
those who create themselves wits at the cost of feminine delicacy to them he
would concede neither to bear the name nor to inherit the tradition of nice
breeding: while for such that, having lost all forbearance, can lose no more,
there remained the sharp antidote of experience to cause their insolency to beat
<br><font color="green">{ms, 2}</font>
<br> an inglorious retreat. Not but what he could feel with mettlesome youth
which, caring nought for the megrims of dotards or the gruntlings of the severe,
is ever for eating of the tree forbid it yet not so far forth as to pretermit
humanity upon any condition soever towards a gentlewoman when she was about her
lawful occasions. To conclude, while from the sister&apos;s words, when
questioned, he had reckoned upon a speedy delivery he was, however, it must be
owned, not a little alleviated by the intelligence that the issue so auspicated
after a trial of such duress now testified once more to the mercy as well as to the bounty of the Supreme Being.</p>
<p> Accordingly he broke his mind to his neighbour saying that to express his
notion of the thing, his opinion (who ought not perhaps to express one) was that
one must have a cold constitution and a cold genius not to be rejoiced by this
freshest news of the fruition of her confinement since she had been in such pain
through no fault of hers. The dressy young spark said it was her husband&apos;s
fault or at least it ought to be unless she were another Ephesian matron. I must
acquaint you, said Mr Crotthers, clapping on the table so as to evoke a resonant
comment of emphasis, holy Joe was round today, a short meagre man with whiskers,
preferring a request to have word of Wilhelmina his wife as he calls her. I bade
him hold himself in readiness for that the event would burst anon. For my part I
cannot but extol the virile potency of the old bucko that could knock another
child out of her. All fell to praising of it, each after his fashion, though the
same young spark held with his former view that another
<br><font color="green">{ms, 3}</font>
<br> than<a target="foot" id="fpz0085">&ordm;</a> he was the man in the gap.
Singular, muttered the guest to himself, the wonderfully unequal faculty of
metempsychosis possessed by them, that the puerperal chamber and the dissecting
theatre should be the seminaries of such mirth and that the mere acquisition of
academic honours should suffice to transform in a pinch of time these votaries
of levity into exemplary practitioners of an art which most men anywise eminent
esteem the noblest. But, he further added, it is but to relieve the pentup
feelings that oppress them for that I have more than once observed that birds of a feather laugh together.</p>
<p> But with what fitness, let it be asked, has this alien whom the concession
of a gracious prince has admitted to civic rights constituted himself the lord
paramount of our politics? Where is now that gratitude which loyalty should have
counselled? During the recent war whenever the enemy had a temporary advantage
did he not seize
<a name="s14080aa" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14080aa">that moment</a> to
discharge his piece against the empire in which he is a tenant at will while he
trembled for the security of his four per cents? Has he forgotten this as he
forgets benefits received? Or is it that from being a deluder of others he has
become his own dupe as he is his own and his only enjoyer? Far be it from
candour to violate the bedchamber of a respectable lady, the daughter of a
gallant major, or to cast the most distant reflections upon her virtue but if he
challenges attention there (as it was indeed highly his interest not to have
done) then be it so. Unhappy woman, she has been too long and too persistently denied her legitimate
<br><font color="green">{ms, 4}</font>
<br> prerogative<a target="foot" id="fpz0086">&ordm;</a> to listen to his
objurgations with any other feeling than the derision of the desperate. He says
this, a censor of morals, who did not scruple, oblivious of the
<a name="s14037cb" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14037cb">ties of nature</a>,
to enter into illicit relations with a domestic servant drawn from the lowest
strata of society. In the question of the grazing lands his
<a name="s14037ca" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14037ca">peevish asperity</a>
is notorious and in Mr Cuffe&apos;s hearing brought upon him from an indignant
cattlebreeder a rebuke as straightforward as he was bucolic. It ill becomes to
preach that gospel. Has he not himself nearer home a seedfield that lies fallow
for the want of a ploughshare. A habit reprehensible at puberty is
<a name="s14037av" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14037av">second nature</a>
and an opprobrium in middle life. If he must dispense balm of Gilead to restore
to health a generation of unfledged profligates let his practice consist better
with the doctrines that now engross him. His marital breast is the repository of
secrets which decorum is reluctant to adduce. Let the lewd suggestion of some
faded and beauty console him for a wife, neglected &amp; debauched, but this new
exponent of natural philosophy and healer of ills is at best an oriental tree,
which when rooted in its native Gilead throve abundant in balm, but
transplanted, its roots have lost their
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">vigu</span></span> vigour and the
stuff that comes away from it is stagnant and inoperative.</p>
<p> The news was imparted with customary circumspection by the second female attendant to the junior
<br><font color="green">{ms, 5}</font>
<br> resident<a target="foot" id="fpz0087">&ordm;</a> who in his turn announced
to the delegation that an heir had been born. When he had retired to the
women&apos;s apartment in his company to assist at the ceremony of the
afterbirth the delegates, chafing under the length &amp; solemnity of their
vigil and hoping that the joyful occurrence would palliate for a licence which
the simultaneous absence of abigail and officer rendered the easier, broke out
at once into a strife of tongues. In vain the voice of Mr Canvasser Bloom was
heard endeavouring to urge, to mollify, to refrain: the moment was too
propitious for the display of that discursiveness which seemed the sole bond of
union among tempers so varied and divergent. Every phase of the situation was
successively eviscerated: the prenatal struggle of uterine brothers, the
Caesarean operation, the rights of primogeniture and queen&apos;s bounty
touching twins &amp; triplets, miscarriages &amp; infanticides, simulated &amp;
dissimulated,

the recorded instances of multiseminal monstrous births. The gravest problems of
obstetrics and forensic medicine were examined with as much animation as the
most popular beliefs on the subject of pregnancy such as the forbidding a gravid
woman to step over a countrystile lest, by her movement, the navelcord should
strangle the foetus in her womb and the injunction upon her in the event of a
yearning, ardently &amp; ineffectually entertained, to lay her hand against that
part of her person which long usage has consecrated as the seat of castigation.
The abnormalities of harelip and strawberry mark were cited by one as a <u>prima
facie</u> and natural explanation of those swineheaded or doghaired infants
occasionally born in opposition to the Caledonian envoy, whose theory, worthy of
the metaphysical traditions of the land he stood
<br><font color="green">{ms, 6}</font>
<br> for,<a target="foot" id="fpz0088">&ordm;</a> said in such cases an arrest
of embryonic development at some stage antecedent to the human. A foreign
delegate of a somewhat bestial cast of countenance sustained with such heat as
almost carried conviction the theory of copulation between women and
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">and</span></span> the males of
brutes, his authority being his own avouchment in support of fables such as that
of the <a name="s14070b" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14070b">Minotaur</a>
which the genius of the polished Latin poet has handed down to us. The
impression made by his words on an assembly so mobile was immediate but
shortlived. It was effaced as easily as it had been evoked by an allocution from
Mr Candidate Mulligan in that vein of pleasantry which none more than he knew
how to effect, postulating as the extremest object of desire
<a name="s14020f" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14020f">a nice clean old
man</a>. Contemporaneously a heated argument having arisen between Mr Delegate
Madden and Mr Candidate Lynch respecting the juridical &amp; theological dilemma
in the event of one Siamese twin predeceasing the other, the matter by mutual
consent was referred to Mr Canvasser Bloom for instant submittal to Mr Deacon
Dedalus. Hitherto silent, whether the better to show that curial dignity in the
garb of which he was invested or in obedience to an inward voice, he delivered
briefly and, as some thought, perfunctorily the ecclesiastical sentence
forbidding man to put asunder what God had joined.

<p> What<a target="foot" id="fpz0089">&ordm;</a> is the age of the soul of man?
As she hath the virtue of the chameleon to change her hue at every new approach,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 7}</font>
<br> to be gay with the gay and mournful with the downcast, so is her age too
changeable as her mood. No longer is Leopold the staid agent of publicity as he
sits there. A score of years are blown away: He is young Leopold. There in a
retrospective arrangement, as in a mirror within a mirror, he beholdeth himself.
That young figure of then is seen walking on a nipping morning from the old
house in Clanbrassil Street to the high school, his
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">book</span></span> satchel on him
bandolier with his books and a fair hunk of wheaten loaf. Or it is the same
figure, a <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">brace of</span></span>
years gone over, in its first hard hat (Ah, that was a day!), already on the
road, a fullfledged traveller for the family firm equipped with a orderbook, a
scented handkerchief not for show only, his case of bright trinketware and a
quiverful of compliant smiles for this or that halfwon housewife, reckoning it
out on her fingertips. The scent, the smile but most of all the dark eyes
brought many a commitment home by dusk to the head of the firm, seated in after
like <a name="s14014a" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14014a">labours</a>,
reading through horned spectacles some paper from the Europe of a month before.
Now the mirror is breathed on and the young adventurer recedes, shrivels,
dwindles to a tiny point within the mist. Now he is himself paternal and these
about him might be his sons. Who can tell? For only the wise father knows his
own child. He thinks of a drizzling night in Hatch street hard by the bonded
stores, the first. Together (she is a poor waif, a child of shame, of one and of
all for a bare shilling &amp; her luckpenny) together they hear the heavy tread
of the watch as two raincaped shadows pass the university
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">and</span></span>. Bridie Kelly.
He will ever remember the name and the night, the
<br><font color="green">{ms, 8}</font>
<br> first, the bridenight. They are entwined in nethermost darkness, the willer
with the willed and in an instant (fiat!) light shall flood the world. But hold!
Back! It must not be! In terror the poor girl flees away through the murk. She
is the bride of darkness, a daughter of night. She dare not bear the sunnygolden
babe of day. No, Leopold. Name and memory solace thee not. That youthful
illusion of thy strength was taken from thee and in vain. There is none now to
be for Leopold what was Leopold for Rudolph.</p>
<p> The voices blend and fuse in clouded silence: silence that is the infinity
of space: and silently, swiftly the soul is wafted over the regions of cycles of
generations that have lived. A
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">twilight</span></span> region
where grey eve ever descends and never falls on wide sagegreen pasturefields,
shedding her dusk<a target="foot" id="fpz0090">&ordm;</a> scattering a perennial
dew of stars. She follows her mother with ungainly steps, a mare leading her
filly foal. Twilight phantoms are they yet moulded in prophetic grace of
structure, slim shapely haunches, the supple tendonous neck, the meek
apprehensive skull. They fade, sad phantoms, and all is gone. Agendath is a
waste land, a home of screechowls and the sandblind upupa: Netaim, the golden,
is no more. And on the highway of the clouds they come, muttering thunder of
rebellion, the ghosts of beasts. Elk and yak, the bulls of Babylon and of
Bashan, the mammoth and the mastodon, they come trooping to the sunken sea,
<u>Lacus Mortis</u>. Ominous, revengeful, zodiacal host! They moan, passing upon
the clouds, horned and capricorned, the trumpeted with the tusked, the
giantantlered, all the moaning multitude, murderers

<p> Costello was<a target="foot" id="fpz0094">&ordm;</a>
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">reminded</span></span> reminding
Stephen of years before when they had been at school in Conmee&apos;s time. He
asked about Patrick and James and other friends. Where were they now? Neither
knew. You have spoken of the past and its phantoms, Stephen said. Why think of
them? If I call them into life across the waters of Lethe will the poor ghosts
not troop to my call? Who supposes it? I, Bous Stephanoumenos, am lord and giver
of their life. He encircled his gadding hair with a coronal of vineleaves,
smiling at Vincent. The answer and those leaves, Vincent said, will adorn you
more fitly when something more than a capful of light songs can call you father.
All hope this for you. I heartily wish you may not fail them. O no Vincent,
Lenehan said, laying his hand on the shoulder
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">nearest</span></span> near him.
Have no fear. He could not leave his mother an orphan. The young man&apos;s face
grew dark: all could see how sad it was for him to be reminded of his promise
and of his recent loss. He would have withdrawn from the feast had not the noise
of voices allayed the smart. Madden had lost five sesterces on Sceptre. Lenehan
as much more. He told them of the race. The flag fell and,
huuh<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span>! off, scamper,
the mare ran out freshly with O. Madden up. She was leading the field. All
hearts were beating even Phyllis waved her scarf and cried: Sceptre wins. But on
the run home in close order Throwaway outstripped her. All was lost. Phyllis was
silent: her eyes were sad anemones: but her lover consoled her and brought her a
little basket of delicate berries which she
<a name="s14081k" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14081k">partook</a>. A
whacking fine whip, said Lenehan, is W. Lane. Four winners yesterday and four
today. What rider is like him? Mount him on a
<br><font color="green">{ms, 2}</font>
<br> camel<a target="foot" id="fpz0095">&ordm;</a> or the boisterous buffalo the
victory is still his. But let us bear it as was the Roman wont. Poor Sceptre! he
said with a light sigh, she is not the filly that she was. Never shall we behold
such another, a queen of them. Do you remember her, Vincent? I wish you could
have seen my queen today, Vincent said. How young she was and radiant in her tan
shoes and frock of muslin. I do not know the right name of it.
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">A</span></span> Her posies too!
Mad romp that she is she had pulled her fill as we lay together. And in your
ear, my friend, he said to Francis, you will not imagine who met us as we left
the field. Conmee himself. The sweet creature turned all colours in her
confusion, feigning to reprove a slight disorder of her dress: a slip of
undergrowth clung there for the very trees adore her. When Conmee had passed she
glanced at her lovely echo in the little glass she carries. But he was kind to
us: in going by he blessed us. The gods too are ever kind, Lenehan said. If I
had poor luck with Bass&apos;s mare perhaps this draught of his may serve me
more propensely. He was laying his hand upon a winejar: Malachi saw it and
withheld his act: he pointed to the stranger and then to the scarlet label.
Warily, Malachi whispered. Preserve a druid silence. His soul is far away. It is
as painful perhaps to be awakened from a vision as to be borne. Any object,
intensely regarded, may be a gate of access to the incorruptible eon of the
gods. Do you not think it, Stephen? Theosophos told me so, Stephen answered. Him
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">as a youth</span></span>
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the</span></span> priests of Egypt
initiated into their mysteries. The lords of the moon, Theosophos told me, an
orangetawny shipload from planet Alpha of the lunar chain would not incarnate
the etheric doubles and these were therefore incarnated by the
<br><font color="green">{ms, 3}</font>
<br> rubycoloured<a target="foot" id="fpz0096">&ordm;</a> egos from the second constellation.</p>
<p> However, as a matter of fact though the surmise about him being in some sort
of a trance which was due to a misconception of the most shallow description,
was preposterously not the case at all. The individual whose visual organs were
now commencing to exhibit symptoms of life was as astute or astuter than any man
living and anybody that conjectured the contrary would have discovered
themselves pretty quickly mistaken. For the last few minutes or thereabouts he
had been staring at a certain amount of beer, bottled by Bass &amp; Co at Burton
on Trent and which happened to be situated right in front of where he was and
was certainly calculated to attract anybody&apos;s eye no matter whom on account
of its scarlet appearance. He was simply and solely recollecting two or three
private transactions of his own
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">of</span></span> which the two
others were as mutually innocent as the babe unborn. Eventually, however, both
their eyes met and
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">accordingly</span></span>
perceiving that the other was endeavouring to help himself out of the bottle he
involuntarily decided to help him himself and so accordingly he grasped the
glass mediumsized recipient which contained the refreshment sought after and
made a capacious hole in it by pouring a lot of it out with a considerable
degree of attentiveness not to upset any of the beer that was in it about the place.</p>
<p> The debate which ensued was, in its scope and progress, an epitome of the
course of life. The debaters were the keenest in the land. The theme they were
engaged on was the loftiest and most vital. The common hall of Horne&apos;s
house had never beheld an assembly so representative and so varied nor had the
old walls of that establishment ever
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">heard</span></span> listened to a
language so encyclopaedic. <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Then at the</span></span>
<br><font color="green">{ms, 4}</font>
<br> foot<a target="foot" id="fpz0097">&ordm;</a> of the table Crotthers in his
striking highland garb, his face glowing from the briny airs of the Mull of
Galloway, sat opposite to Lynch whose countenance born already the stigmata of
early depravity and premature wisdom. Next the Scotchman was the place assigned
to Costello, the eccentric, while at his side was seated, in stolid calm, the
squat form of Madden of Bantry. The chair of the resident indeed was vacant
before the hearth but on either side of it the figure of Bannon, in
explorer&apos;s kit contrasted sharply with the primrose elegance and easy
manners of Malachi Roland St John Mulligan. Lastly at the head of the board was
the young poet who found a refuge from his labours of pedagogy in the convivial
atmosphere of Socratic discussion while to right and left of him were seated the
flippant prognosticator, fresh from the hippodrome, and that vigilant wanderer,
soiled with the dust of travel &amp; conflict and stained by the mire of an
indelible disgrace, but in whose strong heart no lure or peril or threat or
degradation could ever efface the image of that voluptuous female loveliness
which the pencil of Lafayette has limned for posterity.</p>
<p> It had better be stated here that the transcendentalism to which Mr Stephen
Dedalus&apos; contentions would appear to prove him incurably addicted runs
directly counter to accepted scientific methods. Science, it cannot be too often
repeated, deals with phenomena. The man of science has to face hard facts and
explain them as best he can. There may be, it is true,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 5}</font>
<br> some<a target="foot" id="fpz0098">&ordm;</a> questions which science cannot
answer &mdash; at present &mdash; such as the first problem submitted by Mr
Bloom regarding the part played by sex in birth. Must we accept the view of
Empedocles of Trinacria that the right ovary is responsible for the birth of
males or are the too long neglected spermatozoa the differentiating factors or
is it, as <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the</span></span> more
advanced embryologists such as Lusk, Hertwig, Leopold and Valenti, are inclined
to opine, a mixture of both? The other problem raised by the same gentleman is
scarcely less vital: that of infant mortality. It is interesting because as he
very pertinently remarks in this connection we are all born in the same way but
we all die in different ways. Mr Mulligan blames the hygienic conditions in
which our greylunged citizens contract adenoids, pulmonary complaints, etc by
inhaling the germs that lurk in dust. Dr Crotthers attributes it to neglect,
whether private or official. Although the former is unfortunately only too true
the case he cites of nurses forgetting to remove the sponges from the peritoneal
cavity is too rare to be normative. An ingenious explanation is furnished by Mr
Lynch that both natality &amp; mortality, like all other natural phenomena,
tidal movements, lunar phases, blood temperature, diseases in general,
everything, in a word, in nature&apos;s vast workshop from the extinction of
some remote sun to the blossoming of one of the countless flowers which beautify our parks is subject to a law of
<br><font color="green">{ms, 6}</font>
<br> number<a target="foot" id="fpz0099">&ordm;</a> as yet unascertained. Still
the plain straightforward question why a child of normal healthy parents and
seemingly a healthy child and properly looked after dies unaccountably in early
childhood or youth (though other
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">d</span></span> children of the
same marriage do not) must certainly, as the poet says, give us pause. Nature,
we may rest assured, has her own good reasons for all that she does and in all
probability such deaths are due to some law of anticipation by which organisms
where morbous germs have taken up their residence (modern science has
conclusively shown that only the plasmic substance can be said to be immortal)
tend to disappear at an increasingly earlier stage of development, an
arrangement which, though productive of pain to some of our feelings (notably
the maternal) is nevertheless, all things considered, beneficial to the race in
securing thereby the survival of the fittest. Mr Dedalus&apos; remark (or should
it be called an interruption?) that an omnivorous being which can masticate,
deglute, digest and apparently pass in the ordinary fashion such various
aliments as cancrenous females,
<a name="s14081n" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14081n">emaciated</a> by
parturition, corpulent professional gentlemen, and
<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font>
might possibly find relief in an innocent meal of staggering bob reveals in a
very unsavoury light the tendency above alluded to. For the enlightenment of those who
<br><font color="green">{ms, 7}</font>
<br> perhaps<a target="foot" id="fpz0100">&ordm;</a> are not so intimately
acquainted with the secrets of the municipal abattoir as this morbidminded
esthete prides himself on being it should perhaps be stated that staggering bob
in the vile jargon of our lowerclass licensed victuallers, signifies the
cookable flesh of a calf newly dropped from its mother. In a recent public
controversy with Mr Bloom he is reported as having stated that once a woman has
let the cat into the bag she must let it out again or give it life (as he
phrased it) to save her own. At the risk of her own was the telling rejoinder of
his interlocutor none the less effective for the moderate tone in which it was delivered.</p>
<p> Meanwhile the skill and patience of the physician had brought about a happy
<u>accouchement</u>. It had been a weary, weary while both for patient and
doctor. All that surgical skill could do was done and the brave woman had
manfully helped. She had. She had fought the good fight and now she was very
very happy. Look at her as she reclines there in the first bloom of her new
motherhood, breathing a silent prayer of thanksgiving to One above, the
Universal Husband. And, as her loving eyes behold her babe she wishes only one
blessing more, to have her Fonsy there with her to share her joy, to lay in his
arms the fruit of their lawful embraces. He is elderly now and a trifle stooped
in the shoulders yet with the progress of years a grave dignity has come to
<br><font color="green">{ms, 8}</font>
<br> conscientious<a target="foot" id="fpz0101">&ordm;</a> chief accountant of
the Ulster bank. O Fonsy, loved one, faithful companion, it may never be again
that far off time of the roses! With the old shake of her pretty head she
recalls those days, God, how beautiful now across the mist of years! But their
children are there in her imagination about her bedside, hers and his, Charley,
Mary Alice, Frederick Albert (if he had lived), Mamie, Budgey (Frances
Victoria), Tom, Violet Constance Louisa, darling little Bobsy (named after our
famous hero of the South African war, lord Bobs of Waterford and Candahar) and
now this last. He will be christened Mortimer Edward after the influential third
cousin of Mr Purefoy in Dublin Castle. No, let no sigh break from that bosom,
dear gentle Mina. And Fonsy, knock the ashes from your, the old briar you still
fancy, when the curfew rings for you (may it be the distant day!) and dout the
light for the oil has run low in it and so to bed, to rest. You too have fought
the good fight. Sir to you my hand. Well done, thou good &amp; faithful servant.</p>
<p> There are sins, or let us call them evil memories, which are hidden away by
man in the darkest places of the heart but they abide there &amp; wait. He may
suffer their memory to grow dim, let them be as though they had not been, and all but persuade
<br><font color="green">{ms, 9}</font>
<br> himself<a target="foot" id="fpz0102">&ordm;</a> that they were not or were
otherwise yet a chance word will call them suddenly forth &amp; they will rise
up to confront him in the most various circumstances, the vision of some dream,
or while the harp and the timbrel soothe his senses or amid the cool silver
tranquility of evening or at the feast at midnight when he is now filled with
wine. Not to insult over him will the vision come as over one that lies under
her wrath and not for vengeance to cut him off from the living but shrouded in
the piteous vesture of the past, silent, remote, reproachful.</p>
<p> The stranger still regarded on the face before him a slow receding of that
false calm there, imposed, as it seemed, by habit or some studied trick, upon
words so embittered as to suggest in their speaker an unhealthy sensitiveness, a
<u>flair</u> for the cruder things of life. A scene disengages itself in the
observer&apos;s memory, a shaven space of lawn one soft May evening, the
wellremembered grove of lilacs at Roundtown fragrant slender spectators of the
game but with much real interest in the pellets as they run slowly forward over
the sward and stop, one by its fellow, with a brief alert shock. And yonder
about that grey urn you saw another
<a name="s14056l" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14056l">sisterhood</a>, Floey,
Atty, Tiny and their darker friend with I know not what of arresting in her pose then, Our Lady of
<br><font color="green">{ms, 10}</font>
<br> the<a target="foot" id="fpz0103">&ordm;</a> cherries, a comely brace of
them pendant on her ear bringing out the foreign warmth of her skin so daintily
against the cool ardent fruit. A lad of four or five in linsey woolsey of ripe
damson is standing on the urn
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">upheld</span></span> secured by
that circle of girlish hands. He frowns a little just as this young man does now
with <a name="s14056o" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14056o">perhaps</a> a too
conscious enjoyment of the danger but must needs glance at whiles towards where
his mother watches with a faint shadow of regret or of removal in her glad still look.</p>
<p> Mark this farther and remember. The end comes suddenly. Enter that
antechamber of birth where the studious are assembled and note their faces.
Nothing, as it seems, there of rash or violent. Quietude of custody, rather,
befitting their stations in that house, the vigilant watch of shepherds and of
angels on that holiest of nights in Bethlehem long ago. But as before the
lightning the serried stormclouds, heavy, with ponderous excess of moisture, in
swollen masses, turgidly distended, compass earth and sky in one vast slumber,
impending above parched field and drowsy oxen and blighted growth of shrub and
verdure till in an instant a flash rives their centres and, with the
reverberation of the thunder, the cloudburst pours its torrent
<a name="s14001bs" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14001bs">so and not
otherwise</a> in that room of quiet was the transformation, violent
<br><font color="green">{ms, 11}</font>
<br> &amp;<a target="foot" id="fpz0104">&ordm;</a> instantaneous upon the utterance of the word.</p>

universal grabbing at headgear, ashplants, Zermatt alpenstocks, hats of Panama
and what not. Nurse Callan taken aback in the hallway cannot stay them nor
smiling surgeon coming down the stairs with news of placentation ended, a full
pound if a milligram. They hark him on. The door. It is open? Ha! They are
forth, tumultuously off for a minute&apos;s race, all lustily legging it,
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">to</span></span> Burke&apos;s of

but raps out an oath and on. An instant Bloom stays with the nurse to send a
good word to happy mother, convalescent, up there. Doctor Diet and Doctor Quiet.
Looks she too not other now? And all being gone, a glance of motherwit helping,
he whispers close &nbsp;&hellip; The air without is impregnated with raindew
