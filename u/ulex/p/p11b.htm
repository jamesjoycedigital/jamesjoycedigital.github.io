<p class="pStDir">By no pomp of pride or mark of mightiness is the wellbeing of
a people more surely proven than by its solicitude for its own continuance
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">nor can we ever</span></span>
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">nor can we justly</span></span>
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">nor can we with justice esteem a
nation, which sets small store by</span></span> and where this quality either is
lacking or is set small store by we cannot with justice esteem a nation so
little provident, however wide be the dominion, be it ruled never so wisely. For
what boots it to gather and to garner
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">if none or weakling be
to</span></span> for none, or weaklings shall come after? Or
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">what</span></span> is that wisdom,
to extol his meat above the man himself, the dead which sustains life above the
living, which death should serve? Plainly no. If care for progress be absent in
vain was the house raised and the hearthstone laid to cheer.</p>
<p> Yet what <a name="s14038o" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14038o">boon</a>
of all can equal the bounty of increase. Where it is found
<a name="s14013co" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14013co">the land teems</a>
with produce, where not, is bare: or the
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext"><a name="s14009cl" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14009cl">barren</a></span></span>
heath and hillside, this but that the abundant wheatfield of heavy awns, the
fertile loam, the herds numbered and blessed. So was it said to Abraham increase
and multiply and it was promised his seed should not fail but be numerous:
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Sacred then</span></span> and even
the pagans saluted on meeting amid the press a matron with child for, if command
and promise from above warrant and if the wise of mankind at all times and
everywhere establish it, for even the rudest know this awe, sacred above all
else should be motherhood and its abode a temple inviolable.</p>
<p> This was, by concurrent witness, the practice in our land from the earliest
times where leechcraft was ever held high in honour.
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Not to</span></span> The sick, the
wayfarer, the stricken were the objects of wise care. Not to speak of their
hostels, their sweating chambers, their houses of sorrow, their greatest
leeches: as the O&apos;Shiels, the O&apos;Lees and the O&apos;Hickeys with many
others, record in their books the lore of herbs and cures as we may read
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">even now</span></span> with much
instruction how the trembling hand was cured and how the withering
<br><font color="green">{ms, 2}</font>
<br> the boyconnell too and the wave or loose flux. Now surely in such and so
varied learning we shall not miss a tender care for birth. And in fact it is so.
Before born the babe was blessed. Within the womb he won worship. Food and couch
were ready for her than should bear him and cleanness and the service of
midwives and what drugs were needed or surgical tools in the high bright
wellbuilt fair home of mothers when she came there to lie in, far gone, her time near.</p>
<p> Nor has this usage failed in our time. The Coombe hospital, the Rotunda, are
among us, where day after day the neverfailing fount of life is fostered and so
the tale of creatures does not lessen, for nature renews it ever from her bounty
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">which gives</span></span> giving,
if but to her one gift be given, her hundredfold yield. In this greater than we
and in her strength greater for the earth will suffer that chasms
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">to</span></span> rend her and the
sea <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">to</span></span> be sundered
to her depths <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">and</span></span>
yet show no worse, so strong is nature in them, while her chief child faints
under a light load, wailing comes to birth and is borne
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">with</span></span> as a child of
woe. But woe to them that know not this woe. Sweet woe whereof joy comes. If
hallowed was the ground where our dead are laid thrice hallowed should that
house be where life comes to new life, love to fruition.</p>

<p> Bloom, not unmindful, <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">lifted
the k</span></span> pressed the bell. That scene was known to him, who had seen
many for in Holles street where the doorbell rang he had dwelt in rough years
with one dear. Nine years since then were flown. Gently he pressed, knowing the
pangs of birth, fearful to bring fear. Pity led him and led on with lust to wander though awe withheld.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 3}</font> </p>
<p> Of that house
<a name="s14062ca" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14062ca">Andrew Horne</a> is
lord. <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">He goes</span></span> And
there are <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the</span></span> white
spotless couches set, seventy in all, with pillars of shining gold to give rest
to his seventy charges, the pregnant mothers. He goes forth betimes on his round
bringing to life, healing, with hands of comfort and he rejoices to look upon
his home where those wombs await him. Their eyes turn towards him for they long to be delivered and to bring forth.</p>
<p> Two guardians are there, nurse Callan and nurse
Quigley<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">. They</span></span> to see
that nothing lacks and tending hour by hour, whiterobed,, soothing sisters, they
watch by turns. The old they still, sustain the young, in twelve months thrice
five hundred <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">they</span></span>.
Vigilant ever for a sign they move softly.</p>
<p> Softly the halldoor opened of the house and to Bloom greeting whiterobed
nurse Callan answered with fair words, and bade him in. To her he was known. She
and he precedent, stepped soft on the hall mat. She asked his news which softly
he told, <a name="s14077k" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14077k">hat
holding</a> in hand, to not molest, in Horne&apos;s house. Much in nine years
had come to pass. Once her in a throng he had met and when she bowed had not
doffed. Now pardon he craved, for
<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">unread</span></font>
pleas she kindly gave that that to him seen sudden face hers so young then
seemed. Light her eyes lit. Bloom of blushes
<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">unread</span></font> Bloom&apos;s words.</p>
<p> Then when her eyes watchful perceived his dark mien solititous she asked if
feared grief for him. Glad was she if before afraid. He thereat asked how Doctor
O&apos;Hare died. Earnest mien then her face took which late awhile had roseate shone.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 4}</font>
<br> With veiled eyes low <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">she
said</span></span> poor Doctor O&apos;Hare was in heaven, she said. Bloom was
sorry to hear that. In his hat high grave he sad looked
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">mute</span></span>. Nurse Callan
sighed pitying fate for one so good yet unwilling to question God&apos;s will.
Bloom she told how this passed in Scotland, stomach cancer the cause. His mute,
condolent head, in held hat <font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">unread</span></font> staring.</p>
<p> Death thus end to beginning links. On earth&apos;s face race
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">afar</span></span> race appears:
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">appears and dies:</span></span>
but <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the</span></span> deathless
urge of life ever onward drives. Burdens we bare, burdened we, which the unborn must bear, if born.</p>
<p> Her Bloom softspeeched of Mona Purefoy asked. If all well he begged to know.
Hard her case nurse Callan said, hard the birth, if born, would be. Bloom on mat
with hat hearkened. U.P. Josie ringletted hair he knew but law strong, stern.
Rueful he heard of pangs prolonged: Woman&apos;s woe vicarious feeling a
misteyed woman&apos;s tale Bloom heard. So young she was,
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Young she is</span></span> youth
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">he longed for</span></span>
prolonged. He on her looked as then. Nine years. A Virgin. Bloom pondered.

<p> In that chamber sat at board a

for he knew his own wretchedness which could not be done away with by words. And
was he then neither calm like the one nor godly like the other? He was neither
as much as he would have liked to be either. But could he not

Indeed no for grace was not there to give it to him. Would he then in that
thunder a voice of the god or, what calmer said, a natural phenomenon? Heard?
Why he could not forebear hearing both of those things unless
<a name="s14023cu" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14023cu">peradventure</a> he
had up his understanding (which he had not done). For understanding told him
that he was in the kingdom of phenomenon where he must certainly one day die as

the law of his kingdom. Then

tongue But Mr Stephen
<a name="s14071h" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14071h">a little moved but
very handsomely</a> told him no such matter that he had a letter from the

was sending <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">two of</span></span>
the respectablest horseleeches in his kingdom
<a name="s14013h" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14013h">to take the bull by

<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">and if</span></span> he&apos;ll
find himself on the horns of a dilemma, says he, if the bull&apos;s Irish. Irish
she is, says Mr Stephen, sending the ale about. An Irish
<a name="s14072a" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14072a">bull in an English
chinashop</a>. I conceive you, says Mr Dixon, and that same bull was sent here
by the bravest cattlebreeder of them all that was
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the

with an emerald ring in his nose. That&apos;s true for you, says Mr Lynch, and a
bullseye <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">too</span></span> into
the bargain and a properer and a handsomer bull never shit
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">on a buttercup</span></span> on
clover. He had <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">a pair
of</span></span> golden horns <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">on
him and</span></span> a coat of cloth of gold and sweet smoky breath so that all
the women of Ireland followed after him, hanging daisychains on his horns. To be
sure he was gelded by farmer Breakspeare that taught him his trade but maid,
wife and widow to this day affirm they would rather
<br><font color="green">{ms, 18}</font>
<br> any day whisper in his ear or get a lick or two on the neck from his tongue
than lie with any pretty fellow
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">between</span></span> in the four
fields of Ireland. Another then
<a name="s14011c" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14011c">put in his word</a>:
and they dressed him up, says he, in a shift and petticoat with a tippet round
his neck and built a barn for him with a fine manger in it full of the best
grass for by this time our bull was grown so
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">he</span></span> fat and heavy
that he could scarce walk to pasture. To remedy which they brought him his good
feed of fodder in their apronlaps, and, as soon as his belly was full, he used
to rear up on his hind quarters to show them a mystery and bellow and roar to
that extent they were struck with wonder. Ay, says a third, but worse than that
he grew so pampered he would have nought in the land but green grass growing for
himself and the herd and if ever he got scent of a
<a name="s14025aa" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14025aa">husbandman</a> that
was sowing as much as a handful of mustard or a bag of rapeseed he&apos;d run
amok over half the countryside rooting up with his horns whatsoever was planted.
To cut it short all the men of the island seeing no help was for it, as their
women, old and young, were all of the one mind, made a raft of timbers and
loading themselves and their chattels aboard pushed off from the land in quest of

come to town, it being his intention to take the King&apos;s commission now
appeared in the doorway <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">just as

the more as it

Whereupon he handed round to the company a set of cards which he had had printed

went on to expound, was to withdraw from the round of idle pleasures such as
form the chief business of our men about town and to devote himself to the
noblest task for which the bodily organism is destined. To this end he had
resolved to purchase the freehold of Lambay island from count Considine, a gentleman of note much in favour with

whom were the <a name="s14011g" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14011g">loaves
and fishes</a> and then, seeing Mr Bloom, he made him a civil bow and asked if he were in need of

<br> any professional assistance? Mr Bloom thanked him very heartily and
<a name="s14022t" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14022t">made return</a> that

taken place</a>. One of the company there asking Mr Mulligan would he give also

<br> if he might
<a name="s14039am" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14039am">treat him with</a> a

<a name="s14039o" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14039o">There wanted

of the cordial,

from a silk ribbon, the very same picture</a> which he had

Gazing upon the picture with

affection gave eloquence to his words and, replacing the locket, he
<a name="s14039ag" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14039ag">wiped his eyes</a>
and sighed again. Just powers above, how great must be that sweetest of
tyrannies which holds subject the poet and the

<a name="s14086aj" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14086aj">last two</a> minutes
he had been staring <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">at the bottle
which was in front of him as it happened on the table</span></span>
<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font>
<br> <a name="s14086ao" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14086ao">and which</a>
happened to be in front of him and was
<a name="s14086c" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14086c">calculated</a> to
attract the eye on account of its scarlet colour. He was thinking about some
private transactions of his own of which the two mutual friends were
<a name="s14023cl" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14023cl">as innocent as the
babe unborn</a>. Eventually, however,
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">he</span></span> perceiving that
the other was trying to help himself to the beer he involuntarily decided to
help him himself and accordingly grasped the mediumsized recipient and made a
<a name="s14086d" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14086d">capacious</a> hole in
it by pouring a lot of it with a considerable degree of attentiveness not to upset any of it about the place.</p>
<p> The debate which ensued was, in its scope and progress, an epitome of life.
The debaters were the keenest in the land. The theme they were engaged on was
the loftiest for debate. The common hall of Horne&apos;s house had never beheld an assembly so representative
<br><font color="green">{ms, 3}</font>
<br> and<a target="foot" id="fpz0019">&ordm;</a> so
varied<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span> nor had the
old walls of that establishment ever heard a language so encyclopaedic.
Crotthers, <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">from</span></span> in
the striking highland garb, sat
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">beside</span></span> facing Lynch,
whose countenance bore already the signs of
<a name="s14048ar" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14048ar">premature</a> vice
and preternatural cynicism. Below these at the foot of the board and on either
side of it the figure of Bannon in his traveller&apos;s kit contrasted finely
with the primrose elegance and easy manners of Malachi Roland St John Mulligan.
The chair of the resident himself stood vacant before the hearth but beside it
was the place assigned to Costello, the eccentric
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">vagrant who</span></span> while
opposite to him in stolid silence sat
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the</span></span> the squat form
of Madden of Thurles. Lastly at the head of the table was the young poet whose
found a refuge from his
<a name="s14014a" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14014a">labours</a> of
pedagogy in the the convivial atmosphere of Socratic discussion while to right
and left of him were the prognosticator
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">of</span></span>, fresh from the
hippodrome, and the indominatable wanderer, soiled with the dust of conflicts
and <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">sins</span></span> stained
with the mire of a deep dishonour, but in whose heart no lure or peril or
&mdash; or degradation could ever efface the voluptuous image
<br><font color="green">{ms, 4}</font> </p>
<p> It<a target="foot" id="fpz0020">&ordm;</a> had better be said here that the
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">point of view</span></span>
transcendentalism to which Mr Stephen Dedalus&apos; contentions would appear to
prove him <a name="s14077d" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14077d">addicted</a>
runs counter to scientific methods. Science, it cannot be too often said, deals
with phenomena. The man of science has to face hard facts and explain them as
best he can. There are, it is true, some questions which science cannot answer
&mdash; at present &mdash; like the two problems submitted by Mr Bloom as to
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">why one is born male or
female</span></span> the problem played by sex in birth. Must we accept the
opinion of
<a name="s14077at" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14077at">Hippocrates</a> that
<a name="s14077ba" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14077ba">the right ovary is
responsible for the males</a> or are the too long neglected
<a name="s14062be" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14062be">spermatozoa</a> the
differentiating factors or is it a mixture of both. The second problem raised by
the same gentleman is even more vital: infant mortality. Dr Mulligan blames the
hygienic conditions in which our
<a name="s14001bj" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14001bj">greylunged
citizens</a> contract
<a name="s14001bl" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14001bl">adenoids</a>,
pulmonary complaints, etcetera from inhaling germs that lurk in
<a name="s14001bl" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14001bl">dust</a>. Dr
Crotthers attributes it to neglect whether private or official. Although the
former is undoubtedly true the case he mentions of
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">a</span></span>
<a name="s14070a" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14070a">nurses forgetting to

is offered by Mr Lynch that both natality &amp; mortality like all other
phenomena tidal movements, lunar phases, everything, in fact, in nature&apos;s
vast world from the <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">birth</span></span> extinction of

blossoming of one of the many flowers which beautify our parks is subject to a
<a name="s14071p" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14071p">law of number</a> as
yet unascertained. But when we are faced with the plain &amp; straight question
a child born of normal healthy parents and apparently a healthy child and
properly looked after unaccountably dies (though other children born of the same
marriage do not)
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">then</span></span> must certainly,
as the poet says, gives us pause. Nature, we may be sure, has her own good
reasons for what she does &amp; in all probability these deaths are due to some
<a name="s14071q" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14071q">law of
anticipation</a> by which organisms in which morbous
<a name="s14070ar" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14070ar">germs have taken up
their residence</a> (science has now proved conclusively that only the plasmic
substance can be said to be immortal) tend to disappear at an increasingly early
stage of development, thereby securing
<a name="s14070ao" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14070ao">a survival of the
fittest</a>. Mr Dedalus&apos; remark that an omnivorous being which can
masticate, deglute, digest and apparently pass in the ordinary fashion aliments
such as cancrenous females of middle age, pottlebellied solicitors
<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font>

unsavoury light the tendency alluded to above. For the enlightenment of those
who perhaps are not so intimately acquainted with the secrets of the abattoir as this morbidminded esthete seems
<br><font color="green">{ms, 6}</font>
<br> to<a target="foot" id="fpz0022">&ordm;</a> be it should perhaps be stated
that staggering bob, in the vile jargon of our licensed victuallers, signifies
the flesh of a
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">dayold</span></span> calf
newdropped from its mother. In a recent controversy with Mr Bloom he is reported
to have stated that once a woman has let the cat into the bag she must let it
out again and give it life to save her own. At the risk of her own
<a name="un4021at" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4021at">was the
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">reply</span></span> rejoinder</a>,
none the less effective for the moderate tone in which it was delivered.
Meanwhile the skill and patience of the doctors had brought about a happy
<a name="s14037bj" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14037bj">accouchement</a>. It
had been a <a name="s14055l" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14055l">weary weary
while</a> both for patient and physician. All that medical skill could do was
done and <a name="s14055ac" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14055ac">the brave

<a name="s14055af" href="../../ff/unbs/s14all.htm#s14055af">very very happy</a>.
Look at her as she reclines there in the first
