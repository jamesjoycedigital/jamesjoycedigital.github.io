<p class="pith">What course did Bloom and Stephen follow on their homeward way?</p>
<p class="flush">Lower and Middle Gardiner street they followed Mountjoy square
west and then bore left along Gardiner&apos;s Place and took Temple street on
their right from the farther corner by an inadvertence as far as
<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font>.
They crossed the circus before George&apos;s church diametrically towards Eccles
street to shorten their journey, the chord in any circle being lesser than the

<p class="pith">Did Bloom like Eccles street?</p>
<p class="flush"><a name="s17041r" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17041r">He
disliked to meet anywhere or at any time dwellers in it</a> during his
perambulations, he remembered Lombard street west and old friends no longer so
since marriage &amp; since he moved to the north side, yet he comforted himself
by remembering that <a name="s17041t" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17041t">in

least three times reminded himself not to forget to change it,</a></p>
<p class="pith">How did they enter the house?</p>
<p class="flush">By this stratagem. Bloom, not wishing to alarm his wife,
climbed over the area railings. He secured his hat on his head and grasping the
rails under
<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font>
gently lowered himself to the full extent of his five feet nine inches to within
two feet eight inches of the area flags. Taking breath he allowed himself to
drop by his ten stone four weight per weighing machine of &mdash; McConnell,
pharmaceutical chemists the preceding Easter eve,
(<a name="s17009a" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17009a">periodic selfweighing
being his habit</a>), crouching on all fours
<a name="un4049bf" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4049bf">to break the
fall</a>. He then rose, lifted up the latch of the areadoor and made his way in
to the kitchen where he lit the gas and, husbanding the same match, a candle also.</p>
<p class="pith">Where was Stephen meanwhile?</p>
<p class="flush">On the footpath looking down. He saw Bloom make light in the
<a name="s17042a" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17042a">basement</a> and
beckon and then saw him unlace and put off him off his boots and then leave the
kitchen, holding the candle in a stick.</p>
<p class="pith">What happened after this?</p>
<p class="flush">after this Some few minutes Stephen saw a glimmer on the
<a name="s17011i" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17011i">fanlight</a> over
Bloom&apos;s halldoor. The halldoor swung ajar on its hinges slowly and Bloom,
without his hat and with his candlestick, appeared in the opening and said Sst! to enter.
