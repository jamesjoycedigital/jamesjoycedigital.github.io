<p class="ith">Did Bloom discover common factors of similarity between their
respective like and unlike reactions to experience?</p>
<p> Both were sensitive to artistic impressions, musical in preference to
plastic or pictorial. Both preferred a continental to an insular manner of
<br><font color="green">{u21, 737}</font>
<br> life, a cisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence. Both indurated
by early domestic training and an inherited tenacity of resistance professed
their disbelief in many accepted religions, national, social and ethical
doctrines. Both admitted the alternately stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual magnetism.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 620}</font> </p>
<p class="ith">Were their views on some points divergent?</p>
<p> Stephen dissented openly from Bloom&apos;s views on the importance of
dietary and civic selfhelp while Bloom dissented tacitly from Stephen&apos;s
views on the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature.

between Gibraltar villa and Bloomfield house in Crumlin, barony of Uppercross.
In 1886 occasionally with casual acquaintances and prospective purchasers on

<p> He reflected that the progressive extension of the field of

<p class="ith">What action did Bloom make on their arrival at their destination?</p>
<p> At the housesteps of the 4th of the equidifferent uneven numbers, number 7

<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">of his

<p class="ith">Was it there?</p>
<p> It was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn on the day but one preceding.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 739}</font> </p>
<p class="ith">Why was he doubly irritated?</p>
<p> Because he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had reminded himself twice not to forget.</p>
<p class="ith">What were then the alternatives before the keyless couple?</p>
<p> To enter or not to enter. To knock or not to knock.</p>
<p class="ith">His decision?</p>
<p> A stratagem. Resting his feet on the dwarf wall, he climbed over the area
railings, compressed his hat on his head, grasped two points at the lower union
of rails and stiles, lowered his body gradually by its length of five feet nine
inches and a half to within two feet ten inches of the area
pavement<font color="red"><sup><small>|6'</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>6'|</small></sup></font>
and allowed his body to move freely in space by separating himself from the
railings and crouching in preparation for the impact of the fall.</p>
<p class="ith">Did he fall?</p>
<p> By his body&apos;s known weight of ten stone and four

by friction, set free inflammable coal gas by turning on the ventcock, lit a
high flame which, by regulating, he reduced to quiescent candescence and lit finally a portable candle.</p>
<p class="ith">What discrete succession of images did Stephen meanwhile perceive?</p>
<p> Reclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparent
kitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame

lighting a candle, a man removing in turn each of his two boots, a man leaving the kitchen holding a candle.</p>
<p class="ith">Did the man reappear elsewhere?</p>
<p> After a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible
through the
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">semitransparent</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>
glass fanlight over the halldoor. The halldoor turned gradually on its hinges.
In the open space of the doorway the man reappeared without his hat, with his candle.</p>
<p class="ith">Did Stephen obey his sign?</p>
<p> Yes, entering softly, he helped to close and chain the door and followed
softly along the hallway the man&apos;s back and listed feet and lighted candle
past a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and carefully down a turning
staircase of more than five steps into the kitchen of Bloom&apos;s house.</p>
<p class="ith">What did Bloom do?</p>
<p> He extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its flame,
drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone, one for Stephen with his back
to the area window, the other for himself when necessary, knelt on one knee,
composed in the grate a pyre of crosslaid resintipped sticks and various
coloured papers and irregular polygons of best Abram coal at twentyone shillings a ton from the yard of

miles, and thence, through a system of relieving tanks, by a gradient of 250
feet to the city boundary at Eustace bridge, upper Leeson street, though from
prolonged summer drouth and daily supply of 12&frac12; million gallons the water
had fallen below the sill of the overflow weir for which reason the borough
surveyor on the instructions of the waterworks committee had prohibited the use
of municipal water for purposes other than those of consumption (envisaging the

placed in his hand a throwaway (subsequently thrown away), advertising Elijah,
restorer of the church in Zion, in Lincoln place outside the premises of F. W.
Sweny and Co (Limited), dispensing chemists, when, when Frederick M. (Bantam)
Lyons had rapidly and successively requested, perused and restituted the copy of
the current issue of the <i>Freeman&apos;s Journal</i> and <i>National Press</i>
which he had been about to throw away (subsequently thrown away), he had
proceeded towards the oriental edifice of the Turkish and Warm Baths, 11 Leinster street, with the light of
<br><font color="green">{u22, 629}</font>
<br> inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the secret
of the race, graven in the language of prediction.</p>
<p class="ith">What qualifying considerations allayed his perturbations?</p>
<p> The difficulties of interpretation since the significance of any event

<p class="ith">What satisfied him?</p>
<p> To have sustained no positive loss. To have brought a positive gain to others. Light to the gentiles.</p>
<p class="ith">How did Bloom prepare a collation for a gentile?</p>
<p> He poured into two teacups two level spoonfuls, four in all, of Epps&apos;s

<p class="ith">What cerebration accompanied his act?</p>
<p> Concluding by inspection but erroneously that his silent companion was
engaged in mental composition he reflected on the pleasures derived from
literature of instruction rather than of amusement as he himself had applied to
the works of Shakespeare more than once for the solution of difficult problems in imaginary or real life.</p>
<p class="ith">Had he found their solution?</p>

aided by a glossary, he had derived imperfect conviction from the text, the answers not bearing in all points.</p>

<p class="ith">Did their conversation on the subject of these reminiscences
reveal a third connecting link between them?</p>
<p> Mrs Riordan, a widow of independent means, had resided in the house of
Stephen&apos;s parents from 1 September 1888 to 29 December 1891 and had also
resided during the years 1892, 1893 and 1894 in the City Arms Hotel owned by
Elizabeth O&apos;Dowd of 54 Prussia street where, during parts of the years 1893
and 1894, she had been a constant informant of Bloom who resided also in the
same hotel, being at that time a clerk in the employment of Joseph Cuffe of 5
Smithfield for the superintendence of sales in the adjacent Dublin Cattle market on the North Circular road.</p>
<p class="ith">Had he performed any special corporal work of mercy for her?</p>
<p> He had sometimes propelled her on warm summer evenings, an infirm widow of
independent, if limited, means, in her convalescent bathchair with slow
revolutions of its wheels as far as the corner of the North Circular road
opposite Mr Gavin Low&apos;s place of business where she had remained for a
certain time scanning through his onelensed
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">binocular</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>
fieldglasses unrecognisable citizens on tramcars, roadster bicycles equipped
with inflated pneumatic tyres, hackney carriages, tandems, private and hired
landaus, dogcarts, ponytraps and brakes passing from the city to the Phoenix Park and <i>vice versa</i>.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 754}</font> </p>
<p class="ith">Why could he support that his vigil with the greater equanimity?</p>
<p> Because in middle youth he had often sat observing through a rondel of
bossed glass of a multicoloured pane the spectacle offered with continual
changes of the thoroughfare without, pedestrians, quadrupeds, velocipedes,
vehicles, passing slowly, quickly, evenly, round and round and round the rim of
a round
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">and
round<a target="foot" id="fss0085">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>
precipitous globe.</p>
<p class="ith">What distinct different memories had each of her now eight years deceased?</p>
<p> The older, her bezique cards and counters, her Skye terrier, her
suppositious wealth, her lapses of responsiveness and incipient catarrhal
deafness: the younger, her lamp of colza oil before the statue of the Immaculate Conception,
<br><font color="green">{u22, 634}</font>
<br> her green and maroon brushes for Parnell and for Michael Davitt, her tissue papers.</p>
<p class="ith">Were there no means still remaining to him to achieve the
rejuvenation which these reminiscences divulged to a younger companion rendered the more desirable?</p>
<p> The indoor exercises, formerly intermittently practised, subsequently
abandoned, prescribed in Eugen Sandow&apos;s <i>Physical Strength and How to
Obtain It</i> which, designed particularly for commercial men engaged in
sedentary occupations, were to be made with mental concentration in front of a
mirror so as to bring into play the various families of muscles and produce
successively a pleasant rigidity, a more pleasant relaxation and the most
pleasant repristination of juvenile agility.</p>
<p class="ith">Had any special agility been his in earlier youth?</p>
<p> Though ringweight lifting had been beyond his strength and the full circle
gyration beyond his courage yet as a High School scholar he had excelled in his
stable and protracted execution of the half lever movement on the parallel bars
in consequence of his abnormally developed abdominal muscles.

<p class="ith">Condense Stephen&apos;s commentary.</p>
<p> One of all, the least of all, is the victim predestined. Once by
inadvertence, twice by design he challenges his destiny. It comes when he is
abandoned and challenges him reluctant and, as an apparition of hope and youth,
holds him unresisting. It leads him to a strange habitation, to a secret infidel
apartment, and there, implacable, immolates him, consenting.</p>
<p class="ith">Why was the host (victim predestined) sad?</p>
<p> He wished that a tale of a deed should be told of a deed not by him should by him not be told.</p>
<p class="ith">Why was the host (reluctant, unresisting) still?</p>
<p> <font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font></p>
<p class="ith">Why was the host (secret infidel) silent?</p>
<p> He weighed the possible evidences for and against ritual murder: the
incitations of the hierarchy, the superstition of the populace, the envy of
opulence<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">:</span></span><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>
the influence of retaliation, the sporadic reappearance of atavistic
delinquency, the mitigating circumstances of fanaticism, hypnotic suggestion and sonambulism.</p>
<p class="ith">From which of these mental or physical disorders was he not totally immune?</p>
<p> From hypnotic suggestion: once, waking, he had not recognised his sleeping
apartment: more than once, waking, he had been for an indefinite time incapable
of moving or uttering sounds. From sonambulism:
<br><font color="green">{u21, 768}</font>
<br> once, sleeping, his body had risen, crouched and crawled in the direction
of a heatless fire and, having attained its destination, there, curled,
unheated, in night attire had lain, sleeping.</p>
<p class="ith">Had this latter or any cognate phenomenon declared itself in any member of his family?</p>
<p> Twice, in Holles street and in Ontario terrace, his daughter Millicent
(Milly) at the ages of 6 and 8 years had uttered in sleep an exclamation of
terror and had replied to the interrogations of two figures in night attire with a vacant mute expression.

<p> Conversely the nasal and frontal formation was derived in a direct line of
lineage which, though interrupted, would continue at distant intervals to more
distant intervals to its most distant intervals.</p>

she declined to permit him to make and take away her photographic image. On the
South Circular road in the company of Elsa Potter, followed by an individual of
sinister aspect, she went half way down Stamer street and turned abruptly back.
On the vigil of the 15th anniversary of her birth she wrote a letter from Mullingar,

<p class="ith">Why similarly, why differently?</p>
<p> Similarly, because actuated by a secret purpose the quest of a new male
(Mullingar student) or of a healing herb (valerian). Differently, because of
different possible returns to the inhabitants or to the habitation.</p>
<p class="ith">In other respects were their differences similar?</p>

free surface of the lake in Stephen&apos;s green amid inverted reflections of
trees her uncommented spit, describing concentric circles of waterrings,
indicated by the constancy of its permanence the locus of a somnolent prostrate
fish. In order to remember the date, combatants, issue and consequences of a
famous military engagement she pulled a plait of her hair. Silly Milly, she
dreamed of having had an unspoken unremembered conversation with a horse whose
name had been Joseph to whom (which) she had offered a tumblerful of lemonade

<p class="ith">In what manners did she reciprocate?</p>
<p> She remembered: on the 27th anniversary of his birth she presented to him a
breakfast moustachecup of imitation crown Derby porcelain ware. She provided: at
quarter day or thereabouts if or when purchases had been made by him not for her
she showed herself attentive to his necessities, anticipating his desires. She
admired: a natural phenomenon having been explained by him to her she expressed
the immediate desire to possess without gradual acquisition a fraction of his
science, the moiety, the quarter, a thousandth part.

<p class="ith">What rendered problematic for Bloom the realisation of these mutually selfexcluding propositions?</p>
<p> The irreparability of the past: once at a performance of Albert
Hengler&apos;s circus in the Rotunda, Rutland square, Dublin an intuitive
particoloured clown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring to a
place in the auditorium where Bloom, solitary, was seated and had publicly
declared to an exhilarated audience that he (Bloom) was his (the clown&apos;s)
papa. The imprevidibility of the future: once in the summer of 1898 he (Bloom)
had marked a florin (2/-) with three notches on the milled edge and tendered it
in payment of an account due to and received by J. and T. Davy, family grocers,
1 Charlemont Mall, Grand Canal, for circulation on the waters of civic finance,
for possible, circuitous or direct, return.</p>

<p class="ith">With what sensations did Bloom contemplate in rotation these objects?</p>
<p> With strain, elevating a candlestick: with pain feeling on his right temple
a contused tumescence: with attention, focussing his gaze on a large dull
passive and a slender bright active: with amusement, remembering Dr Malachi
Mulligan&apos;s scheme of colour containing the gradation of green: with
pleasure, repeating the words and antecedent act and perceiving through various
channels of internal sensibility the consequent and concomitant tepid pleasant diffusion of gradual discolouration.</p>
<p class="ith">His next proceeding?</p>
<p> From an open box on the majolicatopped table he extracted a black diminutive
cone,
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">1</span></span>
<font color="black">one</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>
inch in height, placed it on its circular base on a small tin plate, placed his
candlestick on the right corner of the mantelpiece, produced from his waistcoat
a folded typed letter, unfolded the folded letter, examined it
<br><font color="green">{u21, 785}</font>
<br> superficially, rolled it into a thin cylinder, ignited it in the
candleflame, applied it when ignited to the apex of the cone till the latter
reached the stage of rutilance, placed the cylinder in the basin of the
candlestick disposing its unconsumed part in such a manner as to facilitate total combustion.</p>
<p class="ith">What followed this operation?</p>
<p> The truncated conical crater summit of the diminutive volcano emitted a
vertical and serpentine fume redolent of aromatic oriental incense.</p>
<p class="ith">What objects, other than the candlestick, stood on the mantelpiece?
<br><font color="green">{u22, 660}</font> </p>
<p> A timepiece of striated Connemara marble, stopped at the hour of 4.46 a.m.

an embalmed owl, matrimonial gift of Alderman John Hooper.</p>
<p class="ith">What interchanges of looks took place between these three objects and Bloom?</p>
<p> In the mirror of the giltbordered pierglass the undecorated back of the
dwarf tree regarded the upright back of the embalmed owl. Before the mirror the
matrimonial gift of Alderman John Hooper with a clear melancholy wise bright
motionless compassionate gaze regarded Bloom while Bloom with obscure tranquil
profound motionless compassionated gaze regarded the matrimonial gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle.</p>
<p class="ith">What composite asymmetrical image in the mirror then attracted his attention?</p>
<p> The image of a solitary (ipsorelative) mutable (aliorelative) man.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 786}</font> </p>
<p class="ith">Why solitary (ipsorelative)?</p>
<p class="set"><i>Brothers and sisters had he none.</i>
<br> <i>Yet that man&apos;s father was his grandfather&apos;s son.</i></p>
<p class="ith">Why mutable (aliorelative)?</p>
<p> From infancy to maturity he had resembled his maternal procreatrix. From
maturity to senility he would increasingly resemble his paternal procreator.</p>
<p class="ith">What final visual impression was communicated to him by the mirror?</p>
<p> The optical reflection of several inverted volumes with scintillating titles on the two bookshelves opposite.</p>

dated this 10th day of May 1822, and reque&#383;ting the per&#383;on who should

Gallagher, carpenter, Dufery Gate, Enniscorthy, county Wicklow, the finest place in the world.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 788}</font> </p>
<p class="ith">What reflections occupied his mind during the process of reversion of the inverted volumes?</p>
<p> The necessity of order, a place for everything and everything in its place:
the deficient appreciation of literature possessed by females: the incongruity
of an apple incuneated in a tumbler and of an umbrella inclined in a closestool:
the insecurity of hiding any secret document behind, beneath or between the pages of a book.</p>
<p class="ith">Why, firstly and secondly, did he not consult the work in question?</p>
<p> Firstly, in order to exercise mnemotechnic: secondly, because after an
interval of amnesia, when, seated at the central table, about to consult the work
<br><font color="green">{u22, 663}</font>
<br> in question, he remembered by mnemotechnic the name of the military engagement, Plevna.</p>
<p class="ith">What caused him irritation in his sitting posture?</p>
<p> Inhibitory pressure of collar (size 17) and waistcoat (5 buttons),
<br><font color="green">{u21, 789}</font>
<br> two articles of clothing superfluous in the costume of mature males and
inelastic to alterations of mass by expansion.</p>
<p class="ith">How was the irritation allayed?</p>
<p> He removed his collar, with contained black necktie and collapsible stud,
from his neck to a position on the left of the table. He unbuttoned successively
in reversed direction waistcoat, trousers, shirt and vest along the medial line
of irregular incrispated black hairs extending in triangular convergence from
the pelvic basin over the circumference of the abdomen and umbilicular fossicle
along the medial line of nodes to the intersection of the sixth pectoral
vertebrae, thence produced both ways at right angles and terminating in circles
described about two equidistant points, right and left, on the summits of the mammary prominences.</p>
<p class="ith">What involuntary actions followed?</p>
<p> He compressed between 2 fingers the flesh circumjacent to a cicatrice in the
left infracostal region below the diaphragm resulting from a sting inflicted 2
weeks and 3 days previously (23 May 1904) by a bee. He scratched imprecisely
with his right hand, though insensible of prurition, various points and surfaces
of his partly
exposed<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>
wholly abluted skin. He inserted his left hand into the left lower pocket of his
waistcoat and extracted and replaced a silver coin (1 shilling), placed there
(presumably) on the occasion (10 October 1903) of the interment of Mrs Emily Sinico, Sydney Parade.

<p class="ith">Did the process of divestiture continue?</p>
<p> Sensible of a benignant persistent ache in his footsoles he extended his
foot to one side and observed the creases, protuberances and salient points
caused by foot pressure in the course of walking repeatedly in several different
directions, then, inclined, he disnoded the laceknots, unhooked and loosened the
laces, took off each of his two boots for the second time, detached the
partially moistened right sock through the fore part of which the nail of his
great toe had again effracted, raised his right and, having unhooked a purple
elastic sock suspender, took off his right sock, placed his unclothed right foot
on the margin of the seat of his chair, picked at and gently lacerated the
protruding part of the great toenail, raised the part lacerated to his nostrils
and inhaled the odour of the quick, then, with satisfaction, threw away the lacerated unghial fragment.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 665}</font> </p>
<p class="ith">Why with satisfaction?</p>
<p> Because the odour inhaled corresponded to other odours inhaled of other
unghial fragments, picked and lacerated by Master Bloom, pupil of Mrs
Ellis&apos;s juvenile school, patiently each night in the act of brief
genuflection and nocturnal prayer and ambitious meditation.</p>

To Daniel Magrane and Francis Wade in 1882 during a juvenile friendship
(terminated by the premature emigration of the former) he had advocated during
nocturnal perambulations the evolutionary theories of Charles Darwin, expounded
in <i>The Descent of Man</i> and <i>The Origin of Species</i>. In 1885 he had
publicly expressed his adherence to the collective and national economic
programme advocated by James Fintan Lalor, John Fisher Murray, John Mitchel,
J.F.X. O&apos;Brien and others, the agrarian policy of Michael Davitt, the
constitutional agitation of Charles Stewart Parnell (M.P. for Cork City), the
programme of peace, retrenchment and reform of William Ewart Gladstone (M.P. for
Midlothian) and, in support of his political convictions, had climbed up into a secure position amid the

<p class="ith">For what reason did he meditate on schemes so difficult of realisation?</p>
<p> It was one of his axioms that similar meditations or the automatic relation
to himself of a narrative concerning himself or tranquil recollection of the
past when practised habitually before retiring for the night allievated fatigue
and produced as a result sound repose and renovated vitality.</p>
<p class="ith">His justifications?</p>
<p> As a physicist he had learned that of the 70 years of complete human life at
least 2&frasl;7, viz, 20 years are passed in sleep. As a philosopher he knew
that at the termination of any allotted life only an infinitesimal part of any
person&apos;s desires has been realised. As a physiologist he believed in the
artificial placation of malignant agencies chiefly operative during somnolence.</p>
<p class="ith">What did he fear?</p>
<p> The commital of homicide or suicide during sleep by an aberration of the
light of reason, the incommensurable categorical intelligence situated in the cerebral convolutions.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 801}</font> </p>
<p class="ith">What were habitually his final meditations?</p>

<p class="ith">Quote the textual terms of this notice.</p>
<p> I, Rudolph Virag, now resident at n&deg; 52 Clanbrassil street, Dublin,
formerly of Szombathely in the kingdom of Hungary, hereby give notice that I
have assumed and intend henceforth upon all occasions and at all times to be known by the name of Rudolph Bloom.</p>
<p class="ith">What other objects relative to Rudolph Bloom (born Virag) were in the 2nd drawer?</p>
<p> An indistinct daguerrotype of Rudolph Virag and his father Leopold Virag
executed in the year 1852 in the portrait atelier of their (respectively) 1st
and 2nd cousin, Stefan Virag of Szesfehervar, Hungary. An ancient hagadah book
in which a pair of hornrimmed convex spectacles inserted marked the passage of
thanksgiving in the ritual prayers for Pessach (Passover): a photocard of the
Queen&apos;s Hotel, Ennis, proprietor, Rudolph Bloom: an envelope addressed: <i>To My Dear Son Leopold</i>.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 676}</font> </p>
<p class="ith">What reminiscences did these objects evoke in Bloom?</p>
<p> An old man, widower, unkempt of hair, in bed, with head covered, sighing: an
infirm dog, Athos:
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">veronal</span></span>
<font color="black">aconite</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>,
resorted to by increasing doses of grains and scruples as a palliative of
recrudescent neuralgia: the face in death of a septuagenarian, suicide by poison.</p>
<p class="ith">Why did Bloom experience a sentiment of remorse?</p>
<p> Because in immature impatience he had treated with disrespect certain beliefs and practices.</p>
<p class="ith">As?</p>
<p> The prohibition of the use of fleshmeat and milk at one meal: the
circumcision of male infants: the supernatural character of Judaic scripture: the sanctity of the sabbath.</p>
<p class="ith">How did these beliefs and practices now appear to him?</p>
<p> Not more rational than they had then appeared, not less rational than other beliefs and practices now appeared.</p>
<p class="ith">What first reminiscence had he of Rudolph Bloom (deceased)?</p>
<p> Rudolph Bloom (deceased) narrated to his son Leopold Bloom (aged 6) a
retrospective arrangement of migrations and settlements in and between Dublin,
London, Florence, Milan,
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">Vienna,
Budapest,<a target="foot" id="fss0387">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>
Szombathely with statements of satisfaction (his grandfather having
<br><font color="green">{u21, 806}</font>
<br> seen Maria Theresia, empress of Austria, queen of Hungary), with commercial
advice (having taken care of pence, the pounds having taken care of themselves).
Leopold Bloom (aged 6) had accompanied

<font color="black">these</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>
narrations by constant consultation of a geographical map
<br><font color="green">{u22, 677}</font>
<br> of Europe (political) and by suggestions for the establishment of
affiliated business premises in the various centres mentioned.</p>
<p class="ith">Had time equally but differently obliterated the memory of these migrations in narrator and listener?</p>
<p> In narrator by the access of years and in consequence of the use of narcotic
toxin: in listener by the access of years and in consequence of the action of
distraction upon vicarious experiences.</p>
<p class="ith">What idiosyncracies of the narrator were concomitant products of amnesia?</p>
<p> Occasionally he ate without having previously removed his hat. Occasionally
he drank voraciously the juice of gooseberry fool from an inclined plate.
Occasionally he removed from his lips the traces of food by means of a lacerated
envelope or other fragment of paper.</p>
<p class="ith">What two phenomena of senescence were more frequent?</p>
<p> The myopic digital calculation of coins, eructation consequent upon repletion.</p>
<p class="ith">What object offered partial consolation for these reminiscences?</p>
<p> The endowment policy, the bank passbook, the certificate of the possession of scrip.</p>
<p class="ith">From what reverse of fortune did these supports protect their possessor?</p>
<p> Successively, in descending helotic
order<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><font color="black">:</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>
Poverty: that of the
<br><font color="green">{u21, 807}</font>
<br> outdoor hawker of imitation jewellery, the dun for the recovery of bad and
doubtful debts, the poor rate and deputy cess collector. Mendicancy: that of the
fraudulent bankrupt with negligible assets paying &frac14;d. in the &pound;,
sandwichman, distributor of throwaways, nocturnal vagrant, maimed sailor, blind
stripling, superannuated bailiff&apos;s man, eccentric public laughingstock
seated on bench of public park under perforated umbrella. Destitution: the
inmate of Old Man&apos;s House (Royal Hospital), Kilmainham, the inmate of
Simpson&apos;s Hospital for reduced but respectable men permanently disabled by gout or want of sight. Nadir of
<br><font color="green">{u22, 678}</font>
<br> misery: the aged impotent disfranchised ratesupported moribund lunatic pauper.</p>
<p class="ith">With which attendant indignities?</p>
<p> The unsympathetic indifference of previously amiable females, the contempt
of males, the acceptance of fragments of bread, the simulated ignorance of
casual acquaintances, the latration of illegitimate vagabond dogs, the infantile
discharge of decomposed vegetable missiles, worth little or nothing, nothing or less than nothing.</p>
<p class="ith">By what could such a situation be precluded?</p>
<p> By decease (change of state): by departure (change of place).</p>
<p class="ith">Which preferably?</p>
<p> The

resistance</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>.</p>
<p class="ith">What considerations rendered it not entirely undesirable?</p>
<p> Constant cohabitation impeding mutual toleration of personal defects. The
habit of independent purchase increasingly cultivated.

<p class="ith">What considerations rendered it desirable?</p>
<p> The attractive character of certain localities in Ireland and abroad, as
represented in general geographical maps of polychrome design or in special
ordnance survey charts by employment of scale numerals and hachures.</p>
<p class="ith">In Ireland?</p>
<p> The cliffs of Moher, the windy wilds of Connemara, lough Neagh with
submerged petrified city, the Giant&apos;s Causeway, Fort Camden and Fort
Carlisle, the Golden Vale of Tiperrary, the islands of Aran, the pastures of
royal Meath, Brigid&apos;s elm in Kildare, the Queen&apos;s Island shipyard in
Belfast, the Salmon Leap, the lakes of Killarney.

<p class="ith">What public advertisement would divulge the occultation of the departed?</p>
<p> &pound;5 reward, lost, stolen or strayed from his residence 7 Eccles street,
missing gent about 40, answering to the name of Bloom, Leopold (Poldy), height 5
ft 8&frac12; inches, full build, olive complexion, may have since grown a beard,
when last seen was wearing a black suit. Above sum will be paid for information leading to his discovery.</p>
<p class="ith">What universal denomination would be his?</p>
<p> Assumed by any or known to none. Everyman or Noman.</p>
<p class="ith">What tributes his?</p>
<p> Honour and gifts of strangers, the friends of Everyman. A nymph immortal,

<font color="black">beauty</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>, the bride of Noman.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 680}</font> </p>
<p class="ith">Would the departed never nowhere nohow reappear?</p>
<p> Ever he would wander to the extreme limit of his cometary orbit, beyond the
fixed stars and variable suns and telescopic planets, astronomical waifs and
strays, to the extreme boundary of space, passing from land to land, among
peoples, amid events. Somewhere imperceptibly he would hear and somehow
reluctantly obey the summons of recall. Whence, disappearing from the constellation
<br><font color="green">{u21, 810}</font>
<br> of the Northern Crown he would somehow reappear reborn above delta in the
constellation of Cassiopeia and after incalculable eons of peregrination return
an avenger, a wreaker of justice on malefactors, a dark crusader, a sleeper
awakened, with financial resources (by supposition) surpassing those of Rothschild or the silver king.</p>
<p class="ith">What would render such return irrational?</p>
<p> An unsatisfactory equation between an exodus and return in time through
reversible space and an exodus and return in space through irreversible time.</p>
<p class="ith">What rendered departure undesirable?</p>
<p> The lateness of the hour, rendering procrastinatory, the obscurity of the
night, rendering invisible, the uncertainty of thoroughfares, rendering
perilous, the necessity for repose, obviating movement, the proximity of an
occupied bed, obviating research, the anticipation of warmth (human) tempered
with coolness (linen) obviating desire and rendering desirable.</p>
<p class="ith">What advantages were possessed by an occupied, as distinct from an unoccupied bed?</p>
<p> The removal of nocturnal solitude, the superior quality of human (mature
female) to inhuman (hotwaterjar) calefaction, the stimulation of matutinal
contact, the economy of mangling done on the premises in the case of trousers
accurately folded and placed lengthwise between the spring mattress (striped)
and the woollen mattress (biscuit section).</p>
<p class="ith">What past consecutive

lunch, the visit to museum and national library, the bookhunt along Bedford row,
Merchants Arch, Wellington Quay, the music in the Ormond Hotel, the altercation
in Bernard Kiernan&apos;s premises, a blank period of time including a cardrive,
a visit to a house of mourning, a leavetaking, the eroticism produce by feminine
exhibitionism, the prolonged delivery of Mrs Mina Purefoy, the visit to the
disorderly house of Mrs Bella Cohen, 82 Tyrone street, lower and subsequent
brawl in Beaver street, nocturnal perambulation to and from the cabman&apos;s shelter, Butt Bridge.</p>
<p class="ith">What enigma pondered with desultory constancy during 30 years did
Bloom now, having effected natural obscurity by the extinction of artificial light, silently suddenly comprehend?</p>
<p> Where was Moses when the candle went out?</p>
<p class="ith">What imperfections in a perfect day did Bloom, walking, silently, successively, enumerate?</p>

<p> The face of her father, the late Major Brian Cooper Tweedy, Royal Dublin
Fusiliers, of Gibraltar and Rehoboth, Dolphin&apos;s Barn.</p>
<p class="ith">What miscellaneous effects of female personal wearing apparel were perceived by him?</p>
<p> A pair of new inodorous halfsilk black ladies&apos; stockings, a pair of new
violet garters, a pair of outsize ladies&apos; drawers of India mull, cut on
generous lines, redolent of opoponax, jessamine and Muratti&apos;s Turkish

<p> A commode, one leg fractured, totally covered by square cretonne cutting,

consisting of basin, soapdish and brushtray (on the washstand, together),
pitcher and night article (on the floor, separate).</p>
<p class="ith">Bloom&apos;s acts?</p>
<p> He deposited the articles of clothing on a chair, removed his other articles
of clothing, took from beneath the bolster at the head of the bed a folded long
white nightshirt, inserted his head and arms into the proper apertures of the
nightshirt, removed a pillow from the head to the foot of the bed, prepared the
bedlinen accordingly and entered the bed.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 683}</font> </p>
<p class="ith">How?</p>
<p> With circumspection, as invariably when entering an abode (his own or not
his own): with solicitude, the snakespiral springs of the mattress being old,
the brass quoits and pendent viper radii loose and tremulous under stress and
strain: prudently, as entering a lair or ambush of lust or adders: lightly, the
less to disturb: reverently, the bed of conception and

<p class="ith">What did his limbs when gradually extended encounter?</p>
<p> New clean bedlinen, additional odours, the presence of a human form, female,
hers, the imprint of a human form, male, not his, some crumbs, some flakes of
potted meat, recooked, which he removed.</p>
<p class="ith">If he had smiled why would he have smiled?</p>
<p> To reflect that each one who enters imagines himself to be the first to
enter whereas he is always the last term of a preceding series even if the first
term of a succeeding one, each imagining himself to be first, last, only and

<p> Because he had observed with augmenting frequency in the preceding members
of the same series the same concupiscence, inflammably transmitted, first with
alarm, then with understanding, then with desire, finally with fatigue, with
alternating symptoms of comprehension and apprehension.</p>
<p class="ith">With what antagonistic sentiments were his subsequent reflections affected?</p>
<p> Envy, jealousy, abnegation, equanimity.</p>
<p class="ith">Envy?</p>
<p> Of a bodily and mental male organism specially adapted for the
superincumbent posture of energetic human copulation and energetic
<br><font color="green">{u21, 815}</font>
<br> piston and cylinder movement necessary for the complete satisfaction of a
constant but not acute concupiscence resident in a bodily and mental female organism passive but not obtuse.</p>
<p class="ith">Jealousy?</p>
<p> Because a nature full and volatile, in her free state, was alternately the
agent and reagent of attraction. Because attraction between agents and reagents
at all instants varied, with inverse proportion of increase and decrease, with
incessant circular extension and radial reentrance. Because the controlled
contemplation of the fluctuation of attraction produced, if desired, a fluctuation of pleasure.</p>
<p class="ith">Abnegation?</p>
<p> In virtue of a) acquaintance initiated in September 1903 in the
establishment of George Mesias, merchant tailor and outfitter, 5 Eden Quay, b)
hospitality extended and received in kind, reciprocated and reappropriated in
person, c) comparative youth subject to impulses of ambition and magnanimity,
colleagual altruism and amorous egoism.</p>
<p class="ith">Equanimity?</p>
<p> As as natural as any and every natural act of a nature expressed or
understood executed in natured nature by natural creatures in accordance with
<br><font color="green">{u22, 685}</font>
<br> his, her and their natured natures, of dissimilar similarity. As not
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">as</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>
calamitous as a cataclysmic annihilation of the planet in consequence of a
collision with a dark sun. As less reprehensible than theft, highway robbery,
cruelty to children and animals, obtaining money under false pretences, forgery,
embezzlement, misappropriation of public money, betrayal of public trust,
malingering, mayhem, corruption of minors, criminal

blackmail, contempt of court, arson, treason, felony, mutiny on the high seas,
trespass, burglary, jailbreaking, practice
<br><font color="green">{u21, 816}</font>
<br> of unnatural vice, desertion from armed forces in the field, perjury,
poaching, usury, intelligence with the king&apos;s enemies, impersonation,
criminal assault, manslaughter, wilful and premeditated murder. As not more
abnormal than all other parallel processes of adaptation to altered conditions
of existence, resulting in a reciprocal equilibrium between the bodily organism
and its attendant circumstances, foods, beverages, acquired habits, indulged
inclinations, significant disease. As more than inevitable, irreparable.</p>
<p class="ith">Why more abnegation than jealousy, less envy than equanimity?</p>
<p> From outrage (matrimony) to outrage (adultery) there arose nought but
outrage (copulation) yet the matrimonial violator of the matrimonially violated
had not been outraged by the adulterous violator of the adulterously violated.</p>
<p class="ith">What retribution, if any?</p>
<p> Assassination, never, as two wrongs did not make one right. Duel by combat,
no. Divorce, not now. Exposure by mechanical artifice (automatic bed) or
individual testimony (concealed ocular witnesses), not yet. Suit for damages by
legal influence or simulation of assault with evidence of injuries sustained
(selfinflicted), not impossibly. If any, positively, connivance, introduction of
emulation (material, a prosperous rival agency of publicity: moral, a successful
rival agent of intimacy), depreciation, alienation, humiliation, separation
protecting
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">the</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font>
one separated from the other, protecting the separator from both.</p>
<p class="ith">By what reflections did he justify to himself his sentiments?</p>
<p> The preordained frangibility of the hymen: the presupposed intangibility of
the thing in itself: the incongruity and disproportion between the
selfprolonging tension of the thing proposed to be done and the selfabbreviating
<br><font color="green">{u22, 686}</font>
<br> relaxation of the thing done: the fallaciously

<p> Negative: he omitted to mention the clandestine correspondence between
Martha Clifford and Henry Flower, the public altercation at, in and in the
vicinity of the licensed premises of Bernard Kiernan and Co, Limited, 8, 9 and
10 Little Britain street, the erotic provocation and response thereto caused by
the exhibitionism of Gertrude (Gerty), surname unknown. Positive: he included

<p class="ith">What limitations of activity and inhibitions of conjugal rights
were perceived by listener and narrator concerning themselves during the course
of this intermittent and increasingly more laconic narration?</p>

been celebrated 2 calendar months after the 18th anniversary of her birth (8
September 1870), viz, 8 October, and consummated on the same date with female
issue born 15 June 1889, having been anticipatorily consummated on the 10
September of the same year and complete carnal intercourse, with ejaculation of

years, 5 months and 18 days during which carnal intercourse had been incomplete,
without ejaculation of semen within the natural female organ. By the narrator a limitation of activity, mental and
<br><font color="green">{u22, 688}</font>
<br> corporal, inasmuch as complete mental intercourse between himself and the
listener had not taken place since the consummation of puberty, indicated by
catamenic hemorrhage, of the female issue of narrator and listener, 15 September
1903, there remained a period of 9 months and 1 day during which, in consequence
of a preestablished natural comprehension in incomprehension between the
consummated females (listener and issue), complete corporal liberty of action had been circumscribed.</p>
<p class="ith">How?</p>
<p> By various reiterated

the object with which in the case of temporary absences, projected or effected.</p>
<p class="ith">What moved visibly above the listener&apos;s and the narrator&apos;s invisible thoughts?</p>
<p> The upcast reflection of a lamp and shade, an inconstant series of
concentric circles of varying gradations of light and shadow.

both carried westward, forward and rereward respectively, by the proper
perpetual motion of the earth through everchanging tracks of neverchanging space.</p>
<p class="ith">In what posture?</p>
