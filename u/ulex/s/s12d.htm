<p class="flush">Stephen dissented openly from Bloom&apos;s views on the
importance of dietary and civic selfhelp while Bloom dissented tacitly from
Stephen&apos;s views on the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in
literature. The collapse which Bloom ascribed to gastric inanition and certain
chemical compounds of varying degrees of adulteration and alcoholic strength
Stephen attributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud at first no bigger than a woman&apos;s hand.</p>

discernible through the glass fanlight over the halldoor. The halldoor turned
