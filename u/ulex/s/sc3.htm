<p class="ith">What course did Bloom and Stephen follow returning?</p>
<p> Lower and Middle Gardiner streets and Mountjoy square, west. Then, bearing
left, Gardiner&apos;s place by an inadvertence as far as the farther corner of
Temple street. Then, bearing right, Temple street, north, as far as Hardwicke
place. They crossed the circus before George&apos;s church diametrically, the
chord in any circle being less than
<a name="s17048i" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17048i">the arc</a> which it subtends.</p>
<p class="ith">Of what did they speak during their itinerary?</p>
<p> Music, literature, Ireland, Dublin, Paris, friendship, woman, diet,
<a name="s17035ac" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17035ac">the influence of
gaslight or the light of</a>

<a name="s17035ac" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17035ac">trees</a>, the Roman
catholic church, jesuit education, careers, the study of medicine, the past
day,<a target="foot" id="fss0003">&ordm;</a> Stephen&apos;s breakdown.</p>
<p class="ith">Did Bloom discover similarity between their respective reactions to experience?</p>
<p> Both were sensitive to artistic
impressions,<a target="foot" id="fss0004">&ordm;</a> musical in preference to
<a name="s17017n" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17017n">plastic</a> or
pictorial. Both preferred a
<a name="s17016i" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17016i">continental</a> to an
insular manner of  life. Both indurated by early domestic training and an
inherited tenacity of resistance professed their disbelief in many accepted
religions, national, social and ethical doctrines. Both admitted the
<a name="s17028q" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17028q">alternately</a>
stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual magnetism.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 620}</font> </p>
<p class="ith">Were their views on some points divergent?</p>
<p> Stephen dissented openly from Bloom&apos;s views on the importance of
dietary and civic selfhelp while Bloom dissented tacitly from Stephen&apos;s
views on the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature. The
collapse which Bloom ascribed to gastric inanition and certain chemical
compounds of varying degrees of adulteration and alcoholic strength Stephen
attributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud at first no bigger than a woman&apos;s hand.</p>
<p class="ith">Was there one point were equal and negative?</p>
<p> The influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of
<a name="un5024cp" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5024cp">adjoining</a> trees.</p>
<p class="ith">Had Bloom discussed similar subjects during nocturnal perambulations in the past?</p>
<p> In 1884 with Owen Goldberg and Cecil Turnbull. In 1885 with Percy Apjohn. In
1886 occasionally<a target="foot" id="fss0010">&ordm;</a> with casual
acquaintances. In 1888 frequently with major Brian Tweedy and his daughter Miss
Marion Tweedy, together and separately. Once in 1892 and once in 1893 with
Julius (Juda)<a target="foot" id="fss0011">&ordm;</a> Mastiansky.</p>
<p class="ith">What action<a target="foot" id="fss0012">&ordm;</a> did Bloom
make on their arrival at their destination?</p>
<p> At the housesteps of number 7 Eccles street he put his hand mechanically
into the back pocket to get his latchkey.</p>
<p class="ith">Was it there?</p>
<p> It was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn on the day but one preceding. </p>
<p class="ith">Why was he doubly irritated?</p>
<p> Because he had forgotten and because he remembered that
<a name="s17007ac" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17007ac">he had reminded himself twice not to forget</a>.</p>
<p class="ith">What were then the alternatives?</p>
<p> To enter or not to enter. To knock or not to knock.</p>
<p class="ith">His decision?</p>
<p> A stratagem. He climbed over the area
<a name="un5024dc" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5024dc">railings</a>,
compressed his hat on his head, grasped the lower parts of two rails, lowered
his body gradually by its length of five feet nine inches and a half to within
two feet ten inches of the area
pavement,<a target="foot" id="fss0014">&ordm;</a> and allowed his body to move
freely in space by separating himself from the railings and crouching
<a name="un4049bf" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4049bf">in preparation for the impact of the fall</a>.</p>
<p class="ith">Did he fall?</p>
<p> By his weight of ten stone and four ounces in
<a name="s17030ar" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17030ar">avoirdupois</a>
measure, as certified by the graduated machine for
<a name="s17009a" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17009a">periodical
selfweighing</a> in the premises of Francis
Froedman<a target="foot" id="fss0015">&ordm;</a>, pharmaceutical chemist of 19
Frederick street, north, on the last feast of the Ascension, to wit, the twelfth day of May of the
<br><font color="green">{u22, 622}</font>
<br> year one thousand nine hundred and four of the christian era<a target="foot" id="fss0016">&ordm;</a>.</p>
<p class="ith">Did he rise uninjured?</p>
<p> He rose uninjured though
<a name="s17016am" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17016am">shocked</a> by the
impact, raised the latch of the area door by
leverage,<a target="foot" id="fss0019">&ordm;</a> entered the kitchen through
the scullery,
<a name="s17026k" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17026k">ignited</a> a lucifer
match by friction, set free inflammable coal gas by turning on the ventcock, lit
a high flame which, by regulating, he
<a name="s17030aq" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17030aq">reduced to</a>
<a name="un5024cd" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5024cd">quiescent</a>
candescence and lit finally a portable candle.</p>
<p class="ith">Where was Stephen meanwhile?</p>
<p> Reclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparent
kitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame, a man lighting a candle, a man
removing in turn each of his two boots, a man leaving the kitchen holding a
candle<a target="foot" id="fss0021">&ordm;</a>.</p>
<p class="ith">Did the man reappear elsewhere?</p>
<p> After a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible
through the glass
<a name="s17011i" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17011i">fanlight</a> over the
halldoor. The halldoor turned gradually on its hinges. In the open space of the
doorway the man reappeared without his hat, with his candle.</p>
<p class="ith">Did Stephen obey his sign?</p>
<p> Yes, entering softly, he helped to close and chain the door and followed
softly along the hallway the man&apos;s back and candle past a lighted crevice
of doorway on the left and carefully down a turning staircase of more than five
steps into the kitchen of Bloom&apos;s house.</p>
<p class="ith">What did Bloom do?</p>
<p> He extinguished the candle by a sharp ejection of breath upon its flame,
drew two <a name="un4049e" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4049e">spoonseat
deal chairs</a> <a name="s17033d" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17033d">to the
hearthstone</a>, one for Stephen with his back to the area window, the other for
himself when necessary, knelt on one knee,
<a name="s17041bn" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17041bn">composed in the
grate a pyre of crosslaid resintipped sticks and various coloured papers</a> and
irregular
<a name="s17013af" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17013af">polygons</a> of
<a name="s17007p" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17007p">best Abram coal at
twentyone shillings a ton from the yard of  Messrs Flower and M&apos;Donald of 7 D&apos;Olier
<br><font color="green">{u22, 623}</font>
<br> street,</a> kindled it at three projecting points of paper with one ignited wooden match.</p>
<p class="ith">Of what similar apparitions did Stephen think?</p>
<p> Of others elsewhere in other times who, kneeling on one knee or on two, had
kindled fires for him, of Brother Michael in the infirmary of the college of the
Society of Jesus at Clongowes Wood in the county of Kildare, of his father,
Simon Dedalus, in the unfurnished room of his first residence in Dublin, number
thirteen Fitzgibbon street, of his godmother Miss Kate Morkan in the house of
her dying sister Miss Julia Morkan at 15 Usher&apos;s Island, of his aunt Sara,
wife of Richie (Richard Goulding) in the kitchen of their lodgings at 62
Clanbrassil street, of his mother in<a target="foot" id="fss0022">&ordm;</a> the
kitchen of number twelve North Richmond street on the morning of the feast of
Saint Francis Xavier<a target="foot" id="fss0023">&ordm;</a> 1898, of the dean
of Studies, Father Butt, in the physics&apos; theatre of university College, 16
Stephen&apos;s Green, north<a target="foot" id="fss0024">&ordm;</a>, of his
sister Dilly (Delia) in his father&apos;s house in Cabra.</p>
<p class="ith">What did Stephen see on raising his gaze to the height of a yard
from the fire towards the opposite wall?</p>
<p> A <a name="s17024o" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17024o">curvilinear</a>
rope stretched between two holdfasts
<a name="un7028g" href="../../ff/unbs/un7all.htm#un7028g">athwart</a> across the
recess beside the chimney pier
<a name="s17033ae" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17033ae">from which hung four
smallsized square handkerchiefs</a> folded unattached
<a name="s17039m" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17039m">consecutively</a> in
adjacent rectangles and one pair of grey Lisle ladies&apos; stockings in their
habitual position clamped by three erect wooden pegs two at their outer
extremities and the third at their point of junction.</p>
<p class="ith">What did Bloom think of their different ages?</p>
<p> That neither could Stephen now have his age then nor he then Stephen&apos;s now.</p>
<p class="ith"></p>
<p class="ith">By what act did he solve the problem?</p>
<p> He removed the saucepan to the left hob, rose and carried the iron kettle to
the tap and sink in order to draw water by turning
<a name="un4032aq" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4032aq">the faucet</a> to let it flow.</p>
<p class="ith">Did it flow?</p>

Riordan</a><a target="foot" id="fss0079">&ordm;</a>, a widow of independent
means, had resided in the house of Stephen&apos;s parents from 1 September 1888
to 29 December 1891 and had also resided during the years 1892, 1893 and 1894 in
the City Arms Hotel owned by Elizabeth O&apos;Dowd of 54 Prussia street
where,<a target="foot" id="fss0080">&ordm;</a> during parts of the years 1893
and 1894,<a target="foot" id="fss0081">&ordm;</a> she had been a

clerk in the employment of Joseph Cuffe of 5 Smithfield for the superintendence
of sales in the adjacent Dublin Cattle market on the North Circular road.</p>
<p class="ith">Had he performed any special corporal work of mercy for her?</p>
<p> He had sometimes

<p class="ith">Why could he support that his vigil with the greater equanimity?</p>
<p> Because in middle youth he had often sat observing through a glass boss of a
multicoloured pane the spectacle offered with continual changes of the
thoroughfare without, pedestrians, quadrupeds, velocipedes, vehicles, passing
slowly, quickly, evenly, round and round and round the rim of a round precipitous globe.</p>
<p class="ith">What distinct different memories had each of her now eight years deceased?</p>

<p class="ith">Did they find their educational careers similar?</p>

the intermediate and through the matriculation, first
arts,<a target="foot" id="fss0103">&ordm;</a> second arts and degree courses of the university.</p>
<p class="ith">Why did Bloom refrain from stating that he had frequented the university of life?</p>
<p> Because of his incertitude as to whether
<a name="s17007as" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17007as">this observation
had</a> <a name="s17007as" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17007as">been already

<p class="ith">What two temperaments did they individually represent?</p>
<p> The scientific. The artistic.</p>
<p class="ith">What proofs did Bloom adduce to prove that his tendency was
towards applied, rather than to pure, science?</p>
<p> Certain possible inventions
<a name="s17030l" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17030l">of which he had
cogitated when reclining</a> on his back in a state of repletion to aid
digestion, stimulated by his appreciation of the importance of inventions now
common but once revolutionary, for example, the parachute, the
<a name="s17029c" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17029c">corkscrew</a>, the
safety pin, <a name="s17031m" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17031m">the canal lock</a>.</p>
<p class="ith">Were these inventions principally intended for an improved scheme of kindergarten?</p>
<p> Yes. They comprised

<p> Because at the critical turningpoint of human existence he desired to amend
many social conditions, the product of inequality and avarice and international animosity.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 650}</font> </p>
<p class="ith">He believed then that human life was infinitely perfectible, eliminating these conditions?</p>
<p> There remained the generic conditions imposed by natural, as distinct from
human law:<a target="foot" id="fss0191">&ordm;</a> the necessity of destruction
to procure alimentary sustenance, the painful character of birth and death, the
monotonous menstruation<a target="foot" id="fss0193">&ordm;</a> of simian and
(particularly) human females extending from the age of puberty to the menopause,
inevitable accidents at sea, in mines and factories, certain very painful
maladies and their resultant surgical operations, innate lunacy and criminality,

<p class="ith">Why did he desist from speculation?</p>
<p> Because it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute other
phenomena in the<a target="foot" id="fss0196">&ordm;</a> place of those to be removed.</p>
<p class="ith">Did Stephen participate in his dejection?</p>
<p> He affirmed his significance as a conscious rational reagent between a micro

<p class="ith">Was this affirmation<a target="foot" id="fss0197">&ordm;</a> apprehended by Bloom?</p>

on a large dull passive and a<a target="foot" id="fss0249">&ordm;</a> slender

<p class="ith">What interchanges of looks took place between these three objects and Bloom?</p>
<p> In the mirror of the giltbordered pierglass the undecorated back of the
dwarf tree regarded the upright back of the embalmed owl. Before the mirror the
matrimonial gift of Alderman John Hooper with a clear melancholy wise bright
motionless compassionate gaze regarded Bloom while Bloom with obscure tranquil
profound motionless compassionated gaze regarded the matrimonial gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle.</p>
<p class="ith">What composite image in the mirror then attracted his attention?</p>

business ability (a bester), impressionability (a boaster).
<br><font color="green">{u22, 684}</font> </p>
<p class="ith">Why this last quality?</p>
<p> Because he had observed with augmenting
<a name="s17026t" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17026t">frequency</a> in the
preceding members of the same series the same concupiscence, inflammably
transmitted,<a target="foot" id="fss0431">&ordm;</a> first with alarm, then with
understanding, then with desire, finally with fatigue, with
<a name="s17028q" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17028q">alternate</a> symptoms of comprehension and apprehension.</p>
<p class="ith">With what antagonistic sentiments were his subsequent reflections affected?</p>
<p> Envy, jealousy, abnegation, equanimity.</p>
<p class="ith">Envy?</p>
<p> Of a bodily and mental male organism specially adapted for the
superincumbent posture of energetic human copulation necessary for the complete
satisfaction of a
<a name="s17048aa" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17048aa">constant</a> but not
acute concupiscence resident in a bodily and mental female organism passive but not obtuse.</p>
<p class="ith">Jealousy?</p>
<p> Because a nature full and
<a name="s17025t" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17025t">volatile</a>, in her
free state, was
<a name="s17028q" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17028q">alternately</a> the
<a name="un5002aj" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5002aj">agent and

Because the controlled contemplation of the fluctuation of attraction produced,
if desired, a fluctuation of pleasure.</p>
<p class="ith">Abnegation?</p>
<p> In virtue of a)
<a name="s17004at" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17004at">acquaintance
initiated in September 1903 in the establishment of George Mesias,</a> merchant
tailor and outfitter, 5 Eden Quay, b) hospitality extended and received, c)

<p class="ith">Equanimity?</p>
<p> <a name="s17010bc" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17010bc">As not so
calamitous as</a> a cataclysmic annihilation of the planet in consequence of a

10 Little Britain street, the erotic provocation and response thereto caused by
