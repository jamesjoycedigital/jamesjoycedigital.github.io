<p class="ith">What parallel courses did Bloom and Stephen follow returning?</p>
<p> Starting united both at normal walking pace from Beresford Place they
followed in the order named Lower and Middle Gardiner streets and Mountjoy
square, west: then, at reduced pace, each bearing left, Gardiner&apos;s place by
an inadvertence as far as the farther corner of Temple street, north: then, at
reduced pace with interruptions of halt, bearing right, Temple street, north, as
far as Hardwicke place. Approaching, disparate, at relaxed walking pace they
crossed both the circus before George&apos;s church diametrically, the chord in
any circle being less than the arc which it subtends.</p>
<p class="ith">Of what did they speak during their itinerary?</p>
<p> Music, literature, Ireland, Dublin, Paris, friendship, woman, prostitution,
diet, the influence of gaslight or the light of arc and glowlamps on the growth
of adjoining

celibacy,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>7|</small></sup></font> the Irish
nation, jesuit education, careers, the study of medicine, the past day, Stephen&apos;s collapse.</p>
<p class="ith">Did Bloom discover common factors of similarity between their
respective like and unlike reactions to experience?</p>
<p> Both were sensitive to artistic impressions, musical in preference to
plastic or pictorial. Both preferred a continental to an insular manner of
<br><font color="green">{u21, 737}</font>
<br> life, a cisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence. Both indurated

stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual magnetism.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 620}</font> </p>
<p class="ith">Were their views on some points divergent?</p>
<p> Stephen dissented openly from Bloom&apos;s views on the importance of
dietary and civic selfhelp while Bloom dissented tacitly from Stephen&apos;s
views on the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature. Bloom
assently covertly to Stephen&apos;s rectification of the anachronism involved in
assigning the date of the conversion of the Irish nation to christianity from
druidism by Patrick son of Calpornus, son of Potitus, son of Odyssus, sent by
pope Celestine I in the year 432 in the reign of Leary to the year

suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at Sletty and interred at
Rossnaree. The collapse which Bloom ascribed to gastric inanition and certain
chemical compounds of varying degrees of adulteration and alcoholic strength,
accelerated by mental exertion and the velocity of rapid circular motion in a
relaxing atmosphere, Stephen attributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud
(perceived by both from two different points of observation, Sandycove and
Dublin) at first no bigger than a woman&apos;s hand.</p>
<p class="ith">Was there one point on which their views were equal and negative?</p>
<p> The influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of adjoining trees.</p>
<p class="ith">Had Bloom discussed similar subjects during nocturnal perambulations in the past?</p>
<p> In 1884 with Owen Goldberg and Cecil Turnbull at night on public
thoroughfares between Longwood avenue and Leonard&apos;s corner and
Leonard&apos;s corner and Synge street and Synge street and Bloomfield
<br><font color="green">{u21, 738}</font>
<br> Avenue. In 1885 with Percy Apjohn in the evenings reclined against the wall
between Gibraltar villa and Bloomfield house in Crumlin, barony of Uppercross.
In 1886 occasionally with casual acquaintances and prospective purchasers on
doorsteps, in front parlours, in
<font color="red"><sup><small>|7</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">3(sup)r(sup)d</span></span>
<font color="black">third</font><font color="red"><sup><small>7|</small></sup></font>
class railway carriages of suburban lines. In 1888 frequently with major Brian
Tweedy and his daughter Miss Marion Tweedy, together and separately on the
lounge in Matthew Dillon&apos;s house in Roundtown. Once in 1892 and once in
1893 with Julius Mastiansky, on both occasions in the parlour of his (Bloom&apos;s) house in Lombard street, west.</p>
<p class="ith">What reflection concerning the irregular sequence of dates 1884,
1885, 1886, 1888, 1892, 1893, 1904 did Bloom make before their arrival at their destination?
<br><font color="green">{u22, 621}</font> </p>
<p> He reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual
development and experience was regressively accompanied by a restriction of the
converse domain of interindividual relations.</p>
<p class="ith">As in what ways?</p>
<p> From inexistence to existence he came to many and was as one received:
existence with existence he was with any as any with any: from existence to
nonexistence gone he would be by all as none perceived.</p>
<p class="ith">What action did Bloom make on their arrival at their destination?</p>
<p> At the housesteps of the 4th of the equidifferent uneven numbers, number 7
Eccles street he put his hand mechanically into the back pocket of his trousers to get his latchkey.</p>
<p class="ith">Was it there?</p>
<p> It was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn on the day but one preceding.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 739}</font> </p>
<p class="ith">Why was he doubly irritated?</p>
<p> Because he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had reminded himself twice not to forget.</p>

before the keyless couple?</p>
<p> To enter or not to enter. To knock or not to knock.</p>
<p class="ith">His decision?</p>
<p> A stratagem. Resting his feet on the dwarf wall, he climbed over the area
railings, compressed his hat on his head, grasped two points at the lower union
of rails and stiles, lowered his body gradually by its length of five feet nine
inches and a half to within two feet ten inches of the area pavement and allowed
his body to move freely in space by separating himself from the railings and
crouching in preparation for the impact of the fall.</p>
<p class="ith">Did he fall?</p>
<p> By his body&apos;s known weight of ten stone and four pounds in avoirdupois
measure, as certified by the graduated machine for periodical selfweighing in
the premises of Francis Froedman, pharmaceutical chemist of 19 Frederick street,
north, on the last feast of the Ascension, to wit, the twelfth day of May of the
<br><font color="green">{u22, 622}</font>
<br> year one thousand nine hundred and four of the christian era.</p>
<p class="ith">Did he rise uninjured by concussion?</p>
<p> Regaining new stable equilibrium he rose uninjured though shocked by the
impact, raised the latch of the area door by the exertion of force at its freely
moving flange and by leverage applied at its fulcrum, gained retarded access to
the kitchen through the subadjacent scullery, ignited a lucifer match by
friction, set free inflammable coal gas by turning on the ventcock, lit a high
flame which, by regulating, he reduced to quiescent candescence and lit finally a portable candle.</p>
<p class="ith">What discrete succession of images did Stephen meanwhile perceive?</p>
<p> Reclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparent
kitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame of 14 CP, a man lighting a candle
<font color="red"><sup><small>|7</small></sup></font><font color="black">of 1
CP<a target="foot" id="fss0020">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>7|</small></sup></font>,
a man removing in turn each of his two boots, a man leaving the kitchen holding a candle.</p>
<p class="ith">Did the man reappear elsewhere?</p>
<p> After a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible
through the semitransparent glass fanlight over the halldoor. The halldoor
turned gradually on its hinges. In the open space of the doorway the man
reappeared without his hat, with his candle.</p>
<p class="ith">Did Stephen obey his sign?</p>
<p> Yes, entering softly, he helped to close and chain the door and followed
softly along the hallway the man&apos;s back and listed feet and lighted candle
past a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and carefully down a turning
staircase of more than five steps into the kitchen of Bloom&apos;s house.</p>
<p class="ith">What did Bloom do?</p>
<p> He extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its flame,
drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone, one for Stephen with

back to the area window, the other for himself when necessary, knelt on one
knee, composed in the grate a pyre of crosslaid resintipped sticks and various
coloured papers and irregular polygons of best Abram coal at twentyone shillings a ton from the yard of
<br><font color="green">{u21, 741}</font>
<br> Messrs Flower and M&apos;Donald of 14 D&apos;Olier
<br><font color="green">{u22, 623}</font>
<br> street, kindled it at three projecting points of paper with one ignited wooden match.</p>
<p class="ith">Of what similar apparitions did Stephen think?</p>
<p> Of others elsewhere in other times who, kneeling on one knee or on two, had
kindled fires for him, of Brother Michael in the infirmary of the college of the
Society of Jesus at Clongowes Wood in the county of Kildare: of his father,
Simon Dedalus, in an unfurnished room of his first residence in Dublin, number
thirteen Fitzgibbon street: of his godmother Miss Kate Morkan in the house of
her dying sister Miss Julia Morkan at 15 Usher&apos;s Island: of his aunt Sara,
wife of Richie (Richard Goulding) in the kitchen of their lodgings at 62
Clanbrassil street, of his mother in the kitchen of number twelve North Richmond
street on the morning of the feast of Saint Francis Xavier 1898: of the dean of
studies, Father Butt, in the physics&apos; theatre of university College, 16
Stephen&apos;s Green, north: of his sister Dilly (Delia) in his father&apos;s house in Cabra.</p>
<p class="ith">What did Stephen see on raising his gaze to the height of a yard
from the fire towards the opposite wall?</p>
<p> Under a row of five coiled spring housebells a curvilinear rope stretched
between two holdfasts athwart across the recess beside the chimney pier from
which hung four smallsized square handkerchiefs folded unattached consecutively
in adjacent rectangles and one pair of ladies&apos; grey stockings with Lisle
suspender tops and feet in their habitual position clamped by three erect wooden
pegs two at their outer extremities and the third at their point of junction.</p>
<p class="ith"></p>

<p> He removed the saucepan to the left hob, rose and carried the iron kettle to
the sink in order to tap the current by turning the faucet to let it flow.</p>
<p class="ith">Did it flow?</p>
<p> Yes. From Roundwood reservoir in county Wicklow of a cubic capacity of 2400
million gallons, percolating through a subterranean acqueduct of filter
<br><font color="green">{u22, 624}</font>
<br> mains of single and double pipeage constructed at an initial plant cost of
&pound;5 per linear yard by

of</font><font color="red"><sup><small>7|</small></sup></font> the Dargle,
Rathdown, Glen of the Downs and Callowhill to the 26 acre reservoir at
Stillorgan, a distance of 22 statute miles, and thence, through a system of
relieving tanks, by a gradient of 250 feet to the city boundary at Eustace
bridge, upper Leeson street, though from prolonged summer drouth and daily
supply of 12&frac12; million gallons the water had fallen below the sill of the
overflow weir for which reason the borough surveyor on the instructions of the
waterworks committee had prohibited the use of municipal water for purposes
other than those of consumption (envisaging the possibility of recourse being
had to the impotable water of the Grand and Royal canals as in 1893)
particularly as the South Dublin Guardians, notwithstanding their ration of 15
gallons per day per pauper supplied through a 6 inch meter had been convicted of
a wastage of 20,000 gallons per night by a reading of their meter on the
affirmation of the law agent of the corporation, Mr Ignatius Rice, thereby
acting to the detriment of another section of the public, selfsupporting taxpayers, solvent, sound.</p>
<p class="ith">What in water did Bloom, waterlover, drawer of water, watercarrier, returning to the range, admire?</p>
<p> Its universality: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature in
seeking its own level: its vastness in the ocean of Mercator&apos;s projector:
its unplumbed profundity in the Sundam trench of
<br><font color="green">{u21, 743}</font>
<br> the Pacific exceeding 8000 fathoms: the restlessness of its waves and
surface particles visiting in turn all points of its seaboard: the independence
of its units: the variability of states of sea: its quiescence in calm: its
turgidity in neap and spring tides: its subsidence after devastation: its
sterility in the circumpolar icecaps, arctic and antarctic: its preponderance of
3 to 1 over the dry land of the globe: its indisputable hegemony
<font color="red"><sup><small>|7</small></sup></font><font color="black">extending
in square leagues</font><font color="red"><sup><small>7|</small></sup></font>
over all the region below the subequatorial tropic of Capricorn: its capacity to
dissolve and hold in solution all soluble substances including millions of tons
of the most precious metals: its slow erosions of peninsulas and downwardtending
promontories: its alluvial deposits: its weight and volume and density: its
imperturbability in lagoons and highland tarns: its gradation of colours in the
torrid and temperate and frigid zones: its vehicular ramifications in continental
<br><font color="green">{u22, 625}</font>
<br> lakecontained streams and confluent oceanflowing rivers with their
tributaries and transoceanic currents: its violence in seaquakes, waterspouts,
Artesian wells, eruptions, torrents, eddies, freshets, spates,
<font color="red"><sup><small>|7</small></sup></font><font color="black">groundswells,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>7|</small></sup></font>
watersheds, waterpartings, geysers, cataracts, whirlpools, maelstroms,
inundations, deluges, cloudbursts: its vast circumterrestrial ahorizontal curve:
its secrecy in springs exemplified by the well by the hole in the wall at
Ashtown gate: the simplicity of its composition, two constituent parts of
hydrogen with one constituent part of oxygen: its healing virtues: its buoyancy
in the waters of the Dead Sea: its persevering penetrativeness in runnels,
gullies, inadequate dams, leaks on shipboard: its properties for cleansing,
quenching thirst and fire, nourishing vegetation: its strength in rigid
hydrants: its variety of forms in loughs and bays and gulfs and bights and guts
and lagoons and atolls and archipelagos and sounds and fjords and minches and estuaries and arms of sea: its
<br><font color="green">{u21, 744}</font>
<br> solidity in glaciers, icebergs, icefloes: its docility in working hydraulic
millwheels, turbines, dynamos, electric power stations, bleachworks, tanneries,
scutchmills: its utility in canals, rivers, if navigable, floating and graving
docks: its potentiality derivable from harnessed tides or watercourses falling
from level to level: its submarine fauna and flora numerically, if not
literally, the inhabitants of the globe: its ubiquity as constituting 90% of the
human body: the noxiousness of its effluvia in lacustrine marshes, pestilential
fens, faded flowers, stagnant pools in the waning moon.</p>
<p class="ith">Having set the halffilled kettle on the now burning coals, why did he return to the stillflowing tap?</p>
<p> To wash his soiled hands with a partially consumed tablet of
Barrington&apos;s lemonflavoured
soap<font color="red"><sup><small>|7</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>7|</small></sup></font>
to which paper still

in fresh cold neverchanging everchanging water and dry them, face and hands, in
a long redbordered holland cloth passed over a wooden revolving roller.</p>
<p class="ith">What reason did Stephen give for declining Bloom&apos;s offer?</p>
<p> That he was hydrophobe, hating partial contact by immersion or total by
submersion in cold water, (his last bath having taken place in the month of
<br><font color="green">{u22, 626}</font>
<br> October of the preceding year), disliking the acqueous substances of glass
and crystal, distrusting aquacities of thought and language.</p>
<p class="ith">What impeded Bloom from giving Stephen counsels of hygiene and
prophylactic to which should be added suggestions concerning a preliminary
wetting of the head and contraction of the muscles with rapid splashing of the
face and neck and thoracic and epigastric region in case of sea or river
bathing<font color="red"><sup><small>|7</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>7|</small></sup></font>
the parts of the human anatomy most sensitive to cold being the nape, stomach and thenar or sole of foot?</p>
<p> The incompatibility of aquacity with the erratic originality of genius.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 745}</font> </p>
<p class="ith">What additional counsels did he similarly repress?</p>
<p> Dietary: concerning the respective percentage of protein and caloric energy
in bacon, salt ling and butter, the absence of the former in the lastnamed and
the abundance of the latter in the firstnamed.</p>
<p class="ith">Which seemed to the host to be the predominant qualities of his guest?</p>
<p> Confidence in himself, an equal and opposite power of abandonment and recuperation.</p>
<p class="ith">What concomitant phenomenon took place in the vessel of liquid by the agency of fire?</p>
<p> The phenomenon of ebullition. Fanned by a constant updraught of ventilation
between the kitchen and the chimneyflue, ignition was communicated from the
faggots of precombustible fuel to polyhedral masses of bituminous coal,
containing in compressed mineral form the foliated fossilised decidua of
primeval forests which had in turn derived their vegetative existence from the
sun, primal source of heat (radiant). Heat (convected), a mode of motion
developed by such combustion, was constantly and increasingly conveyed from the
source of calorification to the liquid contained in the vessel, being radiated
through the uneven unpolished dark surface of the metal iron, in part reflected,
in part absorbed, in part transmitted, gradually raising the temperature of the
water from normal to boiling point, a rise in temperature expressible as the
result of an expenditure of 72 thermal units needed to raise 1 pound of water from 50&deg; to 212&deg; Fahrenheit.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 627}</font> </p>
<p class="ith">What announced the accomplishment of this rise in temperature?</p>
<p> A double falciform ejection of water vapour from under the kettlelid at both sides simultaneously.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 746}</font> </p>
<p class="ith">For what personal purpose could Bloom have applied the water so boiled?</p>
<p> To shave himself.</p>
<p class="ith">What advantages attended shaving by night?</p>
<p> A softer beard: a softer brush if intentionally allowed to remain from shave
to shave in its agglutinated lather: a softer skin if unexpectedly encountering
female acquaintances in remote places at incustomary hours: quiet reflections
upon the course of the day: a cleaner sensation when awaking after a fresher
sleep since matutinal noises, premonitions and perturbations, a clattered
milkcan, a postman&apos;s double knock, a paper
read<font color="red"><sup><small>|7</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>7|</small></sup></font>
reread while lathering, relathering the same spot, a shock, a shoot, with
thought of aught he sought though fraught with nought might cause a faster rate
of shaving and a nick on which incision plaster with precision cut and humected
and applied adhered: which was to be done.</p>
<p class="ith">Why did absence of light disturb him less than presence of noise?</p>
<p> Because of the surety of the sense of touch in his firm full masculine feminine passive active hand.</p>
<p class="ith">What quality did it (his hand) possess but with what counteracting influence?</p>
<p> The operative surgical quality but that he was reluctant to shed human blood
even when the end justified the means, preferring, in their natural order,
heliotherapy, psychophysicotherapeutics, osteopathic surgery.</p>
<p class="ith">What lay under exposure on the lower, middle and upper shelves of
the kitchen dresser, opened by Bloom?</p>
<p> On the lower shelf five vertical breakfast plates, six horizontal breakfast
saucers on which rested inverted breakfast cups, a moustachecup, uninverted, and saucer of Crown Derby, four white
<br><font color="green">{u21, 747}</font>
<br> goldrimmed eggcups, an open shammy purse displaying coins, mostly copper, a
phial of aromatic comfits and a red bettingticket. On the middle shelf a chipped
eggcup containing pepper, a drum of table salt, four conglomerated black olives in oleaginous paper, an empty pot of
<br><font color="green">{u22, 628}</font>
<br> Plumtree&apos;s potted meat, an oval wicker basket bedded with fibre and
containing one Jersey pear, a halfempty bottle of William Gilbey and Co&apos;s
white invalid port, half disrobed of its swathe of coralpink tissue paper, a
packet of Epps&apos;s soluble cocoa, five ounces of Anne Lynch&apos;s choice tea
at 2/- per lb in a crinkled leadpaper bag, a cylindrical canister containing the
best crystallised lump sugar, two onions, one, the larger, Spanish, entire, the
other, smaller, Irish, bisected and more redolent, a jar of Irish Model
Dairy&apos;s cream, a jug of brown crockery containing a naggin and a quarter of
soured adulterated milk, converted by heat into water, acidulous serum and
semisolidified curds, which added to the quantity subtracted for Mr Bloom&apos;s
and Mrs Fleming&apos;s breakfasts made one
<font color="red"><sup><small>|7</small></sup></font><font color="black">imperial</font><font color="red"><sup><small>7|</small></sup></font>
pint, the total quantity originally delivered, two cloves, a halfpenny and a
small dish containing a slice of fresh ribsteak. On the upper shelf a battery of jamjars of various sizes.</p>
<p class="ith">What attracted his attention lying on the apron of the dresser?</p>
<p> Four polygonal fragments of two lacerated scarlet betting tickets, numbered 8 87, 8 86.</p>
<p class="ith">What reminiscences temporarily corrugated his brow?</p>
<p> Reminiscences of coincidences, truth stranger than fiction, preindicative of
the result of the Gold Cup flat handicap, the result of which he had read in the
<i>Evening Telegraph</i>, late pink edition, in the cabman&apos;s shelter, at Butt bridge.</p>
<p class="ith">Where had previous intimations of the result, effected or projected, been received by him?</p>

successively requested, perused and restituted the copy of the current issue of
the <i>Freeman&apos;s Journal</i> and <i>National Press</i> which he had been
about to throw away (subsequently thrown away), he had proceeded towards the
oriental edifice of the Turkish and Warm Baths, 11 Leinster street, with the light of
<br><font color="green">{u22, 629}</font>
<br> inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the secret
of the race, graven in the language of prediction.</p>
<p class="ith">What qualifying considerations allayed his perturbations?</p>
<p> The difficulties of interpretation since the significance of any event
followed its occurrence as variably as the acoustic report followed the
electrical discharge and of counterestimating against an actual loss by failure
to interpret the total sum of possible losses proceeding originally from a successful interpretation.</p>
<p class="ith">His mood?</p>
<p> He had not risked, he did not expect, he had not been disappointed, he was satisfied.</p>
<p class="ith">What satisfied him?</p>
<p> To have sustained no positive loss. To have brought a positive gain to others. Light to the gentiles.</p>
<p class="ith">How did Bloom prepare a collation for a gentile?</p>
<p> He poured into two teacups two level spoonfuls, four in all, of Epps&apos;s
soluble cocoa and proceeded according to the directions for use printed on the
label, to each adding after sufficient time the
<br><font color="green">{u21, 749}</font>
<br> prescribed ingredients in the manner and in the quantity prescribed.</p>
<p class="ith">What marks of special hospitality did the host show his guest?</p>
<p> Relinquishing his right to the moustache cup of imitation crown Derby
presented to him by his only daughter, Millicent
<font color="red"><sup><small>|7</small></sup></font><font color="black">(Milly)</font><font color="red"><sup><small>7|</small></sup></font>,
he substituted a cup identical with that of his guest and served to his guest
and, in reduced measure, to himself, the viscous cream usually reserved for the
breakfast of his wife Marion (Molly).</p>
<p class="ith">Was the guest conscious of and did he acknowledge these marks of hospitality?</p>
<p> His attention was directed to them by his host jocosely and he accepted them seriously as they drank in silence.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 630}</font> </p>
<p class="ith">Were there marks of hospitality which he contemplated but
suppressed, reserving them for another and for himself on future occasions to complete the act begun?</p>
<p> The reparation of a fissure of the length of 1&frac12; inches in the right
side of his guest&apos;s jacket. A gift to his guest of one of the four
lady&apos;s handkerchiefs, if and when ascertained to be in a presentable condition.</p>
<p class="ith">Who drank more quickly?</p>
<p> Bloom, having the advantage of ten seconds at the initiation and taking
three sips to his opponent&apos;s one, six to two, nine to three.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 750}</font> </p>
<p class="ith">What cerebration accompanied his act?</p>
<p> Concluding by inspection but erroneously that his silent companion was
engaged in mental composition he reflected on the pleasures derived from
literature of instruction rather than of amusement as he himself had applied to
the works of Shakespeare more than once for the solution of difficult problems in imaginary or real life.</p>
<p class="ith">Had he found their solution?</p>
<p> In spite of careful and repeated reading of certain classical passages,
aided by a glossary, he had derived imperfect conviction from the text, the answers not bearing in all points.</p>
<p class="ith">What lines concluded his first piece of original verse written by
him, potential poet, at the age of 11 in 1877 on the occasion of the offering of
three prizes of 10/-, 5/- and 2/6 respectively by the <i>Shamrock</i>, a weekly newspaper?</p>

<p class="ith">What relation existed between their ages?</p>
<p> 16 years before in 1888 when Bloom was of Stephen&apos;s present age Stephen
was 6. 16 years after in 1920 when Stephen would be of Bloom&apos;s present age
Bloom would be 54. In 1936 when Bloom would be 70 and Stephen 54 their ages
initially in the ratio of 16 to 0 would be as 17&frac12; to 13&frac12;, the
proportion increasing and the disparity diminishing according as arbitrary
future years were added for if the proportion existing in 1883 had continued
immutable, conceiving that to be possible, till then 1904 when Stephen was 22
Bloom would be 374 and in 1920 when Stephen would be 38, as Bloom then was,
Bloom would be 646 while in 1952 when Stephen would have attained the maximum

<p class="ith">What events might nullify these calculations?</p>
<p> The cessation of existence of both or either, the inauguration of a new era
or calendar, the annihilation of the world and consequent extermination of the
human species, inevitable but impredictable.</p>
<p class="ith">How many previous encounters proved their preexisting acquaintance?</p>
<p> Two. The first in the lilacgarden of Matthew Dillon&apos;s house, Medina
<br><font color="green">{u21, 753}</font>
<br> Villa, Kimmage road, Roundtown, in 1887, in the company of Stephen&apos;s
mother, Stephen being then of the age of 5 and reluctant to give his hand in
salutation. The second in the coffeeroom of Breslin&apos;s hotel on a rainy
Sunday in the January of 1892, in the company of Stephen&apos;s father and
Stephen&apos;s granduncle, Stephen being then 5 years older.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 633}</font> </p>
<p class="ith">Did Bloom accept the invitation to dinner given then by the son
and afterwards seconded by the father?</p>
<p> Very gratefully, with grateful appreciation, with sincere appreciative
gratitude, in appreciatively grateful sincerity of regret, he declined.</p>
<p class="ith">Did their conversation on the subject of these reminiscences
reveal a third connecting link between them?</p>
<p> Mrs Riordan, a widow of independent means, had resided in the house of
Stephen&apos;s parents from 1 September 1888 to 29 December 1891 and had also
resided during the years 1892, 1893 and 1894 in the City Arms Hotel owned by
Elizabeth O&apos;Dowd of 54 Prussia street where, during parts of the years 1893
and 1894, she had been a constant informant of Bloom who resided also in the
same hotel, being at that time a clerk in the employment of Joseph Cuffe of 5
Smithfield for the superintendence of sales in the adjacent Dublin Cattle market on the North Circular road.</p>
<p class="ith">Had he performed any special corporal work of mercy for her?</p>
<p> He had sometimes propelled her on warm summer evenings, an infirm widow of
independent, if limited, means, in her convalescent bathchair with slow
revolutions of its wheels as far as the corner of the North Circular road
opposite Mr Gavin Low&apos;s place of business where she had remained for a
certain time scanning through his onelensed binocular fieldglasses
unrecognisable citizens on tramcars, roadster bicycles equipped with inflated
pneumatic tyres, hackney carriages, tandems, private and hired landaus,
dogcarts, ponytraps and brakes passing from the city to the Phoenix Park and <i>vice versa</i>.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 754}</font> </p>
<p class="ith">Why could he support that his vigil with the greater equanimity?</p>
<p> Because in middle youth he had often sat observing through a rondel of
bossed glass of a multicoloured pane the spectacle offered with continual
changes of the thoroughfare without, pedestrians, quadrupeds, velocipedes,
vehicles, passing slowly, quickly, evenly, round and round and round the rim of a round and round precipitous globe.</p>
<p class="ith">What distinct different memories had each of her now eight years deceased?</p>
<p> The older, her bezique cards and counters, her Skye terrier, her
suppositious wealth, her lapses of responsiveness and incipient catarrhal
deafness: the younger, her lamp of colza oil before the statue of the Immaculate Conception,
<br><font color="green">{u22, 634}</font>
<br> her green and maroon brushes for Parnell and for Michael Davitt, her tissue papers.</p>
<p class="ith">Were there no means still remaining to him to achieve the
rejuvenation which these reminiscences divulged to a younger companion rendered the more desirable?</p>
<p> The indoor exercises, formerly intermittently practised, subsequently
abandoned, prescribed in Eugen Sandow&apos;s <i>Physical Strength and How to
Obtain It</i> which, designed particularly for commercial men engaged in
sedentary occupations, were to be made with mental concentration in front of a
mirror so as to bring into play the various families of muscles and produce
successively a pleasant rigidity, a more pleasant relaxation and the most
pleasant repristination of juvenile agility.</p>
<p class="ith">Had any special agility been his in earlier youth?</p>
<p> Though ringweight lifting had been beyond his strength and the full circle
gyration beyond his courage yet as a High School scholar he had excelled in his
stable and protracted execution of the half lever movement on the parallel bars
in consequence of his abnormally developed abdominal muscles.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 755}</font> </p>
<p class="ith">Did either openly allude to their racial difference?</p>
<p> Neither.</p>
<p class="ith">What, reduced to their simplest form, were Bloom&apos;s thoughts
about Stephen&apos;s thoughts about Bloom?</p>
<p> He thought that he thought that he was a jew whereas he knew that he knew that he knew that he was not.</p>
<p class="ith">What, the enclosures of reticence removed, were their respective parentages?</p>
<p> Bloom, only male heir of Rudolf Virag (subsequently Rudolph Bloom) of
Szombath&eacute;ly, Vienna, Budapest, Milan, London and Dublin and of Ellen
Higgins, second daughter of Julius Higgins (born Karoly) and Fanny Higgins (born
Hegarty). Stephen, eldest surviving male heir of Simon Dedalus of Cork and
Dublin and of Mary, daughter of Richard and Christina Goulding (born Grier).
<br><font color="green">{u22, 635}</font> </p>
<p class="ith">Had Bloom and Stephen been baptised, and where and by whom, cleric or layman?</p>
<p> Bloom (three times) by the reverend Mr Gilmer Johnston M.A., alone, in the
protestant church of Saint Nicholas Without, Coombe, by James O&apos;Connor,
Philip Gilligan and James Fitzpatrick, together, under a pump in the village of
Swords, and by the reverend Charles Malone, C.C., in the church of the Three
Patrons, Rathgar. Stephen (once) by the reverend Charles Malone, C.C., alone, in
the church of the Three Patrons, Rathgar.</p>
<p class="ith">Did they find their educational careers similar?</p>
<p> If Stephen had been Bloom he would have passed successively through a
dame&apos;s school and the high school: if Bloom had been Stephen he would have passed successively through
<br><font color="green">{u21, 756}</font>
<br> the preparatory, junior, middle and senior grades of the intermediate and
through the matriculation, first arts, second arts and degree courses of the royal university.</p>
<p class="ith">Why did Bloom refrain from stating that he had frequented the university of life?</p>
<p> Because of his fluctuating incertitude as to whether this observation had
<font color="red"><sup><small>|7</small></sup></font><font color="black">or had
not</font><font color="red"><sup><small>7|</small></sup></font> been already
made by him to Stephen or by Stephen to him.</p>
<p class="ith">What two temperaments did they individually represent?</p>
<p> The scientific. The artistic.</p>
<p class="ith">What proofs did Bloom adduce to prove that his tendency was
towards applied, rather than towards pure, science?</p>
<p> Certain possible inventions of which he had cogitated when reclining on his
back in a state of repletion to aid digestion, stimulated by his appreciation of
the importance of inventions now common but once revolutionary, for example, the
aeronautic parachute, the reflecting telescope, the spiral corkscrew, the safety
pin, the mineral water syphon, the canal lock with winch and sluice.</p>
<p class="ith">Were these inventions principally intended for an improved scheme of kindergarten?</p>
<p> Yes, rendering obsolete popguns, elastic airbladders, games of hazard,
catapults. They comprised astronomical kaleidoscopes exhibiting the twelve
<br><font color="green">{u22, 636}</font>
<br> constellations of the zodiac from Aries to Pisces, miniature mechanical
orreries, arithmetical gelatine lozenges, geometrical to correspond to
zoological biscuits, globemap playing balls, historically costumed dolls.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 757}</font> </p>
<p class="ith">What also stimulated him in his cogitations?</p>
<p> The financial success achieved by Ephraim Marks and Charles A. James, the
former by his 1d. bazaar at 42 George&apos;s street, south, the latter at his
6&frac12;d. shop and world&apos;s fancy fair and waxwork exhibition at 30 Henry
Street, admission 6d., children 1d.; and the infinite possibilities hitherto
unexploited of the modern art of advertisement if condensed in triliteral symbols of magnetising efficacy.</p>

<p class="ith">Which example did he adduce to induce Stephen to deduce that
originality, though producing its own reward, does not invariably conduce to success?</p>
<p> His own ideated and rejected project of an illuminated showcart, drawn by a
beast of burden, in which two smartly dressed girls were to be seated engaged in writing.</p>
<p class="ith">What suggested scene was then constructed by Stephen?</p>
<p> Solitary hotel in mountain pass. Autumn. Twilight. Fire lit. In dark corner

correct method of writing the capital initial of the name of a city in Canada,
Quebec. She understood little of political complications, internal, or balance
of power, external. In calculating the addenda of bills she frequently had
recourse to digital aid. Unusual polysyllables of foreign origin she interpreted
phonetically or by false analogy or by both: metempsychosis (met him pike

<p class="ith">Condense Stephen&apos;s commentary.</p>
<p> One of all, the least of all, is the victim predestined. Once by
inadvertence, twice by design he challenges his destiny. It comes when he is
abandoned and challenges him reluctant and, as an apparition of hope and youth,
holds him unresisting. It leads him to a strange habitation, to a secret infidel
apartment, and there, implacable, immolates him, consenting.</p>
<p class="ith">Why was the host (victim predestined) sad?</p>
<p> He wished that a tale of a deed should be told of a deed not by him should by him not be told.</p>
<p class="ith">Why was the host (reluctant, unresisting) still?</p>
<p> <font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font></p>
<p class="ith">Why was the host (secret infidel) silent?</p>
<p> He weighed the possible evidences for and against ritual murder: the
incitations of the hierarchy, the superstition of the populace,
<font color="red"><sup><small>|7</small></sup></font><font color="black">the
propagation of rumour in continued fraction of
veridicity,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>7|</small></sup></font> the envy
of opulence, the influence of retaliation, the sporadic reappearance of
atavistic delinquency, the mitigating circumstances of fanaticism, hypnotic suggestion and sonambulism.</p>
<p class="ith">From which of these mental or physical disorders was he not totally immune?</p>
<p> From hypnotic suggestion: once, waking, he had not recognised his sleeping
apartment: more than once, waking, he had been for an indefinite time incapable
of moving or uttering sounds. From sonambulism:
<br><font color="green">{u21, 768}</font>
<br> once, sleeping, his body had risen, crouched and crawled in the direction
of a heatless fire and, having attained its destination, there, curled,
unheated, in night attire had lain, sleeping.</p>
<p class="ith">Had this latter or any cognate phenomenon declared itself in any member of his family?</p>
<p> Twice, in Holles street and in Ontario terrace, his daughter Millicent
(Milly) at the ages of 6 and 8 years had uttered in sleep an exclamation of
terror and had replied to the interrogations of two figures in night attire with a vacant mute expression.

<p class="ith">What other infantile memories had he of her?</p>
<p> 15 June 1889. A querulous

Socks she shook with shocks her moneybox: counted his three free moneypenny

Austrian army, proximate, a hallucination, lieutenant Mulvey, British navy.</p>

breakfast moustachecup of imitation crown Derby porcelain ware. She provided: at
quarter day or thereabouts if or when purchases had been made by him not for her
she showed herself attentive to his necessities, anticipating his desires. She
admired: a natural phenomenon having been explained by him to her she expressed
the immediate desire to possess without gradual acquisition a fraction of his
science, the moiety, the quarter, a thousandth part.

<p class="ith">What proposal did Bloom, diambulist, father of Milly, somnambulist, make to Stephen, noctambulist?</p>
<p> To pass in repose the hours intervening between Thursday (proper) and Friday
(normal) on an extemporised cubicle in the apartment immediately above the
kitchen and immediately adjacent to the sleeping apartment of his host and hostess.</p>
<p class="ith">What various advantages would or might have resulted from a prolungation of such an extemporisation?</p>
<p> For the guest: security of domicile and seclusion of study. For the host:
rejuvenation of intelligence, vicarious satisfaction. For the
<br><font color="green">{u21, 771}</font>
<br> hostess: disintegration of obsession, acquisition of correct Italian pronunciation.</p>
<p class="ith">Why might these several provisional contingencies between a guest
and a hostess not necessarily preclude or be precluded by a permanent
eventuality of reconciliatory union between a schoolfellow and a jew&apos;s daughter?</p>
<p> Because the way to daughter led through mother, the way to mother through daughter.</p>

question of his host did the guest return a monosyllabic negative answer?</p>
<p> If he had known the late Mrs Emily Sinico, accidentally killed at Sydney
Parade railway station, 14 October 1903.</p>
<p class="ith">Was the proposal accepted?</p>
<p> Promptly, inexplicably, with amicability, gratefully it was declined.</p>
<br><font color="green">{u22, 649}</font>
<br>
<p class="ith">What counterproposals were alternately advanced, accepted,
modified, declined, restated in other terms, reaccepted, ratified, reconfirmed?
<br><font color="green">{u21, 772}</font> </p>
<p> To inaugurate a prearranged course of Italian instruction, place the
residence of the instructed. To inaugurate a course of vocal instruction, place
the residence of the instructress. To inaugurate a series of static, semistatic
and peripatetic intellectual dialogues, places the residence of both speakers
(if both speakers were resident in the same place), the <i>Ship</i> hotel and
tavern, 6 Lower Abbey street (W. and E. Connery, proprietors), the National
Library of Ireland, 10 Kildare street, the National Maternity Hospital, 29, 30
and 31 Holles street, a public garden, the vicinity of a place of worship, a
conjunction of two or more public thoroughfares, the point of bisection of a
right line drawn between their residences (if both speakers were resident in different places).</p>
<p class="ith">What rendered problematic for Bloom the realisation of these mutually selfexcluding propositions?</p>
<p> The irreparability of the past: once at a performance of Albert
Hengler&apos;s circus in the Rotunda, Rutland square, Dublin an intuitive
particoloured clown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring to a
place in the auditorium where Bloom, solitary, was seated and had publicly
declared to an exhilarated audience that he (Bloom) was his (the clown&apos;s)
papa. The imprevidibility of the future: once in the summer of 1898 he (Bloom)
had marked a florin (2/-) with three notches on the milled edge and tendered it
in payment of an account due to and received by J. and T. Davy, family grocers,
1 Charlemont Mall, Grand Canal, for circulation on the waters of civic finance,
for possible, circuitous or direct, return.</p>
<p class="ith">Was the clown Bloom&apos;s son?</p>
<p> No.</p>
<p class="ith">Had Bloom&apos;s coin returned?</p>
<p> Never.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 773}</font> </p>
<p class="ith">Why would a recurrent frustration the more depress him?</p>
<p> Because at the critical turningpoint of human existence he desired to amend
many social conditions, the product of inequality and avarice and international animosity.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 650}</font> </p>
<p class="ith">He believed then that human life was infinitely perfectible, eliminating these conditions?</p>
<p> There remained the generic conditions imposed by natural, as distinct from
human law, as integral parts of the human whole: the necessity of destruction to
procure alimentary sustenance; the painful character of the ultimate functions
of separate existence, birth and death: the monotonous menstruation of simian
and (particularly) human females extending from the age of puberty to the
menopause; inevitable accidents at sea, in mines and factories: certain very
painful maladies and their resultant surgical operations, innate lunacy and
congenital criminality, decimating epidemics: catastrophic cataclysms which make
terror the basis of human mentality: seismic upheavals the epicentres of which
are located in densely populated regions: the fact of vital growth, through
convulsions of metamorphosis, from infancy through maturity to decay.</p>
<p class="ith">Why did he desist from speculation?</p>
<p> Because it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute other
<font color="red"><sup><small>|7|a</small></sup></font><font color="black">more<font color="red"><sup><small>a|</small></sup></font>
acceptable</font><font color="red"><sup><small>7|</small></sup></font> phenomena
in the place of the
<font color="red"><sup><small>|7</small></sup></font><font color="black">less
acceptable</font><font color="red"><sup><small>7|</small></sup></font> phenomena to be removed.</p>
<p class="ith">Did Stephen participate in his dejection?</p>
<p> He affirmed his significance as a conscious rational animal proceeding
syllogistically from the known to the unknown and a conscious rational reagent
between a micro and a macrocosm constructed upon the incertitude of the void.</p>
<p class="ith">Was this affirmation apprehended by Bloom?</p>
<p> Not verbally. Substantially.

<p class="ith">Was he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle?</p>

ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the satellite of their planet.</p>
<p class="ith">Did he then accept as an article of belief the theory of

invariability of her aspect: her indeterminate response to inaffirmative
interrogation: her potency over effluent and refluent waters: her power to
enamour, to mortify, to invest with beauty, to render insane, to incite to and
aid delinquency: the tranquil inscrutability of her visage: the terribility of
her isolated dominant implacable resplendent propinquity: her omens of tempest
and of calm: the stimulation of her light, her motion and her presence: the
admonition of her craters, her arid seas, her silence: her splendour, when visible: her attraction, when invisible.

integrity of Jesus circumcised (1 January, holiday of obligation to hear mass
<br><font color="green">{u22, 656}</font>
<br> and abstain from unnecessary servile work) and the problem as to whether
the divine prepuce, the carnal bridal ring of the holy Roman catholic apostolic

Vega in the Lyre above the zenith beyond the stargroup of the Tress of Berenice towards the zodiacal sign of Leo.</p>
<p class="ith">How did the centripetal remainer afford egress to the centrifugal departer?</p>
<p> By inserting the barrel of an arruginated male key in the hole of an

momentarily arrested his ingress) had been moved from its position beside the

<p class="ith">What occupied the position originally occupied by the sideboard?</p>
<p> A vertical piano (Cadby) with exposed keyboard, its closed coffin supporting
a pair of long yellow ladies&apos; gloves and an emerald ashtray containing four
consumed matches, a partly consumed cigarette and two discoloured ends of
cigarettes, its musicrest supporting the music in the key of G natural for voice
and piano of <i>Love&apos;s Old Sweet Song</i> (words by G. Clifton Bingham,
composed by J.L. Molloy, sung by Madam Antoinette Sterling) open at the last
page with the final indications <i>ad libitum</i>, <i>forte</i>, pedal,
<i>animato</i>, sustained pedal, <i>ritirando</i>, close.</p>
<p class="ith">With what sensations did Bloom contemplate in rotation these objects?</p>
<p> With strain, elevating a candlestick: with
pain<font color="red"><sup><small>|7</small></sup></font><font color="black">,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>7|</small></sup></font>
feeling on his right temple a contused tumescence: with attention, focussing his
gaze on a large dull passive and a slender bright active:
<font color="red"><sup><small>|7</small></sup></font><font color="black">with
solicitation, bending and downturning the upturned
rugfringe:</font><font color="red"><sup><small>7|</small></sup></font> with
amusement, remembering Dr Malachi Mulligan&apos;s scheme of colour containing
the gradation of green: with pleasure, repeating the words and antecedent act
and perceiving through various channels of internal sensibility the consequent
and concomitant tepid pleasant diffusion of gradual discolouration.</p>
<p class="ith">His next proceeding?</p>
<p> From an open box on the majolicatopped table he extracted a black diminutive
cone, one inch in height, placed it on its circular base on a small tin plate,
placed his candlestick on the right corner of the mantelpiece, produced from his
waistcoat a folded typed letter, unfolded the folded letter, examined it
<br><font color="green">{u21, 785}</font>
<br> superficially, rolled it into a thin cylinder, ignited it in the
candleflame, applied it when ignited to the apex of the cone till the latter
reached the stage of rutilance, placed the cylinder in the basin of the
candlestick disposing its unconsumed part in such a manner as to facilitate total combustion.</p>
<p class="ith">What followed this operation?</p>
<p> The truncated conical crater summit of the diminutive volcano emitted a
vertical and serpentine fume redolent of aromatic oriental incense.</p>
<p class="ith">What
<font color="red"><sup><small>|7</small></sup></font><font color="black"><a name="s17013an" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17013an">homothetic</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>7|</small></sup></font>
objects, other than the candlestick, stood on the mantelpiece?
<br><font color="green">{u22, 660}</font> </p>
<p> A timepiece of striated Connemara marble, stopped at the hour of 4.46 a.m.
on the 21 March 1896, matrimonial gift of Matthew Dillon: a dwarf tree of
glacial arborescence under a transparent bellshade, matrimonial gift of Luke and
Caroline Doyle: an embalmed owl, matrimonial gift of Alderman John Hooper.</p>
<p class="ith">What interchanges of looks took place between these three objects and Bloom?</p>
<p> In the mirror of the giltbordered pierglass the undecorated back of the
dwarf tree regarded the upright back of the embalmed owl. Before the mirror the
matrimonial gift of Alderman John Hooper with a clear melancholy wise bright
motionless compassionate gaze regarded Bloom while Bloom with obscure tranquil
profound motionless compassionated gaze regarded the matrimonial gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle.</p>
<p class="ith">What composite asymmetrical image in the mirror then attracted his attention?</p>
<p> The image of a solitary (ipsorelative) mutable (aliorelative) man.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 786}</font> </p>
<p class="ith">Why solitary (ipsorelative)?</p>
<p class="set"><i>Brothers and sisters had he none.</i>
<br> <i>Yet that man&apos;s father was his grandfather&apos;s son.</i></p>
<p class="ith">Why mutable (aliorelative)?</p>
<p> From infancy to maturity he had resembled his maternal procreatrix. From
maturity to senility he would increasingly resemble his paternal procreator.</p>
<p class="ith">What final visual impression was communicated to him by the mirror?</p>
<p> The optical reflection of several inverted volumes

<p class="ith">What reflections occupied his mind during the process of reversion of the inverted volumes?</p>
<p> The necessity of order, a place for everything and everything in its place:
the deficient appreciation of literature possessed by females: the incongruity
of an apple incuneated in a tumbler and of an umbrella inclined in a closestool:
the insecurity of hiding any secret document behind, beneath or between the pages of a book.</p>

<p class="ith">Why, firstly and secondly, did he not consult the work in question?</p>
<p> Firstly, in order to exercise mnemotechnic: secondly, because after an
interval of amnesia, when, seated at the central table, about to consult the work
<br><font color="green">{u22, 663}</font>
<br> in question, he remembered by mnemotechnic the name of the military engagement, Plevna.</p>
<p class="ith">What caused him irritation in his sitting posture?</p>
<p> Inhibitory pressure of collar (size 17) and waistcoat (5 buttons),
<br><font color="green">{u21, 789}</font>
<br> two articles of clothing superfluous in the costume of mature males and
inelastic to alterations of mass by expansion.</p>
<p class="ith">How was the irritation allayed?</p>
<p> He removed his collar, with contained black necktie and collapsible stud,
from his neck to a position on the left of the table. He unbuttoned successively
in reversed direction waistcoat, trousers, shirt and vest along the medial line
of irregular incrispated black hairs extending in triangular convergence from
the pelvic basin over the circumference of the abdomen and umbilicular fossicle
along the medial line of nodes to the intersection of the sixth pectoral
vertebrae, thence produced both ways at right angles and terminating in circles
described about two equidistant points, right and left, on the summits of the
mammary prominences.
<font color="red"><sup><small>|7</small></sup></font><font color="black">He
unbraced successively each of six minus one braced trouser buttons, arranged in
pairs, of which one incomplete.</font><font color="red"><sup><small>7|</small></sup></font></p>
<p class="ith">What involuntary actions followed?</p>
<p> He compressed between 2 fingers the flesh circumjacent to a cicatrice in the
left infracostal region below the diaphragm resulting from a sting inflicted 2
weeks and 3 days previously (23 May 1904) by a bee. He scratched imprecisely
with his right hand, though insensible of prurition, various points and surfaces
of his partly exposed, wholly abluted skin. He inserted his left hand into the
left lower pocket of his waistcoat and extracted and replaced a silver coin (1
shilling), placed there (presumably) on the occasion (10 October 1903) of the
interment of Mrs Emily Sinico, Sydney Parade.

<p class="ith">Did the process of divestiture continue?</p>
<p> Sensible of a benignant persistent ache in his footsoles he extended his
foot to one side and observed the creases, protuberances and salient points
caused by foot pressure in the course of walking repeatedly in several different
directions, then, inclined, he disnoded the laceknots, unhooked and loosened the
laces, took off each of his two boots for the second time, detached the
partially moistened right sock through the fore part of which the nail of his
great toe had again effracted, raised his right and, having unhooked a purple
elastic sock suspender, took off his right sock, placed his unclothed right foot
on the margin of the seat of his chair, picked at and gently lacerated the
protruding part of the great toenail, raised the part lacerated to his nostrils
and inhaled the odour of the quick, then, with satisfaction, threw away the lacerated unghial fragment.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 665}</font> </p>
<p class="ith">Why with satisfaction?</p>
<p> Because the odour inhaled corresponded to other odours inhaled of other
unghial fragments, picked and lacerated by Master Bloom, pupil of Mrs
Ellis&apos;s juvenile school, patiently each night in the act of brief
genuflection and nocturnal prayer and ambitious meditation.</p>

<p class="ith">What eventuality would render him independent of such wealth?</p>
<p> The independent discovery of a goldseam of inexhaustible ore.</p>
<p class="ith">For what reason did he meditate on schemes so difficult of realisation?</p>
<p> It was one of his axioms that similar meditations or the automatic relation
to himself of a narrative concerning himself or tranquil recollection of the
past when practised habitually before retiring for the night allievated fatigue
and produced as a result sound repose and renovated vitality.</p>
<p class="ith">His justifications?</p>
<p> As a physicist he had learned that of the 70 years of complete human life at
least 2&frasl;7, viz, 20 years are passed in sleep. As a philosopher he knew
that at the termination of any allotted life only an infinitesimal part of any
person&apos;s desires has been realised. As a physiologist he believed in the
artificial placation of malignant agencies chiefly operative during somnolence.</p>
<p class="ith">What did he fear?</p>
<p> The commital of homicide or suicide during sleep by an aberration of the
light of reason, the incommensurable categorical intelligence situated in the cerebral convolutions.

<p class="ith">What were habitually his final meditations?</p>

infirm dog, Athos: aconite, resorted to by increasing doses of grains and
scruples as a palliative of recrudescent neuralgia: the face in death of a septuagenarian, suicide by poison.</p>
<p class="ith">Why did Bloom experience a sentiment of remorse?</p>

<p class="ith">How did these beliefs and practices now appear to him?</p>
<p> Not more rational than they had then appeared, not less rational than other beliefs and practices now appeared.</p>
<p class="ith">What first reminiscence had he of Rudolph Bloom (deceased)?</p>
<p> Rudolph Bloom (deceased) narrated to his son Leopold Bloom (aged 6) a
retrospective arrangement of migrations and settlements in and between Dublin,
London, Florence, Milan, Vienna, Budapest, Szombathely with statements of satisfaction (his grandfather having
<br><font color="green">{u21, 806}</font>
<br> seen Maria Theresia, empress of Austria, queen of Hungary), with commercial
advice (having taken care of pence, the pounds having taken care of themselves).
Leopold Bloom (aged 6) had accompanied these narrations by constant consultation of a geographical map
<br><font color="green">{u22, 677}</font>
<br> of Europe (political) and by suggestions for the establishment of
affiliated business premises in the various centres mentioned.</p>
<p class="ith">Had time equally but differently obliterated the memory of these migrations in narrator and listener?</p>
<p> In narrator by the access of years and in consequence of the use of narcotic
toxin: in listener by the access of years and in consequence of the action of
distraction upon vicarious experiences.</p>
<p class="ith">What idiosyncracies of the narrator were concomitant products of amnesia?</p>
<p> Occasionally he ate without having previously removed his hat. Occasionally
he drank voraciously the juice of gooseberry fool from an inclined plate.
Occasionally he removed from his lips the traces of food by means of a lacerated
envelope or other fragment of paper.</p>
<p class="ith">What two phenomena of senescence were more frequent?</p>
<p> The myopic digital calculation of coins, eructation consequent upon repletion.</p>
<p class="ith">What object offered partial consolation for these reminiscences?</p>
<p> The endowment policy, the bank passbook, the certificate of the possession of scrip.</p>

<p class="ith">What advantages were possessed by an occupied, as distinct from an unoccupied bed?</p>
<p> The removal of nocturnal solitude, the superior quality of human (mature

contact, the economy of mangling done on the premises in the case of trousers
accurately folded and placed lengthwise between the spring mattress (striped)

<p class="ith">What impersonal objects were perceived?</p>

brushtray (on the washstand, together), pitcher and night article (on the floor, separate).</p>
<p class="ith">Bloom&apos;s acts?</p>
<p> He deposited the articles of clothing on a chair, removed his other articles
of clothing, took from beneath the bolster at the head of the bed a folded long
white nightshirt, inserted his head and arms into the proper apertures of the
nightshirt, removed a pillow from the head to the foot of the bed, prepared the
bedlinen accordingly and entered the bed.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 683}</font> </p>
<p class="ith">How?</p>
<p> With circumspection, as invariably when entering an abode (his own or not
his own): with solicitude, the snakespiral springs of the mattress being old,
the brass quoits and pendent viper radii loose and tremulous under stress and
strain: prudently, as entering a lair or ambush of lust or adders: lightly, the
less to disturb: reverently, the bed of conception and of birth, of consummation
of marriage and of breach of marriage, of sleep and of death.</p>

<p> New clean bedlinen, additional odours, the presence of a human form, female,
hers, the imprint of a human form, male, not his, some crumbs, some flakes of
potted meat, recooked, which he removed.</p>
<p class="ith">If he had smiled why would he have smiled?</p>
<p> To reflect that each one who enters imagines himself to be the first to
enter whereas he is always the last term of a preceding series even if the first
term of a succeeding one, each imagining himself to be first, last, only and
alone whereas he is neither first nor last nor only nor alone in a series originating in and repeated to infinity.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 814}</font> </p>
<p class="ith">What preceding series?</p>
<p> Assuming Mulvey to be the first term of his series, Penrose, Bartell
d&apos;Arcy, professor Goodwin, Julius Mastiansky, John Henry Menton, Father
Bernard Corrigan, a farmer at the Royal Dublin Society&apos;s Horse Show, Maggot
O&apos;Reilly, Matthew Dillon, Valentine Blake Dillon (Lord Mayor of Dublin),
Christopher Callinan, Lenehan, an Italian organgrinder, an unknown gentleman in
the Gaiety Theatre, Benjamin Dollard, Simon Dedalus, Andrew (Pisser) Burke,
Joseph Cuffe, Wisdom Hely, Alderman John Hooper, Dr Francis Brady, Father
Sebastian of Mount Argus, a bootblack at the General Post Office, Hugh (Blazes)
Boylan and so each and so on to no last term.</p>
<p class="ith">What were his reflections concerning the last member of this series and late occupant of the bed?</p>
<p> Reflections on his vigour (a bounder), corporal proportion (a billsticker),
commercial ability (a bester), impressionability (a boaster).
<br><font color="green">{u22, 684}</font> </p>
<p class="ith">Why for the observer impressionability in addition to vigour,
corporal proportion and commercial ability?</p>
<p> Because he had observed with augmenting frequency in the preceding members
of the same series the same concupiscence, inflammably transmitted, first with
alarm, then with understanding, then with desire, finally with fatigue, with
alternating symptoms of comprehension and apprehension.</p>
<p class="ith">With what antagonistic sentiments were his subsequent reflections affected?</p>
<p> Envy, jealousy, abnegation, equanimity.</p>
<p class="ith">Envy?</p>
<p> Of a bodily and mental male organism specially adapted for the
superincumbent posture of energetic human copulation and energetic
<br><font color="green">{u21, 815}</font>
<br> piston and cylinder movement necessary for the complete satisfaction of a
constant but not acute concupiscence resident in a bodily and mental female organism passive but not obtuse.</p>
<p class="ith">Jealousy?</p>
<p> Because a nature full and
volatile<font color="red"><sup><small>|7</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>7|</small></sup></font>
in her free state, was alternately the agent and reagent of attraction. Because
attraction between agents and reagents at all instants varied, with inverse
proportion of increase and decrease, with incessant circular extension and
radial reentrance. Because the controlled contemplation of the fluctuation of
attraction produced, if desired, a fluctuation of pleasure.</p>
<p class="ith">Abnegation?</p>
<p> In virtue of a) acquaintance initiated in September 1903 in the
establishment of George Mesias, merchant tailor and outfitter, 5 Eden Quay, b)
hospitality extended and received in kind, reciprocated and reappropriated in
person, c) comparative youth subject to impulses of ambition and magnanimity,
colleagual altruism and amorous
egoism<font color="red"><sup><small>|7</small></sup></font><font color="black">,
d) <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">racial</span></span>
extraracial attraction, intraracial inhibition, supraracial
prerogative</font><font color="red"><sup><small>7|</small></sup></font>.</p>
<p class="ith">Equanimity?</p>
<p> As as natural as any and every natural act of a nature expressed or
understood executed in natured nature by natural creatures in accordance with
<br><font color="green">{u22, 685}</font>
<br> his, her and their natured natures, of dissimilar similarity. As not as
calamitous as a cataclysmic annihilation of the planet in consequence of a
collision with a dark sun. As less reprehensible than theft, highway robbery,
cruelty to children and animals, obtaining money under false pretences, forgery,
embezzlement, misappropriation of public money, betrayal of public trust,
malingering, mayhem, corruption of minors, criminal libel, blackmail, contempt
of court, arson, treason, felony, mutiny on the high seas, trespass, burglary, jailbreaking, practice
<br><font color="green">{u21, 816}</font>
<br> of unnatural vice, desertion from armed forces in the field, perjury,
poaching, usury, intelligence with the king&apos;s enemies, impersonation,
criminal assault, manslaughter, wilful and premeditated murder. As not more
abnormal than all other parallel processes of adaptation to altered conditions
of existence, resulting in a reciprocal equilibrium between the bodily organism
and its attendant circumstances, foods, beverages, acquired habits, indulged
inclinations, significant disease. As more than inevitable, irreparable.</p>
<p class="ith">Why more abnegation than jealousy, less envy than equanimity?</p>
<p> From outrage (matrimony) to outrage (adultery) there arose nought but
outrage (copulation) yet the matrimonial violator of the matrimonially violated
had not been outraged by the adulterous violator of the adulterously violated.</p>
<p class="ith">What retribution, if any?</p>
<p> Assassination, never, as two wrongs did not make one right. Duel by combat,
no. Divorce, not now. Exposure by mechanical artifice (automatic bed) or
individual testimony (concealed ocular witnesses), not yet. Suit for damages by
legal influence or simulation of assault with evidence of injuries sustained
(selfinflicted), not impossibly. If any, positively, connivance, introduction of
emulation (material, a prosperous rival agency of publicity: moral, a successful
rival agent of intimacy), depreciation, alienation, humiliation, separation
protecting the one separated from the other, protecting the separator from both.</p>

September 1870), viz, 8 October, and consummated on the same date with female
issue born 15 June 1889, having been anticipatorily consummated on the 10
September of the same year and complete carnal intercourse, with ejaculation of
semen within the

organ, having taken place 5 weeks previous, viz, 27 November 1893, to the birth
on 29 December 1893 of second (and only male) issue, deceased 9 January 1895,
aged 11 days, there remained a period of 10 years, 5 months and 18 days during
which carnal intercourse had been incomplete, without ejaculation of semen
within the natural female organ. By the narrator a limitation of activity, mental and
<br><font color="green">{u22, 688}</font>
<br> corporal, inasmuch as complete mental intercourse between himself and the
listener had not taken place since the consummation of puberty, indicated by
catamenic hemorrhage, of the female issue of narrator and listener, 15 September
1903, there remained a period of 9 months and 1 day during which, in consequence
of a preestablished natural comprehension in incomprehension between the
consummated females (listener and issue), complete corporal liberty of action had been circumscribed.</p>
<p class="ith">How?</p>
<p> By various reiterated feminine interrogation concerning the masculine
destination whither, the place where, the time at which, the duration for which,
the object with which in the case of temporary absences, projected or effected.</p>
<p class="ith">What moved visibly above the listener&apos;s and the narrator&apos;s invisible thoughts?</p>
<p> The upcast reflection of a lamp and shade, an inconstant series of
concentric circles of varying gradations of light and shadow.

parallel of latitude, N., and 6th meridian of longitude, W.: at an angle of 45&deg; to the terrestrial equator.</p>
<p class="ith">In what state of rest or motion?</p>
<p> At rest relatively to themselves and to each other. In motion being each and
both carried westward, forward and rereward respectively, by the proper
perpetual motion of the earth through everchanging tracks of neverchanging space.</p>
<p class="ith">In what posture?</p>
<p> Listener: reclined semilaterally, left, left hand under head, right leg
extended in a straight line and resting on left leg, flexed, in the attitude of
Gea-Tellus, fulfilled, recumbent, big with seed. Narrator: reclined laterally,
left, with right and left legs flexed, the indexfinger and thumb of the right
hand resting on the bridge of the nose, in the attitude depicted in a snapshot
photograph made by Percy Apjohn, the childman weary, the manchild in the womb.
