<p class="ith">Did Bloom accept the invitation to dinner given by the son and afterwards seconded by the father?</p>
<p> Very gratefully, appreciatively, sincerely, regretfully, he declined.</p>
<p class="ith">Did their conversation on the subject of these reminiscences
reveal a third connecting link between them?</p>
<p> Mrs Riordan, a widow of independent means, had resided in the house of
Stephen&apos;s parents from 1 September 1888 to 29 December 1891 and had also
resided during the years 1892, 1893 and 1894 in the City Arms Hotel owned by
Elizabeth O&apos;Dowd of 54 Prussia street where, during parts of the years 1893
and 1894, she had been a constant informant of Bloom who resided also in the
same hotel, being at that time a clerk in the employment of Joseph Cuffe of 5
Smithfield for the superintendence of sales in the adjacent Dublin Cattle market on the North Circular road.</p>
<p class="ith">Had he performed any special corporal work of mercy for her?</p>
<p> He had sometimes propelled her on warm summer evenings, an infirm widow of

<p class="ith">What distinct different memories had each of her now eight years deceased?</p>
<p> The older, her bezique cards and counters, her Skye terrier, her
suppositious wealth, her lapses of responsiveness
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">and

<br><font color="green">{u22, 634}</font>
<br> her green and maroon brushes for Parnell and for Michael Davitt, her tissue papers.</p>
<p class="ith">Were there no means still remaining to him to achieve the
rejuvenation which these reminiscences divulged to a younger companion rendered the more desirable?</p>
<p> The indoor exercises, formerly intermittently practised, subsequently
abandoned, prescribed in Eugen Sandow&apos;s <i>Physical Strength and How to
Obtain It</i> which, designed particularly for commercial men engaged in
sedentary occupations, were to be made with mental concentration in front of a
mirror so as to bring into play the various families of muscles and produce
successively a pleasant rigidity, a more pleasant relaxation and the most
pleasant repristination of juvenile agility.</p>
<p class="ith">Had any special agility been his in earlier youth?</p>
<p> Though ringweight lifting had been beyond his strength and the full circle
gyration beyond his courage yet as a High School scholar he had excelled in his
stable and protracted execution of the half lever movement on the parallel bars
in consequence of his abnormally developed abdominal muscles.

<p class="ith">Did either openly allude to their racial difference?</p>
<p> Neither.</p>
<p class="ith">What did Bloom think that Stephen thought about Bloom?</p>
<p> He thought that he thought that he was a jew whereas he knew that he knew that he knew that he was not.</p>
<p class="ith">What were their respective parentages?</p>
<p> Bloom, only male heir of Rudolf Virag (subsequently Rudolph Bloom) of
Szombath&eacute;ly, Milan, London and Dublin and of
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Margaret</span></span>
<font color="black">Ellen</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font>
Higgins, second daughter of Julius Higgins (born Karoly) and Fanny Higgins (born
Hegarty). Stephen, eldest surviving male heir of Simon Dedalus of Cork and
Dublin and of Mary, daughter of Richard and Christina Goulding (born Grier).
<br><font color="green">{u22, 635}</font> </p>
<p class="ith">Had Bloom and Stephen been baptised?</p>
<p> Bloom three times, by the reverend Mr Gilmer Johnston M.A., alone, in the
protestant church of Saint Nicholas Without, Coombe by James O&apos;Connor,
Philip Gilligan and James Fitzpatrick, together, under a pump in the village of
Swords, and by the reverend Charles Malone, C.C., in the church of the Three
Patrons, Rathgar. Stephen (once) by the reverend Charles Malone, C.C., alone, in
the church of the Three Patrons, Rathgar.</p>
<p class="ith">Did they find their educational careers similar?</p>
<p> Bloom had passed successively through a dame&apos;s school and the high school: Stephen through
<br><font color="green">{u21, 756}</font>
<br> the preparatory, junior, middle and senior grades of the intermediate and
through the matriculation, first arts, second arts and degree courses of the university.</p>
<p class="ith">Why did Bloom refrain from stating that he had frequented the university of life?</p>
<p> Because of his incertitude as to whether this observation had been already
made by him to Stephen or by Stephen to him.</p>
<p class="ith">What two temperaments did they individually represent?</p>
<p> The scientific. The artistic.</p>
<p class="ith">What proofs did Bloom adduce to prove that his tendency was
towards applied, rather than to pure, science?</p>
<p> Certain possible inventions of which he had cogitated when reclining on his
back in a state of repletion to aid digestion, stimulated by his appreciation of
the importance of inventions now common but once revolutionary, for example, the
parachute,
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black"><a name="un7030br" href="../../ff/unbs/un7all.htm#un7030br">the

the canal lock.</p>
<p class="ith">Were these inventions principally intended for an improved scheme of kindergarten?</p>
<p> Yes. They comprised astronomical kaleidoscopes exhibiting the twelve
<br><font color="green">{u22, 636}</font>
<br> constellations of the zodiac from Aries to Pisces, arithmetical gelatine
lozenges, geometrical to correspond to zoological biscuits, globemap playing balls, historically costumed dolls.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 757}</font> </p>
<p class="ith">What also stimulated him in his cogitations?</p>
<p> The financial success achieved by Ephraim Marks and Charles A. James, the
former by his 1d bazaar at 42 George&apos;s street, south, the latter at
6&frac12;d shop and world&apos;s fancy fair and waxwork exhibition at 30 Henry
Street, admission 6d, children 1d; and the infinite possibilities hitherto

Irish characters for gee, eh, dee, em, simple and modified, and Bloom in turn
wrote the Hebrew characters ghimel, aleph, daleth and (in the absence of mem) a
substituted qoph, explaining their arithmetical values of 3, 1, 4, and 100.

<p class="ith">Condense Stephen&apos;s commentary.</p>
<p> One of all, the least of all, is the victim predestined. Once by
inadvertence, twice by design he challenges his destiny. It comes when he is
abandoned and challenges him reluctant and, as an apparition of hope and youth,
holds him unresisting. It leads him to a strange habitation, to a secret infidel
apartment, and there, implacable, immolates him, consenting.</p>
<p class="ith">Why was the host silent?</p>
<p> He weighed the possible evidences for and against ritual murder: the
incitations of the hierarchy, the superstition of the populace, the envy of
opulence: the influence of retaliation, the sporadic reappearance of atavistic
delinquency, the mitigating circumstances of fanaticism, hypnotic suggestion and sonambulism.</p>
<p class="ith">Had this latter or any cognate phenomenon declared itself in any member of his family?</p>
<p> Twice, in Holles street and in Ontario terrace, his daughter Millicent
(Milly) at the ages of 6 and 8 years had uttered in sleep an exclamation of
terror and had replied to the interrogations of two figures in night attire with a vacant mute expression.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 646}</font> </p>
<p class="ith">What other infantile memories had he of her?</p>
<p> 15 June 1889. A querulous female infant crying to cause and lessen
congestion. A child renamed Padney Socks she shook with shocks her moneybox:
counted his three free buttons, one, tloo, tlee: a doll, a boy, a sailor she
threw away: blond, born of two dark, she had blond ancestry, remote, a
violation, Herr Hauptmann Hainau, Austrian army, proximate, a hallucination, lieutenant Mulvey, British navy.</p>
<p class="ith">What endemic characteristics were present?</p>
<p> Conversely the nasal and frontal formation was derived in a direct line of
lineage which, though interrupted, would continue at distant intervals to more
distant intervals to its most distant intervals.</p>
<p class="ith">What memories had he of her adolescence?</p>
<p> She relegated her

a recess. On the duke&apos;s lawn entreated by an English visitor she declined
to permit him to make and take away her photographic image. On the South
Circular road in the company of Elsa Potter, followed by an individual of
sinister aspect, she went half way down Stamer street and turned abruptly back.
On the vigil of the 15th anniversary of her birth she wrote a letter from Mullingar,

<p> Leaning she sustained her blond hair for him to ribbon it for her. On the
free surface of the lake in Stephen&apos;s green amid inverted reflections of
trees her uncommented spit, describing concentric circles of waterrings,
indicated by the constancy of its permanence the locus of a somnolent prostrate
fish. In order to remember the date, combatants, issue and consequences of a
famous military engagement she pulled a plait of her hair. Silly Milly, she
dreamed of having had an unspoken unremembered conversation with a horse whose
name had been Joseph to whom (which) she had offered a tumblerful of lemonade
which it (he) had appeared to have accepted.

<p class="ith">In what way had he utilised gifts given as matrimonial auguries to interest and to instruct her?</p>
<p> As object lessons to explain: 1) the nature and habits of oviparous animals,
the possibility of aerial flight, certain abnormalities of vision, the secular
process of imbalsamation: 2) the principle of the pendulum, exemplified in bob,
wheelgear and regulator, the translation in terms of human or social regulation
of the various positions of moveable indicators on an unmoving dial, the
exactitude of the recurrence per hour of an instant in each hour, when the
longer and the shorter indicator were at the same angle of inclination,
<i>videlicet</i>, 5 5&frasl;11 minutes past each hour per hour in arithmetical progression.</p>
<p class="ith">In what manners did she reciprocate?</p>
<p> She remembered: on the 27th anniversary of his birth she presented to him a
breakfast moustachecup of imitation crown Derby porcelain ware. She provided: at
quarter day or thereabouts if or when purchases had been made by him not for her
she showed herself attentive to his necessities, anticipating his desires. She
admired: a natural phenomenon having been explained by him to her she expressed
the immediate desire to possess without gradual acquisition a fraction of his
science, the moiety, the quarter, a thousandth part.

<p class="ith">What rendered problematic for Bloom the realisation of these mutually selfexcluding propositions?</p>
<p> The irreparability of the past: once at a performance of Albert
Hengler&apos;s circus in the Rotunda, Rutland square, Dublin an intuitive
particoloured clown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring to a
place in the auditorium where Bloom, solitary, was seated and had publicly
declared to an exhilarated audience that he (Bloom) was his (the clown&apos;s)
papa. The imprevidibility of the future: once in the summer of 1898 he (Bloom)
had marked a florin (2/-) with three notches on the milled edge and tendered it
in payment of an account due to and received by J. and T. Davy, family grocers,
1 Charlemont Mall, Grand Canal, for circulation on the waters of civic finance,
for possible, circuitous or direct, return.</p>

<p class="ith">Describe the alterations effected in the disposition of the articles of furniture.</p>
<p> A sofa upholstered in prune plush had been translocated from opposite the
door to the ingleside near the compactly furled Union Jack (an alteration which
he had frequently intended to execute), the blue and white checker inlaid
majolicatopped table had been placed opposite the door in the place vacated by
the prune plush sofa: the walnut sideboard (a projecting angle of which had
arrested his ingress) had been moved from its position beside the door to a more
advantageous but more perilous position in front of the door: two chairs had
been moved from right and left of the ingleside to the position originally
occupied by the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table.</p>
<p class="ith">Describe them.</p>
<p> One: a squat stuffed easychair, with stout arms extended and back slanted to
the rere, which repelled in recoil had upturned an irregular fringe of a
rectangular rug and displayed on its amply upholstered seat a centralised
diffusing and diminishing discolouration. The other: a slender splayfoot chair
of glossy cane curves, placed directly opposite the former, its frame from top
to seat and from seat to base being varnished dark brown, its seat being a bright circle of white plaited rush.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 784}</font> </p>
<p class="ith">What significances attached to these two chairs?</p>
<p> Significances of similitude, of posture, of symbolism, of circumstantial evidence, of testimonial supermanence.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 659}</font> </p>
<p class="ith">What occupied the position originally occupied by the sideboard?</p>
<p> A vertical piano (Cadby) with exposed keyboard, its closed coffin supporting
a pair of long yellow ladies&apos; gloves and an emerald ashtray containing four
consumed matches, a partly consumed cigarette and two discoloured ends of
cigarettes, its musicrest supporting the music in the key of G natural for voice
and piano of <i>Love&apos;s Old Sweet Song</i> (words by G. Clifton Bingham,
composed by J.L. Molloy, sung by Madam Antoinette Sterling) open at the last
page with the final indications ad libitum, forte, pedal, animato, sustained pedal, ritirando, close.</p>
<p class="ith">With what sensations did Bloom contemplate in rotation these objects?</p>
<p> With strain, elevating a candlestick: with pain feeling on his right temple
a contused tumescence: with attention, focussing his gaze on a large dull
passive and a slender bright active: with amusement, remembering Dr Malachi
Mulligan&apos;s scheme of colour containing the gradation of green: with
pleasure, repeating the words and antecedent act and perceiving through various
channels of internal sensibility the consequent and concomitant tepid pleasant diffusion of gradual discolouration.</p>
<p class="ith">His next proceeding?</p>
<p> From an open box on the majolicatopped table he extracted a black diminutive
cone, 1 inch in height, placed it on its circular base on a small tin plate,
placed his candlestick on the right corner of the mantelpiece, produced from his
waistcoat a folded typed letter, unfolded the folded letter, examined it
<br><font color="green">{u21, 785}</font>
<br> superficially, rolled it into a thin cylinder, ignited it in the
candleflame, applied it when ignited to the apex of the cone till the latter
reached the stage of rutilance, placed the cylinder in the basin of the
candlestick disposing its unconsumed part in such a manner as to facilitate total combustion.</p>

<p class="ith">What reflections occupied his mind during the process of reversion of the inverted volumes?</p>
<p> The necessity of order, a place for everything and everything in its place:
the deficient appreciation of literature possessed by females: the incongruity
of an apple incuneated in a tumbler and of an umbrella inclined in a closestool:
the insecurity of hiding any secret document behind, beneath or between the pages of a book.</p>
<p class="ith">Why, firstly and secondly, did he not consult the work in question?</p>
<p> Firstly, in order to exercise mnemotechnic: secondly, because after an
interval of amnesia, when, seated at the central table, about to consult the work
<br><font color="green">{u22, 663}</font>
<br> in question, he remembered by mnemotechnic the name of the military engagement, Plevna.</p>
<p class="ith">What caused him irritation in his sitting posture?</p>
<p> Inhibitory pressure of collar (size 17) and waistcoat (5 buttons),
<br><font color="green">{u21, 789}</font>
<br> two articles of clothing superfluous in the costume of mature males and
inelastic to alterations of mass by expansion.</p>
<p class="ith">How was the irritation allayed?</p>
<p> He removed his collar, with contained black necktie and collapsible stud,
from his neck to a position on the left of the table. He unbuttoned successively
in reversed direction waistcoat, trousers, shirt and vest along the medial line
of irregular incrispated black hairs extending in triangular convergence from
the pelvic basin over the circumference of the abdomen and umbilicular fossicle
along the medial line of nodes to the intersection of the sixth pectoral
vertebrae, thence produced both ways at right angles and terminating in circles
described about two equidistant points, right and left, on the summits of the mammary prominences.</p>
<p class="ith">What involuntary actions followed?</p>
<p> He compressed between 2 fingers the flesh circumjacent to a cicatrice in the
left infracostal region below the diaphragm resulting from a sting inflicted 2
weeks and 3 days previously (23 May 1904) by a bee. He scratched imprecisely
with his right hand, though insensible of prurition, various points and surfaces
of his partly exposed wholly abluted skin. He inserted his left hand into the
left lower pocket of his waistcoat and extracted and replaced a silver coin (1
shilling), placed there (presumably) on the occasion (10 October 1903) of the
interment of Mrs Emily Sinico, Sydney Parade.

<p class="ith">Did the process of disvestiture continue?</p>
<p> Sensible of a benignant persistent ache in his footsoles he extended his
foot to one side and observed the creases, protuberances and salient points
caused by foot pressure in the course of walking repeatedly in several different
directions, then, inclined, he disnoded the laceknots, unhooked and loosened the
laces, took off each of his two boots for the second time, detached the
partially moistened right sock through the fore part of which the nail of his
great toe had again effracted, raised his right and, having unhooked a purple
elastic sock suspender, took off his right sock, placed his unclothed right foot
on the margin of the seat of his chair, picked at and gently lacerated the
protruding part of the great toenail, raised the part lacerated to his nostrils
and inhaled the odour of the quick, then, with satisfaction, threw away the lacerated unghial fragment.

Dear Madam.</p>
<p class="ith">Quote the textual terms in which the prospectus claimed advantages for this remedy.</p>
<p> It heals and soothes while you sleep, in case of trouble in breaking wind,
assists nature in the most formidable way insuring instant relief in discharge
of gases, keeping parts clean and free natural action, an initial outlay of 7/6
making a new man of you and life worth living. Ladies find Wonderworker
especially useful, a pleasant surprise when they note delightful result like a cool drink of fresh spring water on
<br><font color="green">{u21, 803}</font>
<br> a sultry summer&apos;s day. Recommend it to your lady and gentlemen
friends, lasts a lifetime. Insert long round end. Wonderworker.</p>
<p class="ith">Were their testimonials?</p>
<p> Numerous. From clergyman, British Naval officer, wellknown author, city man,
hospital nurse, lady, mother of five, absentminded beggar.</p>
<p class="ith">How did absentminded beggar&apos;s testimonial conclude?</p>
<p> What a pity the government did not supply our men with wonderworkers during
the South African campaign! What a relief it would have been!</p>
<p class="ith">What object did Bloom add to this collection of objects?</p>
<p> A 4th typewritten letter received by Henry Flower from Martha Clifford.</p>
<p class="ith">What pleasant reflection accompanied this action?</p>
<p> The reflection that, apart from the letter in question, his face, form and
address had been favourably received during the course of the preceding day by a
wife (Mrs Josephine Breen, born Josie Powell), a nurse, Miss Callan (Christian
name unknown), a maid Gertrude, (Gerty), (family name unknown).
<br><font color="green">{u22, 675}</font> </p>
<p class="ith">What possibility suggested itself?</p>
<p> The possibility of exercising virile power of fascination in the not
immediate future after an expensive repast in a private apartment in the company
of an elegant courtesan, of corporal beauty, moderately mercenary, variously instructed, a lady by origin.</p>
<p class="ith">What did the 2nd drawer contain?</p>

<p class="ith">Quote the textual terms of this notice.</p>
<p> I, Rudolph Virag, now resident at n&deg; 52 Clanbrassil street, Dublin,
formerly of Szombathely in the kingdom of Hungary, hereby give
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">notice</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font>
that I have assumed and intend henceforth upon all occasions and at all times to
be known by the name of Rudolph Bloom.</p>
<p class="ith">What other objects relative to Rudolph Bloom (born Virag) were in the 2nd drawer?</p>
<p> An indistinct daguerrotype of Rudolph Virag and his father Leopold Virag
executed in the year 1852 in the portrait atelier of their (respectively) 1st
and 2nd cousin, Stefan Virag of Szesfehervar, Hungary. An ancient hagadah book
in which a pair of hornrimmed convex spectacles inserted marked the passage of
thanksgiving in the ritual prayers for Pessach (Passover): a photocard of the
Queen&apos;s Hotel, Ennis, proprietor, Rudolph Bloom: an envelope addressed: <i>To My Dear Son Leopold</i>.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 676}</font> </p>
<p class="ith">What reminiscences did these objects evoke in Bloom?</p>
<p> An old man, widower, unkempt of hair, in bed, with head covered, sighing: an
infirm dog, Athos: veronal, resorted to by increasing doses of grains and
scruples as a palliative of recrudescent neuralgia: the face in death of a

suicide by poison.</p>
<p class="ith">Why did Bloom experience a sentiment of remorse?</p>
<p> Because in immature impatience he had treated with disrespect certain beliefs and practices.</p>
<p class="ith">As?</p>
<p> The prohibition of the use of fleshmeat and milk at one meal: the
circumcision of male infants: the supernatural character of Judaic scripture: the sanctity of the sabbath.</p>
<p class="ith">How did these beliefs and practices now appear to him?</p>
<p> Not more rational than they had then appeared, not less rational than other beliefs and practices now appeared.</p>
<p class="ith">What first reminiscence had he of Rudolph Bloom (deceased)?</p>
<p> Rudolph Bloom (deceased) narrated to his son Leopold Bloom (aged 6) a
retrospective arrangement of migrations and settlements in and between Dublin,
London, Florence, Milan, Szombathely with statements of satisfaction (his grandfather having
<br><font color="green">{u21, 806}</font>
<br> seen Maria Theresia, empress of Austria, queen of Hungary), with commercial
advice (having taken care of pence, the pounds having taken care of themselves).
Leopold Bloom (aged 6) had accompanied this narrations by constant consultation of a geographical map
<br><font color="green">{u22, 677}</font>
<br> of Europe (political) and by suggestions for the establishment of
affiliated business premises in the various centres mentioned.</p>
<p class="ith">Had time equally but differently obliterated the memory of these migrations in narrator and listener?</p>
<p> In narrator by the access of years and in consequence of the use of narcotic
toxin: in listener by the access of years and in consequence of the action of
distraction upon vicarious experiences.</p>
<p class="ith">What idiosyncracies of the narrator were concomitant products of amnesia?</p>
<p> Occasionally he ate without having previously removed his hat. Occasionally
he drank voraciously the juice of gooseberry fool from an inclined plate.
Occasionally he removed from his lips the traces of food by means of a lacerated
envelope or other fragment of paper.</p>
<p class="ith">What two phenomena
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black"><a name="un7028ac" href="../../ff/unbs/un7all.htm#un7028ac">of
senescence</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font> were more frequent?</p>
<p> The myopic digital calculation of coins, eructation consequent upon repletion.</p>
<p class="ith">What object offered partial consolation for these reminiscences?</p>
<p> The endowment policy, the bank passbook, the certificate of the possession of scrip.</p>
<p class="ith">From what reverse of fortune did these supports protect their possessor?</p>
<p> Mendicancy: that of the sandwichman, distributor of throwaways, nocturnal
vagrant, maimed sailor, blind stripling, bailiff&apos;s man. Poverty: that of the
<br><font color="green">{u21, 807}</font>

nightshirt, removed a pillow from the head to the foot of the bed, prepared the
bedlinen accordingly and entered the bed.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 683}</font> </p>
<p class="ith">How?</p>
<p> With circumspection, as invariably when entering an abode (his own or not
his own): with solicitude, the snakespiral springs of the mattress being old,
the brass quoits and pendent viper radii loose and tremulous under stress and
strain: prudently, as entering a lair or ambush of lust or adders: lightly, the
less to disturb: reverently, the bed of conception and birth, of consummation of
marriage and breach of marriage, of sleep, of death.</p>
<p class="ith">What did his limbs when gradually extended encounter?</p>
<p> New clean bedlinen, additional odours, the presence of a human form, female,
hers, the imprint of a human form, male, not his, some crumbs, some flakes of
potted meat, recooked, which he removed.</p>
<p class="ith">If he had smiled why would he have smiled?</p>
<p> To reflect that each one who enters imagines himself to be the first to

<p class="ith">Jealousy?</p>
<p> Because a nature full and volatile, in her free state, was alternately the
agent and reagent of attraction. Because attraction between agents and reagents
at all instants varied, with inverse proportion of increase and decrease, with
incessant circular extension and radial reentrance. Because the controlled
contemplation of the fluctuation of attraction produced, if desired, a fluctuation of pleasure.</p>

<p> As not so calamitous as a cataclysmic annihilation of the planet in
consequence of a collision with a dark sun. As less reprehensible than theft,
highway robbery, cruelty to children and animals, obtaining money under false
pretences, forgery, embezzlement, misappropriation of public money, betrayal of
public trust, malingering, mayhem, corruption of minors, criminal liber,

<p> Negative: he omitted to mention the clandestine correspondence between
Martha Clifford and Henry Flower, the public altercation at, in and in the
vicinity of the licensed premises of Bernard Kiernan and Co, Limited, 8, 9 and
10 Little Britain street, the erotic provocation and response thereto caused by
the exhibitionism of Gertrude (Gerty), surname unknown. Positive: he included
mention of a performance by Mrs Bandmann Palmer of <i>Leah</i> at the Gaiety
Theatre, South Anne street, an invitation to supper at Wynn&apos;s
(Murphy&apos;s) Hotel 35, 36 and 37 Lower Abbey street, a temporary concussion
caused by a falsely calculated movement in the course of a postcenal gymnastic
display, the victim (since completely recovered) being Stephen Dedalus,
professor and author, eldest surviving son of Simon Dedalus, of no fixed occupation.</p>

<p> By the listener a limitation of fertility inasmuch as marriage have been
celebrated 2 calendar months after the 18th anniversary of her birth (8
September 1870), viz, 8 October, and consummated on the same
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">date</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font>
with female issue born 15 June 1889, having been anticipatorily consummated on
the 10 September of the same year and complete carnal intercourse, with
ejaculation of semen within the female natural organ, having taken place 5 weeks
previous, viz, 27 November 1894, to the birth on 29 December 1894 of second (and
only male) issue, deceased 9 January 1895, aged 11 days, there remained a period
of 9 years, 5 months and 18 days during which carnal intercourse had been
incomplete, without ejaculation of semen within the natural female organ. By the
narrator a limitation of activity, mental and
<br><font color="green">{u22, 688}</font>
<br> corporal, inasmuch as complete mental intercourse between himself and the
listener had not taken place since the consummation of puberty, indicated by
catamenic hemorrhage, of the female issue of narrator and listener, 15 September
1903, there remained a period of 9 months and 1 day during which, in consequence
of a preestablished natural comprehension in incomprehension between the
consummated females (listener and issue), complete corporal liberty of action had been circumscribed.</p>
<p class="ith">How?</p>
<p> By various reiterated interrogation concerning the destination whither, the
place where, the time at which, the duration for which, the object with which in
the case of temporary absences, projected or effected.</p>
<p class="ith">What moved visibly above the listener&apos;s and the narrator&apos;s invisible thoughts?</p>
<p> The upcast reflection of a lamp and shade, an inconstant series of
concentric circles of varying gradations of light and shadow.

<p class="ith">In what state of rest or motion?</p>
<p> At rest relatively to themselves and to each other. In motion being each and
both carried westward, forward and rereward respectively, by the proper
perpetual motion of the earth through everchanging tracks of neverchanging space.</p>
<p class="ith">In what posture?</p>
<p> Listener: reclined semilaterally, left, left hand under head, right leg
extended in a straight line and resting on left leg, flexed, in the attitude of
Gea-Tellus, fulfilled, recumbent, big with seed. Narrator: reclined laterally,
left, with right and left legs flexed, the index and thumb of the right hand
resting on the bridge of the nose, in the attitude depicted in a snapshot
photograph made by Percy Apjohn, the childman weary, the manchild in the womb.
