<p class="ith">What
<a name="un5024bq" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5024bq">parallel</a> courses
did Bloom and Stephen follow returning?</p>

pace from Beresford place<a target="foot" id="fss0001">&ordm;</a> they followed
in the order named Lower and Middle Gardiner streets and Mountjoy square, west:
then, at reduced pace, each bearing left, Gardiner&apos;s place by an
inadvertence as far as the farther corner of Temple street, north:
then<a target="foot" id="fss0002">&ordm;</a>, at reduced pace with interruptions
of halt, bearing right, Temple street, north, as far as Hardwicke place.
<a name="un7028ab" href="../../ff/unbs/un7all.htm#un7028ab">Approaching,
disparate,</a> at
<a name="un5002c" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5002c">relaxed</a> walking
pace they crossed both the circus before George&apos;s church diametrically, the
chord in any circle being less than
<a name="s17048i" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17048i">the arc</a> which it subtends.</p>
<p class="ith">Of what did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary?</p>
<p> Music, literature, Ireland, Dublin, Paris, friendship, woman, prostitution,
diet, <a name="s17035ac" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17035ac">the influence
of gaslight or the light of</a>

education, careers, the study of medicine, the past
day,<a target="foot" id="fss0003">&ordm;</a> the maleficent influence of the presabbath, Stephen&apos;s collapse.</p>
<p class="ith">Did Bloom discover common factors of similarity between their
respective <a name="s17051e" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17051e">like and unlike</a> reactions to experience?</p>
<p> Both were sensitive to artistic
impressions,<a target="foot" id="fss0004">&ordm;</a> musical in preference to
<a name="s17017n" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17017n">plastic</a> or
pictorial. Both preferred a
<a name="s17016i" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17016i">continental</a> to an
insular manner of life,
<a name="un7030i" href="../../ff/unbs/un7all.htm#un7030i">a cisatlantic to a
transatlantic</a> place of residence. Both indurated by early domestic training
and an inherited tenacity of heterodox resistance professed their disbelief in
many orthodox religious<a target="foot" id="fss0005">&ordm;</a>, national,
social and ethical doctrines. Both admitted the
<a name="s17028q" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17028q">alternately</a>
stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual magnetism. </p>
<p class="ith">Were their views on some points divergent?</p>
<p> Stephen dissented openly from Bloom&apos;s views on the importance of
dietary and civic selfhelp while Bloom dissented tacitly from Stephen&apos;s
views on the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature. Bloom
assented<a target="foot" id="fss0006">&ordm;</a> covertly to Stephen&apos;s
rectification of the anachronism involved in assigning the date of the
conversion of the Irish nation to christianity from druidism by
<a name="un7028v" href="../../ff/unbs/un7all.htm#un7028v">Patrick</a> son of
Calpornus, son of Potitus, son of Odyssus, sent by pope Celestine I

the reign of Leary to the year 260 or thereabouts

MacArt (&dagger; 266

suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at Sletty and interred at
Rossnaree. The collapse which Bloom ascribed to gastric inanition and certain
chemical compounds of varying degrees of adulteration and alcoholic strength,
<a name="un4049aj" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4049aj">accelerated</a> by
mental exertion and the velocity of rapid circular motion in a
<a name="un5002c" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5002c">relaxing</a>
atmosphere, Stephen attributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud
(<a name="s17008b" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17008b">perceived by both</a>
from two different points of observation, Sandycove and
Dublin)<a target="foot" id="fss0008">&ordm;</a> at first no bigger than a woman&apos;s hand.</p>
<p class="ith">Was there one point on which their views were equal and negative?</p>
<p> The influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of
<a name="un5024cp" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5024cp">adjoining</a> paraheliotropic trees.</p>
<p class="ith">Had Bloom discussed similar subjects during nocturnal perambulations in the past?</p>
<p> In 1884 with Owen Goldberg and Cecil Turnbull
<a name="un4033u" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4033u">at night</a>
<a name="un5024cq" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5024cq">on public
thoroughfares</a>
<a name="un4033u" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4033u">between Longwood
avenue and Leonard&apos;s corner and Leonard&apos;s corner and Synge street and
Synge street</a> and
<a name="un4049bl" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4049bl">Bloomfield
avenue</a><a target="foot" id="fss0009">&ordm;</a>. In 1885 with Percy Apjohn in
the evenings, reclined against the wall between Gibraltar villa and Bloomfield
house in Crumlin, barony of Uppercross. In 1886
occasionally<a target="foot" id="fss0010">&ordm;</a> with casual acquaintances
and prospective purchasers on doorsteps, in front parlours, in third class
railway carriages of suburban lines. In 1888 frequently with major Brian Tweedy
and his daughter Miss Marion Tweedy, together and separately on the lounge in
Matthew Dillon&apos;s house in Roundtown. Once in 1892 and once in 1893 with
Julius<a target="foot" id="fss0011">&ordm;</a> Mastiansky, on both occasions in
the parlour of his (Bloom&apos;s) house in Lombard street, west.</p>
<p class="ith">What reflection concerning the irregular
<a name="un7030e" href="../../ff/unbs/un7all.htm#un7030e">sequence</a> of dates
1884, 1885, 1886, 1888, 1892, 1893, 1904 did Bloom make before their arrival at their destination? </p>
<p> He reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual
development and experience was regressively accompanied by a restriction of
<a name="un7029u" href="../../ff/unbs/un7all.htm#un7029u">the converse domain of interindividual relations</a>.</p>
<p class="ith">As in what ways?</p>
<p> <a name="un7029cm" href="../../ff/unbs/un7all.htm#un7029cm">From inexistence
to existence he came to many and was as one received: existence with existence
he was with any as any with any: from existence to nonexistence gone he would be by all as none perceived.</a></p>
<p class="ith">What action<a target="foot" id="fss0012">&ordm;</a> did Bloom
make on their arrival at their destination?</p>
<p> At the housesteps of the 4th of the
<a name="s17043h" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17043h">equidifferent</a>
<a name="s17025as" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17025as">uneven numbers</a>,
number 7 Eccles street, he inserted his hand mechanically into the back pocket
of his trousers to obtain his latchkey.</p>
<p class="ith">Was it there?</p>
<p> It was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn on the day but one preceding.</p>
<p class="ith">Why was he doubly irritated?</p>
<p> Because he had forgotten and because he remembered that
<a name="s17007ac" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17007ac">he had reminded himself twice not to forget</a>.</p>
<p class="ith">What were then the
alternatives<a target="foot" id="fss0013">&ordm;</a> before the, premeditatedly
(respectively) and inadvertently, keyless couple?</p>
<p> To enter or not to enter. To knock or not to knock.</p>
<p class="ith">Bloom&apos;s decision?</p>
<p> A stratagem. Resting his feet on
<a name="un5024dc" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5024dc">the dwarf wall</a>,
he climbed over the area
<a name="un5024dc" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5024dc">railings</a>,
compressed his hat on his head, grasped two points at the lower union of
<a name="un5024cv" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5024cv">rails and
stiles</a>, lowered his body gradually by its length of five feet nine inches
and a half to within two feet ten inches of the area
pavement<a target="foot" id="fss0014">&ordm;</a> and allowed his body to move
freely in space by separating himself from the railings and crouching
<a name="un4049bf" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4049bf">in preparation for the impact of the fall</a>.</p>
<p class="ith">Did he fall?</p>
<p> By his
<a name="s17025be" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17025be">body&apos;s
known</a> weight of eleven stone and four pounds in
<a name="s17030ar" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17030ar">avoirdupois</a>

a lucifer match by friction, set free inflammable coal gas by turning on the

<a name="un5024cd" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5024cd">quiescent</a>
candescence and lit finally a portable candle.</p>
<p class="ith">What
<a name="un7028ap" href="../../ff/unbs/un7all.htm#un7028ap">discrete succession
of images</a> did Stephen meanwhile perceive?</p>
<p> Reclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparent
kitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame
<a name="un7030ci" href="../../ff/unbs/un7all.htm#un7030ci">of 14 CP</a>, a man
lighting a candle of 1 CP<a target="foot" id="fss0020">&ordm;</a>, a man
removing in turn each of his two boots, a man leaving the kitchen holding a
candle<a target="foot" id="fss0021">&ordm;</a>.</p>
<p class="ith">Did the man reappear elsewhere?</p>
<p> After a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible
through the semitransparent semicircular glass
<a name="s17011i" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17011i">fanlight</a> over the
halldoor. The halldoor turned gradually on its hinges. In the open space of the
doorway the man reappeared without his hat, with his candle.</p>
<p class="ith">Did Stephen obey his sign?</p>
<p> Yes, entering softly, he helped to close and chain the door and followed
softly along the hallway the man&apos;s back and
<a name="s17043q" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17043q">listed feet</a> and
lighted candle past a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and carefully down
a turning staircase of more than five steps into the kitchen of Bloom&apos;s house.</p>
<p class="ith">What did Bloom do?</p>
<p> He extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its flame,
drew two <a name="un4049e" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4049e">spoonseat
deal chairs</a> <a name="s17033d" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17033d">to the
hearthstone</a>, one for Stephen with its back to the area window, the other for
himself when necessary, knelt on one knee,
<a name="s17041bn" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17041bn">composed in the
grate a pyre of crosslaid resintipped sticks and various coloured papers</a> and

one ignited lucifer match, thereby releasing the potential energy contained in
the fuel by allowing its carbon and hydrogen elements to enter into
<a name="s17025ac" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17025ac">free union</a> with the oxygen of the air.</p>
<p class="ith">Of what similar apparitions did Stephen think?</p>
<p> Of others elsewhere in other times who, kneeling on one knee or on two, had
kindled fires for him, of Brother Michael in the infirmary of the college of the
Society of Jesus at Clongowes Wood, Sallins, in the county of Kildare: of his
father, Simon Dedalus, in an unfurnished room of his first residence in Dublin,
number thirteen Fitzgibbon street: of his godmother Miss Kate Morkan in the
house of her dying sister Miss Julia Morkan at 15 Usher&apos;s Island: of his
mother Mary, wife of Simon Dedalus, in<a target="foot" id="fss0022">&ordm;</a>
the kitchen of number twelve North Richmond street on the morning of the feast
of Saint Francis Xavier<a target="foot" id="fss0023">&ordm;</a> 1898: of the
dean of studies, Father Butt, in the physics&apos; theatre of university
College, 16 Stephen&apos;s Green, north<a target="foot" id="fss0024">&ordm;</a>:
of his sister Dilly (Delia) in his father&apos;s house in Cabra.</p>
<p class="ith">What did Stephen see on raising his gaze to the height of a yard
from the fire towards the opposite wall?</p>
<p> Under a row of five
<a name="s17016ak" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17016ak">coiled spring

<a name="s17033ae" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17033ae">from which hung four

<p class="ith">What did Bloom see on the range?</p>
<p> On the right (smaller) hob a blue enamelled

left (larger) hob a black iron kettle.</p>
<p class="ith">What did Bloom do at the range?<a target="foot" id="fss0025">&ordm;</a></p>
<p> He removed the saucepan to the left hob, rose and carried the iron kettle to
the sink in order to

<p> Reminiscences of

truth stranger than fiction, preindicative of the result of the Gold Cup flat

 inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the secret of
the race, graven in the language of prediction.</p>
<p class="ith">What qualifying considerations allayed his perturbations?</p>
<p> The difficulties of interpretation since the significance of any event
followed its occurrence as variably as
<a name="s17026v" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17026v">the acoustic

losses proceeding originally from a successful interpretation.</p>
<p class="ith">His mood?</p>
<p> He had not risked, he did not expect, he had not been disappointed, he was satisfied.</p>
<p class="ith">What satisfied him?</p>
<p> <a name="s17024aa" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17024aa">To have

<p class="ith">Why did Bloom refrain from stating that he had frequented the university of life?</p>
<p> Because of his fluctuating incertitude as to whether

had</a> or had not
<a name="s17007as" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17007as">been already made by

<p class="ith">What two temperaments did they individually represent?</p>
<p> The scientific. The artistic.</p>
<p class="ith">What proofs did Bloom adduce to prove that his tendency was
towards applied, rather than towards pure, science?</p>
<p> Certain possible inventions
<a name="s17030l" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17030l">of which he had
cogitated when reclining</a> in a state of supine repletion to aid digestion,
stimulated by his appreciation of the importance of inventions now common but
once revolutionary, for example, the aeronautic parachute,

telescope</a>, the spiral

<p> One of all, the least of all, is the victim predestined. Once by
inadvertence, twice by design he challenges his destiny. It comes when he is
abandoned and challenges him reluctant and, as an apparition of hope and youth,
holds him unresisting. It leads him to a strange habitation, to a secret infidel
apartment, and there, implacable, immolates him, consenting.</p>
<p class="ith">Why was the host (victim predestined) sad?</p>
<p> <a name="s17045m" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17045m">He wished that a

suggestion and somnambulism<a target="foot" id="fss0163">&ordm;</a>.</p>
<p class="ith">From which (if any) of these mental or physical disorders was he not totally immune?</p>
<p> From hypnotic suggestion: once, waking, he had not recognised his sleeping
apartment: more than once, waking, he had been for an indefinite time incapable
of moving or uttering sounds. From
somnambulism<a target="foot" id="fss0164">&ordm;</a>: once, sleeping, his body
had risen, crouched and crawled in the direction of a heatless fire and, having
attained its destination, there, curled, unheated, in night attire had lain, sleeping.</p>
<p class="ith">Had this latter or any cognate phenomenon declared itself in any member of his family?</p>
<p> Twice, in Holles street and in Ontario terrace, his daughter Millicent
(Milly) at the ages of 6 and 8 years had uttered in sleep an exclamation of
terror and had replied to the interrogations of two figures in night attire with a vacant mute expression. </p>

<p class="ith">He remembered the initial paraphenomena?</p>
<p> More active air, a matutinal distant cock, ecclesiastical clocks at various
