assigning the date of the conversion of the Irish nation to christianity from
druidism by Patrick son of Calpornus, son of Potitus, son of Odyssus, sent by

suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at Sletty and interred at
Rossnaree. The collapse which Bloom ascribed to gastric inanition and certain
chemical compounds of varying degrees of adulteration and alcoholic strength,
accelerated by mental exertion and the velocity of rapid circular motion in a
relaxing atmosphere, Stephen attributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud

Dublin)<font color="red"><sup><small>(u22</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><a target="foot" id="fss0008">&ordm;</a><font color="red"><sup><small>u21)</small></sup></font>

<p> The influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees.</p>
<p class="ith">Had Bloom discussed similar subjects during nocturnal perambulations in the past?</p>

separately on the lounge in Matthew Dillon&apos;s house in Roundtown. Once in
1892 and once in 1893 with Julius Mastiansky, on both occasions in the parlour
of his (Bloom&apos;s) house in Lombard street, west.</p>
<p class="ith">What reflection concerning the irregular sequence of dates 1884,
1885, 1886, 1888, 1892, 1893, 1904 did Bloom make before their arrival at their destination?
<br><font color="green">{u22, 621}</font> </p>
<p> He reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual
development and experience was regressively accompanied by a restriction of the
converse domain of interindividual relations.</p>
<p class="ith">As in what ways?</p>
<p> From inexistence to existence he came to many and was as one received:
existence with existence he was with any as any with any: from existence to
nonexistence gone he would be by all as none perceived.</p>
<p class="ith">What
<font color="red"><sup><small>(u22</small></sup></font>action<a target="foot" id="fss0012">&ordm;</a><font color="red"><sup><small>u21)</small></sup></font>
did Bloom make on their arrival at their destination?</p>
<p> At the housesteps of the 4th of the equidifferent uneven numbers, number 7
Eccles street, he inserted his hand mechanically into the back pocket of his trousers to obtain his latchkey.</p>
<p class="ith">Was it there?</p>
<p> It was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn on the day but one preceding.</p>
<p class="ith">Why was he doubly irritated?</p>
<p> Because he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had reminded himself twice not to forget.</p>
<p class="ith">What were then the alternatives before the, premeditatedly
(respectively) and inadvertently, keyless couple?</p>
<p> To enter or not to enter. To knock or not to knock.</p>
<p class="ith">Bloom&apos;s decision?</p>
<p> A stratagem. Resting his feet on the dwarf wall, he climbed over the area
railings, compressed his hat on his head, grasped two points at the lower union
of rails and stiles, lowered his body gradually by its length of five feet nine
inches and a half to within two feet ten inches of the area
pavement<font color="red"><sup><small>(u22</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><a target="foot" id="fss0014">&ordm;</a><font color="red"><sup><small>u21)</small></sup></font>
and allowed his body to move freely in space by separating himself from the
railings and crouching in preparation for the impact of the fall.</p>
<p class="ith">Did he fall?</p>

<p class="ith">What discrete succession of images did Stephen meanwhile perceive?</p>
<p> Reclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparent
kitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame of 14 CP, a man lighting a candle
<font color="red"><sup><small>(u22</small></sup></font>of 1

<p class="ith">Did the man reappear elsewhere?</p>
<p> After a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible
through the semitransparent semicircular glass fanlight over the halldoor. The
halldoor turned gradually on its hinges. In the open space of the doorway the
man reappeared without his hat, with his candle.</p>
<p class="ith">Did Stephen obey his sign?</p>
<p> Yes, entering softly, he helped to close and chain the door and followed
softly along the hallway the man&apos;s back and listed feet and lighted candle
past a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and carefully down a turning
staircase of more than five steps into the kitchen of Bloom&apos;s house.</p>
<p class="ith">What did Bloom do?</p>
<p> He extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its flame,
drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone, one for Stephen with its back
to the area window, the other for himself when necessary, knelt on one knee,
composed in the grate a pyre of crosslaid resintipped sticks and various
coloured papers and irregular polygons of best Abram coal at twentyone shillings

lucifer match, thereby releasing the potential energy contained in the fuel by
allowing its carbon and hydrogen elements to enter into free union with the oxygen of the air.</p>
<p class="ith">Of what similar apparitions did Stephen think?</p>
<p> Of others elsewhere in other times who, kneeling on one knee or on two, had
kindled fires for him, of Brother Michael in the infirmary of the college of the
Society of Jesus at Clongowes Wood, Sallins, in the county of Kildare: of his
father, Simon Dedalus, in an unfurnished room of his first residence in Dublin,
number thirteen Fitzgibbon street: of his godmother Miss Kate Morkan in the
house of her dying sister Miss Julia Morkan at 15 Usher&apos;s Island: of his

university College, 16 Stephen&apos;s Green, north: of his sister Dilly (Delia) in his father&apos;s house in Cabra.</p>
<p class="ith">What did Stephen see on raising his gaze to the height of a yard
from the fire towards the opposite wall?</p>
<p> Under a row of five coiled spring housebells a curvilinear rope, stretched
between two holdfasts athwart across the recess beside the chimney pier, from
which hung four smallsized square handkerchiefs folded unattached consecutively
in adjacent rectangles and one pair of ladies&apos; grey hose with Lisle
suspender tops and feet in their habitual position clamped by three erect wooden
pegs two at their outer extremities and the third at their point of junction.</p>
<p class="ith"></p>
<p class="ith">What did Bloom see on the range?</p>
<p> On the right (smaller) hob a blue enamelled saucepan: on the left (larger) hob a black iron kettle.</p>
<p class="ith">What did Bloom do at the range?</p>
<p> He removed the saucepan to the left hob, rose and carried the iron kettle to
the sink in order to tap the current by turning the faucet to let it flow.</p>

surveyor and waterworks engineer, Mr Spencer Harty, C.E., on the instructions of

<p class="ith">Having set the halffilled kettle on the now burning coals, why did he return to the stillflowing tap?</p>
<p> To wash his soiled hands with a partially consumed tablet of
Barrington&apos;s lemonflavoured soap, to which paper still adhered (bought
thirteen hours previously for fourpence and still unpaid for), in fresh cold
neverchanging everchanging water and dry them, face and hands, in a long
redbordered holland cloth passed over a wooden revolving roller.</p>
<p class="ith">What reason did Stephen give for declining Bloom&apos;s offer?</p>
<p> That he was hydrophobe, hating partial contact by immersion or total by
submersion in cold water (his last bath having taken place in the month of
<br><font color="green">{u22, 626}</font>
<br> October of the preceding year), disliking the aqueous substances of glass
and crystal, distrusting aquacities of thought and language.</p>
<p class="ith">What impeded Bloom from giving Stephen counsels of hygiene and
prophylactic to which should be added suggestions concerning a preliminary
wetting of the head and contraction of the muscles with rapid splashing of the
face and neck and thoracic and epigastric region in case of sea or river
bathing, the parts of the human anatomy most sensitive to cold being the nape, stomach and thenar or sole of foot?</p>
<p> The incompatibility of aquacity with the erratic originality of genius.</p>
<p class="ith">What additional didactic counsels did he similarly repress?</p>
<p> Dietary: concerning the respective percentage of protein and caloric energy
in bacon, salt ling and butter, the absence of the former in the lastnamed and
the abundance of the latter in the firstnamed.</p>
<p class="ith">Which seemed to the host to be the predominant qualities of his guest?</p>
<p> Confidence in himself, an equal and opposite power of abandonment and recuperation.</p>
<p class="ith">What concomitant phenomenon took place in the vessel of liquid by the agency of fire?</p>
<p> The phenomenon of ebullition. Fanned by a constant updraught of ventilation
between the kitchen and the chimneyflue, ignition was communicated from the
faggots of precombustible fuel to polyhedral masses of bituminous coal,
containing in compressed mineral form the foliated fossilised decidua of
primeval forests which had in turn derived their vegetative existence from the
sun, primal source of heat (radiant), transmitted through omnipresent
luminiferous diathermanous ether. Heat (convected), a mode of motion developed
by such combustion, was constantly and increasingly conveyed from the
<font color="red"><sup><small>(u22</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">course</span></span>
source<a target="foot" id="fss0048">&ordm;</a><font color="red"><sup><small>u21)</small></sup></font>
of calorification to the liquid contained in the vessel, being radiated through
the uneven unpolished dark surface of the metal iron, in part reflected, in part
absorbed, in part transmitted, gradually raising the temperature of the water
from normal to boiling point, a rise in temperature expressible as the result of
an expenditure of 72 thermal units needed to raise 1 pound of water from 50&deg; to 212&deg; Fahrenheit.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 627}</font> </p>
<p class="ith">What announced the accomplishment of this rise in temperature?</p>
<p> A double falciform ejection of water vapour from under the kettlelid at both sides simultaneously.</p>
<p class="ith">For what personal purpose could Bloom have applied the water so boiled?</p>
<p> To shave himself.</p>
<p class="ith">What advantages attended shaving by night?</p>
<p> A softer beard: a softer brush if intentionally allowed to remain from shave
to shave in its agglutinated lather: a softer skin if unexpectedly encountering
female acquaintances in remote places at incustomary hours: quiet reflections
upon the course of the day: a cleaner sensation when awaking after a fresher
sleep since matutinal noises, premonitions and perturbations, a clattered
milkcan, a postman&apos;s double knock, a paper read, reread while lathering,
relathering the same spot, a shock, a shoot, with thought of aught he sought
though fraught with nought might cause a faster rate of shaving and a nick on
which incision plaster with precision cut and humected and applied
adhered<font color="red"><sup><small>(u22</small></sup></font>:<a target="foot" id="fss0049">&ordm;</a><font color="red"><sup><small>u21)</small></sup></font>
which was to be done.</p>
<p class="ith">Why did absence of light disturb him less than presence of noise?</p>
<p> Because of the surety of the sense of touch in his firm full masculine feminine passive active hand.</p>
<p class="ith">What quality did it (his hand) possess but with what counteracting influence?</p>
<p> The operative surgical quality but that he was reluctant to shed human blood
even when the end justified the means, preferring, in their natural order,
heliotherapy, psychophysicotherapeutics, osteopathic surgery.</p>

<p> Four polygonal fragments of two lacerated scarlet betting tickets, numbered 8 87, 8 86.</p>
<p class="ith">What reminiscences temporarily corrugated his brow?</p>
<p> Reminiscences of coincidences, truth stranger than fiction, preindicative of
the result of the Gold Cup flat handicap, the official and definitive result of
which he had read in the <i>Evening Telegraph</i>, late pink edition, in the cabman&apos;s shelter, at Butt bridge.</p>
<p class="ith">Where had previous intimations of the result, effected or projected, been received by him?</p>
<p> In Bernard Kiernan&apos;s licensed premises 8, 9 and 10 Little Britain
street: in David Byrne&apos;s licensed premises, 14 Duke street: in

Sweny and Co (Limited), dispensing chemists, when, when Frederick M. (Bantam)
Lyons had rapidly and successively requested, perused and restituted the copy of
the current issue of the <i>Freeman&apos;s Journal</i> and <i>National Press</i>
which he had been about to throw away (subsequently thrown away), he had
proceeded towards the oriental edifice of the Turkish and Warm Baths, 11 Leinster street, with the light of
<br><font color="green">{u22, 629}</font>
<br> inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the secret
of the race, graven in the language of prediction.</p>
<p class="ith">What qualifying considerations allayed his perturbations?</p>
<p> The difficulties of interpretation since the significance of any event
followed its occurrence as variably as the acoustic report followed the
electrical discharge and of counterestimating against an actual loss by failure
to interpret the total sum of possible losses proceeding originally from a successful interpretation.</p>
<p class="ith">His mood?</p>
<p> He had not risked, he did not expect, he had not been disappointed, he was satisfied.</p>
<p class="ith">What satisfied him?</p>
<p> To have sustained no positive loss. To have brought a positive gain to others. Light to the gentiles.</p>
<p class="ith">How did Bloom prepare a collation for a gentile?</p>
<p> He poured into two teacups two level spoonfuls, four in all, of Epps&apos;s
soluble cocoa and proceeded according to the directions for use printed on the
label, to each adding after sufficient time for infusion the prescribed
ingredients for diffusion in the manner and in the quantity prescribed.</p>
<p class="ith">What supererogatory marks of special hospitality did the host show his guest?</p>
<p> Relinquishing his symposiarchal right to the moustache cup of imitation
Crown Derby presented to him by his only daughter, Millicent (Milly), he
substituted a cup identical with that of his guest and served extraordinarily to
his guest and, in reduced measure, to
himself<font color="red"><sup><small>(u22</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><a target="foot" id="fss0060">&ordm;</a><font color="red"><sup><small>u21)</small></sup></font>
the viscous cream ordinarily reserved for the breakfast of his wife Marion (Molly).</p>
<p class="ith">Was the guest conscious of and did he acknowledge these marks of hospitality?</p>
<p> His attention was directed to them by his host jocosely and he accepted them
seriously as they drank in jocoserious silence Epps&apos;s massproduct, the creature cocoa.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 630}</font> </p>
<p class="ith">Were there marks of hospitality which he contemplated but
suppressed, reserving them for another and for himself on future occasions to complete the act begun?</p>
<p> The reparation of a fissure of the length of 1&frac12; inches in the right
side of his guest&apos;s jacket. A gift to his guest of one of the four
lady&apos;s handkerchiefs, if and when ascertained to be in a presentable condition.</p>
<p class="ith">Who drank more quickly?</p>
<p> Bloom, having the advantage of ten seconds at the initiation and taking,
from the concave surface of a spoon along the handle of which a steady flow of
heat was conducted, three sips to his opponent&apos;s one, six to two, nine to three.</p>
<p class="ith">What cerebration accompanied his frequentative act?</p>
<p> Concluding by inspection but erroneously that his silent companion was
engaged in mental composition he reflected on the pleasures derived from
literature of instruction rather than of amusement as he himself had applied to
the works of William Shakespeare more than once for the solution of difficult problems in imaginary or real life.</p>
<p class="ith">Had he found their solution?</p>
<p> In spite of careful and repeated reading of certain classical passages,
aided by a glossary, he had derived imperfect conviction from the text, the answers not bearing in all points.</p>
<p class="ith">What lines concluded his first piece of original verse written by
him, potential poet, at the age of 11 in 1877 on the occasion of the offering of

<p> 16 years before in 1888 when Bloom was of Stephen&apos;s present age Stephen
was 6. 16 years after in 1920 when Stephen would be of Bloom&apos;s present age
Bloom would be 54. In 1936 when Bloom would be 70 and Stephen 54 their ages
initially in the ratio of 16 to 0 would be as 17&frac12; to 13&frac12;, the
proportion increasing and the disparity diminishing according

for if the proportion existing in 1883 had continued immutable, conceiving that
to be possible, till then 1904 when Stephen was 22 Bloom would be 374 and in
1920 when Stephen would be 38, as Bloom then was, Bloom would be 646 while in
1952 when Stephen would have attained the maximum postdiluvian age of 70 Bloom,
being 1190 years alive having been born in the year 714, would have surpassed by
221 years the maximum antediluvian age, that of Methusalah, 969 years, while, if
Stephen would continue to live until he would attain that age in the year 3072
<span style="font-variant:small-caps">a.d.</span>, Bloom would have been obliged
to have been alive 83,300 years, having been obliged to have been born in the
year 81,396 <span style="font-variant:small-caps">b.c.</span></p>
<p class="ith">What events might nullify these calculations?</p>
<p> The cessation of existence of both or either, the inauguration of a new era
or calendar, the annihilation of the world and consequent extermination of the
human species, inevitable but impredictable.</p>

of Stephen&apos;s father and Stephen&apos;s granduncle, Stephen being then 5 years older.

<p class="ith">Did Bloom accept the invitation to dinner given then by the son
and afterwards seconded by the father?</p>
<p> Very gratefully, with grateful appreciation, with sincere appreciative
gratitude, in appreciatively grateful sincerity of regret, he declined.</p>
<p class="ith">Did their conversation on the subject of these reminiscences
reveal a third connecting link between them?</p>
<p> Mrs Riordan, a widow of independent means, had resided in the house of
Stephen&apos;s parents from 1 September 1888 to 29 December 1891 and had also
resided during the years 1892, 1893 and 1894 in the City Arms Hotel owned by
Elizabeth O&apos;Dowd of 54 Prussia street
where<font color="red"><sup><small>(u22</small></sup></font>,<a target="foot" id="fss0080">&ordm;</a><font color="red"><sup><small>u21)</small></sup></font>

she had been a constant informant of Bloom who resided also in the same hotel,
being at that time a clerk in the employment of Joseph Cuffe of 5 Smithfield for
the superintendence of sales in the adjacent Dublin Cattle market on the North Circular road.</p>
<p class="ith">Had he performed any special corporal work of mercy for her?</p>

Park and <i>vice versa</i>.</p>
<p class="ith">Why could he then support that his vigil with the greater equanimity?</p>
<p> Because in middle youth he had often sat observing through a rondel of
bossed glass of a multicoloured pane the spectacle offered with continual
changes of the thoroughfare without, pedestrians, quadrupeds, velocipedes,
vehicles, passing slowly, quickly, evenly, round and round and round the rim of
a round <font color="red"><sup><small>(u22</small></sup></font>and

<p class="ith">What distinct different memories had each of her now eight years deceased?</p>
<p> The older, her bezique cards and counters, her Skye terrier, her
suppositious wealth, her lapses of responsiveness and incipient catarrhal
deafness: the younger, her lamp of colza oil before the statue of the Immaculate Conception,
<br><font color="green">{u22, 634}</font>
<br> her green and maroon brushes for Charles Stewart Parnell and for Michael Davitt, her tissue papers.</p>

<p class="ith">Had any special agility been his in earlier youth?</p>

gyration beyond his courage yet as a High School scholar he had excelled in his

would have passed successively through the preparatory, junior, middle and

second arts and arts degree courses of the royal university.</p>
<p class="ith">Why did Bloom refrain from stating that he had frequented the university of life?</p>
<p> Because of his fluctuating incertitude as to whether this observation had or
had not been already made by him to Stephen or by Stephen to him.</p>
<p class="ith">What two temperaments did they individually represent?</p>
<p> The scientific. The artistic.</p>
<p class="ith">What proofs did Bloom adduce to prove that his tendency was
towards applied, rather than towards pure, science?</p>
<p> Certain possible inventions of which he had cogitated when reclining in a
state of supine repletion to aid digestion, stimulated by his appreciation of
the importance of inventions now common but once revolutionary, for example, the
aeronautic parachute, the reflecting telescope, the spiral corkscrew, the safety
pin, the mineral water siphon, the canal lock with winch and sluice, the suction pump.</p>
<p class="ith">Were these inventions principally intended for an improved scheme of kindergarten?</p>
<p> Yes, rendering obsolete popguns, elastic airbladders, games of hazard,
catapults. They comprised astronomical kaleidoscopes exhibiting the twelve
<br><font color="green">{u22, 636}</font>
<br> constellations of the zodiac from Aries to Pisces, miniature mechanical
orreries, arithmetical gelatine lozenges, geometrical to correspond with

Quebec. She understood little of political complications, internal, or balance

recourse to digital aid. After completion of laconic epistolary compositions she

<p> One of all, the least of all, is the victim predestined. Once by
inadvertence, twice by design he challenges his destiny. It comes when he is
abandoned and challenges him reluctant and, as an apparition of hope and youth,
holds him unresisting. It leads him to a strange habitation, to a secret infidel
apartment, and there, implacable, immolates him, consenting.</p>
<p class="ith">Why was the host (victim predestined) sad?</p>
<p> He wished that a tale of a deed should be told of a deed not by him should by him not be told.</p>
<p class="ith">Why was the host (reluctant, unresisting) still?</p>
<p> In accordance with the law of the conservation of energy.</p>

of the hierarchy, the superstition of the populace, the propagation of rumour in
continued fraction of veridicity, the envy of opulence, the influence of
retaliation, the sporadic reappearance of atavistic delinquency, the mitigating
circumstances of fanaticism, hypnotic suggestion and somnambulism.</p>
<p class="ith">From which (if any) of these mental or physical disorders was he not totally immune?</p>
<p> From hypnotic suggestion: once, waking, he had not recognised his sleeping
apartment: more than once, waking, he had been for an indefinite time incapable
of moving or uttering sounds. From somnambulism: once, sleeping, his body had
risen, crouched and crawled in the direction of a heatless fire and, having
attained its destination, there, curled, unheated, in night attire had lain, sleeping.</p>
<p class="ith">Had this latter or any cognate phenomenon declared itself in any member of his family?</p>
<p> Twice, in Holles street and in Ontario terrace, his daughter Millicent
(Milly) at the ages of 6 and 8 years had uttered in sleep an exclamation of
terror and had replied to the interrogations of two figures in night attire with a vacant mute expression.

obtained, 33 closely printed volumes of 1000 pages each of innumerable quires
and reams of India paper would have to be requisitioned in order to contain the
complete tale of its printed integers of units, tens, hundreds, thousands, tens

spectators had entered actual present existence.</p>
<p class="ith">Was he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle?</p>
<p> Indubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in the
delirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejection invoking
ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the satellite of their planet.</p>
<p class="ith">Did he then accept as an article of belief the theory of
astrological influences upon sublunary disasters?</p>
<p> It seemed to him as possible of proof as of confutation and the nomenclature
employed in its selenographical charts as attributable to verifiable intuition
as to fallacious analogy: the lake of dreams, the sea of rains, the gulf of dews, the ocean of fecundity.</p>
<p class="ith">What special affinities appeared to him to exist between the moon and woman?</p>
<p> Her antiquity in preceding and surviving successive tellurian generations:
her nocturnal predominance: her satellitic dependence: her luminary reflection:
her constancy under all her phases,
rising<font color="red"><sup><small>(u22</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span><a target="foot" id="fss0226">&ordm;</a><font color="red"><sup><small>u21)</small></sup></font>
and setting by her appointed times, waxing and waning: the forced invariability
of her aspect: her indeterminate response to inaffirmative interrogation: her
potency over effluent and refluent waters: her power to enamour, to mortify, to
invest with beauty, to render insane, to incite to and aid delinquency: the
tranquil inscrutability of her visage: the terribility of her isolated dominant
implacable resplendent propinquity: her omens of tempest and of calm: the
stimulation of her light, her motion and her presence: the admonition of her
craters, her arid seas, her silence: her splendour, when visible: her attraction, when invisible.

<p class="ith">What visible luminous sign attracted Bloom&apos;s, who attracted

<p> In the second storey (rere) of his (Bloom&apos;s) house the light of a
paraffin oil lamp with oblique shade projected on a screen of roller blind
supplied by Frank O&apos;Hara, window blind, curtain pole and revolving shutter manufacturer, 16 Aungier street.</p>

affection and admiration: with

with suggestion.</p>
<p class="ith">Both then were silent?</p>
<p> Silent, each contemplating the other in both mirrors of the reciprocal flesh of theirhisnothis fellowfaces.</p>
<p class="ith">Were they indefinitely inactive?</p>
<p> At Stephen&apos;s suggestion, at Bloom&apos;s instigation both, first
Stephen, then Bloom, in penumbra urinated, their sides contiguous, their organs
of micturition reciprocally rendered invisible by manual circumposition, their
gazes, first Bloom&apos;s, then Stephen&apos;s, elevated to the projected luminous and semiluminous shadow.</p>
<p class="ith">Similarly?</p>
<p> The trajectories of their, first sequent, then simultaneous, urinations were
dissimilar: Bloom&apos;s longer, less irruent, in the incomplete form of the
bifurcated penultimate alphabetical letter who in his ultimate year at High
School (1880) had been capable of attaining the point of greatest altitude
against the whole concurrent strength of the institution, 210 scholars:
Stephen&apos;s higher, more sibilant, who in the ultimate hours of the previous
day had augmented by diuretic consumption an insistent

vesical<a target="foot" id="fss0232">&ordm;</a><font color="red"><sup><small>u21)</small></sup></font> pressure.</p>
<p class="ith">What different problems presented themselves to each concerning
the invisible audible collateral organ of the other?</p>
<p> To Bloom: the problems of irritability, tumescence, rigidity, reactivity,
dimension, sanitariness, pelosity. To Stephen: the problem of the sacerdotal
integrity of Jesus circumcised (1st January, holiday of obligation to hear mass
<br><font color="green">{u22, 656}</font>
<br> and abstain from unnecessary servile work) and the problem as to whether
the divine prepuce, the carnal bridal ring of the holy Roman catholic apostolic
church, conserved in Calcata, were deserving of simple hyperduly or of the
fourth degree of latria accorded to the abscission of such divine excrescences as hair and toenails.</p>
<p class="ith">What celestial sign was by both simultaneously observed?</p>
<p> A star precipitated with great apparent velocity across the firmament from
Vega in the Lyre above the zenith beyond the stargroup of the Tress of Berenice towards the zodiacal sign of Leo.</p>
<p class="ith">How did the centripetal remainer afford egress to the centrifugal departer?</p>
<p> By inserting the barrel of an arruginated male key in the hole of an
unstable female lock, obtaining a purchase on the bow of the key and turning its
wards from right to left, withdrawing a bolt from its staple, pulling inward
spasmodically an obsolescent unhinged door and revealing an aperture for free egress and free ingress.</p>
<p class="ith">How did they take leave, one of the other, in separation?</p>
<p> Standing perpendicular at the same door and on different sides of its base,
the lines of their valedictory arms, meeting at any point and forming any angle
less than the sum of two right angles.</p>
<p class="ith">What sound accompanied the union of their tangent, the disunion
of their (respectively) centrifugal and centripetal hands?</p>
<p> The sound of the peal of the hour of the night by the chime of the bells in the church of Saint George.</p>
<p class="ith">What echoes of that sound were by both and each heard?</p>
<p> By Stephen:</p>

<p class="ith">Where were the several members of the company which with Bloom

<p> Martin Cunningham (in bed), Jack Power (in bed), Simon Dedalus (in bed), Tom

<p class="ith">Alone, what did Bloom hear?</p>
<p> The double reverberation of retreating feet on the heavenborn earth, the
double vibration of a jew&apos;s harp in the resonant lane.</p>
<p class="ith">Alone, what did Bloom feel?</p>
<p> The cold of interstellar space, thousands of degrees below freezing point or

<p> The disparition of three final stars, the diffusion of daybreak, the apparition of a new solar disk.</p>
<p class="ith">Had he ever been a spectator of those phenomena?</p>
<p> Once, in

after a protracted performance of charades in the house of Luke Doyle, Kimmage,
he had awaited with patience the apparition of the diurnal phenomenon, seated on
a wall, his gaze turned in the direction of Mizrach, the east.</p>
<p class="ith">He remembered the initial paraphenomena?</p>
<p> More active air, a matutinal distant cock, ecclesiastical clocks at various
points, avine music, the isolated tread of an early wayfarer, the visible diffusion
<br><font color="green">{u22, 658}</font>
<br> of the light of an invisible luminous body, the first golden limb of the
resurgent sun perceptible low on the horizon.</p>
<p class="ith">Did he remain?</p>
<p> With deep inspiration he returned, retraversing the garden, reentering the
passage, reclosing the door. With brief suspiration he reassumed the candle,
reascended the stairs, reapproached the door of the front room, hallfloor, and reentered.</p>
<p class="ith">What suddenly arrested his ingress?</p>
<p> The right temporal lobe of the hollow sphere of his cranium came into
contact with a solid timber angle where, an infinitesimal but sensible fraction
of a second later, a painful sensation was located in consequence of

<p> A sofa upholstered in prune plush had been translocated from opposite the
door to the ingleside near the compactly furled Union Jack (an alteration which
he had frequently intended to execute): the blue and white checker inlaid
majolicatopped table had been placed opposite the door in the place vacated by
the prune plush sofa: the walnut sideboard (a projecting angle of which had
momentarily arrested his ingress) had been moved from its position beside the
door to a more advantageous but more perilous position in front of the door: two
chairs had been moved from right and left of the ingleside to the position
originally occupied by the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table.</p>
<p class="ith">Describe them.</p>
<p> One: a squat stuffed
easychair<font color="red"><sup><small>(u22</small></sup></font>,<a target="foot" id="fss0246">&ordm;</a><font color="red"><sup><small>u21)</small></sup></font>
with stout arms extended and back slanted to the rere, which, repelled in
recoil, had then upturned an irregular fringe of a rectangular rug and now
displayed on its amply upholstered seat a centralised diffusing and diminishing
discolouration. The other: a slender splayfoot chair of glossy cane curves,
placed directly opposite the former, its frame from top to seat and from seat to
base being varnished dark brown, its seat being a bright circle of white plaited rush.</p>
<p class="ith">What significances attached to these two chairs?</p>
<p> Significances of similitude, of posture, of symbolism, of circumstantial evidence, of testimonial supermanence.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 659}</font> </p>
<p class="ith">What occupied the position originally occupied by the sideboard?</p>

consumed matches, a partly consumed cigarette and two discoloured ends of

<p class="ith">With what sensations did Bloom contemplate in rotation these objects?</p>
<p> With strain, elevating a candlestick: with pain, feeling on his right temple
a contused tumescence: with attention, focussing his gaze on a large dull
passive and

slender bright active: with solicitation, bending and downturning the upturned
rugfringe: with amusement, remembering Dr Malachi Mulligan&apos;s scheme of
colour containing the gradation of green: with pleasure, repeating the words and
antecedent act and perceiving through various channels of internal sensibility
the consequent and concomitant tepid pleasant diffusion of gradual discolouration.</p>

majolicatopped table he extracted a black diminutive cone, one inch in height,
placed it on its circular base on a small tin plate, placed his candlestick on
the right corner of the mantelpiece, produced from his waistcoat a folded page
of prospectus (illustrated) entitled Agendath Netaim, unfolded the same,
examined it superficially, rolled it into a thin cylinder, ignited it in the
candleflame, applied it when ignited to the apex of the cone till the latter
reached the stage of rutilance, placed the cylinder in the basin of the
candlestick disposing its unconsumed part in such a manner as to facilitate total combustion.</p>

<p class="ith">What interchanges of looks took place between these three objects and Bloom?</p>
<p> In the mirror of the giltbordered pierglass the undecorated back of the
dwarf tree regarded the upright back of the embalmed owl. Before the mirror the
matrimonial gift of Alderman John Hooper with a clear melancholy wise bright
motionless compassionate gaze regarded Bloom while Bloom with obscure tranquil
profound motionless compassionated gaze regarded the matrimonial gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle.</p>
<p class="ith">What composite asymmetrical image in the mirror then attracted his attention?</p>

<p class="ith">Why mutable (aliorelative)?</p>
<p> From infancy to maturity he had resembled his maternal procreatrix. From
maturity to senility he would increasingly resemble his paternal procreator.</p>
<p class="ith">What final visual impression was communicated to him by the mirror?</p>

not in the order of their common letters with scintillating titles on the two bookshelves opposite.</p>

<p class="ith">What reflections occupied his mind during the process of reversion of the inverted volumes?</p>
<p> The necessity of order, a place for everything and everything in its place:
the deficient appreciation of literature possessed by females: the incongruity
of an apple incuneated in a tumbler and of an umbrella inclined in a closestool:
the insecurity of hiding any secret document behind, beneath or between the pages of a book.</p>
<p class="ith">Which volume was the largest in bulk?</p>

decisive officer, major Brian Cooper Tweedy (remembered).</p>
<p class="ith">Why, firstly and secondly, did he not consult the work in question?</p>
<p> Firstly, in order to exercise mnemotechnic: secondly, because after an

<p class="ith">What caused him irritation in his sitting posture?</p>
<p> Inhibitory pressure of collar (size 17) and waistcoat (5 buttons), two
articles of clothing superfluous in the costume of mature males and inelastic to alterations of mass by expansion.</p>
<p class="ith">How was the irritation allayed?</p>
<p> He removed his collar, with contained black necktie and collapsible stud,
from his neck to a position on the left of the table. He unbuttoned successively
in reversed direction waistcoat, trousers, shirt and vest along the medial line
of irregular incrispated black hairs extending in triangular convergence from
the pelvic basin over the circumference of the abdomen and umbilicular fossicle
along the medial line of nodes to the intersection of the sixth pectoral
vertebrae, thence produced both ways at right angles and terminating in circles
described about two equidistant points, right and left, on the summits of the
mammary prominences. He unbraced successively each of six minus one braced
trouser buttons, arranged in pairs, of which one incomplete.</p>
<p class="ith">What involuntary actions followed?</p>
<p> He compressed between 2 fingers the flesh circumjacent to a cicatrice in the
left infracostal region below the diaphragm resulting from a sting inflicted 2
weeks and 3 days previously (23 May 1904) by a bee. He scratched imprecisely
with his right hand, though insensible of prurition, various points and surfaces
of his partly exposed, wholly abluted skin. He inserted his left hand into the
left lower pocket of his waistcoat and extracted and replaced a silver coin (1
shilling), placed there (presumably) on the occasion

<p> To Master Percy Apjohn at High School in 1880 he had divulged his disbelief
in the tenets of the Irish (protestant) church (to which his father Rudolf
Virag,later Rudolph Bloom, had been converted from the Israelitic faith and
communion in 1865 by the Society for promoting Christianity among the jews)
subsequently abjured by him in favour of Roman catholicism at the epoch of and
with a view to his matrimony in 1888. To Daniel Magrane and Francis Wade in 1882
during a juvenile friendship (terminated by the premature emigration of the
former) he had advocated during nocturnal perambulations the political theory of
colonial (e.g. Canadian) expansion and the evolutionary theories of Charles
Darwin, expounded in <i>The Descent of Man</i> and <i>The Origin of Species</i>.
In 1885 he had publicly expressed his adherence to the collective and national
economic programme advocated by James Fintan Lalor, John Fisher Murray, John
Mitchel, J.F.X. O&apos;Brien and others, the agrarian policy of Michael Davitt,
the constitutional agitation of Charles Stewart Parnell (M.P. for Cork City),
the programme of peace, retrenchment and reform of William Ewart Gladstone (M.P.
for Midlothian, N.B.) and, in support of his political convictions, had climbed

<p class="ith">How did these beliefs and practices now appear to him?</p>
<p> Not more rational than they had then appeared, not less rational than other beliefs and practices now appeared.</p>
<p class="ith">What first reminiscence had he of Rudolph Bloom (deceased)?</p>
<p> Rudolph Bloom (deceased) narrated to his son Leopold Bloom (aged 6) a
retrospective arrangement of migrations and settlements in and between Dublin,
London, Florence, Milan, Vienna, Budapest, Szombathely with statements of
satisfaction (his grandfather having seen Maria Theresia, empress of Austria,
queen of Hungary), with commercial advice (having taken care of pence, the
pounds having taken care of themselves). Leopold Bloom (aged 6) had accompanied
these narrations by constant consultation of a geographical map
<br><font color="green">{u22, 677}</font>
<br> of Europe (political) and by suggestions for the establishment of
affiliated business premises in the various centres mentioned.</p>
<p class="ith">Had time equally but differently obliterated the memory of these migrations in narrator and listener?</p>
<p> In narrator by the access of years and in consequence of the use of narcotic
toxin: in listener by the access of years and in consequence of the action of
distraction upon vicarious experiences.</p>

he drank voraciously the juice of

food by means of a lacerated envelope or other accessible fragment of paper.</p>
<p class="ith">What two phenomena of senescence were more frequent?</p>
<p> The myopic digital calculation of coins, eructation consequent upon repletion.</p>
<p class="ith">What object offered partial consolation for these reminiscences?</p>
<p> The endowment policy, the bank passbook, the certificate of the possession of scrip.</p>
<p class="ith">Reduce Bloom by cross multiplication of reverses of fortune, from
which these supports protected him, and by elimination of all positive values to

<br> misery: the aged impotent disfranchised ratesupported moribund lunatic pauper.</p>

of casual acquaintances, the latration of illegitimate unlicensed vagabond dogs,
the infantile discharge of decomposed vegetable missiles, worth little or nothing, nothing or less than nothing.</p>

<p class="ith">Which preferably?</p>
<p> The latter, by the line of least resistance.</p>
<p class="ith">What considerations rendered it not entirely undesirable?</p>
<p> Constant cohabitation impeding mutual toleration of personal defects. The
habit of independent purchase increasingly cultivated. The necessity to
counteract by impermanent sojourn the permanence of arrest.</p>

<p> The parties concerned, uniting, had increased and multiplied, which being

accurately folded and placed lengthwise between the spring mattress (striped)

bed, prepared the bedlinen accordingly and entered the bed.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 683}</font> </p>
<p class="ith">How?</p>
<p> With circumspection, as invariably when entering an abode (his own or not
his own): with solicitude, the snakespiral springs of the mattress being old,
the brass quoits and pendent viper radii loose and tremulous under stress and
strain: prudently, as entering a lair or ambush of lust or adders: lightly, the
less to disturb: reverently, the bed of conception and of birth, of consummation
of marriage and of breach of marriage, of sleep and of death.</p>
<p class="ith">What did his limbs, when gradually extended, encounter?</p>
<p> New clean bedlinen, additional odours, the presence of a human form, female,
hers, the imprint of a human form, male, not his, some crumbs, some flakes of

Joseph Cuffe, Wisdom Hely, Alderman John Hooper, Dr Francis Brady, Father

<p class="ith">What were his reflections concerning the last member of this series and late occupant of the bed?</p>
<p> Reflections on his vigour (a bounder), corporal proportion (a billsticker),
commercial ability (a bester), impressionability (a boaster).
<br><font color="green">{u22, 684}</font> </p>
<p class="ith">Why for the observer impressionability in addition to vigour,
corporal proportion and commercial ability?</p>
<p> Because he had observed with augmenting frequency in the preceding members
of the same series the same concupiscence, inflammably
transmitted<font color="red"><sup><small>(u22</small></sup></font>,<a target="foot" id="fss0431">&ordm;</a><font color="red"><sup><small>u21)</small></sup></font>
first with alarm, then with understanding, then with desire, finally with
fatigue, with alternating symptoms of epicene comprehension and apprehension.</p>
<p class="ith">With what antagonistic sentiments were his subsequent reflections affected?</p>
<p> Envy, jealousy, abnegation, equanimity.</p>
<p class="ith">Envy?</p>
<p> Of a bodily and mental male organism specially adapted for the
superincumbent posture of energetic human copulation and energetic piston and
cylinder movement necessary for the complete satisfaction of a constant but not
acute concupiscence resident in a bodily and mental female organism, passive but not obtuse.</p>
<p class="ith">Jealousy?</p>
<p> Because a nature full and volatile in its free state, was alternately the
agent and reagent of attraction. Because attraction between

at all instants varied, with inverse proportion of increase and decrease, with
incessant circular extension and radial reentrance. Because the controlled
contemplation of the fluctuation of attraction produced, if desired, a fluctuation of pleasure.</p>
<p class="ith">Abnegation?</p>
<p> In virtue of a) acquaintance initiated in September 1903 in the
establishment of George Mesias, merchant tailor and outfitter, 5 Eden Quay, b)
hospitality extended and received in kind, reciprocated and reappropriated in

colleagual altruism and amorous egoism, d) extraracial attraction, intraracial

<p class="ith">Equanimity?</p>
<p> As
<font color="red"><sup><small>(u22</small></sup></font>as<a target="foot" id="fss0434">&ordm;</a><font color="red"><sup><small>u21)</small></sup></font>
natural as any and every natural act of a nature expressed or understood
executed in natured nature by natural creatures in accordance with
<br><font color="green">{u22, 685}</font>
<br> his, her and their natured natures, of dissimilar similarity. As not as
calamitous as a cataclysmic annihilation of the planet in consequence of a
collision with a dark sun. As less reprehensible than theft, highway robbery,
cruelty to children and animals, obtaining money under false pretences, forgery,
embezzlement, misappropriation of public money, betrayal of public trust,
malingering, mayhem, corruption of minors, criminal libel, blackmail, contempt
of court, arson, treason, felony, mutiny on the high seas, trespass, burglary,
jailbreaking, practice of unnatural vice, desertion from armed forces in the
field, perjury, poaching, usury, intelligence with the king&apos;s enemies,
impersonation, criminal assault, manslaughter, wilful and premeditated murder.

processes of adaptation to altered conditions of existence, resulting in a
reciprocal equilibrium between the bodily organism and its attendant
circumstances, foods, beverages, acquired habits, indulged inclinations,
significant disease. As more than inevitable, irreparable.</p>
<p class="ith">Why more abnegation than jealousy, less envy than equanimity?</p>
<p> From outrage (matrimony) to outrage (adultery) there arose nought but
outrage (copulation) yet the matrimonial violator of the matrimonially violated
had not been outraged by the adulterous violator of the adulterously violated.</p>
<p class="ith">What retribution, if any?</p>
<p> Assassination, never, as two wrongs did not make one right. Duel by combat,
no. Divorce, not now. Exposure by mechanical artifice (automatic bed) or
individual testimony (concealed ocular witnesses), not yet. Suit for damages by
legal influence or simulation of assault with evidence of injuries sustained
(selfinflicted), not impossibly. If any, positively, connivance, introduction of
emulation (material, a prosperous rival agency of publicity: moral, a successful
rival agent of intimacy), depreciation, alienation, humiliation, separation
protecting the one separated from the other, protecting

<p class="ith">By what reflections did he, a conscious reactor against the void
of incertitude, justify to himself his sentiments?</p>

the presupposed intangibility of the thing in itself: the incongruity and
disproportion between the selfprolonging tension of the thing proposed to be done and the selfabbreviating
<br><font color="green">{u22, 686}</font>
<br> relaxation of the thing done: the fallaciously inferred debility of the
female<font color="red"><sup><small>(u22</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span>:<a target="foot" id="fss0440">&ordm;</a><font color="red"><sup><small>u21)</small></sup></font>
the muscularity of the male: the variations of ethical codes: the natural
grammatical transition by inversion involving no alteration of sense of an
aorist preterite proposition (parsed as masculine subject, monosyllabic
onomatop&oelig;ic transitive verb with direct feminine object) from the active
voice into its correlative aorist preterite proposition (parsed as feminine
subject, auxiliary verb and quasimonosyllabic onomatop&oelig;ic past participle
with complementary masculine agent) in the passive voice: the continued product
of seminators by generation: the continual production of semen by distillation:
the futility of triumph or protest or vindication: the inanity of extolled
virtue: the lethargy of nescient matter: the apathy of the stars.</p>
<p class="ith">In what final satisfaction did these antagonistic sentiments and
reflections<font color="red"><sup><small>(u22</small></sup></font>,<a target="foot" id="fss0441">&ordm;</a><font color="red"><sup><small>u21)</small></sup></font>
reduced to their simplest forms, converge?</p>
<p> Satisfaction at the ubiquity in eastern and western terrestrial hemispheres,

midnight sun, the islands of the blessed, the isles of Greece, the land of
promise)<font color="red"><sup><small>(u22</small></sup></font>,<a target="foot" id="fss0442">&ordm;</a><font color="red"><sup><small>u21)</small></sup></font>

posterior female hemispheres, redolent of milk and honey and of excretory
sanguine and seminal warmth, reminiscent of secular families of curves of
amplitude, insusceptible of moods of impression or of contrarieties of
expression, expressive of mute immutable mature animality.</p>
<p class="ith">The visible signs of antesatisfaction?</p>
<p> An approximate erection: a solicitous adversion: a gradual elevation: a
tentative

a silent contemplation.</p>
<p class="ith">Then?</p>
<p> He kissed the plump mellow yellow smellow melons of her rump, on each plump
melonous hemisphere, in their mellow yellow furrow, with obscure prolonged provocative melonsmellonous osculation.</p>
<p class="ith">The visible signs of postsatisfaction?</p>
<p> A silent contemplation: a tentative velation: a gradual abasement: a solicitous aversion: a proximate erection.</p>
<p class="ith">What followed this silent action?</p>
<p> Somnolent invocation, less somnolent recognition, incipient excitation, catechetical interrogation.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 687}</font> </p>
<p class="ith">With what modifications did the narrator reply to this interrogation?</p>
<p> Negative: he omitted to mention the clandestine correspondence between
Martha Clifford and Henry Flower, the public altercation at, in and in the
vicinity of the licensed premises of Bernard Kiernan and Co, Limited, 8, 9 and
10 Little Britain street, the erotic provocation and response thereto caused by
the exhibitionism of Gertrude (Gerty), surname unknown. Positive: he included
mention of a performance by Mrs Bandmann Palmer of <i>Leah</i> at the Gaiety
Theatre, 46, 47, 48, 49 South King street, an invitation to supper at
Wynn&apos;s (Murphy&apos;s)

the course of a postcenal gymnastic display, the victim (since completely
recovered) being Stephen Dedalus, professor and author, eldest surviving son of
Simon Dedalus, of no fixed occupation, an aeronautical feat executed by him
(narrator) in the presence of a witness, the professor and author aforesaid,
with promptitude of decision and gymnastic flexibility.</p>
<p class="ith">Was the narration otherwise unaltered by modifications?</p>
<p> Absolutely.</p>
<p class="ith">Which event or person emerged as the salient point of his narration?</p>
<p> Stephen Dedalus, professor and author.</p>
<p class="ith">What limitations of activity and inhibitions of conjugal rights
were perceived by listener and narrator concerning themselves during the course
of this intermittent and increasingly more laconic narration?</p>

aged 11 days, there remained a period of 10 years, 5 months and 18 days during
which carnal intercourse had been incomplete, without ejaculation of semen
within the natural female organ. By the narrator a limitation of activity, mental and
<br><font color="green">{u22, 688}</font>
<br> corporal, inasmuch as complete mental intercourse between himself and the
listener had not taken place since the consummation of puberty, indicated by
catamenic hemorrhage, of the female issue of narrator and listener, 15 September
1903, there remained a period of 9 months and 1 day during
which<font color="red"><sup><small>(u22</small></sup></font>,<a target="foot" id="fss0454">&ordm;</a><font color="red"><sup><small>u21)</small></sup></font>
in consequence of a preestablished natural comprehension in incomprehension
between the consummated females (listener and issue), complete corporal liberty of action had been circumscribed.</p>
<p class="ith">How?</p>
<p> By various reiterated feminine interrogation concerning the masculine
destination whither, the place where, the time at which, the duration for which,
the object with which in the case of temporary absences, projected or effected.</p>
<p class="ith">What moved visibly above the listener&apos;s and the narrator&apos;s invisible thoughts?</p>
<p> The upcast reflection of a lamp and shade, an inconstant series of
concentric circles of varying gradations of light and shadow.</p>
