<p class="pith">What course did Bloom and Stephen follow returning?</p>
<p class="flush">Lower and Middle Gardiner streets and Mountjoy square, west.
Then, bearing left, Gardiner&apos;s place by an inadvertence as far as the
farther corner of Temple street. Then, bearing right, Temple street, north, as
far as Hardwicke place. They crossed the circus before George&apos;s church
diametrically, the chord in any circle being less than the arc which it subtends.</p>
<p class="pith">Of what did they speak during their itinerary?</p>
<p class="flush">Music, literature, Ireland, Dublin, Paris, friendship, woman,
diet, <a name="s17035ac" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17035ac">the influence
of gaslight</a> or the light of
<a name="s17019ba" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17019ba">arc and
glowlamps</a> <a name="s17035ac" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17035ac">on the
growth of</a>
<a name="s17025u" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17025u">adjoining</a>
<a name="s17035ac" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17035ac">trees</a>, the Roman
catholic church, jesuit education, careers, the study of medicine, the past day Stephen&apos;s breakdown.</p>
<p class="pith">Did Bloom discover similarity between their respective reactions to experience?</p>
<p class="flush">Both were sensitive to artistic impressions, musical in
preference to
<a name="s17017n" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17017n">plastic</a> or
pictorial. Both preferred a
<a name="s17016i" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17016i">continental</a> to an
insular manner of life. Both indurated by early domestic training and an
inherited tenacity of resistance professed their disbelief in many accepted
religious, national, social and ethical doctrines. Both admitted the
<a name="s17028q" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17028q">alternately</a>
stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual magnetism.</p>
<p class="pith">Were their views on some points divergent?</p>
<p class="flush">Stephen dissented openly from Bloom&apos;s views on the
importance of dietary and civic selfhelp while Bloom dissented tacitly from
Stephen&apos;s views on the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in
literature. The collapse which Bloom ascribed to gastric inanition and certain
chemical compounds of varying degrees of adulteration and alcoholic strength
Stephen attributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud at first no bigger than a woman&apos;s hand.</p>
<p class="pith">Was there one point were equal and negative?</p>
<p class="flush">The influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of
<a name="un5024cp" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5024cp">adjoining</a> trees.</p>
<p class="pith">Had Bloom discussed similar subjects during nocturnal perambulations in the past?</p>
<p class="flush">In 1884 with Owen Goldberg and Cecil Turnbull. In 1885 with
Percy Apjohn. In 1886 occasionally with casual acquaintances. In 1888 frequently
with major Brian Tweedy and his daughter Miss Marion Tweedy, together and
separately. Once in 1892 and once in 1893 with Julius (Juda) Mastiansky.</p>
<p class="pith">What action did Bloom make on their arrival at their destination?</p>
<p class="flush">At the housesteps of number 7 Eccles street he put his hand
mechanically into the back pocket to get his latchkey.</p>
<p class="pith">Was it there?</p>
<p class="flush">It was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn on the day but one preceding.</p>
<p class="pith">Why was he doubly irritated?</p>
<p class="flush">Because he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had
reminded himself twice not to forget.</p>
<p class="pith">What were then the alternatives?</p>
<p class="flush">To enter or not to enter. To knock or not to knock.</p>
<p class="pith">His decision?</p>
<p class="flush">A stratagem. He climbed over the area railings,
compressed<a target="foot" id="fsz0001">&ordm;</a> his hat on his head, grasped
the lower parts of two rails, lowered his body gradually by its length of five
feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten inches of the area pavement,
and allowed his body to move freely in space by separating himself from the
railings and crouching in preparation for the impact of the fall.</p>
<p class="pith">Did he fall?</p>
<p class="flush">By his weight of ten stone and four ounces in
<a name="s17030ar" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17030ar">avoirdupois</a>
measure, as certified by the graduated machine for periodical selfweighing in
the premises of Francis Froedman, pharmaceutical chemist of 19 Frederick street,
north, on the last feast of the Ascension, to wit, the twelfth day of May of the
year one thousand nine hundred and four of the christian era.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 2}</font> </p>
<p class="pith">Did he rise uninjured?</p>
<p class="flush">He rose uninjured though
<a name="s17016am" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17016am">shocked</a> by the
impact, raised the latch of the area door by leverage, entered the kitchen
through the scullery,
<a name="s17026k" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17026k">ignited</a> a lucifer
match by friction, set free inflammable coal gas by turning on the ventcock, lit
a high flame which, by regulating, he
<a name="s17030aq" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17030aq">reduced to</a>
<a name="un5024cd" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5024cd">quiescent</a>
candescence and lit finally a portable candle.</p>
<p class="pith">Where was Stephen meanwhile?</p>
<p class="flush">Reclined against the area railings he perceived through the
transparent kitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame, a man lighting a candle,
a man removing in turn each of his two boots, a man leaving the kitchen holding a candle.</p>
<p class="pith">Did the man reappear elsewhere?</p>
<p class="flush">After a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was
discernible through the glass fanlight over the halldoor. The halldoor turned
gradually on its hinges. In the open space of the doorway the man reappeared without his hat, with his candle.</p>
<p class="pith">Did Stephen obey his sign?</p>
<p class="flush">Yes, entering softly, he helped to close and chain the door and
followed softly along the hallway the man&apos;s back and candle past a lighted
crevice of doorway on the left and carefully down a turning staircase of more
than five steps into the kitchen of Bloom&apos;s house.</p>
<p class="pith">What did Bloom do?</p>
<p class="flush">He extinguished the candle by a sharp ejection of breath upon
its flame, drew two
<a name="un4049e" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4049e">spoonseat</a> deal
chairs to the hearthstone, one for Stephen with his back to the area window, the
other for himself when necessary, knelt on one knee, composed in the grate a
pyre of crosslaid resintipped sticks and various coloured papers and irregular
<a name="s17013af" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17013af">polygons</a> of best
Abram coal at twentyone shillings a ton from the yard of Messrs Flower and
M&apos;Donald of 7 D&apos;Olier street, kindled it at three projecting points of
paper with one <a name="s17026k" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17026k">ignited</a> wooden match.</p>
<p class="pith">Of what similar apparitions did Stephen think?</p>
<p class="flush">Of others elsewhere in other times who, kneeling on one knee or
on two, had kindled fires for him, of Brother
<br><font color="green">{ms, 3}</font>
<br> Michael in the infirmary of the college of the Society of Jesus at
Clongowes Wood in the county of Kildare, of his father, Simon Dedalus, in the
unfurnished room of his first residence in Dublin, number thirteen Fitzgibbon
street, of his godmother Miss Kate Morkan in the house of her dying sister Miss
Julia Morkan at 15 Usher&apos;s Island, of his aunt Sara, wife of Richie
(Richard Goulding) in the kitchen of their lodgings at 62 Clanbrassil street, of
his mother in the kitchen of number twelve North Richmond street on the morning
of the feast of Saint Francis Xavier 1898, of the dean of Studies, Father Butt,
in the physics&apos; theatre of university College, 16 Stephen&apos;s Green,
north, of his sister Dilly (Delia) in his father&apos;s house in Cabra.</p>
<p class="pith">What did Stephen see on raising his gaze to the height of a yard
from the fire towards the opposite wall?</p>
<p class="flush">A
<a name="s17024o" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17024o">curvilinear</a> rope
stretched between two holdfasts
<a name="un7028g" href="../../ff/unbs/un7all.htm#un7028g">athwart</a> across the
recess beside the chimney pier from which
<a name="s17033ae" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17033ae">hung four smallsized
square handkerchiefs</a> folded unattached
<a name="s17039m" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17039m">consecutively</a> in
adjacent rectangles and one pair of grey Lisle ladies&apos; stockings in their
habitual position clamped by three erect wooden pegs two at their outer
extremities and the third at their point of junction.</p>
<p class="pith">What did Bloom think of their different ages?</p>
<p class="flush">That neither could Stephen now have his age then nor he then Stephen&apos;s now.</p>
<p class="pith">By what act did he solve the problem?</p>
<p class="flush">He removed the saucepan to the left hob, rose and carried the
iron kettle to the tap and sink in order to draw water by turning the
<a name="un4032aq" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4032aq">faucet</a> to let it flow.</p>
<p class="pith">Did it flow?</p>
<p class="flush">Yes. From Roundwood reservoir
<a name="s17016an" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17016an">in county
Wicklow,</a> capable of containing
<a name="s17016ao" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17016ao">2400 million

feet to the city boundary at Leeson street bridge</a> though from prolonged

reason the borough surveyor on the instructions of the waterworks committee had

gallons per day per pauper supplied through a 6 inch meter had been convicted of
a wastage of 20,000 gallons per night by a reading of their meter on the
affirmation of the law agent of the corporation, Mr Ignatius Rice, thereby
acting to the detriment of another section of the public, selfsupporting taxpayers, solvent, sound.</p>
<p class="pith">What in water did Bloom, carrying water, returning to the range, admire?
<br><font color="green">{ms, 4}</font> </p>
<p class="flush">Its universality, its equality and constancy to its nature in
seeking its own level, its vastness in the ocean of

fens, stagnant pools in the waning moon.</p>
<p class="pith">Having set the halffilled kettle on the now burning coals why did he return to the stillflowing tap?</p>
<p class="flush">To wash his soiled hands with a partially consumed tablet of

<p class="flush">That he was hydrophobe, hating total contact by

<p class="flush">A double falciform ejection of water vapour from under the kettlelid at both sides simultaneously.</p>
<p class="pith">For what personal purpose could Bloom have applied the water so boiled?</p>
<p class="flush">To shave himself.</p>
<p class="pith">What advantages attended shaving by night?</p>
<p class="flush">A softer beard, quiet reflections upon the course of the

after a fresher sleep since matutinal noises, premonitions and perturbations, a
clattered milkcan, a postman&apos;s double knock, a shock, a shoot, with thought

taking three sips to his opponent&apos;s one.</p>
<p class="pith">What cerebration accompanied his act?</p>
<p class="flush">Concluding that his silent companion was engaged in mental
composition he reflected on the pleasures derived from literature of instruction
rather than of amusement as he himself had applied to the works of Shakespeare
more than once for the solution of difficult problems in imaginary or real life.</p>

<p class="pith">What relation existed between their ages?</p>
<p class="flush">16 years before in 1888 when Bloom was of Stephen&apos;s
present age Stephen was 6. Sixteen years after in 1920 when Stephen would be of
Bloom&apos;s present age Bloom would be 54.</p>
<p class="pith">What events might nullify these calculations?</p>
<p class="flush">The cessation of existence of both or either, the inauguration
of a new era or calendar, the annihilation of the world.</p>
<p class="pith">Had Bloom and Stephen met before that day?</p>
<p class="flush">Twice. The first time in the lilacgarden of Matthew
Dillon&apos;s house, Medina Villa, Kimmage road, Roundtown, in 1887, in the
company of his mother, Stephen being then of the age of 5 and reluctant to give
his hand in salutation. The second time in the coffeeroom of Breslin&apos;s
hotel on a rainy Sunday in the January of 1892, in the company of his father and
his granduncle, Stephen being then 5 years older.</p>
<p class="pith">Did Bloom accept the invitation to dinner given by the son and afterwards seconded by the father?</p>
<p class="flush">Very gratefully, appreciatively, sincerely, regretfully, he declined.</p>
<p class="pith">Did their conversation on the subject of these reminiscences
reveal a third connecting link between them?</p>
<p class="flush">Mrs Riordan (Dante), a widow of independent means, had resided
in the house of Stephen&apos;s parents from 1 September 1888 to 29 December 1891
and had also resided during the years 1892, 1893 and 1894 in the City Arms Hotel
owned by Elizabeth O&apos;Dowd of 54 Prussia street where, during parts of the
years 1893 and 1894, she had been a
<a name="s17048aa" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17048aa">constant</a>
informant of Bloom who resided also in the same hotel, being at that time a
clerk in the employment of Joseph Cuffe of 5 Smithfield for the superintendence<a target="foot" id="fsz0007">&ordm;</a>
<br><font color="green">{ms, 8}</font>
<br> of sales in the adjacent Dublin Cattle market on the North Circular road.</p>
<p class="pith">Had he performed any special corporal work of mercy for her?</p>
<p class="flush">He had sometimes
<a name="s17026j" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17026j">propelled</a> her on
warm summer evenings, an infirm widow of independent, if limited, means, in her
bathchair<a target="foot" id="fsz0008">&ordm;</a> with slow revolutions of its
wheels as far as the corner of the North Circular road opposite Mr Gavin
Low&apos;s place of business where she had remained for a certain time scanning
through his onelensed fieldglasses unrecognisable citizens on
tramcars<a target="foot" id="fsz0009">&ordm;</a>, roadster bicycles, hackney
carriages, tandems, private and hired landaus,
dogcarts<a target="foot" id="fsz0010">&ordm;</a>, ponytraps and brakes passing
from the city to the Phoenix Park and <u>vice versa</u>.</p>
<p class="pith">Why could he support that his vigil with the greater equanimity?</p>
<p class="flush">Because in middle youth he had often sat observing through a
glass boss of a multicoloured pane the spectacle offered with continual changes
of the thoroughfare without,
pedestrians<a target="foot" id="fsz0011">&ordm;</a>, quadrupeds, velocipedes,
vehicles, passing slowly, quickly, evenly, round and round and round the rim of a round precipitous globe</p>
<p class="pith">What distinct different memories had each of her now eight years deceased?</p>
<p class="flush">The older, her bezique cards and counters, her Skye terrier,
her suppositious wealth, her lapses of responsiveness: the younger, her lamp of
colza oil before the statue of the Immaculate Conception, her green and maroon
brushes for Parnell and for Michael Davitt, her tissue papers.</p>
<p class="pith">Were there no means still remaining to him to achieve the
rejuvenation which these reminiscences divulged to a younger companion rendered the more desirable?</p>
<p class="flush">The
<a name="s17002l" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17002l">indoor exercises</a>,
formerly intermittently<a target="foot" id="fsz0012">&ordm;</a> practised,
subsequently abandoned, prescribed in Eugen

to bring into play the various families of muscles and produce successively a
pleasant rigidity, a more pleasant relaxation and the most pleasant repristination of juvenile agility.</p>
<p class="pith">Had any special agility been his in earlier youth?</p>
<p class="flush">Though ringweight lifting had been beyond his strength and the full
<br><font color="green">{ms, 9}</font>
<br> circle gyration beyond his courage yet as a High school scholar he had
excelled in his stable and protracted execution of the half lever movement on
the parallel bars in consequence of his abnormally developed abdominal muscles.</p>
<p class="pStDir">(Part ii, NB 2)
<br><font color="green">{ms, 1}</font> </p>
<p class="pith">Did either openly allude to their racial difference?</p>
<p class="flush">Neither.</p>
<p class="pith">What did Bloom think that Stephen thought about Bloom?</p>
<p class="flush">He thought that he thought that he was a jew whereas he knew
that he knew that he knew that he was not.</p>
<p class="pith">What were their respective parentages?</p>
<p class="flush">Bloom, only male heir of Rudolf Virag
(subsequently<a target="foot" id="fsz0014">&ordm;</a> Rudolph Bloom) of
Szombath&eacute;ly, Milan, London and Dublin and of Margaret Higgins second
daughter of Julius Higgins (born Karoly) and
<a name="un4022t" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4022t">Fanny</a> Higgins
(born Hegarty). Stephen, eldest
<a name="un4049x" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4049x">surviving</a> male
heir of Simon Dedalus of Cork and Dublin and of Mary, daughter of Richard and Christina Goulding (born Grier).</p>
<p class="pith">Had Bloom and Stephen been baptised?</p>
<p class="flush">Bloom three times, by the
reverend<a target="foot" id="fsz0015">&ordm;</a> Mr Gilmer Johnston M.A., alone,
in the protestant church of Saint Nicholas Without, Coombe by James
O&apos;Connor, Philip Gilligan and James Fitzpatrick, together, under a pump in
the village of Swords, and by the reverend Charles Malone, C.C., in the
<a name="s18010bh" href="../../ff/unbs/s18all.htm#s18010bh">church of the Three
Patrons, Rathgar</a>. Stephen (once) by the reverend Charles Malone, C.C., alone
in the church of the Three Patrons, Rathgar.</p>
<p class="pith">Did they find their educational careers similar?</p>
<p class="flush">Bloom had passed successively through a dame&apos;s school and
the high school: Stephen through the preparatory, junior, middle and senior
grades of the intermediate and through the
matriculation<a target="foot" id="fsz0016">&ordm;</a>, first arts, second arts and degree courses of the university.</p>
<p class="pith">Why did Bloom refrain from stating that he had frequented the university of life?</p>
<p class="flush">Because of his incertitude as to whether
<a name="s17007as" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17007as">this observation had
been already made by him to Stephen or by Stephen to him.</a></p>
<p class="pith">What two temperaments did they individually represent?</p>
<p class="flush">The scientific. The artistic.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 2}</font> </p>
<p class="pith">What proofs did Bloom adduce to prove that his tendency was
towards applied, rather than to pure, science?</p>
<p class="flush">Certain possible inventions of which he had cogitated when
reclining on his back in a state of repletion to aid digestion, stimulated by
his appreciation of the importance of inventions now common but once
revolutionary, for example, the parachute, the
<a name="s17029c" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17029c">corkscrew</a>, the
safety pin, <a name="s17031m" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17031m">the canal lock</a>.</p>
<p class="pith">Were these inventions principally intended for an improved scheme of kindergarten?</p>
<p class="flush">Yes. They comprised astronomical kaleidoscopes exhibiting the
twelve constellations of the zodiac from Aries to Pisces, arithmetical
<a name="s17037i" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17037i">gelatine lozenges</a>,

<a name="s17019bn" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17019bn">globemap playing balls</a>, historically costumed dolls.</p>
<p class="pith">What also stimulated him in his cogitations?</p>
<p class="flush">The financial success achieved by Ephraim Marks and Charles A
James, the former by his 1d bazaar at 42 George&apos;s street, south, the latter

<p class="pith">Which example did he adduce to induce Stephen to comprehend that
originality does not invariably conduce to success?</p>
<p class="flush">His own ideated and rejected project of an illuminated

<p class="pith">What suggested scene was then constructed by Stephen?</p>
<p class="flush">A solitary hotel in a mountain pass. Autumn. Twilight. A fire

sits. <a name="s17048af" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17048af">She goes to

<p class="pith">Did he attribute this homonymity to information or

<p class="pith">What rendered problematic for Bloom the realisation of these mutually selfexcluding propositions?</p>
<p class="flush">The irreparability of the past: once at a performance of Albert
Hengler&apos;s circus in the Rotunda, Rutland square, Dublin an intuitive
particoloured clown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring to a
place in the auditorium where Bloom, solitary, was seated and had publicly
declared to an exhilarated audience that he (Bloom) was his (the clown&apos;s)
papa. The imprevidibility of the future: once in the summer of 1898 he (Bloom)
had marked a florin (2/-) with three notches on the milled edge and tendered it
in payment of an account due to and received by J and T Davy, family grocers, 1
Charlemont Mall, Grand Canal, for
circulation<a target="foot" id="fsz0038">&ordm;</a> on the waters of civic
finance, for possible, circuitous or direct, return.</p>
<p class="pith">Was the clown Bloom&apos;s son?</p>
<p class="flush">No.</p>
<p class="pith">Had Bloom&apos;s coin returned?</p>
<p class="flush">Never.</p>
<p class="pith">Why would a
<a name="s17007i" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17007i">recurrent</a> frustration the more depress him?</p>
<p class="flush">Because at the critical turningpoint of human existence he
desired to amend many social conditions, the product of inequality and avarice and international animosity.</p>
<p class="pith">He believed then that human life was infinitely perfectible, eliminating these conditions?</p>
<p class="flush">There remained the generic conditions imposed by natural, as
distinct from human law: the necessity of destruction to procure alimentary sustenance,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 13}</font>
<br> the painful character of birth and death, the monotonous menstruation of
simian and (particularly) human females extending from the age of puberty to the
menopause, inevitable accidents at sea, in mines and factories, certain very
painful maladies and their resultant surgical operations, innate lunacy and
criminality<a target="foot" id="fsz0039">&ordm;</a>, catastrophic cataclysms
which make terror the basis of human mentality, seismic upheavals the epicentres
of which are located in densely populated regions, the fact of vital growth from infancy through maturity to decay.</p>
<p class="pith">Why did he desist from speculation?</p>
<p class="flush">Because it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute
other phenomena in the place of those to be removed.</p>
<p class="pith">Did Stephen participate in his dejection?</p>
<p class="flush">He affirmed his significance as a
conscious<a target="foot" id="fsz0040">&ordm;</a> rational reagent between a
micro and a macrocosm constructed upon the incertitude of the void.</p>
<p class="pith">Was this affirmation apprehended by Bloom?</p>
<p class="flush">Not <a name="s17051an" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17051an">literally</a>, substantially.</p>
<p class="pith">What spectacle confronted them when they, first the host, then

<p class="pith">With what meditations did Bloom
accompany<a target="foot" id="fsz0041">&ordm;</a> his demonstration to his companion of various constellations?</p>
<p class="flush">Meditations increasingly vaster: of the infinite lattiginous

<p class="pith">Why did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result?</p>
<p class="flush">Because some years previously in 1886 when occupied with the
problem of the quadrature of the circle he had learned of the existence of a
number computed to be of such
<a name="s17013ak" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17013ak">magnitude</a>, e.g.,
the 9<sup>th</sup> power of the 9<sup>th</sup> power of 9, that 33 closely
printed volumes of 1000 pages each of innumerable quires and reams of India
paper would have to be requisitioned in order to contain the complete tale of its printed integers.</p>
<p class="pith">Did he find the problem of the inhabitability of the planets and
their <a name="un7029bi" href="../../ff/unbs/un7all.htm#un7029bi">satellites</a> easier of solution?</p>
<p class="flush">Of a different order of difficulty. Conscious that
<a name="s17047n" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17047n">the human organism
when elevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere suffered
from nasal hemorrhage</a><a target="foot" id="fsz0044">&ordm;</a>, impeded
respiration and vertigo, when proposing this problem for solution, he had
conjectured that a more ancient and differently constructed race of beings might
subsist otherwise under Martian,
<a name="un5023aw" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5023aw">Mercurial</a>,
Veneral, Jovian, Saturnian, Neptunian or Uranian conditions, though humanity
would probably there as here remain inalterably attached to vanities of vanities.</p>
<p class="pith">His logical conclusion?</p>
<p class="flush">That it was a Utopia, a past which possibly had ceased to exist
<a name="s17027an" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17027an">before its spectators had entered existence</a>.</p>
<p class="pith">Was he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle?</p>
<p class="flush">Indubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets
in the <a name="s17047f" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17047f">delirium of the

<p class="pith">What reflections occupied his mind during the process of reversion of the inverted volumes?</p>
<p class="flush">The necessity of order, a place for everything and everything
in its place: the deficient appreciation of literature possessed by females: the
incongruity of an apple incuneated in a tumbler and of an umbrella inclined in a

the left infracostal region below the diaphragm resulting from a sting inflicted
2 weeks and 3 days previously (23 May 1904) by a bee. He scratched imprecisely
with his right hand, though insensible of prurition, various points and surfaces
of his partly exposed wholly abluted skin. He inserted his left hand into the

<p class="pith">What other objects relative to Rudolph Bloom (born Virag) were in the 2<sup>nd</sup> drawer?</p>

<a name="s17047bp" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17047bp">Rudolph Virag and
his father Leopold Virag executed in the year 1852 in the portrait atelier of
their (respectively) 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> cousin, Stefan Virag of
Szesfehervar, Hungary</a>. An ancient hagadah book in which a pair of hornrimmed

<br> addressed: <u>To My Dear Son Leopold</u>.</p>
<p class="pith">What reminiscences did these objects evoke in Bloom?</p>
<p class="flush">An old man, widower, unkempt of hair, in bed, with head
covered, sighing: an infirm dog, Athos: veronal, resorted to by increasing doses
of <a name="s17030an" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17030an">grains and
scruples</a> as a palliative of recrudescent neuralgia: the face in death of a suicide by poison.</p>
<p class="pith">Why did Bloom experience a sentiment of remorse?</p>
<p class="flush">Because in immature impatience he had treated with disrespect
certain beliefs and <a name="s17007l" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17007l">practices</a>.</p>
<p class="pith">As?</p>
<p class="flush">The prohibition of the use of fleshmeat and milk at one meal:

scripture: the sanctity of the <a name="s17031o" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17031o">sabbath</a>.</p>
<p class="pith">How did these beliefs and
<a name="s17007l" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17007l">practices</a> now appear to him?</p>
<p class="flush">Not more rational than they had then appeared, not less

<p class="pith">What first reminiscence had he of Rudolph Bloom (deceased)?</p>
<p class="flush">Rudolph Bloom (deceased) narrated to his son Leopold Bloom
(aged 6) a retrospective arrangement of migrations and settlements in and
between Dublin, London, Florence, Milan, Szombathely with statements of
satisfaction (<a name="s17048ab" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17048ab">his

consultation of a geographical map of Europe (political) and by suggestions for
the establishment of affiliated business premises in the various centres mentioned.</p>
<p class="pith">Had time equally but differently obliterated the memory of these migrations in
<br><font color="green">{ms, 22}</font>
<br> narrator and listener?</p>
<p class="flush">In narrator by the access of years and in consequence of the
use of narcotic toxin: in listener by the access of years and in consequence of
the action of distraction upon vicarious experiences.</p>
<p class="pith">What idiosyncracies of the narrator were
<a name="un4049ah" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4049ah">concomitant</a> products of amnesia?</p>
<p class="flush">Occasionally he ate without having previously removed his hat.
Occasionally <a name="s17041ag" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17041ag">he
drank voraciously the juice of gooseberry fool from an inclined plate</a>.
Occasionally he removed from his lips the traces of food by means of a lacerated

endowment policy</a>, the bank pass book, the certificate of the possession of scrip.</p>
<p class="pith">From what reverse of fortune did these supports protect their possessor?</p>
<p class="flush">Mendicancy: that of the sandwichman, distributor of throwaways,
nocturnal vagrant, maimed sailor, blind stripling, bailiff&apos;s man. Poverty:
that of the outdoor hawker of imitation jewellery, the dun for the recovery of
bad and doubtful debts, the poor rate and deputy cess collector.</p>
<p class="pith">With which attendant indignities?</p>
<p class="flush">The indifference of previously amiable females, the contempt of
males, the acceptance of fragments of bread, the simulated ignorance of casual
acquaintances, the latration of illegitimate vagabond dogs, the infantile discharge of vegetable missiles.</p>
<p class="pith">By what could such a situation be precluded?
<br><font color="green">{ms, 23}</font> </p>

<p class="pith">What considerations rendered
departure<a target="foot" id="fsz0081">&ordm;</a> not entirely undesirable.</p>
<p class="flush">Constant cohabitation impeding mutual toleration of personal
defects. The habit of independent purchase increasingly cultivated.</p>
<p class="pith">What considerations rendered departure<a target="foot" id="fsz0082">&ordm;</a> not irrational?</p>
<p class="flush">The parties concerned, uniting, had increased and multiplied,
which being done, offspring produced and educed to maturity, the parties, if not
