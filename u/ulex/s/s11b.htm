<p class="pith">What course did Bloom and Stephen follow on their homeward way?</p>
<p class="flush">Lower and Middle Gardiner street they followed
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">till</span></span> Mountjoy square
west and then bore left along Gardiner&apos;s Place and took Temple street on
their right. They crossed the circus before George&apos;s church diametrically
towards Eccles street to shorten their journey, the chord in any circle being
lesser than the <a name="s17048i" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17048i">arc</a> which it subtends.</p>
<p class="pith"></p>
<p class="pith">Why did Bloom whistle? softly when they halted before his housesteps at number 7 Eccles street?</p>
<p class="flush">Not to call attention but because on putting his hand into the
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">ba</span></span> hip pocket he
discovered that he had forgotten his latchkey in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had left off</p>
<p class="pith">How did they enter the house?</p>
<p class="flush">By this stratagem. Bloom, not wishing to alarm his wife,
climbed over the area railings. He secured his hat on his head and gently
lowered himself to the full extent of his five feet nine inches to within two
feet eight inches of the area flags. Taking breath he allowed himself to drop by
his ten stone four weight), crouching on all fours
<a name="un4049bf" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4049bf">to break the
fall</a>. He then rose, lifted up the latch of the areadoor and made his way in
to the kitchen where he lit the gas and, husbanding the same match, a candle also.</p>
<p class="pith">Where was Stephen meanwhile?</p>
<p class="flush">On the footpath looking down. He saw Bloom make light in the
kitchen and beckon and then saw him unlace and put off him off his boots and
then leave the kitchen, holding the candle in a stick.</p>
<p class="pith">What happened after this?</p>
<p class="flush">[1Some few minutes] after this Stephen saw a glimmer on the
<a name="s17011i" href="../../ff/unbs/s17all.htm#s17011i">fanlight</a> over
Bloom&apos;s halldoor. The halldoor opened on its hinges slowly and Bloom,
without his hat and with his candlestick, appeared in the opening and said Sst! to enter.
