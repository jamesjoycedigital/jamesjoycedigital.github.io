<p> The milkwhite Dolphin tossed his Mane and, rising in
<br><font color="green">{ms, 14}</font>
<br> the golden Poop the Helmsman spread the glorious Sail upon the Wind. A many
comely Nymphs drew nigh to Starboard and to Larboard and clinging to the sides
of the noble Bark linked their shining Forms as doth the cunning Wheelwright
when he fashions about the Heart of his Wheel the equidistant Rays whereof each
one is Sister to another and he binds them all with an outer Ring and giveth
Speed to the Feet of Men
<a name="un4052ah" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4052ah">whenas</a> they ride
to an Hosting or contend for the Smile of Ladies fair. Even so did they come and
set them, those willing Nymphs, the undying sisters. And they laughed sporting
in a Circle of their Foam: and the Bark
<a name="s12003aj" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12003aj">clave</a> the Waves.</p>
<p> Martin and Jack Power did their level best to keep him quiet but Bloom had
his rag out. All the ragamuffins and guttersnipes of the place were jeering
round the car and says one of the fishgirls</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ay, mister. Look at your hat, mister!</p>
<p> What was it but Cusack
<br><font color="green">{ms, 15}</font>
<br> had stuck two of the bloody betting tickets in the front of Bloom&apos;s
topper and what was on it but: W.C. 13. Terry, the curate, and Alf Bergan were doubled up laughing:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, mister! Look at what&apos;s on your hat, mister.</p>
<p> Arra sure Bloom didn&apos;t know what was up till Jack stood up and took off
the tickets and all the sluts began to yell:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Eh, mister, give us a speech!</p>
<p> and the mudlarks screaming the Boys of Wexford. And Martin trying to get the
jarvey to drive on. But Bloom was on his high horse speeching a
<a name="s12001p" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12001p">harangue</a> out of him about the jews.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Mendelsohn was a jew, he says, and Karl Marx and
<a name="s12014bt" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12014bt">Mercadante</a> and
Spinoza and your god was a jew, he shouted, and his father was a jew</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What God? says Cusack.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He had no father, says Jack Power trying to pull him down.</p>
<p> Sure Bloom didn&apos;t know about father or mother, only shouting:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, your god was a jew. Your saviour, Christ, was a jew.</p>
<p> Cusack made one bound in:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; By this &amp; that, says he, I&apos;ll brain that bloody
jewman for using the holy name. Give us that
<a name="s12004l" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004l">biscuit tin</a> here.
By Jesus, I&apos;ll be the death of him. Give us here.</p>
<p> God there was meila murder.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Stop! Stop! says Alf.</p>
<p> However the jarvey began lashing the bloody nag and the street arabs began
to peg cabbage stumps, yelling like blazes.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Three cheers for the jew&apos;s droppings!</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Get your hair cut.</p>
<p> A large and appreciative gathering of friends and acquaintances assembled to
bid farewell to Mr Leopold Bloom on the occasion of his departure for a distant
clime. The ceremony which took place
<a name="s12001ap" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12001ap">under the most
favourable auspices</a> which was characterised by the most affecting cordiality
was rendered all the more picturesque by the presence of numerous delegates from
all parts of the provinces whose traditional national costumes lent a welcome
note of colour to the scene which went off with great &eacute;clat. An
illuminated scroll, the work of Irish artists, was presented to the
distinguished orientalist on behalf of a large section of the community and was
accompanied by the gift of a silver casket, tastefully executed in the style of
ancient Celtic ornament, a work which reflects every credit on the makers,
<a name="s12004l" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004l">Messrs Jacob and
Jacob</a>. The departing guest was made the recipient of a hearty ovation, many
of those present being visibly moved when the select orchestra of Irish pipes
<br><font color="green">{ms, 17}</font>
<br> struck<a target="foot" id="fnz0003">&ordm;</a> up the wellknown strains of
<u>Come Back to Erin</u> as a sendoff.
<a name="un4036be" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4036be">Amid the echoing
cheers</a> of the multitude
<a name="s12004u" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004u">that rent the
welkin</a> the vessel slowly put off, saluted by a final floral tribute from the
representatives of the fair sex who were present in large numbers. Gone but not forgotten!</p>
<p> There was a crowd in Capel street The jarvey, cute enough, got the
horse&apos;s head round when out runs Cusack and the bloody
<a name="s12004h" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004h">biscuit tin</a> in his
hand and little Alf trying to hold him and roaring:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Where is he till I murder him!</p>
<p> It was the mercy of God the sun was in his eyes. Anyway he made a swipe in
the air and let fly. God, he near sent it into the county Longford. The bloody
tin fell on the cobblestones with a clatter that would waken the dead. You know
he&apos;s a powerful fellow Cusack.
<a name="s12007ah" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12007ah">Best man in Ireland
in his time at putting the fiftysix pound shot.</a> That&apos;s a fact. He won
prizes and cups and medals. O, Cusack was a famous man in his day, faith.</p>
<p> Well you should have heard the hullaballoo of the crowd and the horse took
fright and off with him and Garryowen after him and all the ragtag and bobtail after the car, warhooping.</p>
<p> The catastrophe was terrific and instantaneous in its effect. The
observatory of Dunsink registered in all eleven shocks and there is no record of
a similar seismic disturbance in our island since the great earthquake of
<a name="un2002b" href="../../ff/unbs/un2all.htm#un2002b">1534</a> the year of
the rebellion of
<a name="un2002a" href="../../ff/unbs/un2all.htm#un2002a">Thomas Fitzgerald</a>,
<a name="un2002d" href="../../ff/unbs/un2all.htm#un2002d">silken knight</a>. The
epicentre appears to have been that part of the metropolis which constitutes the
Inn&apos;s Quay Ward and parish of saint
<br><font color="green">{ms, 18}</font>
<br> Michan. All the palatial residences in the immediate vicinity of the palace
of justice were demolished and the noble edifice itself in which at the time of
the catastrophe important legal debates were in progress is literally a mass of
ruins beneath which, it is only to be feared, all the occupants have found death
alive. From the reports of eyewitnesses it has transpired that the seismic waves
were accompanied by a violent atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic character. An
article of headgear, since ascertained to belong to the much respected clerk of
the crown and peace, Mr George Fottrell, and a silk umbrella with gold handle
with the engraved initials, crest, coat of arms and genealogical tree of the
erudite and worshipful chairman of quarter sessions recorder of Dublin, sir
Frederick Falkiner, were discovered by search parties in remote parts of the
island respectively, the former on the third basaltic ridge of
<a name="s12006ba" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12006ba">the Giant&apos;s
causeway</a> in Antrim, the latter embedded to the extent of one foot three
inches in the sandy beach of Holeopen bay beneath the old head of Kinsale,
latitude 64', longitude, 17. Other eyewitnesses state that they observed an
incandescent object of huge volume and of unknown proportions hurtling through
the atmosphere at a terrifying velocity in a trajectory directed southwest by
west. Messages of condolence and sympathy are being hourly received from all parts of different continents
<br><font color="green">{ms, 19}</font>
<br> and the sovereign pontiff has been graciously pleased to order that a
special <u>missa pro defunctis</u> shall be celebrated simultaneously by the
ordinary of each &amp; every parish church of all episcopal dioceses subject to
the spiritual authority of the holy see in suffrage of the souls of those
faithful departed who have been so unexpectedly called away from our midst. The
work of salvage and of removal of debris, human remains etc has been entrusted
to Messrs Michael Meade and Son of 4 Great Brunswick street and to Messrs T. and
C Martin, 18 North Wall, assisted by the men and officers of the Duke of
Cornwall&apos;s light infantry
<a name="s12003b" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12003b">col. Jameson &amp;
officers of the Seaforth Highlanders</a> under the general supervision of H.R.H.
rear admiral the Rt. Hon sir Hercules Hannibal Habeas Corpus Anderson, K.G.,
K.P., K.T., P.C., K.C.B., M.P., J.P., M.B., D.S.O., S.O.D, M.F.H., M.R.I.A,

<p> Tare and ages it was the grandest sight you ever seen
<a name="un3014a" href="../../ff/unbs/un3all.htm#un3014a">in all your born
puff</a>. Bloom up on the bloody car trying to blather out of him that he was a
jew and his father and not ashamed of it, and the mudlarks yelling like old
boots and the bloody tin bursting open and the bloody dog after it &amp; all
<a name="s12007ac" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12007ac">the great
unwashed</a> after the dog and the horse galloping like mad and the jarvey
<a name="s12014bq" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12014bq">belabouring</a> it
man, and the sparks flying out of his hoofs. Uproar &amp; holy murder!
<a name="s12004al" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004al">By the mortal
frost</a>, if he got that tin on the head he would have been carted off to
Jervis street on a shutter and, by God, Cusack would have been lagged for
<a name="s12004bc" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004bc">assault</a> and Joe
and Tom for <a name="s12002bv" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12002bv">aiding
and abetting</a> <a name="s12004bc" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004bc">and
battery</a>. The jarvey saved his life as sure as God made
<br><font color="green">{ms, 20}</font>
<br> little apples. What? O, he did, faith. Cusack let
<a name="s12007av" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12007av">a volley of
oaths</a> after him Where is he?, the bloody sicklooking
<a name="s12002ac" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12002ac">kaffir</a>? says he.
Did I kill him or what? Terry and little Alf Bergan took him by the arm to hold
him back but he kept shouting to the bloody dog. After him, Garry. After him,
bloody curse to you! And the last we saw was the car turn the corner with Bloom
gesticulating and the bloody dog after it with his lugs back for all he was bloody well worth.</p>
<p> When, lo, there came about them all a great Brightness and they beheld a
golden Chariot, wherein He stood ascend to Heaven even Him, ben Bloom Elijah.
And they beheld Him in the Chariot, clothed upon in the Glory of the Brightness,
having Raiment as of the Sun, fair as the Moon and terrible that for awe they
durst not look upon him. And there came a Voice out of Heaven, saying
<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">unread</span></font>!
Elijah! And He answered with a
<a name="s12004s" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004s">main cry</a>: Abba,
Adonai:, Abba. And they beheld Him amid Clouds of angels ascend to to the Glory
of the Brightness at an angle of fortyfive degrees over Donohoe&apos;s in Little
Green street like a shot off a shovel.</p> </p>  </main>
