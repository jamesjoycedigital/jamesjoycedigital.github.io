<p class="pdi">&mdash; Blatherskite says Cusack. Can you point to any other part
of the wide world where the population has decreased to fifty per cent in fifty
years<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span> under a
civilised government? Where are the thirty millions of Irish should be here
today instead of four? Where are our potteries and textiles, the finest in the
world? Look at the beds of the Barrow and Shannon they won&apos;t deepen. Where
is the other civilised government would
<a name="un3005e" href="../../ff/unbs/un3all.htm#un3005e">leave us as treeless
as Portugal</a> with a million acres of marsh &amp; bog to make us all die of
consumption? Not a ship to be seen in our harbours, Queenstown, Kinsale, Galway,
Killybegs, the third biggest harbour in the world. We had our trade with Spain
and Europe before they were born and with the Flemings too. We had Spanish ale
&amp; wine in Galway, the winebark on the winedark waterway. First, they tried
to slaughter us all, then to banish us, then to make us paupers and to starve
us. Then to buy us as they buy everything else
(<a name="s12004bi" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004bi">when all fruit
fails welcome haws</a>) but they&apos;re as far off now as they were 700 years
ago when they first came here and damnation well they know. But they&apos;ll
know more than that and to their cost when the first Irish battleship is seen
breasting the waves with the green flag at her helm.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The cows in Connacht have long horns, Mick, says Ned.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Long or short, says Cusack, is all one. Our history that Geoffrey Keating
<br><font color="green">{ms, 6}</font>
<br> wrote, in the fortresses of the Galtees is not finished yet. What did John
Mitchel says: The last conquest of Ireland (perhaps!)
<p class="spbr"><font color="green">(U84 1329-1353)</font></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And what about the British navy? says &mdash;.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What about it? says Cusack. I&apos;ll tell you about it.
Did you read the revelations that&apos;s going on</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What&apos;s that? says Hynes.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; British navy regulations, says Cusack, about flogging on
the trainingships at Portsmouth. There&apos;s a chap writing to the papers calls
himself <u>Disgusted</u>. By God, he gives chapter and verse too. The whole
bloody crew drawn up on the lower deck and the parson with his bible and
officers and admiral of the fleet. Then they lug out the young chap to give him
what that bloody old ruffian sir John Beresford called a rump and dozen, and tie him down over a gun, straddled out.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Stripped, is it?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; With a pair of duck trousers on him</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That&apos;s right, says J.J. God&apos;s Englishman
distinguishes between the breech and the bare breech.</p>
<p> So of course O&apos;Madden Burke put in his goo.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; &apos;Tis a custom more honoured in the breech than in the observance, says he.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And then comes the master-at-arms, says Cusack, with a
long cane &amp; by the hokey poky he flogs the bloody backside off the poor chap till he yells meila murder.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Bloody in all senses of the word, says Lenehan.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That was used in ancient Sparta, says the professor. The
victory of Trafalgar was won on the whipping stools of Portsmouth.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And that&apos;s your British navy, says Cusack, the
fellows that never will be slaves, with the only hereditary chamber in Europe
and their land in the hands of twentyfive lords. Did we stand that in Ireland,
eh? What about the land league, eh, the most wonderful organisation in the
history of the universe. And they talk of the liberty of their empire of drudges &amp; serfs.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; On which the sun never rises, says young Dedalus</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ay, says Cusack, and the unfortunate yahoos believe it.</p>
<p> They believe in Rod, the Scourger Almighty, Flayer and Boss of the Earth, and in Jacky Tar, the Son of a gun.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">If</span></span> It&apos;s well they do, if no one else does, says JJ.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Liars and hyrocrites, says O&apos;Madden Burke</p>
<p> The soul of war heeded him not:
<a name="un5015ak" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5015ak">red was his rolling
eye</a>. He seized the harp that hung on Tara&apos;s walls: and his strong hands
swept the chords. Song burst from his lips: terrible was his mien.</p>
<p class="set">O Ireland! Our sireland!
<br> Once fireland! Now mireland!
<br> No liar land shall buy our land!
<br> A higher land is Ireland!</p> </p>  </main>
