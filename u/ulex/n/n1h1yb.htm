<p> There entered one of the clan of the O&apos;Molloy&apos;s a comely hero, of
white face but withal somewhat ruddy, his majesty&apos;s counsel learned in the
law: and with him the prince and heir of the noble house of Lambert.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Hello, Ned.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Hello, Alf</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Hello, Jack</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Hello, Bob
<p class="spbr"><font color="green">(U84 1084-1140)</font></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; How did that swindle case go off? Were you round there?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Remanded. <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Yes, I was.</span></span></p>
<p> Bloody jewman it was went by the name of James Wought alias Saphiro alias
Spark and Spiro put an ad in the papers saying he&apos;d give you a passage to
Canada for a quid. What? Course it was a barney. Swindled them all, skivvies and
badhochs from the county Meath, ay, and his own kidney too. J.J. was telling us
there was an ancient Hebrew Zaretsky or something came up weeping for his
goodlooking sovereign. Put on his hat to swear in the witnessbox</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Who tried the case?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The recorder.</p>
<p> And on the sixteenth day of the month of the oxeyed goddess, ruler of the
heavens, the daughter of the skies being then in her first quarter, the lady
moon, those learned judges, dight in the garb of justice, repaired them to their
halls of law. There Master Courtenay, sitting in his own chamber, gave rede and
master Justice Andrews, sitting without a jury in the probate court, weighed
well and pondered in the matter of the will propounded and last testamentary
scriptory disposition of the real and personal estate of the late lamented Jacob
Halliday, vintner, deceased, versus Livingstone of unsound mind and another. And
to the solemn court of Green street came Frederick the Falconer. And then set he
to administer the law of the brehons of the commission to be holden in and for
the county of the city of Dublin. And there sat with him the noble sinhedrim of
the twelve tribes of Erin, for each tribe one man, of the tribe of Patrick and
of the tribe of Hugh and of the tribe of Owen and of the tribe of Conn and of
the tribe of Oscar and of the tribe of Fergus and of the tribe of Finn and of
the tribe of Dermot and of the tribe of Cormac and of the tribe of Kevin and of
the tribe of Fingal and of the tribe of Ossian, there being in all twelve good
men and true. And he conjured them by Him who died on rood that they should well
<br><font color="green">{ms, 8}</font>
<br> and truly try and true deliverance make in the issue joined between their
sovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the bar and true verdict give
according to the evidence so help them God and kiss the book. And they rose in
their seats, the twelve of Erin, and they sware by the name of Him Who is from
everlasting that they would do His Righteousness. And straightway the minions of
the law led forth from their donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of justice
had apprehended in consequence of information received. And they shackled him
hand and foot and arraigned him there and would take of him ne bail ne mainprise
but preferred a charge against him. For he was a malefactor.
<p class="spbr"><font color="green">(U84 1096-1102)</font></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Poor old recorder, says Alf. You can bamboozle him up to the two eyes.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He has a heart as big a lion, says Ned. Tell him a tale
of woe about arrears of rent and a sick wife and a squad of children and, faith,
he&apos;ll weep on the bench before you.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ay, say Alf, and if poor bugger had up by a loan society
or a moneylender by herrings the bloody jewman is safe if the recorder doesn&apos;t clap in the dock.
<p class="spbr"><font color="green">(U84 129-140)</font></p>
<p> Cusack was telling Joe about the <a name="s12001cp" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12001cp">ribbonmen</a>.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What&apos;s your opinion of the times?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I think the markets are on a rise.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Foreign wars is the cause of it.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It&apos;s the Russians wish to tyrannise</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <a name="s12001ck" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12001ck">What&apos;s the age of the moon</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Really I don&apos;t know.</a></p>
<p> Then he rubs his right hand over his eye and the other fellow
<a name="s12001cm" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12001cm">slides his left hand
down his pocket</a> and then the first chap puts his hand on his knee and the
other fellow sticks his thumb in his breeches pocket.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I don&apos;t see the advantage of
<a name="s12001cq" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12001cq">kilts</a> then, says Joe.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;
<a name="s12001cq" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12001cq">Scratch your arse quicker</a>, says Ned.</p> </p>  </main>
