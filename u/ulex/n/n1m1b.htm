<p> The<a target="foot" id="fnz0019">&ordm;</a> figure seated on a large
threelegged stool was that of a broadshouldered, deepchested, stronglimbed,
blueeyed, redhaired, shaggybearded, widemouthed, largenosed, longheaded,
deepvoiced, barekneed, brawnyhanded, hairylegged, ruddyfaced, sinewyarmed hero.
From shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his eggshaped knees
covered <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">wi</span></span>, as was
the rest of his body wherever visible, with a strong growth of tawny prickly
hair similar to the mountain gorse,fucta montanis. The widewinged nostrils, from
which bristles of the same tawny hue projected, were of such capacity that
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">in</span></span> within their
cavernous obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest. The eyes in
which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the dimension of a
goodsized cauliflower. A powerful current of warm steaming breath issued at
regular intervals from the profound cavity of his mouth while in rhythmic
regularity the loud strong hale reverberations of his heart resounded deeply
causing the ground and the walls of the building to vibrate and tremble not unpleasantly.</p>
<p> He wore a long sleeveless garment of saffron wool, reaching to the knees in
a loose kilt, and this was bound about his waist with a girdle of plaited
rushes. Beneath this he wore trews of deerskin, cunningly sewn with gut. Across his shoulders was flung a
<br><font color="green">{ms, 30}</font>
<br> manyfolded<a target="foot" id="fnz0020">&ordm;</a> cloak of dark seagreen
which was clasped together at the breastbone by a brooch or torc of mottled
marble. He wore on his legs buskinlike stocks dyed with the purple of lichens
while his <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">l</span></span>
extensive feet were encased
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">wi</span></span> in
<a name="un2024a" href="../../ff/unbs/un2all.htm#un2024a">brogues</a> of cowhide
laced with strips of the same beast. From his girdle rung a row of seastones
which jangled at every movement and on which were graven with rude yet striking
art the heads of various famous heroes, Cuchulin,
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Rory O&apos;More,</span></span>
Conn of Hundred Battles, Niall of Nine Hostages, Brian of Thomond, the ardri
Malachy, Art Mac Murragh, Shane O&apos;Neill, Owen Roe, Patrick, Red Hugh
O&apos;Donnell, Don Philip O&apos;Sullivan Beare. A javelin spear of pointed
granite rested near him while at his feet reposed a savage animal of the dog
tribe whose stertorous snoring announced that he was sunk in uneasy slumber, a
fact confirmed by repressed growls and convulsive movements which his master
silenced from time to time by quieting blows of a formidable
