<p> I was just passing the time of day with old Troy of the D.M.P. at the corner
of Arbour hill there and be damned but a bloody sweep came along and he near
drove his gear into my eye. I turned around to let him have
<a name="s12003aa" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12003aa">the weight of my
tongue</a> when who should I see dodging along Stony<a target="foot" id="fnn0001">&ordm;</a> Batter only Joe Hynes.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Lo, Joe, says I. How are you blowing? Did you see that
bloody chimneysweep near shove my eye out with his brush?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Soot&apos;s luck, says Joe. Who&apos;s the old ballocks
you were talking<a target="foot" id="fnn0002">&ordm;</a> to?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Old Troy, says I, was
<a name="s12002bt" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12002bt">in the force</a>.
I&apos;m on two minds not to give that fellow in charge for obstructing the
thoroughfare with his brooms and ladders.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What are you doing round those parts? says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Devil a much, says I.
There&apos;s<a target="foot" id="fnn0003">&ordm;</a> a bloody big foxy thief
beyond by the garrison church at the corner of Chicken
lane<a target="foot" id="fnn0004">&ordm;</a> &mdash; old Troy was just giving me
a wrinkle about him &mdash; lifted any God&apos;s quantity of tea and sugar to
pay three bob a week said he had a farm in the county Down off a hop of my
thumb<a target="foot" id="fnn0005">&ordm;</a> by the name of Moses Herzog over there near Heytesbury street.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Circumcised?<a target="foot" id="fnn0006">&ordm;</a> says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ay, says I. A bit off the top. An old plumber named
Geraghty. I&apos;m hanging on to his taw now for the past fortnight and I can&apos;t get a penny out of him.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That the lay you&apos;re on now? says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ay, says I. How are the mighty fallen! Collector of
<a name="jn1039q" href="../../ff/unbs/jn1all.htm#jn1039q">bad and  doubtful
debts</a>. But that&apos;s the most notorious bloody robber you&apos;d meet in a
day&apos;s walk and the face on him all pockmarks would hold a shower of rain.
Tell him, says he, I dare him, says he,<a target="foot" id="fnn0009">&ordm;</a>
and I doubledare him to send you round here again, or if he does, says he,
I&apos;ll have him summonsed up before the court, so I will, for trading without
a licence. And he after stuffing himself till he&apos;s fit to
burst!<a target="foot" id="fnn0011">&ordm;</a> Jesus I had to laugh at the
little jewy getting his shirt out. <i>He drink me my teas. He eat me my sugars. Why he no pay me my moneys</i>.</p>

<p class="di">&mdash; Are you a strict t.t.? says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Not taking anything between drinks, says I.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What about paying our respects to our friend? says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who? says I. Sure, he&apos;s
out<a target="foot" id="fnn0021">&ordm;</a> in John of God&apos;s
<a name="s12002s" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12002s">off his head</a>, poor man.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="s12002s" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12002s">Drinking his own stuff?</a> says Joe. </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ay, says I. Whisky and water on the brain.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Come around to Barney Kiernan&apos;s, says Joe. I want to see the citizen.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Barney
<a name="un5001cc" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5001cc">mavourneen&apos;s</a>
be it, says I. Anything strange or wonderful, Joe?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Not a word, says Joe. I was up at that meeting in the City Arms.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What was that, Joe? says I.<a target="foot" id="fnn0022">&ordm;</a></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Cattle traders, says Joe, about the foot and mouth
disease. I want to give the citizen
<a name="s12004p" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004p">the hard word</a> about it.</p>
<p> So we went around by the Linenhall barracks and the back of the courthouse
talking of one thing or another. Decent fellow Joe when he has it but sure like
that he never has it. Jesus, I couldn&apos;t get over that bloody foxy Geraghty. For trading without a licence, says he.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 282}</font> </p>
<p> In <a name="s12011bt" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12011bt">Inisfail the
fair</a> there lies a land, the land of holy Michan. There rises a watchtower
beheld of men afar. There sleep the mighty dead as in life they slept, warriors
and princes of high renown. A pleasant land it is in sooth of murmuring waters,
<a name="s12010a" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12010a">fishful</a> streams
where sport the
<a name="s12003f" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12003f">gurnard</a><a target="foot" id="fnn0023">&ordm;</a>,
the plaice, the
<a name="s12010h" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12010h">halibut</a>, the
flounder the
<a name="s12003g" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12003g">pollock</a> and other
denizens of the acqueous kingdom too numerous to be enumerated. In the mild
breezes of the west and of the east the lofty trees wave in different directions
their firstclass<a target="foot" id="fnn0025">&ordm;</a> foliage, the sycamore,
the Lebanonian cedar, the exalted planetree, the eucalyptus and other ornaments
of the arboreal world with which that region is thoroughly well supplied. Lovely
maidens sit in close proximity to the roots of the lovely trees singing the most
lovely songs while they play with all kinds of lovely objects as for example
golden ingots, silvery fishes, purple seagems and playful insects. And heroes
voyage from afar to woo them, the sons of kings. </p>
<p> And there rises a
<a name="s12006aa" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12006aa">shining palace whose
crytally glittering roof</a> is seen by mariners who traverse the extensive sea
in barks built for that purpose,<a target="foot" id="fnn0027">&ordm;</a> and
thither come all herds and fatlings and firstfruits of that land for
O&apos;Connell Fitzsimon takes toll of them, a chieftain descended from
chieftains. Thither the extremely large wains bring
<a name="un5001g" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5001g">foison of</a> the
fields, spherical potatoes and irridescent kale and onions, pearls of the earth,
and red, green, yellow, brown, russet, sweet, big, bitter, ripe, pomellated
apples and strawberries fit for princes and raspberries from their canes.</p>
<p> I dare him, says he, and I doubledare him.</p>
<p> And thither wend the herds innumerable of heavyhooved kine from pasturelands
of Lusk<a target="foot" id="fnn0035">&ordm;</a> and Rush and Carrickmines and
from the <a name="s12004t" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004t">streamy
vales</a> of Thomond and from the gentle declivities of
the<a target="foot" id="fnn0036">&ordm;</a> place of the race of Kiar, their
udders distended with superabundance of milk and butter and rennets of cheese
and oblong eggs, various in size, the agate with the dun.</p>
<p> So we turned into Barney Kiernan&apos;s and there, sure enough, was the
citizen <a name="un4021df" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4021df">as large as
life</a> up in the corner having a great confab with himself and that  bloody
mangy mongrel, Garryowen, and he waiting for what the sky would drop in the way of drink.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There he is, says I,
<a name="s12009e" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12009e">in his glory hole</a>,
with his load of papers working for the cause.</p>
<p> The bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps. Be a
corporal work of mercy if someone would take the life of that bloody dog.
I&apos;m told for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off a constabulary
man in Santry that came round one time with a blue paper about a licence.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Stand and deliver, says he.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That&apos;s all right, citizen, says Joe. Friends here.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Pass, friends, says he.</p>
<p> Then he <a name="s12001cl" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12001cl">rubs his hand in his eye</a> and says he:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="s12001ci" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12001ci">What&apos;s your opinion of the times?</a></p>
<p> Doing the rapparee. But, begob, Joe was equal to the occasion.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="s12001ci" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12001ci">I think the markets
are on a rise</a>, says<a target="foot" id="fnn0037">&ordm;</a> he,
<a name="s12001cm" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12001cm">sliding his hand down his</a> fork.</p>
<p> So begob the citizen
<a name="s12001cn" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12001cn">claps his paw on his knee</a> and he says:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="s12001cj" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12001cj">Foreign wars is the cause of it</a>.</p>
<p> And says Joe, <a name="s12001co" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12001co">sticking his thumb in his pocket</a>:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="s12001cj" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12001cj">It&apos;s the Russians wish to tyrannise.</a></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Arrah, give over your bloody
codding,<a target="foot" id="fnn0038">&ordm;</a> Joe, says I.
<a name="s12005bc" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12005bc">I&apos;ve a thirst
on me I wouldn&apos;t sell for half a crown.</a></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Give it a name, citizen, says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <a name="s12004am" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004am">Wine of the country</a>, says he.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What&apos;s yours? says Joe.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 284}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ditto MacAnaspey, says I.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Three pints, Terry, says Joe. And how&apos;s the old heart, citizen? says he.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Never better, <i>a
chara</i>,<a target="foot" id="fnn0039">&ordm;</a> says he. What Garry? Are we going to win? Eh?</p>
<p> And with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck and, by Jesus, he near throttled him. </p>
<p> The figure seated on a large boulder was that of a broadshouldered,
deepchested, stronglimbed, frankeyed, redhaired freely freckled, shaggybearded,
widemouthed, largenosed, longheaded deepvoiced, barekneed, brawnyhanded,
hairylegged, ruddyfaced,<a target="foot" id="fnn0041">&ordm;</a> sinewyarmed
hero. From shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his rocklike knees
were covered, as was likewise the rest of his body wherever visible, with a
strong growth of tawny prickly hair in hue and toughness similar to the mountain
gorse (Ulex Europeus). The widewinged nostrils, from which bristles of the same
tawny hue projected, were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous
obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest. The eyes in which a
tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the dimension of a
goodsized cauliflower. A powerful current of warm breath issued at regular
intervals from the profound cavity of his mouth while in rhythmic resonance the
loud strong hale reverberations of his formidable heart thundered rumblingly
causing the ground and the lofty walls of the cave to vibrate and tremble.</p>
<p> He wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to the
knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a girdle of plaited
straw and rushes. Beneath this he wore trews of deerskin, roughly stitched with
gut. His nether extremities were encased in high buskins dyed in lichen purple,
the feet being shod with
<a name="un2024a" href="../../ff/unbs/un2all.htm#un2024a">brogues</a> of salted
cowhide laced with the windpipe of the same beast. From his girdle hung a row of
seastones which jangled<a target="foot" id="fnn0042">&ordm;</a> at every
movement of his portentous frame and on these were graven with rude yet striking
art the tribal images of many heroes of antiquity, Cuchulin, Conn of hundred
battles, Niall of nine hostages, Brian of Kincora, the
ardri<a target="foot" id="fnn0043">&ordm;</a> Malachi, Art Mac Murragh, Shane
O&apos;Neill, Father John Murphy, Owen Roe, Patrick Sarsfield, Red Hugh
O&apos;Donnell, Don Philip O&apos;Sullivan Beare. A spear of acuminated granite
rested by him while at his feet reposed a savage animal of the canine tribe
whose stertorous gasps announced that he was sunk in uneasy slumber, a
supposition confirmed by hoarse growls and spasmodic movements which his master
repressed from time to time by tranquilising blows of a mighty
<a name="un4045ae" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4045ae">cudgel</a> rudely
<a name="un2024b" href="../../ff/unbs/un2all.htm#un2024b">fashioned out of paleolithic stone</a>.</p>
<p> So anyhow Terry brought the three pints Joe was standing and begob the sight
nearly left my eyes when I saw him land out a quid. O,
<a name="un4017au" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4017au">as true as I&apos;m
telling you</a>. A goodlooking sovereign.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And there&apos;s more where that came from, says he.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Were you robbing a poorbox, Joe? says I.<a target="foot" id="fnn0046">&ordm;</a></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Sweat of my brow, says Joe. &apos;Twas the prudent member gave me the wheeze.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I saw him before I met you, says I, sloping around by Pill
lane with his cod&apos;s eye counting up all the guts of the fish.</p>

<p> Ah! Ow! Don&apos;t be talking! I was blue mouldy for the want of that pint.
Declare to God I could hear it hit the pit of my stomach with a click.</p>
<p> And lo, as they quaffed their cup of joy, a godlike messenger came running
in, radiant as the eye of heaven, a comely youth. And behind him there passed an

know what was up and Alf kept making signs out of the door. And begob what was
it only that bloody old pantaloon Denis Breen in his bathslippers with two
bloody big books tucked under his oxter and the wife

<p class="di">&mdash; When is that long John going to hang that fellow in Mountjoy? says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Bergan, says Bob Doran, waking up. Is that Alf Bergan.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, says Alf. Hanging?
<a name="un4045bs" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4045bs">Wait till I show
you</a>. Here, Terry, give us

bloody old fool! Ten thousand pounds. You should have seen long John&apos;s eye. U. p&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> And he started laughing.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who are you laughing at? says Bob
Doran.<a target="foot" id="fnn0062">&ordm;</a> Is that Bergan?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Hurry up, Terry boy, says Alf, with the stout.</p>
<p> Terence O&apos;Ryan heard him and straightway brought him a crystal cup
 full of the foamy ebon ale which the
<a name="s12004m" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004m">noble twin
brothers</a>

ever in their divine alevats, cunning as the sons of deathless Leda. For they
garner the succulent berries of the hop and mass and sift and bruise and brew
them and they mix therewith sour juices and bring the must to the sacred fire
and cease not night or day from their toil, those cunning brothers, lords of the vat.</p>
<p> <a name="s12015b" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12015b">Then did you</a>,
<a name="s12015b" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12015b">Terence</a>, hand
forth, <a name="s12008aa" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12008aa">as to the
manner born</a>, that nectarous beverage and you offered the crystal cup to him
that thirsted, in beauty akin to the immortals.</p>
<p> But he, the young chief of the O&apos;Bergan&apos;s, could ill
<a name="s12004bk" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004bk">brook</a> to be
outdone in generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious gesture a testoon of
costliest bronze. Thereon embossed in excellent smith work was seen the image of
a queen of regal port, Victoria her name,

queen of Great Britain and Ireland</a>,

<br><font color="green">{u22, 288}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What&apos;s that bloody freemason doing, says the citizen, prowling up and down outside?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What&apos;s that? says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Here you are, says Alf, chucking out the rhino. Talking
about hanging,<a target="foot" id="fnn0063">&ordm;</a> I&apos;ll show you
something you never saw. Hangmen&apos;s<a target="foot" id="fnn0064">&ordm;</a> letters. Look at here.</p>
<p> So he took a bundle of wisps of letters and envelopes out of his pocket.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Are you codding? says<a target="foot" id="fnn0065">&ordm;</a> I.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="s12008h" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12008h">Honest injun</a>, says Alf. Read them.</p>
<p> So Joe took up the letters.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who were you laughing at? says Bob Doran.</p>
<p> So I saw there was going to be a bit of a dust Bob&apos;s a queer chap when
the porter&apos;s up in him so says I just to make talk: </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; How&apos;s Willie Murray those times, Alf?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I don&apos;t know, says Alf. I saw him just now in Capel
street<a target="foot" id="fnn0067">&ordm;</a> with Paddy Dignam. Only I was running after that&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You what? says Joe, throwing down the letters. With who?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; With Dignam, says Alf.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Is it Paddy? says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, says Alf. Why?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Don&apos;t you know he&apos;s dead? says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Paddy Dignam dead! says Alf.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ay, says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Sure I&apos;m after seeing him not five minutes ago, says Alf, as plain as a pikestaff.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who&apos;s dead? says Bob Doran.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You saw his ghost then, says Joe, God between us and harm.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What? says Alf. Good Christ, only five&nbsp;&hellip;
What?&nbsp;&hellip; And Willie Murray with him, the two of them there near what
do you call him&apos;s&nbsp;&hellip; What? Dignam dead?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What about Dignam? says Bob Doran. Who&apos;s talking about&nbsp;&hellip;?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Dead! says Alf. He&apos;s<a target="foot" id="fnn0068">&ordm;</a> no more dead than you are.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Maybe so, says Joe. They took the liberty of burying him this morning anyhow.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Paddy? says Alf.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ay, says Joe.
<a name="s12004aa" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004aa">He paid the debt of nature</a>, God be merciful to him.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Good Christ! says Alf.</p>
<p> Begod he was <a name="un4017c" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4017c">what you might call</a> flabbergasted.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 289}</font> </p>
<p> In the darkness, spirit hands were felt to flutter, and when
<a name="un5015t" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5015t">prayer by</a> tantras
had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing luminosity of
dark ruby light became gradually visible, the apparition
<a name="un1013bh" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1013bh">of the etheric
double</a> being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge of
<a name="un1013bp" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1013bp">jivic rays from the
crown of the head</a> and face. Communication was effected through
<a name="un1013bs" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1013bs">the pituitary
body</a> and also by means of the
<a name="un1013bi" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1013bi">orangefiery</a> and
<a name="un1013bj" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1013bj">scarlet rays
emanating</a> from the
<a name="un1013bi" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1013bi">sacral region</a>
and <a name="un1013bj" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1013bj">solar
plexus</a>. Questioned as to his whereabouts he stated that he was now on the
path of <a name="un1013l" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1013l">pralaya or
return</a> but was still submitted to trial at the hands of certain
<a name="s12015a" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12015a">bloodthirsty entities
on the lower astral levels</a>. In reply to a question as to his first
sensations beyond he stated that previously he had seen but as in a glass darkly
but that those who had passed over had summit possibilities of atmic development
opened up to them. Interrogated as to whether life there resembled our
experience in the flesh he stated that he had heard from more favoured beings
that their abodes were equipped with every modern comfort and that the highest
adepts were steeped in waves of volupcy of the very purest nature. Having
requested a quart of buttermilk this was brought and evidently afforded relief.
Asked if he had any message for the living he exhorted all who were still at the
wrong side of maya to acknowledge the true path for it was reported in devanic
circles that <a name="s12015h" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12015h">Mars and
Jupiter were out for mischief on the eastern angle where the ram has power</a>.
It was then queried whether there were any special desires on the part of the
defunct and the reply was: <i>Mind C.&nbsp;K. doesn&apos;t pile it on.</i> It
was ascertained that the reference was to Mr Cornelius Kelleher, manager of
Messrs H.&nbsp;J. O&apos;Neill&apos;s popular funeral establishment, a personal
friend of the defunct who had been responsible for the carrying out of the
interment arrangements. Before departing he requested that it should be told to
his dear son Patsy that the other boot which he had been looking for was at
present under the commode in the return room and that the pair should be sent to
<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font> to
be soled only as the heels were still good. He stated that this had greatly
perturbed his peace of mind in the other region and earnestly requested that his
desire should be made known. Assurances were given that the matter would be
attended to and it was intimated that this had given satisfaction.</p>
<p> He is gone from mortal haunts: O&apos;Dignam, sun of our morning. Fleet was
his foot on the bracken: Patrick of the beamy brow. Wail, Banba, with your wind:
and wail, O ocean, with your whirlwind. 
<br><font color="green">{u22, 290}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There he is again, says the citizen, staring out.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who? says I.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Bloom, says he. He&apos;s on point duty up and down there for the last ten minutes.</p>
<p> And, begob, I saw him do a peep in and then slidder off again.</p>
<p> Little Alf was knocked bawways. Faith, he was.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Good Christ! says he. I could have sworn it was him.</p>
<p> And says Bob Doran, with the hat on the back of his poll, lowest blackguard
in Dublin when he&apos;s under the influence</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who said Christ is good?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I beg your parsnips, says Alf.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="s12001g" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12001g">Is that a good
Christ,</a> says Bob,
<a name="s12001g" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12001g">to take away poor little Willie Dignam?</a></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ah, well, says Alf, trying to pass it off.
<a name="s12014u" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12014u">He&apos;s over all his troubles.</a></p>
<p> But Bob Doran shouts out of him.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He&apos;s a bloody ruffian, I say, to take away poor little Willie Dignam.</p>
<p> Terry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet, that they didn&apos;t
want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises. And Bob Doran starts
doing the weeps about Paddy Dignam, true as you&apos;re there.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The finest man, says he, snivelling, the finest, purest character.</p>
<p> Talking through his bloody hat. Fitter for him go home to the little
sleepwalking bitch he married,
<a name="un3001d" href="../../ff/unbs/un3all.htm#un3001d">Mooney, the</a>

<a name="s12004cf" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004cf">without a stitch on
her</a>, open to all comers, fair field and no favour.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The noblest, the truest, says he. And he&apos;s gone, poor
little Willie, poor little Paddy Dignam.</p>
<p> And mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the
<a name="s12004ae" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004ae">extinction of that beam of heaven</a>.</p>
<p> Old Garryowen started growling again at Bloom that was skeezing  round the door.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Come in, come on, says the citizen. He won&apos;t eat you.</p>
<p> So Bloom slopes in with his cod&apos;s eye on the dog and he asks Terry was Martin Cunningham there.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O, Christ Mackeon, says Joe, reading one of the letters. Listen to this, will you?
<br><font color="green">{u22, 291}</font> </p>
<p> And he starts reading out one.</p>
<p class="diset">&mdash; 7 Hunter street
<br> Liverpool</p>
<p class="set">To the High Sheriff of Dublin
<br> Dublin</p>
<p class="flush">Honoured sir i beg to offer my services in the abovementioned
painful case i hanged Joe Gann in Bootle jail on the 12 of Febuary 1900 and i hanged&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Show us, Joe, says I.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; &hellip; private Arthur Chace for fowl murder of Jessie
Tilsit in Pentonville prison and I was assistant when&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Jesus, says I.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; &hellip; Billington executed the awful murderer Toad Smith&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> The citizen made a grab at the letter.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Hold hard, says Joe, i have a special nack of putting the

<p class="deep">H. Rumbold&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="deep">Master Barber&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And a
<a name="s12002an" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12002an">barbarous</a> bloody
barbarian he is too, says the citizen.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And the dirty scrawl of the wretch, says Joe. Here, says
he, take them to hell out of my sight, Alf. Hello, Bloom, says he, what will you have?</p>
<p> They started arguing about the point, Bloom saying he wouldn&apos;t and
he<a target="foot" id="fnn0072">&ordm;</a> couldn&apos;t and excuse him no
offence and all to that and then he said well he&apos;d just take a cigar. Gob,
he&apos;s a prudent member and no mistake. </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Give us one of your prime stinkers, Terry, says Joe.</p>
<p> And Alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with a black border round it.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; They&apos;re<a target="foot" id="fnn0073">&ordm;</a> all
barbers, says he, from the black country that would hang their own fathers for
five quid. down. and travelling expenses.</p>
<p> And he was telling us they chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob each.</p>
<p> In the dark land they bide, the vengeful
<a name="un5015b" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5015b">knights of the
razor</a>. Their deadly coil they grasp: yea, and therein they lead to Erebus
whatsoever wight hath done a deed of blood for I will on nowise suffer it even so saith the Lord.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 292}</font> </p>
<p> So they started talking about capital punishment and of course Bloom comes
out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the business and the
old dog smelling him all the time I&apos;m told those
jewies<a target="foot" id="fnn0074">&ordm;</a> has a queer sort of odour coming
off them for dogs about I don&apos;t know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There&apos;s one thing it hasn&apos;t a deterrent effect on, says Alf.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What&apos;s that? says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="s12014bm" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12014bm">The poor
bugger&apos;s tool that&apos;s being hanged</a>, says Alf.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That so? says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; God&apos;s truth, says Alf. I heard that from the head
warder that was in Kilmainham when they hanged Joe Brady, the invincible. He
told me when they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like a poker.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ruling passion strong in death, says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That can be explained by science, says Bloom. It&apos;s
only a natural phenomenon, don&apos;t you see, because on account of the&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> And then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and
this phenomenon and the other phenomenon.</p>
<p> The distinguished scientist Herr Professor Luitpold Blumenduft tendered
medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the cervical
vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would, according to the
best approved tradition<a target="foot" id="fnn0075">&ordm;</a> of medical
science,  be
<a name="un1032ab" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1032ab">calculated to</a>
produce in the human subject a violent ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres
of the genital apparatus, thereby causing the elastic
pores<a target="foot" id="fnn0078">&ordm;</a> of the <i>corpora cavernosa</i> to
rapidly dilate in such a way as to facilitate the flow of blood to that part of
the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ resulting in the phenomenon
which has been denominated by the faculty a morbid upwards and outwards
philoprogenetive erection <i>in articulo mortis per diminutionem capitis</i>.</p>
<p> So of course the citizen was only waiting for the
<a name="un5018m" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5018m">wink of the word</a>
and he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and who fears to speak of
ninetyeight and Joe with him about all the fellows that were hanged for the
cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new Ireland and new this that and the
other. Talking about new Ireland he ought to go and get a new dog so he ought.
Mangy ravenous brute sniffing<a target="foot" id="fnn0080">&ordm;</a> and
sneezing all round the place and
<a name="un1001b" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1001b">scratching his
scabs</a> and round he<a target="foot" id="fnn0081">&ordm;</a> goes to Bob Doran
that was standing Alf a half one sucking up for what he could get. So of course
Bob Doran starts doing the bloody fool with his<a target="foot" id="fnn0082">&ordm;</a>:
<br><font color="green">{u22, 293}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Give us the paw! Give the paw, doggy! Good old
doggy!<a target="foot" id="fnn0083">&ordm;</a>
Give<a target="foot" id="fnn0084">&ordm;</a> the paw here! Give us the paw!</p>
<p> Arrah,<a target="foot" id="fnn0085">&ordm;</a> bloody end to the paw
he&apos;d give and Alf trying to keep him from tumbling off the bloody stool
atop of the bloody old dog and he talking all kinds of drivel about
training<a target="foot" id="fnn0086">&ordm;</a> by kindness and thoroughbred
dog and intelligent dog: give you the bloody pip. Then he starts scraping a few
bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a
<a name="s12004l" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004l">Jacobs&apos;</a><a target="foot" id="fnn0087">&ordm;</a>
<a name="s12004l" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004l">tin</a> he told Terry
to bring. Gob, he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging out for
more. Near ate the tin and all, hungry bloody mongrel.</p>
<p> And the citizen and Bloom having an argument about the point, Robert Emmet
and die for your country, the Tommy Moore touch about Sarah Curran and
she&apos;s far from the land. And Bloom, of course, with his knock me down cigar
putting on swank with his lardy face. Phenomenon! The fat heap he married is a
nice old phenomenon. Time they were stopping up in
<a name="s12008ag" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12008ag">the City
Arms</a><a target="foot" id="fnn0088">&ordm;</a>
<a name="un4045bu" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4045bu">Pisser</a><a target="foot" id="fnn0089">&ordm;</a>
Burke told me there was an old one there with a cracked nephew and Bloom trying
to get the soft side of her doing the
<a name="s12008u" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12008u">molly coddle</a>
<a name="s12002ap" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12002ap">playing

<a name="s12007ag" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12007ag">and not eating meat
of a Friday</a> because the old one was always thumping her craw and taking the
lout out for a walk. And one time he brought him back as
<a name="s12005u" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12005u">drunk as a boiled
owl</a> and he said he did it to teach him the evils of alcohol. And, by
herrings<a target="foot" id="fnn0090">&ordm;</a> the women near roasted him, the
old one, Bloom&apos;s wife and Mrs O&apos;Dowd that kept the hotel. Jesus, I had
to laugh at Pisser<a target="foot" id="fnn0091">&ordm;</a> Burke taking them off
<a name="s12008ah" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12008ah">chewing the fat</a>

<i>but</i><a target="foot" id="fnn0093">&ordm;</a> <i>don&apos;t you see?</i>
and <i>but on the other hand</i>. Phenomenon!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The memory of the dead, says the citizen taking up his pintglass and glaring at Bloom.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ay, ay, says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You don&apos;t grasp my point, says Bloom. What I mean is&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="s12006bj" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12006bj"><i>Sinn
Fein!</i></a> says the citizen.
<a name="s12006bj" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12006bj"><i>Sinn fein
amhain!</i></a> The friends we love are by our side and the foes we hate before us.</p>
<p> The last farewell was affecting in the extreme. From the belfries far and
near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the gloomy
<br><font color="green">{u22, 294}</font>
<br> precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums punctuated
by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance. The deafening claps of thunder and
the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the ghastly scene testified that
the artillery of heaven had lent its supernatural pomp to the already gruesome
spectacle. A torrential rain poured down from the floodgates of the angry
heavens upon the bared heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the
lowest computation five hundred thousand persons. The learned prelate who
administered the last comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr knelt in a
most christian spirit in a pool of rainwater, his cassock above his hoary head,
and offered up to the throne of grace fervent prayers of supplication.
Hard<a target="foot" id="fnn0101">&ordm;</a> by the block stood the grim figure
of the executioner, his visage being concealed in a ten gallon pot with two
circular perforated apertures through which his eyes glowered furiously. As he
awaited the fatal signal he tested the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it
upon his brawny forearm or decapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep
which had been provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary office. On a
handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the
<a name="s12004bd" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004bd">quartering
knife</a>, the various finely tempered disembowelling
appliances,<a target="foot" id="fnn0102">&ordm;</a> a
terracotta<a target="foot" id="fnn0103">&ordm;</a> saucepan for the reception of
the duodenum, colon, blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully
extricated and two commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most precious
blood of the most precious victim. The housesteward of the amalgamated
cats&apos; and dogs&apos; home was in attendance to convey these vessels when
<a name="s12001at" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12001at">replenished</a> to
that beneficent institution. Quite an excellent repast consisting of rashers and
eggs, fried steak and onions, delicious hot breakfast rolls and invigorating tea
had been considerately provided by the authorities for the consumption of the
central figure of the tragedy but he expressed the dying wish (immediately
acceded to) that the meal should be divided in aliquot parts among the members
of <a name="s12014v" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12014v">the sick and
indigent roomkeepers&apos;</a> association as a token of his regard and esteem.
The non plus ultra of emotion was reached when the blushing bride elect burst
her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself upon the
muscular bosom of him who was about to die for her sake. The hero folded her
willowy form in a loving embrace murmuring fondly &ldquo;Sheila, my own&rdquo;.
Encouraged by this use of her christian name she kissed passionately all the
various suitable areas of his person which the decencies of prison garb
permitted her ardour to reach. She swore to him as they mingled the salt streams
of their tears that she would cherish<a target="foot" id="fnn0104">&ordm;</a> his memory, that she would never
<br><font color="green">{u22, 297}</font>
<br> forget her hero boy. She brought back to his recollection the happy days of
blissful childhood together on the banks of Anna Liffey when they had indulged
in the innocent pastimes of the young and, oblivious of the dreadful present,
they both laughed heartily, all the spectators, including the venerable pastor,
joining in the general merriment. But anon they were overcome with grief and
clasped their hands for the last time. A fresh torrent of tears burst from their
lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people, touched to the inmost core,
broke into
<a name="un4017dn" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4017dn">heartrending</a>
sobs,<a target="foot" id="fnn0105">&ordm;</a> not the least affected being the
aged prebendary himself. A most romantic incident occurred when a handsome young
Oxford <a name="un5018ae" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5018ae">graduate</a>,
noted for his chivalry towards the fair sex, stepped forward and, presenting his
visiting card, bankbook and genealogical
tree,<a target="foot" id="fnn0106">&ordm;</a> solicited the hand of the hapless
young lady and was accepted on the spot. This timely and generous act evoked a
fresh outburst of emotion: and when he placed on the finger of his blushing
fianc&eacute;e an expensive engagement ring with three emeralds set in the form
of a shamrock the<a target="foot" id="fnn0108">&ordm;</a> excitement knew no
bounds. Nay, even the stern
provostmarshal<a target="foot" id="fnn0109">&ordm;</a>, lieutenant-colonel
Tomkin-Maxwell Frenchmullen Tomlinson, who presided on the sad occasion, he who
had blown a considerable number of sepoys from the cannonmouth without
flinching, could not now restrain his natural emotion. With his mailed gauntlet
he brushed away a furtive tear and was
overheard<a target="foot" id="fnn0111">&ordm;</a> by those privileged burghers
who happened to be in his immediate entourage, to murmur to himself in a faltering undertone:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; God blimey if she aint a clinker, that there bleeding
tart. Blimey<a target="foot" id="fnn0112">&ordm;</a> it makes me kind of cry,
straight, it does, when I sees her cause I thinks of my old mashtub what&apos;s waiting for me down Limehouse way.</p>
<p> So then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and the
<a name="s12005bh" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12005bh">corporation
meeting</a> and all to that and the shoneens that can&apos;t speak their own
language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a quid and Bloom
putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he cadged off Joe and
<br><font color="green">{u22, 298}</font>
<br> talking about the Gaelic league and the antitreating league and drink, the
curse of Ireland. Antitreating is about the size of it. Gob, he&apos;d let you
pour all manner of drink down his throat till the Lord would call him before
you&apos;d ever see the
<a name="un1032bk" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1032bk">froth of his
pint</a>. And one night I went in with a fellow into one of their musical
evenings, <a name="un4015aa" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4015aa">song and
dance</a><a target="foot" id="fnn0113">&ordm;</a> and there was a fellow with a
badge spiffing out of him in Irish and a lot of colleen bawns going about with
temperance beverages and selling medals. And then an old fellow starts blowing
into his bagpipes and all shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of.
And one or two sky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with
the females, hitting below the belt. </p>
<p> So, as I was saying, the old dog seeing the tin was empty starts mousing
around by Joe and me. I&apos;d train him by kindness, so I would, if he was my
dog. Give him a rousing fine kick now and again where it wouldn&apos;t blind him.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Afraid he&apos;ll bite you? says the citizen, jeering<a target="foot" id="fnn0114">&ordm;</a>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; No, says I. But he might take my leg for a lamppost.</p>
<p> So he calls the old dog over.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="s12004cb" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004cb">What&apos;s on you</a>, Garryowen? says he.</p>
<p> Then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in Irish and the old
towser growling, letting on to answer, like a duet in the opera. Such growling
you never heard as they let off between them. Someone that has nothing better to
do ought to write a letter <i>pro bono publico</i> to the papers about the
muzzling order for a dog the like of that. Growling and grousing and his eye all
bloodshot and the hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws.</p>
<p> All those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the lower
animals (and their name is legion) should make a point of not missing the really
marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the famous animal Garryowen. The
exhibition,<a target="foot" id="fnn0116">&ordm;</a> which is the result of years
of training by kindness and a carefully thought out dietary system, comprises,
among other achievements, the recitation of verse. Our phonetic experts have
left no stone unturned in their efforts to delucidate and compare the verse
recited and have found it bears a striking resemblance
<br><font color="green">{u22, 299}</font>
<br> to the ranns of ancient Celtic bards. We are not speaking so much of those
delightful lovesongs with which the writer who conceals his identity under the
title of the &lsquo;little sweet branch&rsquo; has familiarised the bookloving
world but rather of the harsher and more personal note which is found in the
satirical effusions of the famous Raftery and of
Donal<a target="foot" id="fnn0118">&ordm;</a> MacConsidine. We subjoin a
specimen which has been rendered into English by an eminent scholar whose name
for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though we believe that our
readers will find the topical allusion rather more than an indication. The
metrical system of the canine original, which recalls the intricate alliterative
and isosyllabic rules of the Welsh englyn, is infinitely more complicated but we
believe our readers will agree that the spirit has been well caught. Perhaps it
should be added that the effect is greatly increased if the verse be spoken
somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive of suppressed rancour.</p>
<p class="set"><i>The curse of my curses</i>
<br> <i>Seven days every day</i>
<br> <i>And seven dry Thursdays</i>
<br> <i>On you, Barney Kiernan,</i>
<br> <i>Has no sup of water</i>
<br> <i><a name="s12004ba" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004ba">To cool my courage</a>,</i>
<br> <i>And my guts red roaring</i>
<br> <i>After Lowry&apos;s lights.</i></p>
<p> So he told Terry to bring some water for the dog and, gob, you could hear
him lapping it up a mile off. And Joe asked him would he have another.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I will, says he, to show there&apos;s no ill feeling.</p>
<p> Gob, he&apos;s not as green as he&apos;s cabbagelooking. Arsing around from
one pub to another with a dog and getting fed up by the ratepayers.
<a name="s12004ap" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004ap">Entertainment for man and beast.</a> And says Joe:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Could you make a hole in another pint?
<br><font color="green">{u22, 300}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Could a swim duck? says I.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Same again, Terry, says Joe. Are you sure you won&apos;t
have anything in the way of liquid refreshment? says he.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Thank you, no, says Bloom. As a matter of fact I just
wanted to meet Martin Cunningham, don&apos;t you see, about this insurance of
Dignam&apos;s. Martin asked me to go to the house. You see, he, Dignam,  I mean,
didn&apos;t serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and
really under the act the mortgagee can&apos;t recover on the policy.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That&apos;s a good one, by God, says
Joe,<a target="foot" id="fnn0120">&ordm;</a> laughing, if old Bridgeman is
landed. So the wife comes out top dog, what?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Well, that&apos;s a point,
<a name="s12001ai" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12001ai">says Bloom, for the wife&apos;s admirers</a>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Whose admirers? says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The wife&apos;s advisers, I mean, says Bloom.</p>
<p> Then he starts all confused mucking it up about
the<a target="foot" id="fnn0121">&ordm;</a> mortgagor under the act and for the
benefit of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that
Dignam owed the money and if now the wife or the widow contested the
mortgagee&apos;s right till he near gave me a pain in my head with his mortgagor
under the act. He was bloody safe he wasn&apos;t run in himself under the act
that time as a <a name="s12007m" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12007m">rogue
and vagabond</a> only he had a
<a name="s12004ah" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004ah">friend in court</a>.
Selling bazaar tickets or what do you call it
<a name="s12007m" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12007m">royal Hungarian</a>
<a name="un2014e" href="../../ff/unbs/un2all.htm#un2014e">privileged</a>

<a name="s12011br" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12011br">O, commend me to an
israelite!</a> Royal and privileged Hungarian robbery.</p>
<p> So Bob Doran comes lurching around asking Bloom to tell Mrs Dignam he was
sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and to tell her
that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was never a truer, a
finer than poor little Willie that&apos;s dead to tell her. Choking with bloody
foolery. And shaking Bloom&apos;s hand doing the tragic to tell her that. Shake
hands, brother. You&apos;re a rogue and I&apos;m another.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Let me, said he, so far presume upon our acquaintance
which, however slight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time, is
founded, as I hope and believe, on a sentiment of mutual
esteem<a target="foot" id="fnn0122">&ordm;</a> as to request of you this favour.
But, should I have overstepped the limits of reserve let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; No, rejoined the other, I appreciate to the full the
motives which actuate your conduct and I shall discharge the office you entrust
to me consoled by the reflection that, though the errand be one of sorrow,  this
proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness of the cup.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 301}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Then suffer me to take your hand, said he. The goodness of
your heart, I feel sure, will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the
expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose poignancy, were I
to give vent to my feelings, would deprive me even of speech.</p>
<p> And off with him and out trying to walk straight. Boosed at five
o&apos;clock. Night he was near being lagged only Paddy Leonard knew the bobby.
Boosed up in a shebeen in Bride street after closing time with two shawls and a
bully on guard drinking porter out of teacups. And calling himself a Frenchy for
the shawls, Joseph Manuo, and talking against the
catholic<a target="foot" id="fnn0124">&ordm;</a>
religion,<a target="foot" id="fnn0125">&ordm;</a> who wrote the new testament
and the old testament<a target="foot" id="fnn0127">&ordm;</a> and hugging and
smugging. And the two shawls killed with the laughing, picking his
pockets,<a target="foot" id="fnn0128">&ordm;</a> the bloody fool and he spilling
the porter all over the bed and the two shawls screeching laughing at one
another. <i>How is your testament? Have you got an old testament?</i> Only Paddy
was passing there, I tell you what. Then see him of a Sunday with his little
wife, and she wagging her tail up the aisle of the
chapel<a target="foot" id="fnn0129">&ordm;</a> with her patent boots on her, no
less, and her violets, nice as pie, doing the little lady. Jack Mooney&apos;s
sister. And the old prostitute of a mother letting rooms to street couples. Gob,
Jack made him toe the line. Told him if he didn&apos;t patch up the pot, Jesus, he&apos;d kick the shite out of him.</p>
<p> So Terry brought the three pints.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Here, says Joe, doing the honours. Here, citizen.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>Slan leat</i>,<a target="foot" id="fnn0130">&ordm;</a> says he.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Fortune, Joe, says I. Good health, citizen.</p>
<p> Gob, he had his mouth half way down the tumbler already. Want a small fortune to keep him in drinks.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty, Alf? says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Friend of yours, says Alf. </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Nan Nan? says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I won&apos;t mention any names, says Alf.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="un4051bj" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4051bj">I thought so</a>,
says Joe. I saw him up at that meeting now with William Field, M.P., the cattle traders.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Hairy Iopas, says the citizen, the darling of all countries and the idol of his own.</p>
<p> So Joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease and the
cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen sending them all
<br><font color="green">{u22, 302}</font>
<br> to the rightabout and Bloom coming out with his guaranteed remedy for
<a name="s12014ai" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12014ai">timber tongue</a> in
calves. Because <a name="s12014br" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12014br">he
was up one time in a knacker&apos;s yard</a>. Walking about with his book and
pencil here&apos;s my head and my heels are coming till Joe Cuffe gave him the
order of the boot for giving lip to a
<a name="s12014ak" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12014ak">grazier</a>. Mister
Knowall. Teach your grandmother how to milk ducks. Pisser Burke was telling me
in the hotel the wife used to be in rivers of tears some times with Mrs
O&apos;Dowd. Couldn&apos;t loosen her farting strings but old codseye was
waltzing around her showing her how to do it. Ay. Humane methods. Because the
poor animals suffer and experts say and the best known remedy that doesn&apos;t
cause pain to the animal and on the sore spot administer gently. Gob,
<a name="s12006bt" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12006bt">he&apos;d have a soft hand under a hen</a>.</p>
<p> Ga Ga Gara. Klook Klook Klook. Black Liz is our hen. She lays eggs for us.
When she lays her egg she is so glad. Gara. Klook Klook Klook. Then comes good
uncle Leo. He puts his hand under black Liz and takes her fresh
egg.<a target="foot" id="fnn0132">&ordm;</a> Ga ga ga ga Gara. Klook Klook Klook.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Anyhow, says Joe,<a target="foot" id="fnn0133">&ordm;</a>
<a name="s12006d" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12006d">Field and Nannetti are
going over tonight to London</a> to ask about it in the House of Commons<a target="foot" id="fnn0134">&ordm;</a>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Are you sure, says Bloom, the councillor is going. I wanted to see him, as it happens.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Well, he&apos;s going off by the mailboat, says Joe, tonight.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That&apos;s too bad, says Bloom. I wanted particularly.
Perhaps only Mr Field is going. I couldn&apos;t phone. No. You&apos;re sure?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Nan Nan&apos;s going too, says Joe.
<a name="s12008ao" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12008ao">The league told him

<p> Mr Cowe Conacre (Multifarnham. Nat.): Arising out of the question of my
honourable friend may I ask the right honourable gentleman whether the
government has issued orders that these animals shall be slaughtered though no
medical evidence is forthcoming as to their pathological condition?</p>
<p> Mr Allfours (Tamoshant. Con.): Honourable members are already in possession
of the evidence. The answer to the honourable member&apos;s question is in the affirmative.</p>
<p> Mr Orelli O&apos;Reilly (Montenotte. Nat.):<a target="foot" id="fnn0138">&ordm;</a> Have similar orders been issued
<br><font color="green">{u22, 303}</font>
<br> for the slaughter of human animals who dare to play Irish games in the Phoenix park?</p>
<p> Mr Allfours: The answer is in the negative.</p>
<p> Mr Cowe Conacre: Has the right honourable gentleman&apos;s famous
Mitchelstown telegram inspired the policy of gentlemen on the
Treasury<a target="foot" id="fnn0139">&ordm;</a> bench? (O! O!)</p>
<p> Mr Allfours: <a name="s12006k" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12006k">I must have notice of that question.</a></p>

<p> The speaker<a target="foot" id="fnn0142">&ordm;</a>: Order! Order!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There&apos;s the man, says Joe, that made the Gaelic
sports revival. There he is sitting there.
<a name="s12006bu" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12006bu">The man that got
away James Stephens.</a>

<p class="di">&mdash; Is that really a fact? says Alf.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, says Bloom. That&apos;s well known.
Did<a target="foot" id="fnn0145">&ordm;</a> you not know that? </p>
<p> So off they started about Irish
sports<a target="foot" id="fnn0146">&ordm;</a> and shoneen games the like
of<a target="foot" id="fnn0147">&ordm;</a> lawn tennis and about hurley and
putting the stone and
<a name="s12004k" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004k">racy of the soil</a>
and building up a nation once again. And of course Bloom had to have his say too
about if a fellow had a weak heart violent exercise was bad. I declare to God if
you took up a straw from the floor and if you said to Bloom: <i>Look at, Bloom.
Do you see that straw? That&apos;s a straw</i>. Declare to my aunt he&apos;d
talk about it for an hour so he would and talk steady.</p>
<p> A most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of the
O&apos;Kiernan&apos;s under the auspices of <i>Sluagh na
h-Eireann</i>,<a target="foot" id="fnn0150">&ordm;</a> on the revival of ancient
Gaelic sports and the importance of physical culture, as understood in ancient
Greece and ancient Rome and ancient Ireland, for the development of the race.
The venerable president of the<a target="foot" id="fnn0151">&ordm;</a> noble
order was in the chair and
<a name="s12010l" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12010l">the attendance was of
large dimensions</a>. After an instructive discourse by the chairman a most
interesting and instructive discussion
<a name="s12004h" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004h">ensued</a> as to the
desirability of the revivability of the ancient games and sports of our ancient Irish forefathers.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 304}</font>
<br> The wellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of our old tongue Mr
Joseph M&apos;Carthy Hynes made an eloquent appeal for the resuscitation of the
ancient Gaelic sports and pastimes as calculated to revive the best traditions
of manly strength and prowess<a target="foot" id="fnn0153">&ordm;</a> handed
down to us from ancient ages. L. Bloom having
<a name="s12002ag" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12002ag">espoused the
negative</a> the chairman brought the discussion to a close, in response to
repeated requests and
<a name="s12009j" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12009j">hearty plaudits</a>
from all parts of the house<a target="foot" id="fnn0154">&ordm;</a>, by a
remarkably noteworthy rendering of Thomas Osborne Davis&apos;s immortal verses
<i>A Nation Once Again</i><a target="foot" id="fnn0155">&ordm;</a> in the
execution of which the veteran patriot champion may be said without fear of
contradiction to have fairly
<a name="s12004ad" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004ad">excelled
himself</a>. His stentorian notes were heard to the greatest advantage in the
timehonoured anthem  and his superb
<a name="s12010m" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12010m">highclass vocalism</a>
was vociferously applauded by the large audience
among<a target="foot" id="fnn0156">&ordm;</a> which were to be noticed many
prominent members of the clergy as well as representatives of the press and the
bar and the other learned professions.<a target="foot" id="fnn0157">&ordm;</a> The proceedings then terminated.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Talking about violent exercise, says Alf, were you at that Keogh-Bennett match?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; No, says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I heard Boylan made a cool hundred quid over it, says Alf.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who? Blazes? says Joe.</p>
<p> And says Bloom:
<br><font color="green">{u22, 305}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What I meant about tennis, for example, is the agility and
training<a target="foot" id="fnn0162">&ordm;</a> the eye.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ay, Blazes, says Alf. He let out that Myler was on the
beer to run up the odds and he swatting all the time.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; We know him, says the citizen. The traitor&apos;s son. We
know what put English gold in his pocket.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; True for you, says Joe.</p>
<p> And Bloom cuts in again about lawn tennis and the circulation of the blood, asking Alf:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Now,<a target="foot" id="fnn0163">&ordm;</a> don&apos;t you think, Bergan? </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Myler dusted the floor with him, says Alf.

<p> It was a historic
<a name="s12003ah" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12003ah">battle</a>.
Handicapped as he was by lack of poundage Dublin&apos;s pet lamb made up for it
by superlative skill in ringcraft. The final
<a name="s12003ap" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12003ap">bout of
fireworks</a> was a gruelling for both champions. Bennett had tapped some
<a name="s12003an" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12003an">lively claret</a> in
the previous mixup and Myler came on looking groggy. The soldier got to
business<a target="foot" id="fnn0165">&ordm;</a> leading off with a powerful
left <a name="s12003af" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12003af">jab</a> to
which Myler retaliated by shooting out a
<a name="s12003af" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12003af">stiff one</a> to
Bennett&apos;s face. The latter ducked but the Dubliner lifted him with a left
hook, the punch being a fine one. The men came to handigrips and the bout ended
with Bennett on the ropes, Myler punishing him. The Englishman was liberally
drenched with water and when the bell
went<a target="foot" id="fnn0166">&ordm;</a> came on gamey and full of
pluck.<a target="foot" id="fnn0167">&ordm;</a> It was a fight to a finish and
the best man for it. The two fought like tigers and excitement ran fever high.
After a brisk exchange of courtesies during which a smart upper cut of the
military man brought blood freely from his opponent&apos;s mouth the lamb
suddenly landed a terrific left to Bennett&apos;s stomach, flooring him flat. It
was a <a name="s12003ag" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12003ag">knockout clean and
<br><font color="green">{u22, 306}</font>
<br> clever</a>. Amid tense expectation the Portobello bruiser was counted out
and Myler declared victor to the frenzied cheers of the public who broke through
the ringropes and fairly mobbed him with delight. </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He knows which side his bread is buttered, says Alf. I
hear he&apos;s running a concert tour now up in the north.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He is, says Joe. Isn&apos;t he?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who? says Bloom. Ah, yes. That&apos;s quite true. Yes, a
kind of summer tour, you see. Just a holiday.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Mrs B. is the bright particular star, isn&apos;t she? says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; My wife? says<a target="foot" id="fnn0168">&ordm;</a>
Bloom. She&apos;s singing, yes. I think it will be a success too. He&apos;s an excellent man to organise. Excellent.</p>
<p> Hoho begob says I to myself says I. That explains
<a name="s12004bh" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004bh">the milk in the
cocoanut and absence of hair on the animal&apos;s chest</a>. Blazes doing the

<a name="s12007v" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12007v">sold the same horses

<p> Pride of Calpe&apos;s rocky mount, the ravenhaired daughter of Tweedy. There
grew she to peerless beauty where loquat and almond scent the air. The gardens
of Alameda knew her step: the
<a name="un1032di" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1032di">garths of olives</a>
knew and bowed. The chaste spouse of Leopold is she: Marion of the bountiful
<a name="s12006g" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12006g">bosoms</a>.</p>
<p> And lo, there entered one of the clan of the O&apos;Molloy&apos;s, a comely
hero <a name="s12007e" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12007e">of white face yet
withal somewhat ruddy</a>,
<a name="s12002co" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12002co">his majesty&apos;s
counsel learned in the law</a> and with him the prince and heir of the noble line of Lambert.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Hello, Ned.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Hello, Alf.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Hello, Jack.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Hello, Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; God save you, says the citizen.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Save you kindly, says J.J. What&apos;ll it be, Ned?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Half one, says Ned.</p>
<p> So J.J. ordered the drinks.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Were you round at the court? says Joe. </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, says J.J. He&apos;ll square that, Ned, says he.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Hope so, says Ned.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 307}</font> </p>
<p> Now what were those two at? J.J. getting him off the jury list and the other
give him a leg over the stile. With his name in Stubbs&apos;s. Playing cards,
<a name="s12002bm" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12002bm">hobnobbing</a> with
flash toffs, drinking<a target="foot" id="fnn0172">&ordm;</a> fizz and he half
smothered in writs and

orders</a>. Gob, he&apos;ll
<a name="s12008b" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12008b">come home by weeping
cross</a> one of these<a target="foot" id="fnn0173">&ordm;</a> days, I&apos;m thinking.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Did you see that bloody lunatic Breen round
there?<a target="foot" id="fnn0174">&ordm;</a> says Alf. U.
p:<a target="foot" id="fnn0175">&ordm;</a> up.<a target="foot" id="fnn0176">&ordm;</a></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, says J.J. Looking for a private detective.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ay, says Ned, and<a target="foot" id="fnn0177">&ordm;</a>
he wanted right go wrong to address the court only Corny Kelleher got round him
telling him to get the handwriting examined first.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ten thousand pounds, says Alf, laughing.
God,<a target="foot" id="fnn0178">&ordm;</a> I&apos;d give anything to hear him before a judge and jury.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Was it you did it, Alf? says Joe.
<a name="s12014ck" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12014ck">The truth, the whole
truth and nothing but the truth, so help you Jimmy Johnson.</a></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Me? says Alf. Don&apos;t
<a name="s12008ab" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12008ab">cast your nasturtiums</a> on my character.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Whatever statement you make, says Joe, will be taken down in evidence against you.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Of course an action would lie, says J.J. It implies that
he is not <i>compos mentis</i>. U. p:<a target="foot" id="fnn0179">&ordm;</a> up.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>Compos</i> what? says Alf, laughing. Do you know that
he&apos;s balmy? Look at his head. Do you know that some mornings he has to get his hat on with a shoehorn.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, says J.J.,<a target="foot" id="fnn0181">&ordm;</a>
but the truth of a libel is no defence to an indictment for publishing it in the
<a name="un4017da" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4017da">eye of the law</a>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ha<a target="foot" id="fnn0182">&ordm;</a> ha, Alf, says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Still, says Bloom, on account of the poor woman, I mean his wife. </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Pity about her, says the citizen. Or any other woman marries a half and half.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; How half and half? says Bloom. Do you mean he&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Half and half I mean, says the citizen. A fellow that&apos;s neither fish nor flesh.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Nor good red herring, says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That what&apos;s I mean, says the citizen. A pishogue, if you know what that is.</p>
<p> Begob I saw there was trouble coming. And Bloom explaining<a target="foot" id="fnn0183">&ordm;</a> he meant
<br><font color="green">{u22, 308}</font>
<br> on account of it being cruel for the wife having to go round after the old
stuttering fool.
<a name="s12004bs" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004bs">Cruelty to
animals</a> so it is to let that bloody Breen out on grass with his beard out
tripping him. And she with her nose cocked up after she married him because a
cousin of his old fellow&apos;s was
pewopener<a target="foot" id="fnn0184">&ordm;</a> to the pope. Picture of him on
the wall with his Turk&apos;s moustaches,
the<a target="foot" id="fnn0186">&ordm;</a>
signior<a target="foot" id="fnn0187">&ordm;</a> from Summer hill, two pair back
and passages<a target="foot" id="fnn0189">&ordm;</a>, and he covered with
all<a target="foot" id="fnn0190">&ordm;</a> kinds of breastplates bidding defiance to the world.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And moreover, says
J.J.,<a target="foot" id="fnn0191">&ordm;</a> a postcard is publication. It was
held to be sufficient evidence of malice in the testcase Sadgrove v. Hole. In my opinion an action might lie.</p>
<p> Six and eightpence, please. Who wants your opinion? Let us drink our pints
in peace. Gob, we won&apos;t be let even do that much.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Well good health, Jack, says Ned.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Good health, Ned, says J.J.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There he is again, says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Where? says Alf.</p>
<p> And begob there he was passing the door with his books under his oxter and
the wife beside him and Corny
<a name="s12005ab" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12005ab">Kelleher</a> with
his wall eye looking in as they went
past<a target="foot" id="fnn0192">&ordm;</a>, talking to him like a father,
trying to sell him a <a name="s12005ab" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12005ab">secondhand coffin</a>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; How did that Canada swindle case go off? says Joe. </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Remanded, says J.J.</p>
<p> One of the bottlenosed tribe it was went by the name of
<a name="s12003p" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12003p">James Wought alias
Saphiro alias Spark and Spiro</a> put an ad in the papers saying he&apos;d give
a passage to Canada for twenty bob. What? Course it was a bloody barney. What?
Swindled them all, skivvies and badhachs from the county Meath, ay, and his own
kidney too. J.J. was telling us there was
<a name="s12003r" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12003r">an ancient Hebrew</a>
<a name="s12003q" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12003q">Zaretsky</a> or
something weeping in the witness box with his hat on him swearing by the holy Moses he was stuck for two quid.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who tried the case? says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <a name="s12014ad" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12014ad">Recorder</a>, says Ned.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Poor old sir<a target="foot" id="fnn0193">&ordm;</a>
Frederick Falkiner, says Alf, you can cod him up to the two eyes.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="s12014ad" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12014ad">Heart as big as a
lion, says Ned. Tell him a tale of woe</a> about arrears
<br><font color="green">{u22, 309}</font>
<br> of rent and a sick wife and a squad of kids
<a name="s12014ad" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12014ad">and, faith,
he&apos;ll dissolve in tears on the bench</a>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="s12014ad" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12014ad">Ay, says Alf. Reuben
J. was bloody lucky he didn&apos;t clap in the dock</a> the other
day<a target="foot" id="fnn0194">&ordm;</a> for suing poor little Gumly
that&apos;s minding stones<a target="foot" id="fnn0195">&ordm;</a> for the corporation there near Butt bridge.</p>
<p> And he starts taking off the old recorder letting on to cry:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A most scandalous thing! This poor hardworking man! How many children? Ten, did you say?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, your worship. And my wife has the typhoid.<a target="foot" id="fnn0196">&ordm;</a></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And the<a target="foot" id="fnn0197">&ordm;</a> wife with
typhoid fever! Scandalous! Leave the court immediately, sir. No, sir, I&apos;ll
make no order for payment. How dare you, sir, come up before me and ask me to
make an order! A poor hardworking industrious man! I dismiss the case.</p>
<p> And on the sixteenth day of the month of the oxeyed goddess the
<a name="s12004ag" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004ag">daughter of the
skies</a>, the virgin moon, being then in her first quarter those learned judges
repaired them to the halls of law. There
<a name="s12005a" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12005a">master</a><a target="foot" id="fnn0199">&ordm;</a>
<a name="s12005a" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12005a">Courtenay, sitting in
his own chamber,</a> gave his rede
<a name="s12005e" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12005e">and master Justice
Andrews,</a><a target="foot" id="fnn0200">&ordm;</a>
<a name="s12005e" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12005e">sitting without a jury
in the probate court</a>, weighed well and pondered the
claim<a target="foot" id="fnn0201">&ordm;</a> of
<a name="s12005b" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12005b">the first chargeant
upon the property</a> in the matter of
<a name="s12007h" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12007h">the will
propounded</a> and final testamentary disposition of the real and personal
estate of the late lamented Jacob Halliday, vintner, deceased, versus
<a name="s12005f" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12005f">Livingstone</a>, of
<a name="s12002as" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12002as">unsound mind</a>,
<a name="s12005f" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12005f">and another</a>. And
to the solemn court of Green street there came sir Frederick the Falconer. And
he sat him there to administer
<a name="s12006ad" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12006ad">the law of the
brehons</a> at the commission to be holden in and for the county of the city of
Dublin. And there sat with him the high
<a name="s12005am" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12005am">sinhedrim</a> of the
twelve tribes of Iar, for every tribe one man, of the tribe of Patrick and of
the tribe of Hugh and of the tribe of Owen and of the tribe of Conn and of the
tribe of Oscar and of the tribe of Fergus and of the tribe of Finn and of the
tribe of Dermot and of the tribe of Cormac and of the tribe of Kevin and of the
tribe of Caolte and of the tribe of Ossian, there being in all twelve good men
and true. And he conjured them by Him who died on rood that they should well and
truly try and true deliverance make in the issue joined between their sovereign
lord the king and the prisoner at the bar and true verdict give according to the
evidence so help them God and kiss the book. And they rose in their seats, the
twelve of Iar, and they swore by the name of Him Who<a target="foot" id="fnn0202">&ordm;</a> is
<br><font color="green">{u22, 310}</font>
<br> from everlasting that they would do His rightwiseness. And straightway the
minions of the law led forth from their donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of
justice had apprehended
<a name="s12015n" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12015n">in consequence of
information received</a>. And they shackled him hand and foot and would take of
him <a name="s12001cb" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12001cb">ne bail ne
mainprise</a> but
<a name="s12003t" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12003t">preferred a charge
against him</a> for he was a malefactor.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Those are nice things, says the citizen, coming over here
to Ireland filling the country with bugs.</p>
<p> So Bloom let on he heard nothing and he starts talking with Joe, telling him
he needn&apos;t trouble about that little matter till the first but if he would
just say a word to Mr Crawford. And so Joe swore high and holy he&apos;d do the devil and all.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Because,<a target="foot" id="fnn0203">&ordm;</a> you see,
says Bloom, for an advertisement you must have repetition. That&apos;s the whole secret. </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Rely on me, says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Swindling the peasants, says the citizen, and the poor of
Ireland. We want no more strangers in our house.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O,<a target="foot" id="fnn0204">&ordm;</a> I&apos;m sure
that will be all right, Hynes, says Bloom. It&apos;s just that Keyes, you see.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Consider that done, says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Very kind of you, says Bloom.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The strangers, says the citizen. Our own fault. We let
them come in. We brought them in. The<a target="foot" id="fnn0205">&ordm;</a>
adulteress and her paramour brought the Saxon robbers here.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Decree nisi, says J.J.</p>
<p> And Bloom letting on to be awfully deeply interested in nothing, a
spider&apos;s web in the corner behind the barrel and the citizen scowling after
him and the old dog at his feet looking up to know who to bite and when.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A dishonoured wife, says the citizen, that was the cause of all our misfortunes.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And here she is, says Alf, that was giggling over the
<a name="s12006ch" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12006ch"><i>Police
Gazette</i></a> with Terry on the counter, in all her warpaint.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Give us a squint at her, says I.</p>
<p> And what was it only one of the smutty yankee pictures Terry borrows off of
Corny Kelleher. Misconduct of society belle. Norman W. Tupper, wealthy Chicago
contractor finds pretty but faithless wife in lap of officer Taylor. Belle in
<a name="s12007r" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12007r">her bloomers</a>
misconducting herself<a target="foot" id="fnn0207">&ordm;</a> and her
fancyman<a target="foot" id="fnn0208">&ordm;</a> feeling for her tickles and
Norman W.<a target="foot" id="fnn0209">&ordm;</a> Tupper
<br><font color="green">{u22, 311}</font>
<br> bouncing in with his peashooter just in time to be late after she doing the
trick of the loop with officer Taylor.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O jakers, Jenny, says Joe, how short your shirt is!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; There&apos;s hair, Joe, says I. Get a queer old sirloin off of that one, what?</p>
<p> So anyhow in came John Wyse Nolan and Lenehan with him with a face on him as long as a late breakfast.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Well, says the citizen,  what did those
<a name="un5001co" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5001co">tinkers</a> in the
city hall<a target="foot" id="fnn0210">&ordm;</a> decide about the Irish language?</p>
<p> O&apos;Nolan, clad in shining armour, low bending made obeisance to the
<a name="s12011bk" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12011bk">puissant</a> chief
of Erin and did him to wit of that which had befallen, how that the grave elders
of <a name="s12009g" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12009g">the most obedient
city</a>, <a name="s12001j" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12001j">second of
the realm</a>, had met them in the tholsel, and there, after due prayers to the
gods who dwell in ether supernal, had taken solemn counsel whereby they might,
if so be it might be, bring once more into honour among mortal men the winged speech of the seadivided Gael.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It&apos;s on the march, says the citizen. To hell with the
bloody brutal Sassenachs and their language.</p>
<p> So J.J. puts in a word<a target="foot" id="fnn0211">&ordm;</a> doing the
toff, and Bloom trying to back him up. Moderation and botheration.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; To hell with them, says the citizen.
<a name="s12009f" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12009f">The curse of a good
for nothing God light sideways on the bloody thicklugged sons of whores&apos;
gets.</a> Any civilisation they have they stole from us. Tonguetied sons of bastards&apos; ghosts.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The European family, says J.J.&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; They&apos;re<a target="foot" id="fnn0214">&ordm;</a> not
European, says the citizen. I was in Europe. You wouldn&apos;t see a trace of
them or their language anywhere in Europe except in a<a target="foot" id="fnn0215">&ordm;</a> watercloset.</p>
<p> And says John Wyse:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Full many a flower is born to blush unseen.</p>
<p> And says Lenehan, that knows a bit of the lingo:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>Conspuez les anglais!</i><a target="foot" id="fnn0216">&ordm;</a> <i>Perfide Albion!</i>
<br><font color="green">{u22, 312}</font> </p>
<p> Then lifted he in his rude great brawny
<a name="s12004bu" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004bu">strengthy</a> hands
the medher of dark strong foamy ale and he drank to the undoing of his foes,
<a name="s12006an" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12006an">a race of mighty
valorous heroes, rulers of the waves, who sit on thrones of alabaster silent as the deathless gods</a>. </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What&apos;s up with you, says I to Lenehan. You look like
a fellow that had lost a bob and found a tanner.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="un2005a" href="../../ff/unbs/un2all.htm#un2005a">Gold</a><a target="foot" id="fnn0218">&ordm;</a>
<a name="un2005a" href="../../ff/unbs/un2all.htm#un2005a">cup</a>, says he.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who won, Mr Lenehan? says Terry.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="un2003f" href="../../ff/unbs/un2all.htm#un2003f"><i>Throwaway</i>, says
he, at twenty to one. A rank outsider.</a></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And
<a name="un2005f" href="../../ff/unbs/un2all.htm#un2005f">Bass&apos;s mare</a>? says Terry.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Still running, says he. We&apos;re all in a cart. Boylan
plunged two quid on my tip
<a name="un2005j" href="../../ff/unbs/un2all.htm#un2005j"><i>Sceptre</i></a> for himself and a lady friend.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I had half a crown myself, says Terry, on
<a name="un2005d" href="../../ff/unbs/un2all.htm#un2005d"><i>Zinfandel</i></a>
that Mr Flynn gave me. <a name="un2005d" href="../../ff/unbs/un2all.htm#un2005d">Lord Howard de Walden&apos;s.</a></p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="un2005i" href="../../ff/unbs/un2all.htm#un2005i">Twenty to one</a>,
says Lenehan. <a name="s15014g" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15014g">Such is
life in an outhouse.</a>
<a name="un2005i" href="../../ff/unbs/un2all.htm#un2005i"><i>Throwaway</i></a>,
says he. Takes the biscuit,<a target="foot" id="fnn0219">&ordm;</a> and talking
about bunions. Frailty, thy name is <a name="un2005k" href="../../ff/unbs/un2all.htm#un2005k"><i>Sceptre</i></a>.</p>
<p> So he went over to the biscuit tin Bob Doran left to see if there was
anything he could lift on the nod the old cur after him backing his luck with
his mangy snout up. Old Mother<a target="foot" id="fnn0220">&ordm;</a> Hubbard went to the cupboard.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Not there, my child, says he.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Keep your pecker up, says Joe. She&apos;d have won the money only for the other dog.</p>
<p> And J.J. and the citizen arguing about law and history with Bloom sticking in an odd word.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Some people, says Bloom, can see the mote in others&apos;
eyes but they can&apos;t see the beam in their own.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>Raimeis</i>, says the citizen. Where are the twenty
millions of Irish should be here today instead of four? And our
<a name="s12012c" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12012c">potteries and

<a name="un3005e" href="../../ff/unbs/un3all.htm#un3005e">As treeless as
Portugal we&apos;ll be soon</a>, says John Wyse, if something is not to
reafforest the land. Larches, firs, all the trees of the

<p class="di">&mdash; Europe has its eyes on you, says Lenehan.</p>
<p> The fashionable international world attended <i>en masse</i> this afternoon
at the wedding of the chevalier Jean Wyse de Nolan,
<a name="s12015o" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12015o">grand high chief
ranger</a> of the
<a name="s12002cg" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12002cg">Irish National
Foresters</a>, with
<a name="un2022a" href="../../ff/unbs/un2all.htm#un2022a">Miss Fir Conifer of
Pine Valley</a>. The bride looked exquisitely charming in a creation of green
<a name="s12003l" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12003l">mercerised silk</a>,
moulded on an
<a name="s12003k" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12003k">underslip</a> of
gloaming grey, sashed with a yoke of broad emerald and finished with a triple
flounce of darker hued fringe, the scheme being relieved by bretelles and hip
insertions of acorn bronze. The maids of honour, Miss Larch Conifer and Miss
Spruce Conifer, sisters of the bride, wore very becoming costumes in the same
tone, a dainty <i>motif</i><a target="foot" id="fnn0224">&ordm;</a> of plume
rose being worked into the pleats in a pinstripe and repeated capriciously
<br><font color="green">{u22, 314}</font>
<br> in the jadegreen toques in the form of heron feathers of paletinted coral.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And our eyes are on Europe, says the citizen. We had our
trade with Spain and French and with the Flemings before those mongrels were
born, <a name="s12007aa" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12007aa">Spanish ale in
Galway</a>, <a name="s12006cg" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12006cg">the winebark on the winedark waterway</a>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And will again, says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And with the help of the holy mother of God we will again,
says the citizen. Our harbours that are empty will be full again, Queenstown,
Kinsale, Galway,
<a name="s12005bd" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12005bd">Killybegs, the third

<p class="di">&mdash; Half one, Terry, says John Wyse, and a hands up. Terry! Are you asleep?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, sir, says Terry. Small whisky and bottle of
Allsopp<a target="foot" id="fnn0229">&ordm;</a>. Right, sir.</p>
<p> Hanging over the bloody paper with Alf looking for spicy bits instead of
attending to the general public. Picture of a
<a name="s12003al" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12003al">butting match</a>, trying to crack their
<br><font color="green">{u22, 315}</font>
<br> bloody skulls, one chap going for the other with his
<a name="s15061bp" href="../../ff/unbs/s15all.htm#s15061bp">head down</a> like a
bull at a gate. And another one: <i>Black Beast Burned in Omaha</i>. <i>Ga</i>.
A lot of Deadwood Dicks in slouch hats and they firing at a
Sambo<a target="foot" id="fnn0231">&ordm;</a> strung up on a tree with his
tongue out and a bonfire under him. Gob, they ought to drown him in the sea
after and electrocute and crucify him to make sure of the job.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; But what about the fighting navy, says Ned, that keeps our foes at bay?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I&apos;ll tell you what about it, says the citizen. Hell
upon earth it is. Read the revelations that&apos;s going on
<a name="un2015a" href="../../ff/unbs/un2all.htm#un2015a">in the papers</a>
about <a name="un2015i" href="../../ff/unbs/un2all.htm#un2015i">flogging</a>
<a name="un2015a" href="../../ff/unbs/un2all.htm#un2015a">on the training
ships</a> at Portsmouth. A fellow writes that calls himself <i>Disgusted One</i>.</p>
<p> So he starts telling us about
<a name="un2015f" href="../../ff/unbs/un2all.htm#un2015f">corporal
punishment</a> and about the crew of tars
and<a target="foot" id="fnn0232">&ordm;</a> officers and rearadmirals drawn up
in cocked hats and the parson with his protestant bible to witness punishment
and <a name="un2015i" href="../../ff/unbs/un2all.htm#un2015i">a young lad
brought out</a>, howling for his ma, and they tie him down on the buttend of a gun.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="s12001k" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12001k">A rump and dozen,</a>
says the citizen, <a name="s12001k" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12001k">was
what that old ruffian sir John Beresford called
it</a><a target="foot" id="fnn0233">&ordm;</a> but the modern God&apos;s
Englishman calls it <a name="un2015h" href="../../ff/unbs/un2all.htm#un2015h">caning on the breech</a>.</p>
<p> And says John Wyse: </p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="s12002bu" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12002bu">&apos;Tis a custom
more honoured in the breech than in the observance.</a></p>
<p> Then he was telling us the master at arms comes along with a long cane and
he draws out and he flogs the bloody backside off of the poor lad till he yells meila murder.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That&apos;s your glorious British navy, says the citizen,
that bosses the earth. The fellows that never will be slaves, with the only
hereditary chamber in Europe and their land in the hands of a dozen
<a name="s12002ak" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12002ak">gamehogs</a> and
cottonball barons. That&apos;s the great empire they boast about of drudges and whipped serfs.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="s12001bs" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12001bs">On which the sun never rises</a>, says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And the tragedy of it is, says the citizen, they believe
it. The unfortunate <a name="s12008d" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12008d">Yahoos</a> believe it.</p>
<p> They believe in rod, the scourger almighty, creator of hell upon
earth,<a target="foot" id="fnn0234">&ordm;</a> and in Jacky Tar, the son of a
gun, who was conceived of unholy boast, born of the fighting navy, suffered
under rump and dozen, was scarified, flayed and curried, yelled like bloody
hell, the third day he arose again from the bed, steered into haven, sitteth on
his beamend<a target="foot" id="fnn0235">&ordm;</a> till further orders when he
shall come to drudge for a living and be paid.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; But, says Bloom, isn&apos;t discipline the same
everywhere. I mean wouldn&apos;t it be the same here if you put force against force?
<br><font color="green">{u22, 316}</font> </p>
<p> Didn&apos;t I tell you? As true as I&apos;m drinking this porter if he was
on his last gasp he&apos;d try to downface you that dying was living.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; We&apos;ll put force against force, says the citizen. We
have our greater Ireland beyond the sea. They were driven out of house and home
in the <a name="s12005as" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12005as">black
&apos;47</a><a target="foot" id="fnn0238">&ordm;</a>. Their mudcabins by the
roadside were laid low by the
<a name="s12014bl" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12014bl">batteringram</a> and
the <i>Times</i> rubbed its hands and told the whitelivered Saxons there would
soon be as few Irish in Ireland as redskins in America. Even the Turks sent us
help. But the Sassenach tried to starve the nation at home while the land was
full of crops that the British hyenas bought and sold in Rio de Janeiro. Ay,
they drove out the peasants in hordes. Twenty thousand of them died in the
coffin ships. But those that came to the land of the free remember the land of
bondage. And they will come  again and with a vengeance: the sons of
<a name="s12011k" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12011k">Granuaile</a>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Perfectly true, says Bloom. But my point was&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; We are a long time waiting for that day, citizen, says
Ned. Since <a name="s12004ca" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004ca">the
French</a> <a name="s12004ca" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004ca">landed at Killala</a>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ay, says John Wyse. We gave our best blood to France and
Spain, the wild geese. Fontenoy, eh? And Sarsfield and O&apos;Donnell, duke of
Tetuan in Spain and
<a name="s12014ba" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12014ba">Ulysses Browne of
Camus</a> that was
<a name="s12014bc" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12014bc">fieldmarshal to
Maria Teresa</a>. But what did we ever get for it?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The French! says the citizen. Set of dancing masters. Do
you know what it is? They were
<a name="s12004bb" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004bb">never worth a
roasted fart</a> to Ireland. Aren&apos;t they trying to make an entente cordial
now with perfidious Albion? Firebrands of Europe and they always were.<a target="foot" id="fnn0241">&ordm;</a></p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="s12015r" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12015r"><i>Conspuez les

<p class="di">&mdash; And as for the Germans, says Joe, haven&apos;t we had
enough of those sausageeating bastards on the throne from George the elector
down to the flatulent old bitch that&apos;s dead?</p>
<p> Jesus, I had to laugh at the way he came out with that about the old one
with the winkers on her,<a target="foot" id="fnn0243">&ordm;</a> blind drunk in
her royal palace every night with her jorum of mountain dew and her coachman
carrying her up body and bones to roll into bed and she pulling him by the
whiskers and singing him old bits of songs about Ehren on the Rhine and

<p class="di">&mdash; Well,<a target="foot" id="fnn0244">&ordm;</a> says J.J. We have Edward the peacemaker now.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="s12004au" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004au">Tell that to a
fool</a>, says the citizen. There&apos;s a bloody sight more pox than pax about that boyo.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And what do you think, says Joe, of the holy boys, the
priests and bishops of Ireland doing up his room in Maynooth in his racing
colours and sticking up pictures of all the horses his jockeys rode. </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; They ought to have stuck up all the women he rode, says little Alf.</p>
<p> And says J.J.:<a target="foot" id="fnn0246">&ordm;</a></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Considerations of space influenced their lordships&apos; decision.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Will you try another, citizen? says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, sir, says he, I will.<a target="foot" id="fnn0247">&ordm;</a></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You? says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Thank you, Joe, says I.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Repeat that dose, says Joe.</p>
<p> <a name="un5015ai" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5015ai">Bloom was
talking and talking with John Wyse and he quite excited</a> with his old
plumeyes<a target="foot" id="fnn0248">&ordm;</a> rolling about.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Persecution, says he, all the history of
the<a target="foot" id="fnn0249">&ordm;</a> world is full of it. Perpetuating national hatred among nations.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="s12002cp" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12002cp">But do you know what a nation means?</a> says John Wyse.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, says Bloom.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What is it? says John Wyse.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A nation? says Bloom. A nation is the same people living in the same place.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; By God, then, says Ned, laughing, if that&apos;s so
I&apos;m a nation for I&apos;m living in the same place for the past years.</p>
<p> So of course everyone had a<a target="foot" id="fnn0250">&ordm;</a> laugh at
Bloom and says he, trying to muck out of it:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Or also living in different places.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That covers my case, says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What is your nation if I may ask,<a target="foot" id="fnn0251">&ordm;</a> says the citizen.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ireland, says Bloom. I was born here. Ireland.</p>
<p> The citizen said nothing only cleared the spit out of his gullet and, gob,
he spat an oyster out of him right in the corner.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="s12007af" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12007af">After you with the push</a>, Joe, says he.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 318}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Here you are, citizen, says Joe.
<a name="s12002be" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12002be">Take that in your
right hand and repeat after me the following words.</a></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Which is which? says I.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="s12004ce" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004ce">That&apos;s
mine,</a> says Joe,
<a name="s12004ce" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004ce">as the devil said to the dead policeman.</a></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And I belong to a race too, says Bloom, that is hated and
persecuted. Also now. This very moment. This very instant.</p>
<p> Gob, he near burnt his<a target="foot" id="fnn0255">&ordm;</a> fingers with the butt of his old cigar.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Robbed, says he. Plundered. Insulted. Persecuted. Taking
what  belongs to us by right. At this very moment, says he, putting up his fist.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Are you talking about the new Jerusalem? says the citizen.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I&apos;m talking about injustice, says Bloom.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 319}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Right, says John Wyse. Stand up to it then with force like men.</p>
<p> That&apos;s an almanac<a target="foot" id="fnn0257">&ordm;</a> picture for
you. Old lardyface standing up to
<a name="un3050g" href="../../ff/unbs/un3all.htm#un3050g">the business end of a
gun</a>. Gob, he&apos;d adorn a sweeping brush, so he would, if he only had a
nurse&apos;s apron on him. And then he collapses all of a sudden, twisting
around all the opposite, as limp as a wet rag.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; But it&apos;s no use, says he. Force, hatred, history, all
that. That&apos;s not life for men and women, insult and hatred. And everybody
knows that it&apos;s the very opposite of that that is really life.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What? says Alf.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Love, says Bloom. I mean the opposite of hatred. I must go
now, says he to John Wyse. Just round to the court a moment to see if Martin is
there. If he comes just say I&apos;ll be back in a second. Just a moment.</p>
<p> And off he pops.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A new apostle to the gentiles, says the citizen. Universal love.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Well, says John Wyse. Isn&apos;t that what we&apos;re
told. Love your neighbour<a target="foot" id="fnn0259">&ordm;</a>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That chap? says the citizen. Beggar my neighbour is his
motto. Love, Moya<a target="foot" id="fnn0260">&ordm;</a>! He&apos;s a nice pattern of a Romeo and Juliet.</p>
<p> Love loves to love love. Nurse loves the new chemist. Constable 25A loves
Mary Kelly. Gertie MacDowell loves the boy that has the bicycle. M.B. loves a
fair gentleman. Li Chi Han lovey up kissy Cha Pu Chow. Jumbo, the elephant,
loves Alice, the elephant. Old Mr Verschoyle with the ear trumpet loves old Mrs
Verschoyle with the turned in eye. The man in the brown mackintosh loves a lady
who is dead. His Majesty<a target="foot" id="fnn0261">&ordm;</a> the
King<a target="foot" id="fnn0262">&ordm;</a> loves her majesty the
Queen<a target="foot" id="fnn0263">&ordm;</a>. Mrs Norman W. Tupper loves
officer Taylor. You love a certain person. And this person loves that other
person because everybody loves somebody but God loves everybody.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Well, Joe, says I, your very good health and song. More power, citizen. </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Hurrah, there, says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The blessing of God and Mary and Patrick on you, says the citizen.</p>
<p> And he ups with his pint to wet his whistle.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; We know those canters, says he, preaching and picking your
pocket.<a target="foot" id="fnn0264">&ordm;</a> What about Cromwell that put the
women and children of Drogheda to the sword with
the<a target="foot" id="fnn0265">&ordm;</a> bible texts <i>God is love</i>
pasted round the mouth of his cannons. The bible! Did you read that skit in the
<i>United Irishman</i> today about that Zulu chief that&apos;s visiting England?
<br><font color="green">{u22, 320}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What&apos;s that? says Joe.</p>
<p> So the citizen takes up one of his papers and he starts reading out:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A delegation of

emphasised<a target="foot" id="fnn0267">&ordm;</a> the cordial relations

<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="s12007t" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12007t">Same only more so</a>,
says Lenehan. And thereafter in that fruitful land the broadleaved mango flourished exceedingly.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Is that by Griffith? says John Wyse.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; No, says the citizen. It&apos;s not signed Shanganagh.

<p class="di">&mdash; That&apos;s how it&apos;s worked, says the citizen. Trade follows the flag.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Well, says J.J.,<a target="foot" id="fnn0272">&ordm;</a>
if they&apos;re any worse than those Belgians in the

<p class="di">&mdash; I know where he&apos;s gone,
says<a target="foot" id="fnn0273">&ordm;</a> Lenehan, cracking his fingers.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who? says I.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 321}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Bloom, says he.
The<a target="foot" id="fnn0274">&ordm;</a> courthouse is a blind. He had a few
bob on <i>Throwaway</i> and he&apos;s gone to gather in the shekels.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Is it that

says the citizen, that never backed a horse in anger in his life?<a target="foot" id="fnn0276">&ordm;</a></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That&apos;s where he&apos;s gone, says Lenehan. I met
Bantam Lyons going to back that horse only I put him off it and he told me Bloom
gave him the tip. Bet you what you like he has a hundred shillings to five on.
He&apos;s the only man in Dublin has it. A dark horse.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He&apos;s a bloody dark horse himself, says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Mind, Joe, says I.

<p class="di">&mdash; There you are, says Terry.</p>
<p> So I just went round<a target="foot" id="fnn0277">&ordm;</a> the back of the
yard to <a name="un1032bv" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1032bv">pumpship</a>
and begob (hundred shillings to five) while I was letting off my
(<i>Throwaway</i> twenty to) letting off my load gob says I to myself I knew he
was uneasy in his (two pints off Joe and one in Slattery&apos;s off) in his mind
to get off the mark to (hundred shillings  is five quid) and when they were in
the (dark horse) Pisser<a target="foot" id="fnn0278">&ordm;</a> Burke told me
card party and letting on the child was sick (gob, must have done about a
gallon) flabbyarse of a wife speaking down the tube <i>she&apos;s better</i> or
<i>she&apos;s</i> (ow!) all a plan so he could vamoose with the pool if he won
or (Jesus, full up I was) trading without a licence (ow!) never be up to those
bloody (there&apos;s the last of it) Jerusalem (ah!)
<a name="s12001bl" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12001bl">cuckoos</a>.</p>
<p> So anyhow when I got back they were at it dingdong, John Wyse saying it was
Bloom gave the ideas<a target="foot" id="fnn0279">&ordm;</a> for Sinn Fein to
Griffith to put in his paper all kinds of jerrymandering, packed juries and
swindling the taxes off the government<a target="foot" id="fnn0280">&ordm;</a>
and appointing
<a name="s12014d" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12014d">consuls</a> all over
the world to walk about selling Irish industries. Robbing Peter to pay Paul.
<a name="jn1039w" href="../../ff/unbs/jn1all.htm#jn1039w">Gob, that puts the
bloody kybosh on it</a> if old sloppy eyes is mucking up the show. God save
Ireland from the likes of that bloody mouseabout. Mr Bloom with his argol
bargol. Gob,<a target="foot" id="fnn0281">&ordm;</a> he&apos;s like
<a name="s12004cg" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004cg">Lanty MacHale&apos;s
goat</a> that&apos;d go a piece of the road with every one.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Well, it&apos;s a fact, says John Wyse. And there&apos;s
the man now that&apos;ll tell you all about it, Martin Cunningham.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 322}</font> </p>
<p> Sure enough the castle car drove up with Martin on it and Jack Power with
him and a fellow named Crofter or Crofton
<a name="un4016ce" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4016ce">pensioner</a> out of
the collector general&apos;s an orangeman Blackburn has on the registration and
he drawing his pay or Crawford jaunting around the country at the king&apos;s expense.</p>
<p> Our travellers reached the rustic hostelry and alighted from their palfreys.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ho, varlet! cried he, who by his mien seemed the leader of the party. Saucy knave! To us!</p>
<p> So saying he knocked loudly with his swordhilt upon the open lattice. </p>
<p> Mine host came forth at the summons,<a target="foot" id="fnn0282">&ordm;</a> girding him with his tabard.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Give you good den, my masters, said he with an obsequious bow.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Bestir thyself, sirrah! cried he who had knocked. Look to
our steeds. And for ourselves give us of your best for ifaith we need it.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Lackaday, good masters, said the host, my poor house has
but a bare larder. I know not what to offer your lordships.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; How now, fellow? cried the second of the party, a man of
pleasant countenance, so<a target="foot" id="fnn0283">&ordm;</a> serve you the
king&apos;s messengers, master<a target="foot" id="fnn0284">&ordm;</a> Taptun?</p>
<p> An instantaneous change overspread the landlord&apos;s visage.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="un5015bl" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5015bl">Cry you mercy</a>,
gentlemen, he said humbly. An you be the king&apos;s messengers
(God<a target="foot" id="fnn0285">&ordm;</a> shield his majesty!) you shall not
want for aught. The king&apos;s friends (God bless his majesty!) shall not go afasting in my house I warrant me.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Then about! cried the traveller who had not spoken, a
lusty trencherman by his aspect. Hast aught to give us?</p>
<p> Mine host bowed again as he made answer:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What say you, good masters, to a cold pigeon pasty, a
boar&apos;s head with pistachios and a flagon of old Rhenish?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Gadzooks! cried the last speaker. That likes me well. Pistachios!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Aha! cried he of the pleasant countenance. A poor house,
and a bare larder, quotha! &apos;Tis a merry rogue.</p>
<p> So in comes Martin asking where was Bloom.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Where is he? says Lenehan. Defrauding widows and orphans.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Isn&apos;t that a fact, says John Wyse, what I was telling
the citizen about Bloom and the Sinn Fein?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That&apos;s so, says Martin. Or so they allege.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who made those allegations? says Alf.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 323}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I, says Joe. I&apos;m the alligator.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And after all, says John Wyse,
<a name="s12006ck" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12006ck">why can&apos;t a jew
love his country like the next fellow?</a> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Why not? says J.J.
<a name="s12006ck" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12006ck">when he&apos;s quite sure which country it is</a>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Is he a jew or a gentile or what the hell is he? says Ned.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He&apos;s a perverted jew, says Martin, from a place in
Hungary and it was he drew up all the plans according to the Hungarian system. We know that in the castle.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Isn&apos;t he a cousin of Bloom the dentist? says Jack Power.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Not at all, says Martin. His name was Virag,
the<a target="foot" id="fnn0287">&ordm;</a> father&apos;s name that poisoned
himself. He changed it by deedpoll, the father did.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That&apos;s the new Messiah for Ireland! says the citizen. Island of saints and sages!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Well, they&apos;re still waiting for their redeemer, says Martin. For that matter so are we.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, says J.J., and
<a name="s12001bn" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12001bn">every male
that&apos;s born they think it may be their Messiah</a>. And every jew is in a
tall state of excitement, I believe, till he knows if he&apos;s a father or a mother.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Expecting
<a name="s12004ao" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004ao">every moment will be his next</a>, says Lenehan.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O, by God, says Ned, you should have seen Bloom before
that son of his that died was born. I met
him<a target="foot" id="fnn0288">&ordm;</a> one day in the south city markets
<a name="s12015f" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12015f">buying a tin of
Neave&apos;s food</a> six weeks before the wife was delivered.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; En ventre sa m&egrave;re, says J.J.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Do you call that a man? says the citizen.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I wonder did he ever put it out of sight, says Joe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Well, there were two children born anyhow, says Jack Power.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And who does he suspect? says the citizen.</p>
<p> Gob, there&apos;s many a true word spoken in jest. One of those mixed
middlings<a target="foot" id="fnn0290">&ordm;</a> he is. Lying up in the hotel
Pisser<a target="foot" id="fnn0291">&ordm;</a> told me
<a name="s12015e" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12015e">once a month with
headache like a totty with her courses</a>. Why are things like that let live?
Then sloping off with his five quid without putting up a pint like a man.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 324}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Charity to the neighbour, says Martin. But where is he? We can&apos;t wait.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash;
<a name="s12004n" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004n">A wolf in sheep&apos;s
clothing</a>, says the citizen. That&apos;s what he is. Virag from Hungary! Ahasuerus I call him. Cursed by God.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Have you time for a brief libation, Martin? says Ned.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Only one, says Martin. We must be quick. John Jameson.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You, Jack? Crofton? Three half ones, Terry.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Saint Patrick would want to come and convert us again,
says the citizen, after allowing things like that to contaminate our shores.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Well, says Martin, taking his glass. God bless all here is my prayer.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Amen, says the citizen.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And I&apos;m sure He<a target="foot" id="fnn0292">&ordm;</a> will, says Joe.</p>

<p> Arrah, sit down on the parliamentary side of your arse and don&apos;t be
making an exhibition of yourself. Jesus, there&apos;s always some bloody clown
or other kicking up a bloody murder about bloody nothing. Gob, it&apos;d turn
the porter sour in your guts, so it would.</p>
<p> And all the ragamuffins and sluts of the place round the door and Martin
telling the jarvey to drive ahead and the citizen bawling and Alf and Joe at him
to whisht and Bloom on his high horse about the jews and the loafers calling for
a speech and Jack Power trying to get him to sit down on the car and hold his
bloody jaw and a young lad starts singing <i>The Boys of Wexford</i> and a slut shouts out of her:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Eh, mister! Your fly is open, mister!</p>
<p> And says Bloom:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Mendelssohn was a jew and Karl Marx and
<a name="s12014bt" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12014bt">Mercadante</a> and
Spinoza. And your god was a jew and his father was a jew.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He had no father, says Martin. That&apos;ll do now. Drive ahead.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Whose god?<a target="foot" id="fnn0315">&ordm;</a> says the citizen.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Well, his uncle was a jew, says Bloom. Your god was a jew. Christ was a jew like me.</p>
<p> Gob, the citizen made a plunge into the shop.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; By Jesus, says he, I&apos;ll brain that bloody jewman for
using the holy name. By Jesus, I&apos;ll crucify him so I will. Give us that biscuit box here.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Stop! Stop!<a target="foot" id="fnn0316">&ordm;</a> says Joe.</p>
<p> A large and appreciative gathering of friends and acquaintances assembled to
bid farewell to Mr L Virag on the occasion of his departure for  a distant
clime. The ceremony which went off with great <i>&eacute;clat</i> was
characterised by the most affecting cordiality. An illuminated scroll, the work
of Irish artists, was presented to the distinguished visitor on behalf
of<a target="foot" id="fnn0318">&ordm;</a> a large section of the community and
was accompanied by the gift of a silver casket, tastefully executed in the style
of ancient Celtic ornament, a work which reflects every credit on the makers,
Messrs Jacob and Jacob. The departing guest was the recipient of a hearty
ovation, many of those who were present being visibly moved when the select
orchestra of Irish pipes struck up the wellknown strains of <i>Come Back to
Erin</i>. Amid
<a name="un4036be" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4036be">cheers</a> that rent
<a name="s12004u" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004u">the welkin</a> the
vessel slowly moved away saluted by a final floral tribute from the
representatives of the fair sex who were present in large
numbers.<a target="foot" id="fnn0320">&ordm;</a> Gone but not forgotten.</p>
<p> He got hold of the bloody tin anyhow and out with him, and little Alf
hanging on to his elbow and he shouting like a stuck pig:<a target="foot" id="fnn0322">&ordm;</a></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Where is he till I murder him?</p>
<p> And Ned and J.J.<a target="foot" id="fnn0323">&ordm;</a> paralysed with the laughing.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Gob, says I, I&apos;ll be
<a name="un4017s" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4017s">in for the last gospel</a>.</p>
<p> But as luck would have it the jarvey got the nag&apos;s head round the other way and off with him. </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Hold on, citizen, says Joe. Stop!</p>
<p> Begob he made a swipe and let fly. Mercy of God the sun was in his eyes.
Gob, he near sent it into the county Longford. The bloody nag took fright and the old mongrel after
<br><font color="green">{u22, 329}</font>
<br> the car and all the populace shouting and laughing and the old
tinbox<a target="foot" id="fnn0324">&ordm;</a> clattering along the street.</p>
<p> The catastrophe was terrific and instantaneous in its effect. The
observatory of Dunsink registered in all eleven shocks and there is no record
extant of a similar seismic disturbance in our island since the earthquake of
<a name="un2002b" href="../../ff/unbs/un2all.htm#un2002b">1534</a>, the year of
the rebellion of
<a name="un2002d" href="../../ff/unbs/un2all.htm#un2002d">Silken Thomas</a>. The
epicentre appears to have been that part of the metropolis which constitutes the
Inn&apos;s Quay Ward and parish of Saint Michan. All the lordly
residences<a target="foot" id="fnn0325">&ordm;</a> in the vicinity of the palace
of justice were demolished and that noble edifice itself, in which at the time
of the catastrophe, important legal debates were in progress, is literally a
mass of ruins beneath which it is to be feared all the occupants have been
buried alive. From the reports of eyewitnesses it transpires that the seismic
waves were accompanied by a violent atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic
character. An article of headgear since ascertained to belong to the much
respected clerk of the crown and peace Mr George Fottrell and a silk umbrella
with gold handle with the engraved initials,
crest,<a target="foot" id="fnn0326">&ordm;</a> coat of arms and house number of
the erudite and worshipful chairman of quarter sessions sir Frederick Falkiner,
recorder of Dublin, have been discovered by search parties in remote parts of
the island respectively, the former on the third basaltic ridge of the
<a name="s12006ba" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12006ba">giant&apos;s
causeway</a>, the latter embedded to the extent of one foot three inches in the
sandy beach of Holeopen bay near the old head of Kinsale. Other eyewitnesses
depose that they observed an incandescent object of enormous proportions
hurtling through the atmosphere at a terrifying velocity in a trajectory
directed southwest by west. Messages of condolence and sympathy are being hourly
received from all parts of the different continents and the sovereign pontiff
has been graciously pleased to decree that a special <i>missa pro defunctis</i>
shall be celebrated simultaneously by the ordinaries  of each and every parish
church of all the episcopal dioceses subject to the spiritual authority of the
holy see in suffrage of the souls of those faithful departed who have been so
unexpectedly called away from our midst. The work of salvage, removal of debris,
human remains etc has been entrusted to Messrs Michael Meade and
Son,<a target="foot" id="fnn0328">&ordm;</a> Great Brunswick
street<a target="foot" id="fnn0330">&ordm;</a>, and Messrs T.
and<a target="foot" id="fnn0331">&ordm;</a> C.
Martin,<a target="foot" id="fnn0332">&ordm;</a> North Wall, assisted by the men
and officers of the Duke of Cornwall&apos;s light infantry under the general
supervision of H.R.H.,<a target="foot" id="fnn0334">&ordm;</a> rear admiral, the
right honourable sir Hercules Hannibal Habeas Corpus
Anderson,<a target="foot" id="fnn0335">&ordm;</a> K.G., K.P., K.T., P.C.,
K.C.B.,<a target="foot" id="fnn0336">&ordm;</a>
<br><font color="green">{u22, 330}</font>
<br> M.P., J.P., M.B., D.S.O.,<a target="foot" id="fnn0337">&ordm;</a> S.O.D.,
M.F.H., M.R.I.A., B.L., Mus. Doc.,
P.L.G.,<a target="foot" id="fnn0338">&ordm;</a> F.R.C.P.I.<a target="foot" id="fnn0339">&ordm;</a> and F.R.C.S.I.</p>
<p> You never saw the like of it
<a name="un3014a" href="../../ff/unbs/un3all.htm#un3014a">in all your born
puff</a>. Gob, if he got that on the side of his poll he&apos;d remember the
gold cup, so he would, but begob the citizen would have been lagged for
<a name="s12004bc" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004bc">assault and
battery</a> and Joe for
<a name="s12002bv" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12002bv">aiding and
abetting</a>. The jarvey saved his life as sure as God made me. What? O, Jesus,
he did. And he let a <a name="s12007av" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12007av">volley of oaths</a> after him.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Did I kill him, says he, or what?</p>
<p> And he shouting to the bloody dog:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; After him, Garry! After him, boy!</p>
<p> And the last we saw was the bloody car rounding the corner and old
sheepsface on it gesticulating and the bloody mongrel after it with his lugs
back for all he was bloody well worth. Hundred to five! Jesus, he took the value of it out of him, I promise you.</p>
<p> When lo there came about them all a great brightness and they beheld the
chariot wherein he stood ascend to heaven. And they beheld him in the chariot,
clothed upon in the glory of the brightness, having raiment as of the sun, fair
as the moon and terrible that for awe they durst not look upon him. And there
came a voice out of heaven, calling: <i>Elijah! Elijah!</i> And he answered with
a <a name="s12004s" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004s">main cry</a>:
<i>Abba! Adonai!</i> And they beheld him even him, ben Bloom
Elijah,<a target="foot" id="fnn0340">&ordm;</a> amid clouds of angels ascend to
the glory of the brightness at an angle of fortyfive degrees over Donohoe&apos;s
in Little Green street<a target="foot" id="fnn0341">&ordm;</a> like a shot off a shovel.</p>  </main>
