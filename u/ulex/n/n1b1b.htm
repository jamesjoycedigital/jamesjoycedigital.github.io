<p> Lo, as they spoke, a godlike youth came in running on swift feet, radiant as
the eye of heaven, a laughing youth. And lo there passed behind him an elder of
noble mien and visage, bearing the scrolls of law, and with him his lady wife, a
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">comely</span></span> dame of
beauteous lineage, the fairest of her race.</p>
<p> Little Alf Bergan popped in and hid behind Barney&apos;s snug,
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">squez</span></span> squeezed up
laughing. He made signs to &mdash; &mdash;, &mdash; pointing out. And what was
it but that bloody old pantaloon Denis Breen in his bathslippers and two bloody
big lawbooks tucked under his oxter and the wife, unfortunate wretched creature, trotting after him like a poodle</p>
<p> I thought Alf Bergan&apos;d split.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Look at him, he said. Breen. He&apos;s traipsing all
round Dublin with a postcard someone sent him with
<a name="s12001au" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12001au">U.p: up</a> on it to
take a <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">libe</span></span> li&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> He squirmed laughing.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; To take a what?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A libel action for 10,000 pounds</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, Christ!</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He was in John Henry Menton&apos;s and then he went to
Collis and Ward&apos;s and then Tom Rochford met him and for
<br><font color="green">{ms, 3}</font>
<br> lark sent him on to the subsheriff&apos;s. And long John sent him up to
Green street to look for a <a name="un4016as" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4016as">G division man</a>.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is long John going to hang that fellow up in Mountjoy?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; By God, he&apos;ll have to by law
<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">unread</span></font>
send a fellow round with a bell. Look at till I show you. Here, Terry, give us a
<a name="s12002cm" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12002cm">pony of stout</a>.</p>
<p> <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Terr</span></span> Terence
O&apos;Ryan heard him and forthwith he brought him a crystal cup full of the
foamcrowned ebon ale
<a name="s12004m" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004m">the noble twin
brothers</a> Iveagh and Ardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats. He poured it
forth the nectarous beverage, and reached out the crystal goblet in beauty akin
to the immortals. But he, the young chief of the O&apos;Bergans, would
<a name="s12004bk" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004bk">not brook</a> to be
less generous but gave him with noble mien a costly talent of costliest bronze.
Thereon embossed by cunning smithwork was made the image of gracious queen,
Victoria her name who bears rule, a
<a name="un5001i" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5001i">victress</a>
well-beloved, over countless peoples, pale and dark, ruddy and ethiop.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Here you are, Alf Bergan said, chucking out a copper.
Talking about hanging now I&apos;ll show you something you never saw. Hangman&apos;s letters. Look at here.</p>
<p> He drew forth and tossed on the counter a bundle of wisps of letters and envelopes.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Are you codding?
<br><font color="green">{ms, 4}</font> </p>
<p> The young chieftain O&apos;Bergan, comely in his youth, quaffed the divine nectar of Iveagh.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <a name="s12008h" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12008h">Honest injun.</a> Read them.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; How is Tommy these times and his great invention.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I don&apos;t know, Alf Bergan said. I saw him just now on
Essex Bridge with Paddy Dignam. Boylan is going to&nbsp;&hellip;.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You what? Ned Lambert said. With who?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Dignam, Alf Bergan said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is it Paddy?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes. Why?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Don&apos;t you know he&apos;s dead?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Paddy Dignam dead! Alf Bergan cried. Are you codding?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I am not, Ned Lambert said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Sure, I&apos;m after seeing him not five minutes ago on
Essex bridge talking to Tommy&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You saw his ghost then, if you did.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What? Good Christ, only five&nbsp;&hellip;
What?&nbsp;&hellip; And Tommy with him, the two of them, there near what you
call him&apos;s. Dead? He&apos;s no more dead than you are.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I don&apos;t know, Ned Lambert said reflectively. They
took the liberty of burying him this morning anyhow.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Paddy?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ay. God be merciful to him.

<p> He is gone from mortal haunts, the beamy sun of our morning. Light was his
foot on the bracken, Patrick of the beamy countenance. Mourn,

of Guilt may scape him. Dread is his Ire.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, Christ MacKeon, says he, will you listen to this.</p>
<p> He read:</p>

<p class="pdi">&mdash;</p>
<p> Alf stuck them all back in his pocket.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; They&apos;re all barbers from the black country. One chap
sent in a mourning card with a black border on it. Five guineas is the fee but
they make a good bit cutting up the rope in bits and selling it. Do you not
believe me? That&apos;s a fact. They do, faith.</p>
<p> In the dark Regions they bide: the vengeful

<p class="pdi">&mdash; I wonder has it a deterrent effect, X said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; There&apos;s one thing it hasn&apos;t a deterrent effect on, Alf said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What&apos;s that?</p>

<p class="pdi">&mdash; That&apos;s God&apos;s truth, Alf Bergan said. I heard that from a warder that was in Kilmainham

<br> when they hanged Joe Brady.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The invincible?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ay. He told me when they cut him down it was standing out like a poker in their faces.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Good Christ!</p>

<p> XY tendered medical evidence to the effect that the fracture of the cervical
vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would, in the opinion of
science, be

Ireland, &mdash; cried. Set of barbarians. Sure they have nothing, blast them, a
race of mongrels with their mongrel bloody language. We want no mongrels here. Eh, Garryowen?</p>
<p> He heard the voice of his lord and raised his head in pride. Short bow, quick eye, black palate: proud of
<br><font color="green">{ms, 8}</font>
<br> his noble sires.</p>
<p> &mdash; caught the setter by the scruff
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">a</span></span> of the neck and says he:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Eh, Garry, old boy, what do you think?</p>

<p> He shook the setter&apos;s <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">nape</span></span> fell.</p>

<p class="pdi">&mdash; That&apos;s the language we want here, &mdash; cried.
Down with the beurla. We want an Irish speaking Ireland. There was a meeting of
those shoneens in the city hall today to have the Irish language&nbsp;&hellip; Here&apos;s the man can tell us.</p>
<p> John Wyse O&apos;Power, clad in shining armour, hastened in and, low
bending, he made obeisance to the high chief of Erin and bore him tidings of
what had befallen, how that the grave elders of the city had met them in the
tholsel and there, after meet prayer to the gods who dwell in realms supernal,
had taken counsel whereby they might, if so be bring once more to honour among
mortals the winged speech of the Gael. And &mdash; gave ear, a chieftain
excellent in counsel. And they had bethought them of how it might come to pass
for great is their wisdom, and thereat were all right glad and joyous.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It&apos;s on the march, &mdash; cried, dark
Rosaleen&apos;s hour of triumph. What about the scoffers now? A nation once
again. To hell with the bloody brutal Sassenachs, and their language!</p>

<p class="pdi">&mdash; To hell with them, &mdash; bawled,
