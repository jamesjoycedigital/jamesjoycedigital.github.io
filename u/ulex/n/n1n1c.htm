<p> I<a target="foot" id="fnz0022">&ordm;</a> was just passing the time of day
with Old Troy of the DMP at the corner of Arbour hill there and be damned but a
bloody sweep came along and he near put his gear into my eye. I turned around to
let him have <a name="s12003aa" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12003aa">the
weight of my tongue</a> and who should I see coming along out of Stony Batter but Joe Hynes.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Hello, Joe, says I. How are you blowing? Did you see that
bloody chimneysweep near shoving my eye out with his brush?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Soot&apos;s luck, says Joe. Who&apos;s the old ballocks you&apos;re were talking to?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Old Troy, says I, that was
<a name="s12002bt" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12002bt">in the force</a>.
I&apos;m on two minds not to give that fellow in charge for obstructing the path with his brooms and ladders.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What are you doing round those parts? says Joe</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Faith, says I, devil a much. There&apos;s an bloody big
foxy thief round there beyond by the garrison church at the corner of Chicken
lane. Old Troy was just giving me a wrinkle about him lifted any God&apos;s
quantity of tea and sugar to pay three bob a week said he had a farm in the
county Down off a hop o&apos; my thumb by the name of Moses Herzog over there near Heytesbury street.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Circumcised? says Joe</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, says I, a bit off the top. An old plumber named
Geraghty. I&apos;m on to his taw for the past fortnight and I can&apos;t get a penny
<br><font color="green">{ms, 32}</font>
<br> out<a target="foot" id="fnz0023">&ordm;</a> of him.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is that the lay you&apos;re on now? says Joe</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ay, says I, how are the mighty fallen? collector of
<a name="jn1039q" href="../../FF/unbs/jn1all.htm#jn1039q">bad &amp; doubtful
debts</a>. But that&apos;s the most notorious old schemer you&apos;d meet in a
day&apos;s walk and the face of him all pockmarks that&apos;d hold a shower of
rain. Tell him, says he, if he sends you round here again I&apos;ll have him
summonsed before the court, so I will for trading without a licence. And he
after stuffing his guts till he&apos;s fit to burst Jesus, I had to laugh at the
little jewy getting his shirt out. <u>He drink me my teas</u>. <u>He eat me my
sugars</u>. <u>Why he no pay me my moneys?</u></p>
<p> <a name="un2023a" href="../../FF/unbs/un2all.htm#un2023a">For perishable
goods bought of Moses Herzog, of 13 S. Kevin&apos;s parade in the city of
Dublin, Wood quay ward, merchant, hereinafter called the vendor and sold and

herein set forth as this day hereby agreed upon between said vendor, for
himself, his heirs, issue trustees and assigns on the one part and said
purchaser, for himself, his heirs, issue, trustees and assigns on the other part.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Are you a strict t.t.? says Joe.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I&apos;m not taking anything between drinks, says I.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What about paying our respects to Christy Meagher?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He&apos;s up in John of God&apos;s, says I,
<a name="s12002s" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12002s">gone off his head</a>, poor man.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;
<a name="s12002s" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12002s">Drinking his own stuff</a>, says Joe.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That&apos;s it, says I, whisky and water on the brain.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Come around to Barney&apos;s, says Joe. I want to the see the citizen.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Barney
<a name="un5001cc" href="../../FF/unbs/un5all.htm#un5001cc">Mavourneen&apos;s</a>
be it, says I. Anything strange or wonderful, Joe?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Not a word, says Joe. I was up at that meeting in the City Arms</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What was that Joe? says I</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The cattle traders, says Joe, about the foot and mouth
disease. I want to give the citizen
<a name="s12004p" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004p">the hard word</a> about it.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 34}</font> </p>
<p> So<a target="foot" id="fnz0025">&ordm;</a> we bevelled around by the
Linenhall &amp; the courthouse, talking of one thing or another. Decent fellow,
Joe, when he has it but sure like that he never has it. God, I couldn&apos;t get
over that bloody foxy Geraghty. For trading without a licence, says he.</p>
<p> So we turned into Barney Kiernan&apos;s and there, sure enough, was the
citizen <a name="un4021df" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4021df">as large as
life</a> up in the corner having a great confab with himself and the bloody old
mangy dog Garryowen and he waiting for what the sky would drop in the way of drink</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; There he is, says I,
<a name="s12009e" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12009e">in his glory hole</a>, working for the cause.</p>
<p> The old mongrel let a growl out of him would give you the creeps. Be a
corporal work of mercy if someone would take the life of that bloody dog.
I&apos;m told for a fact he ate half the breeches of a constabulary man in
Santry one time that came round pestering for a licence.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Stand and deliver, says he
<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That&apos;s all right, citizen, says Joe. Friends here.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Pass, friends, says he.</p>
<p> Then he <a name="s12001cl" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12001cl">rubs his hand in his eye</a> and says he:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;
<a name="s12001ci" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12001ci">What&apos;s your opinion of the times.</a></p>
<p> Doing the rapparee touch. But, by God, Joe was equal to the occasion.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;
<a name="s12001ci" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12001ci">I think the markets
are on a rise</a>, says he,
<a name="s12001cm" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12001cm">sliding his hand down</a> his fork.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 35}</font> </p>
<p> So<a target="foot" id="fnz0026">&ordm;</a> the citizen
<a name="s12001cn" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12001cn">claps his paw on his knee</a> and says he:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;
<a name="s12001cj" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12001cj">Foreign wars is the cause of it.</a></p>
<p> And says Joe, <a name="s12001co" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12001co">sticking his thumb in his pocket</a>:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;
<a name="s12001cj" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12001cj">It&apos;s the Russians wish to tyrannise</a>.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ah, give over your bloody codding, Joe, says I. I&apos;ve
a thirst on me <a name="s12005bc" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12005bc">I
wouldn&apos;t sell for half a crown</a>.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Give it a name, citizen, says Joe.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The
<a name="s12004am" href="../../FF/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004am">wine of the country</a>, says he.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What&apos;s yours? says Joe.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ditto MacAnaspey, says I.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Three pints, Terry, says Joe.
<p class="spbr"><font color="green">(U84 12.206-243)</font></p>
<p> And begob true as you&apos;re there he lands out with a golden sovereign</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Were you robbing a poorbox? says I.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Sweat of my brow, says Joe.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 34v}</font>
<br>'Twas the prudent member gave me the wheeze.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I saw him, says I, before I met you sloping around by
Pill lane with his cod&apos;s eye counting up all the guts of the fish</p>

<p> Who comes through Michan&apos;s land, a hero in sable armour? O&apos;Bloom,
the son of Rory, it is he. Impervious to fear is Rory&apos;s son, he of the prudent soul.

<p class="pdi">&mdash; For the old woman of Prince&apos;s street, says the
citizen, the subsidised organ. And look at this blasted rag, says he, the

Parnell to be the workingman&apos;s friends. Listen to their names.</p>
