<p> The<a target="foot" id="fnz0028">&ordm;</a> last farewell was affecting in
the extreme. From the belfries far and near the funereal deathbell boomed
unceasingly while all around the gloomy precincts there rolled the ominous
warning of a hundred muffled drums punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of
ordnance. The loud crashes of thunder and the frequent flashes of lightning
which lit up the ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent
its supernatural pomp to the already gruesome function.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 37}</font>
<br> A<a target="foot" id="fnz0029">&ordm;</a> torrential rain poured down from
the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared heads of the multitude which
numbered at least five hundred and fifty thousand. The erudite prelate who
administered the last comforts of religion to the hero martyr knelt in a most
christian spirit in a pool of muddy water, his cassock above his hoary head, and
offered up prayers of supplication. Hard by the block stood the grim figure of
the executioner, his visage being concealed in a ten gallon pot with two round
eyeholes through which his glowering eyes glared furiously. As he awaited the
final sign he tested the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his
brawny arm or decapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been
thoughtfully provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary office. On a
handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the
<a name="s12004bd" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004bd">quartering knife</a>
the various finely tempered disembowelling appliances, a terra cotta saucepan
<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font>
for the reception of the colon, blind intestine, appendix, etc when successfully
extricated and two large milkjugs destined to receive the most precious blood of
the most noble victim. The house steward of the
amalgated<a target="foot" id="fnz0030">&ordm;</a> cats&apos; and dogs&apos; home
was in attendance to convey these vessels when
<a name="s12001at" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12001at">replenished</a> to
that useful institution. Quite an excellent repast consisting of rashers &amp;
eggs, fried rumpsteak &amp; onions delicious hot breakfast rolls &amp; butter
and invigorating tea had been considerately provided by the authorities for the
consumption of the central figure of the tragedy but he expressed the dying wish
(immediately acceded to) that the meal should be divided equally among the
members of the <a name="s12014v" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12014v">sick
&amp; indigent roomkeepers</a> association as a token of his regard &amp;
esteem. The non plus ultra of emotion was reached when
<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font>
the blushing bride elect burst through the serried ranks of the bystanders and
flung herself upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to die for her sake.
She hung about his neck and kissed passionately the different suitable areas
which the decencies of prison garb permitted her ardour to reach. The hero
folded her willowy form in a loving embrace, murmuring fondly &ldquo;Sheila, my
own&rdquo;. Encouraged by the use of her christian name She swore to him as they
<br><font color="green">{ms, 38}</font>
<br> mingled<a target="foot" id="fnz0031">&ordm;</a> the salt streams of their
tears that she would cherish his memory, that she would never forget her hero
boy however frequently she might marry in the course of her after life. She
brought back to his recollection the days gone by, the happy days of blissful
childhood together by the banks of the Anna Liffey when they had indulged in the
innocent pastimes of the young and, forgetful of the dreadful present, they
laughed heartily together, all the bystanders, including the venerable pastor
joining in the general merriment. But anon they were overcome with grief and
clasped their hands for the last last time. A fresh torrent of tears burst from
their eyes and the vast concourse of people, touched to the inmost core, burst
into
<a name="un4017dn" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4017dn">heartrending</a>
sobs, not the least affected being the aged prebendary himself. Nay, even, the
grim provost marshal lieutenant-Colonel Tomkin Tomlinson who presided on the sad
occasion, he who had shot countless sepoys from the cannonmouth without
flinching, could not now restrain his emotion. With his mailed gauntlet he
brushed away a furtive tear and was heard by those privileged burghers
<br><font color="green">{ms, 40}</font>
<br> who<a target="foot" id="fnz0032">&ordm;</a> happened to be in his immediate
entourage to murmur to himself in a faltering undertone:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; God Blame me if she beent a clinker, that there dona. It
makes me kind of sad, it does, cos I thinks of my old mashtub what&apos;s
waiting for me down Limehouse way.</p> </p>  </main>
