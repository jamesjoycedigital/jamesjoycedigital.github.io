<p> There entered a hero

too. J.J. was telling there was an

the Prisoner at the Bar and true Verdict give according to the Evidence so help
them God and kiss the Book. And they rose in their seats, the twelve of Erin,
and they swore by the Name of Him that is from everlasting to do His
Rightwiseness. And the minions of the law straightway led forth from their
donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of justice had apprehended
