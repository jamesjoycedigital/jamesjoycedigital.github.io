<p> Lo, as they spoke, a godlike messenger came in running on swift feet,
radiant as the eye of heaven, a laughing youth. And lo there passed behind him
an elder of noble gait and countenance, bearing the divine scrolls of law, and
with him his lady wife, a dame of beauteous lineage, the fairest of her race.</p>
<p> Little Alf Bergan popped in and hid behind Barney&apos;s snug, squeezed up
laughing. I didn&apos;t know what was up. He made signs to &mdash; &mdash;,
&mdash; pointing out. And what was it but that bloody old pantaloon Denis Breen
in his bathslippers and two bloody big lawbooks tucked under his oxter and
<a name="s12005au" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12005au">hotfoot</a> after
him the wife, unfortunate wretched creature, trotting after him like a poodle</p>
<p> I thought Alf Bergan&apos;d get a fit.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Look at him, he said. Breen. He&apos;s traipsing all
round Dublin with a postcard someone sent him with
<a name="s12001au" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12001au">U.p: up</a> on it to take a li&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> He squirmed laughing.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; To take a what?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A libel action for 10,000 pounds</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, Christ!</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He was in John Henry Menton&apos;s and then he went to
Collis and Ward&apos;s and then Tom Rochford met him and for
<br><font color="green">{ms, 3}</font>
<br> lark sent him on to the subsheriff&apos;s. And the long fellow
<a name="s12014bg" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12014bg">gave him an eye as
good as a process</a> sent him up to Green street to look for the

<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is long John going to hang that fellow up in Mountjoy?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; By God, he&apos;ll have to by law
<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">unread</span></font>
send a fellow round with a bell. Look at till I show you. Here, Terry, give us a
<a name="s12002cm" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12002cm">pony of stout</a>.</p>
<p> Terence O&apos;Ryan heard him and forthwith he brought him a crystal cup
full of the foamcrowned ebon ale which
<a name="s12004m" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004m">the noble twin
brothers</a>

<a name="s12007s" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12007s">Bung</a>ardilaun brew
ever in their divine alevats cunning as the sons of deathless Leda. He poured it
forth as <a name="s12008aa" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12008aa">to the
manner born</a> the nectarous beverage, and reached out the crystal goblet in
beauty akin to the immortals. But he, the young chief of the O&apos;Bergans,
would <a name="s12004bk" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004bk">not brook</a>
to be less generous but gave him with noble mien a testoon of costliest bronze.
Thereon embossed by cunning smithwork was made the image of a queen of gracious
port, Victoria her name

queen of Great Britain &amp; Ireland, empress of India</a>, defender of the

well-beloved, over countless peoples, pale and dark, ruddy and ethiop.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Here you are, Alf Bergan said, chucking out the rhino.
Talking about hanging now I&apos;ll show you something you never saw. Hangmen&apos;s letters. Look at here.</p>
<p> He drew forth and tossed on the counter a bundle of wisps of letters and envelopes.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Are you codding?
<br><font color="green">{ms, 4}</font> </p>
<p> The young chieftain O&apos;Bergan, comely in his youth, quaffed the divine nectar of Iveagh.</p>

<p class="pdi">&mdash; How is Tommy these times and his great invention, Stagger the World.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I don&apos;t know, Alf Bergan said. I saw him just now on
Essex Bridge with Paddy Dignam. Boylan is going to&nbsp;&hellip;.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You what? Ned Lambert cried. With who?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Dignam, Alf Bergan said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is it Paddy?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes. Why?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Don&apos;t you know he&apos;s dead?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Paddy Dignam dead! Alf Bergan cried. Are you codding?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I am not, Ned Lambert said.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Sure, I&apos;m after seeing him not ten, not five minutes
ago on Essex bridge as plain as a pikestaff talking to Tommy&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You saw his ghost then God between us &amp; harm, if you did.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What? Good Christ, only five&nbsp;&hellip;
What?&nbsp;&hellip; And Tommy with him, the two of them, there near what you
call him&apos;s. Dead? He&apos;s no more dead than you are.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Maybe so, Ned Lambert said reflectively. They took the
liberty of burying him this morning anyhow.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Paddy?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ay.

<p> In the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when supplication by
tantras had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing
luminosity of dark ruby light became visible, the apparition
<a name="un1013bh" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1013bh">of the etheric
double</a> being particularly lifelike in consequence of the discharge of
<a name="un1013bp" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1013bp">jivic rays from the
head and face</a>. Communication was made through
<a name="un1013bs" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1013bs">the pituitary
body</a> and also through the
<a name="un1013bi" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1013bi">orangefiery</a> and
<a name="un1013bj" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1013bj">scarlet rays
emanating</a> respectively from the

<a name="un1013bj" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1013bj">solar plexi</a>.
Questioned as to his whereabouts he stated that he was now on
<a name="un1013l" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1013l">the path of pralaya or
return</a> but was submitted to trial by some
<a name="s12015a" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12015a">bloodthirsty entities
on the lower astrals</a>. Questioned as to his first sensations he stated that
before he had seen as in a glass darkly but that those who had passed over had
summit possibilities of atmic development opened up to them. Interrogated as to
whether life there resembled our experience in the flesh he stated that he had
heard from more favoured beings that their abodes were equipped with every
modern comfort and that the highest adepts were steeped in volupcy of the purest
kind. Having requested a jug of buttermilk this was brought and evidently
afforded relief. Asked if he had any message for the living he exhorted all men
to acknowledge the true path for it was reported that
<a name="s12015h" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12015h">Mars and
<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font>
were out for mischief on the eastern angle where the Ram has rule</a>. He was
then queried whether there were any special desires on the part of the
<br><font color="green">{ms, 4v}</font>
<br> defunct and the reply was: Watch CK doesn&apos;t pile it on. It was
ascertained that the reference was to Mr Cornelius Kelleher, manager of Messrs
H.J. O&apos;Neill&apos;s, the popular funeral undertakers, a friend of the
defunct who had been responsible for the carrying out
of<a target="foot" id="fnz0001">&ordm;</a> the interment arrangements. Before
departing he requested that it should be told to Patsy, his dear son, that the
other boot which he had been looking for was at present under the commode in the
return room and that the pair should be soled only as the heels were still good.
He stated that this had greatly disturbed his peace of mind in the other region
and earnestly requested that his desire should be made known. Assurances were
given that this matter would be seen to and it was intimated that this had given satisfaction.

<p> He is gone from mortal Haunts: O&apos;Dignam, Sun of our Morning. Fleet was
his Foot on the Bracken: Patrick of the beamy Brow. Wail, Inisfail, with your
Wind: and wail, O Ocean, with your Whirlwind.</p>
<p> Bob Doran bent over with the hat on the back of his poll &ldquo;Who&apos;s
dead?&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;Dignam&rdquo; says Ned Lambert &ldquo;Is it little
Dignam that was in Menton&apos;s office&rdquo; Ay, by God. &ldquo;Ay, poor chap,

produce a violent ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital
apparatus thereby causing the elastic pores of the <u>corpus spongiosum</u> to
