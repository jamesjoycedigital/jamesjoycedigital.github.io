<p> The<a target="foot" id="fnz0028">&ordm;</a> last farewell was affecting in
the extreme. From the belfries far and near the funeral deathbell boomed while
all around the gloomy precincts there rolled the ominous warning of a hundred
muffled drums. The loud crashes of thunder and the frequent flashes of lightning
which lit up the ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent
its supernatural pomp to the already gruesome function.

A<a target="foot" id="fnz0029">&ordm;</a> torrential rain poured down from the
floodgates of heaven upon the bared heads of the multitude which numbered at
least five hundred and fifty thousand. The erudite prelate who administered the
last comforts of religion to the hero martyr knelt in a most christian spirit in
a pool of muddy water, his cassock above his hoary head, and offered up
alternate prayers of supplication. Hard by the block stood the grim
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">be</span></span> figure of the
executioner, his visage being concealed in a ten gallon pot in which two round
eyeholes through which his gruesome eyes glared furiously. As he awaited the
final sign he tested the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his
brawny arm or decapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been
provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary office. The non plus ultra of
emotion was reached when the blushing bride elect burst through the serried
ranks of the bystanders and flung herself
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">into</span></span> upon the
muscular bosom of him who was about to die for her sake. She hung about his neck
and kissed passionately the different suitable areas which the decencies of
prison garb permitted her ardour to reach. She swore to him as they
<br><font color="green">{ms, 38}</font>
<br> mingled<a target="foot" id="fnz0031">&ordm;</a> the salt streams of their
tears that she would cherish his memory, that she would never forget her hero
boy however frequently she might marry in the course of her future life. She
brought back to his memory the days gone by, the happy days of blissful
childhood together
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">and</span></span> when they
indulged in the innocent pastimes of the young and, forgetful of the dreadful
present, they laughed heartily together, all the bystanders, including the
venerable prelate joining in the general merriment. But anon they were overcome
with grief and clasped their hands for the last last time. A fresh torrent of
tears burst from their eyes and the vast concourse of people, touched to the
inmost core, burst into
<a name="un4017dn" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4017dn">heartrending</a>
sobs, not the least affected being the aged pastor himself. Nay, even, the grim
provost marshal sir colonel who presided on the sad occasion, he who had shot
countless sepoys from the cannonmouth without flinching, could not now restrain
his emotion. With his mailed gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear and was heard by those privileged burghers
<br><font color="green">{ms, 40}</font>
<br> who<a target="foot" id="fnz0032">&ordm;</a> happened to be in his immediate
entourage to murmur to himself in faltering undertone:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Blame me if that there dona beent the clinker, that there
dona. It makes me kind of sad, it does, cos I thinks of my old
