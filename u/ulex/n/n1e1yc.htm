<p> Cusack read on:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A distinguished gathering assembled
<a name="un2014g" href="../../ff/unbs/un2all.htm#un2014g">in Manchester
yesterday</a> to do honour to a ruler of Africa, the Alaki of Abeakuta. A
delegation consisting of the chief magnates of the district was presented to his
majesty by Gold Stick in Waiting, lord Walkup of Walkup on
Eggs<a target="foot" id="fnz0035">&ordm;</a> and tendered to his majesty their
heartfelt thanks for the facilities afforded to British traders in his
majesty&apos;s dominions. The dusky potentate in the course of a gracious speech
(translated by the British chaplain from Alakamekhapth, the reverend Ananias
Praisegod Barebones) tendered his thanks to massa Walkup and emphasised the
cordial relations existing between his people and the British empire, stating
that he treasured as one of his dearest possessions an illuminated bible
presented to him by the great squaw, Victoria. Amid general applause the Alaki
then drank a loving cup to the toast of &lsquo;The King, God bless him&rsquo;
from the skull of his immediate predecessor in the dynasty, Kakachakachak,
nicknamed Forty Warts. an<a target="foot" id="fnz0036">&ordm;</a> outstanding
feature of The ceremony was a musical setting of the versicle <u>I am black but
comely</u> excellently rendered by the royal musicians upon their curious native
instruments, alligator carapaces strung with the elongated guts of vanquished
Zulu warriors and the perforated thighbones of early christian missionaries, the
effect of these latter being remarkably similar to the dulcet melancholy tones of the Italian <u>ocarina</u>.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, trust a widow woman, says Ned. Wonder did he put that bible to the same use as I would.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The same only more so, says Lenehan, and thereafter in
that fruitful land the broadleaved mango flourished exceedingly.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is that by Griffith? says &mdash;. It&apos;s like what
that chap writes under the name of Heblon.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I don&apos;t know, says Cusack. It&apos;s only initialled P.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And a bloody good initial too, says Lenehan.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, says O&apos;Madden Burke, Griffith&apos;s stuff is signed <u>Shanganagh</u></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is it you is going to write that pantomime about Finn
MacCool or Brian Boru, isn&apos;t it? says &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What about it? says O&apos;Madden Burke. Haven&apos;t we
had enough of those English importations with musichall songs and flash girls in tights.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I heard it was Bloom gave Griffith the hard word about that Hungarian lay he&apos;s on.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Using the county councils, is it? And chucking sending
over the members on the floor of the house?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Leaders of the Irish people at home and abroad, says &mdash;.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well and doesn&apos;t it stand to reason? says
O&apos;Madden Burke. If Peter the Packer can pack a jury for the crown why
can&apos;t we pack the civil service and the police and the constabulary and
swindle them over the taxes and boycott the post too.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And how would you send letters? says &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; By private post, says O&apos;Madden Burke. And then they
can&apos;t spy on your correspondence</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And aren&apos;t they talking of sending Irish consuls to
the continent to open up trade? says &mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What about the wherewithal? says Lenehan.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 2}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; There are Irish American millionaires behind it, says &mdash; {!U84 1365-1408}</p>
<p> Then did you speak, noble Cusack, lifting up your voice; and all men harkened:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; They were driven out of house and home in the black
&apos;47. Their mudcabins by the roadside were laid low by the battering rams of
the Sassenach. They departed with tears and wailing And the <u>Times</u> rubbed
its hands and told the whitelivered English public that there would soon be as
few Irish in Ireland as redskins in India and suggested to ship off the few of
us that still lived, praying for death, to the banks of the Hydaspe and the
Brahmaputra. Twenty 20,000<a target="foot" id="fnz0037">&ordm;</a> of the poor
wretches died in the coffinships when the land was full of crops and the nation
of shopkeepers, as Napoleon called them, selling the harvest of our peasants in
Rio de Janeiro, and hoarding it up till it rotted on their hands. Why, even the
Turks sent us their piastres then. The whole world did. But, if they went, they
built up a greater Ireland beyond the waves. And they will come again: and with a vengeance: the sons of Granuaile.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; We&apos;re a long time waiting for that day, says &mdash;
One time it was the French have landed at Killala. Then the Yankees. Now it&apos;s the Germans or the Japanese.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ay, and look at all the generals and soldiers we sent to
France and Spain, says O&apos;Madden Burke and Austria too, when the
Cromwellians drove them out, the wild geese. Fontenoy, eh? And Sarsfield. And
O&apos;Donnell, duke of Tetuan in Spain and Ulysses Browne of Camus and Mountany
that was fieldmarshal to Maria Teresa, no less, not forgetting Marshal MacMahon,
J&apos;y suis, J&apos;y reste. And what did we ever get for it?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The French! says Ned. Set of dancing masters! Do you know
what it is! They were never worth a roasted fart to Ireland. And now aren&apos;t
they going to make what they call an entente cordiale with perfidious Albion
against the Germans. Firebrands of Europe they always were.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Conspuez les anglais, says Lenehan.</p>
<p> He knows a bit of the lingo he picks up in the smutty papers he reads</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And as for the Germans! says Ned. Haven&apos;t we had
enough of those sausageeating bastards on the throne from George the Elector
down to the flatulent old bitch that&apos;s dead.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And Edward the peacemaker, says Lenehan</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Arrah, tell that to a fool, says Ned. There&apos;s a
bloody sight more pox than pax about him if you ask me.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And when he was over here last year, says O&apos;Madden
Burke, what about the holy boys, the priests and bishops that killed our
rightful king, Chas. Stew. Parnell, doing up his room in Maynooth in his racing
colours and sticking up round the wall all the horses his jockeys rode.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; They ought to have stuck up all the married women he rode himself, says Ned.</p>
<p> And says J.J.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Considerations of space doubtless influenced their lordships&apos; decision.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Talking about kings, says Hynes, the MacDermot that died
is the real king of Ireland. Hugh Hyacinth, the MacDermott, prince of Coolavin.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, No, says O&apos;Madden Burke. You&apos;re
<br><font color="green">{ms, 3}</font>
<br> wrong there, Joe. It&apos;s the O&apos;Conor Don. He&apos;s the descendant
of Roderick O&apos;Conor, the last king of all Ireland.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; We want no king nor crown nor mitre either, shouts
Cusack. The Royal Stuarts were no better. Strangle the last king in the windpipe
of the last priest. We want no French or Germans. We want ourselves. Sinn Fein! Sinn Fein amh&aacute;in!</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I tell you what it is, says O&apos;Madden Burke,
there&apos;s a war coming on for the Sassanachs and the Germans will give them a
hell of a gate of going. What the imperial yeomanry got from the boers is only
what you might call a hors d&apos;&oelig;uvre.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But aren&apos;t you after saying&nbsp;&hellip;? says Ned</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I know what I&apos;m after saying, says O&apos;Madden
Burke. But, win or lose, they&apos;ll have to stand up to their match this time
not naked Zulus to mow them down with their dumdum bullets and Ashantimen with
puttyknives in their hands. Not likely! They&apos;ll be up against a conundrum,
I tell you, that&apos;ll put the kibbosh on them, a fellow that&apos;ll kill his
man for every man they kill. Wait till you see.</p>
<p> Thus did they laud the prowess of those farfamed races, the lordly Gauls (or
Gaiculs, as some do name them), sons of the Gamecock, nimble of foot, a noble
nation descended from the gods who dwell in the land of Oui-Oui, and the lordly
Teutons (from Teuton or Chewaton are they yclept) brood of the Stork, feasters
at the board, a noble race of the seed of the immortals, whose dwelling is in the land of Ja-Ja.</p> </p>  </main>
