<p> I was just passing the time of day with old Troy of the D.M.P. at the corner
of Arbour hill there and be damned but a bloody sweep came along and he near
drove his gear into my eye. I turned around to let him have the weight of my
tongue when who should I see dodging along Stony Batter only Joe Hynes.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Lo, Joe, says I. How are you blowing? Did you see that
bloody chimneysweep near shove my eye out with his brush?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Soot&apos;s luck, says Joe. Who&apos;s the old ballocks you were talking to?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Old Troy, says I, was in the force. I&apos;m on two minds
not to give that fellow in charge for obstructing the thoroughfare with his brooms and ladders.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What are you doing round those parts? says Joe.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Devil a much, says I. There&apos;s a bloody big foxy
thief beyond by the garrison church at the corner of Chicken lane &mdash; old
Troy was just giving me a wrinkle about him &mdash; lifted any God&apos;s
quantity of tea and sugar to pay three bob a week said he had a farm in the
county Down off a hop-of-my-thumb by the name of Moses Herzog over there near Heytesbury street.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Circumcised? says Joe.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ay, says I. A bit off the top. An old plumber named Geraghty.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 002}</font>
<br> I&apos;m hanging on to his taw now for the past fortnight and I can&apos;t get a penny out of him.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That the lay you&apos;re on now? says Joe.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ay, says I. How are the mighty fallen! Collector of bad
and doubtful debts. But that&apos;s the most notorious bloody robber you&apos;d
meet in a day&apos;s walk and the face on him all pockmarks would hold a shower
of rain. Tell him, says he,
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">if
he dare</span></span> <font color="black">I dare him, says he, and I doubledare
him</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font> to send you
round here again,
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">says
he</span></span> <font color="black">or if he does, says
he,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font> I&apos;ll have
him summonsed up before the court, so I will, for trading without a licence. And
he after stuffing himself till he&apos;s fit to burst. Jesus I had to laugh at
the little jewy getting his
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">rag</span></span> shirt out. <u>He
drink me my teas. He eat me my sugars. Why he no pay me my moneys.</u></p>
<p> For nonperishable goods bought of Moses Herzog, of 13 Saint Kevin&apos;s
parade in the city of Dublin, Wood quay ward, merchant, hereinafter called the
vendor, and sold and delivered to Michael. E. Geraghty, esquire, of 29 Arbour
hill in the city of Dublin, Arran quay ward, gentleman, hereinafter called the
purchaser, videlicet, five pounds avoirdupois of first choice tea at three
shillings
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">and no
pence</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font> per pound
avoirdupois and three stone avoirdupois of sugar, crushed crystal, at
threepence<a target="foot" id="fnz0040">&ordm;</a> per pound avoidupois, the
said purchaser debtor to the said vendor of one pound five shillings and
sixpence sterling for value received which amount shall be paid by said
purchaser to said vendor in weekly instalments every seven calendar days of three
<br><font color="green">{ms, 003}</font>
<br> shillings and no pence sterling: and the said nonperishable goods shall not
be pawned or pledged or sold or otherwise alienated by the said purchaser but
shall be and remain and be held to be the sole and exclusive property of the
said vendor to be disposed of at his good will and pleasure until the said
amount shall have been duly paid by the said purchaser to the said vendor in the
manner herein set forth as this day hereby agreed between the said vendor, his
heirs, successors, trustees and assigns, of the one part and the said purchaser,
his heirs, successors, trustees and assigns of the other part.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Are you a strict t.t.? says Joe.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Not taking anything between drinks, says I.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What about paying our respects to our friend? says Joe.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Who? says I. Sure, he&apos;s
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">up</span></span> out in John of God&apos;s off his head, poor man.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Drinking his own stuff? says Joe.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ay, says I. Whisky and water on the brain.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Come around to Barney Kiernan&apos;s, says Joe. I want to see the citizen.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Barney mavourneen&apos;s be it, says I. Anything strange or wonderful, Joe?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Not a word, says Joe. I was up at that meeting in the City Arms.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What was that, Joe? says I.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Cattle traders, says Joe, about the foot and mouth
disease. I want to give the citizen the hard word about it.</p>
<p> So we went around by the Linenhall barracks and the back of the courthouse
talking of one thing or another. Decent fellow Joe when he has it but sure like that
<br><font color="green">{ms, 004}</font>
<br> he never has it. Jesus, I couldn&apos;t get over that bloody foxy Geraghty.
For trading without a licence, says he.</p>
<p> In Inisfail the fair there lies a land, the land of holy Michan. There rises
a watchtower beheld of men afar. There sleep the mighty dead as in life they
slept, warriors and princes of high renown. A pleasant land it is in sooth of
murmuring waters, fishful streams where sport the gunnard, the plaice, the
halibut, the flounder
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">the
pollock</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font> and other
denizens of the acqueous kingdom too numerous to be enumerated. In the mild
breezes of the west and of the east the lofty trees wave in different directions
their firstclass foliage, the sycamore, the Lebanonian cedar, the exalted
planetree, the eucalyptus and other ornaments of the arboreal world with which
that region is thoroughly well supplied. Lovely maidens sit in close proximity
to the roots of the
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">lovely</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font>
trees singing the most lovely songs while they play with all kinds of lovely
objects as for example golden ingots, silvery fishes, purple seagems and playful
insects. And heroes voyage from afar to woo them, the sons of kings.</p>
<p> And there rises a shining palace whose
crytally<a target="foot" id="fnz0041">&ordm;</a> glittering roof is seen by
mariners who traverse the extensive sea in barks
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">built
for that purpose</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font>,
and thither come all herds and
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">fatlings
and</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font> firstfruits of
that land for O&apos;Connell Fitzsimon takes toll of them, a chieftain descended from chieftains.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 005}</font>
<br> Thither the extremely large wains bring foison of the fields, spherical
potatoes and irridescent kale and onions, pearls of the earth, and red, green,
yellow, brown, russet, sweet, big, bitter, ripe, pomellated apples and
strawberries fit for princes and raspberries from their canes.</p>
<p> I dare him, says he, and I doubledare him.</p>
<p> And thither wend the herds innumerable of heavyhooved kine from pasturelands
of Lusk and Rush and Carrickmines and from the streamy vales of Thomond and from
the gentle declivities of the place of the race of Kiar, their udders distended
with superabundance of milk and butter and rennets of cheese and oblong eggs,
various in size, the agate with the dun.</p>
<p> So we turned into Barney Kiernan&apos;s and there, sure enough, was the
citizen as large as life up in the corner having a
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">great</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font>
confab with himself and that bloody mangy mongrel, Garryowen, and he waiting for
what the sky would drop in the way of drink.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; There he is, says I, in his glory hole,
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">with
his load of papers</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font> working for the cause.</p>
<p> The bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps. Be a
corporal work of mercy if someone would take the life of that bloody dog.
I&apos;m told for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off a constabulary
man in Santry that came round one time with a blue paper about a licence.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Stand and deliver, says he</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That&apos;s all right, citizen, says
<br><font color="green">{ms, 006}</font>
<br> Joe. Friends here.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Pass, friends, says he.</p>
<p> Then he rubs his hand in his eye and says he:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What&apos;s your opinion of the times?</p>
<p> Doing the rapparee
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">touch</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font>.
But, begob, Joe was equal to the occasion.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I think the markets are on a rise, says he, sliding his hand down his fork.</p>
<p> So begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Foreign wars is the cause of it.</p>
<p> And says Joe, sticking his thumb in his pocket:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It&apos;s the Russians wish to tyrannise.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Arrah, give over your bloody codding, Joe, says I.
I&apos;ve a thirst on me I wouldn&apos;t sell for half a crown.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Give it a name, citizen, says Joe.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Wine of the country, says he.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What&apos;s yours? says Joe.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ditto MacAnaspey, says I.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Three pints, Terry, says Joe. And how&apos;s the old heart, citizen? says he.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Never better, <u>a chara</u>, says he. What Garry? Are we going to win? Eh?</p>
<p> And with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck and, by Jesus, he near throttled him.</p>
<p> The figure seated on a large boulder was that of a
broadshouldered<a target="foot" id="fnz0042">&ordm;</a>, deepchested,
stronglimbed, frankeyed, redhaired
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">freely
freckled</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font>,
shaggybearded, widemouthed, largenosed, longheaded deepvoiced, barekneed,
brawnyhanded, hairylegged, ruddyfaced, sinewyarmed hero. From shoulder to
shoulder he measured several ells and his rocklike knees were covered, as was
likewise the rest of his body wherever visible, with a strong growth of tawny
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">bristly</span></span>
<font color="black">prickly</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font>
hair in hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse
(<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">&mdash;</span></span>
<font color="black">Ulex
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Europaeus</span></span>
Europeus</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font>). The widewinged nostrils, from which bristles
<br><font color="green">{ms, 007}</font>
<br> of the same tawny hue projected, were of such capaciousness that within
their cavernous obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest. The
eyes in which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the
dimension<a target="foot" id="fnz0043">&ordm;</a> of a goodsized cauliflower. A
powerful current of warm breath issued at regular intervals from the profound
cavity of his mouth while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale
reverberations of his formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground
and the lofty walls of the cave to vibrate and tremble.</p>
<p> He wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to the
knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a girdle of plaited
straw and rushes. Beneath this he wore trews of deerskin, roughly stitched with
gut. His nether extremities were encased in high buskins dyed in lichen purple,
the feet being shod with brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of
the same beast. From his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled at every
movement of his portentous frame and on these were graven with rude yet striking
art the tribal images of many heroes of antiquity, Cuchulin, Conn of hundred
battles, Niall of nine hostages, Brian of Kincora, the ardri Malachi, Art Mac
Murragh, Shane O&apos;Neill, Father John Murphy, Owen Roe, Patrick Sarsfield,
Red Hugh O&apos;Donnell, Don Philip O&apos;Sullivan Beare. A spear of acuminated
granite rested by him while at his feet reposed a savage animal of the
<br><font color="green">{ms, 008}</font>
<br> canine tribe whose stertorous gasps announced that he was sunk in uneasy
slumber, a supposition confirmed by hoarse growls and spasmodic movements which
his master repressed from time to time by tranquilising blows of a mighty cudgel
rudely fashioned out of paleolithic stone.</p>
<p> So anyhow Terry brought the three pints Joe was standing and begob the sight
nearly left my eyes when I saw him land out a quid. O,
<a name="un4017au" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4017au">as true as I&apos;m
telling you</a>. A goodlooking sovereign.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And there&apos;s more where that came from, says he.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Were you robbing a poorbox, Joe? says I.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Sweat of my brow, says Joe. &apos;Twas the prudent member gave me the wheeze</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I saw him before I met you, says I, sloping around by
Pill lane with his cod&apos;s eye counting up all the guts of the fish.</p>
<p> Who comes through Michan&apos;s land, bedight in sable armour? O&apos;Bloom,
the son of Rory: it is he. Impervious to fear is Rory&apos;s son: he of the prudent soul.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; For the old woman of Prince&apos;s street, says the
citizen, the subsidised<a target="foot" id="fnz0044">&ordm;</a> organ.
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">The
pledgebound party on the floor of the
house.</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font> And look at

<p>

Look</span></span><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font></p>

you please, founded by Parnell to be the workingman&apos;s friends. Listen to
the births and deaths in the <u>Irish all for Ireland Independent</u>, and I&apos;ll thank you, and the marriages.</p>
<p> And he starts reading them out:</p>

<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ah, well, says Joe, handing round the boose. Thanks be to
God they had the start of us. Drink that, citizen.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I will, says he, honourable person</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Health, Joe, says I.</p>
<p> Ah! Ow! Don&apos;t be talking! I was blue mouldy for the want of that pint.
Declare to God I could hear it hit the pit of my stomach with a click.</p>
<p> And lo, as they quaffed their cup of joy, a godlike messenger came running
in, radiant as the eye of heaven, a comely youth. And behind him there passed an
elder of noble gait and countenance, bearing the sacred
<br><font color="green">{ms, 010}</font>
<br> scrolls of law and with him his lady wife, a dame of peerless lineage, fairest of her race.</p>
<p> Little Alf Bergan popped in round the door and hid behind Barney&apos;s
snug, squeezed up with the laughing. And who was sitting up there in the corner
that I hadn&apos;t seen snoring drunk
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">blind
to the world</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font> only
Bob Doran. I didn&apos;t know what was up and Alf kept making signs out of the
door. And begob what was it only that bloody old pantaloon Denis Breen in his
bathslippers with two bloody big books tucked under his oxter and the wife
hotfoot after him, unfortunate wretched woman, trotting like a poodle. I thought Alf would split.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Look at him, says he. Breen. He&apos;s traipsing all
round Dublin with a postcard someone sent him with u.p: up on it to take a li&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> And he doubled up.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Take a what? says I</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Libel action, says he, for ten thousand pounds.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O hell! says I.</p>
<p> The bloody mongrel began to growl seeing something was up but the citizen
gave him a kick in the ribs.
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">Begob,
he wakened Bob Doran anyhow.</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Bi i dho husht, says he.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Who? says Joe.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Breen, says Alf. He was in John Henry Menton&apos;s and
then he went round to Colles and Ward&apos;s and then Tom Rochford met him and
sent him round to the subsheriff&apos;s for a lark. O God, I&apos;ve a pain
laughing. U.p: up. The long fellow gave him an eye as good as a process and now
the bloody old lunatic is gone round to Green street to look for a G. man.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; When is that

<p class="pdi">&mdash; Bergan, says Bob Doran, waking up. Is that Alf Bergan.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, says Alf. Hanging?
<a name="un4045bs" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4045bs">Wait till I show
you</a>. Here, Terry, give us a pony of stout. That bloody old fool! Ten
thousand pounds. You should have seen long John&apos;s eye. U.p&nbsp;&hellip;.</p>
<p> And he started laughing.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Who are you laughing at? says Bob
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">Doran</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font>.
Is that Bergan?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Hurry up, Terry boy, says
Alf<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">,
with the stout</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font>.</p>
<p> Terence O&apos;Ryan heard him and straightway brought him a crystal cup full
of the foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers
Bungiveagh<a target="foot" id="fnz0045">&ordm;</a> and Bungardilaun brew ever in
their divine alevats, cunning as the sons of deathless Leda. For they garner the
succulent berries of the hop and mass and sift and bruise and brew them and they
mix therewith sour juices and bring the must to the sacred fire and cease not
night or day from their toil, those cunning brothers, lords of the vat.</p>
<p> Then did you, Terence, hand forth, as to the manner born, that nectarous
beverage and you offered the crystal cup to him that thirsted, in beauty akin to the immortals.</p>
<p> But he, the young chief of the O&apos;Bergan&apos;s,
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">would</span></span>
<font color="black">could</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font>
ill brook to be outdone in generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious
gesture a testoon of costliest bronze. Thereon embossed in excellent smith work
was seen the image of a queen of regal port, Victoria her name, by grace of God
queen of Great Britain and Ireland, empress of India, defender of the faith,
even she, who bore rule, a victress over many peoples, the wellbeloved, for they
knew and loved her from the rising of the sun to the going down thereof, the pale, the dark, the ruddy and the ethiop.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 012}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What&apos;s that bloody freemason doing, says the citizen, prowling up and down outside?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What&apos;s that? says Joe.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Here you are, says Alf, chucking out the rhino. Talking
about hanging, I&apos;ll show you something you never saw. Hangmen&apos;s letters. Look at here.</p>
<p> So he took a bundle of wisps of letters and envelopes out of his pocket.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Are you codding? says I.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Honest injun, says Alf. Read them.</p>
<p> So Joe took up the letters</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Who were you laughing at? says Bob
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">Doran</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font>.</p>
<p> So I saw there was going to be a bit of a dust Bob&apos;s a queer chap when
the porter&apos;s up in him so says I just to make talk:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; How&apos;s

Murray</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font> those times, Alf?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I don&apos;t know, says Alf. I saw him just now in Capel
street with Paddy Dignam. Only I was running after that&nbsp;&hellip;.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You what? says Joe, throwing down the letters. With who?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; With Dignam, says Alf.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is it Paddy? says Joe.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, says Alf. Why?</p>

<p> Begod he was <a name="un4017c" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4017c">what you might call</a> flabbergasted.</p>
<p> In the darkness, spirit
<br><font color="green">{ms, 013}</font>
<br> hands were felt to flutter, and when
<a name="un5015t" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5015t">prayer by</a> tantras
had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing luminosity of
dark ruby light became gradually visible, the apparition of the etheric double
being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge of jivic rays from the crown
of the head and face. Communication<a target="foot" id="fnz0046">&ordm;</a> was
effected through the pituitary body and also by means of the orangefiery and
scarlet rays emanating<a target="foot" id="fnz0047">&ordm;</a> from the sacral
region and solar plexus. Questioned as to his whereabouts he stated that he was
now on the path of pralaya or return but was still submitted to trial at the
hands of certain bloodthirsty entities on the lower astral levels. In reply to a
question as to his first sensations beyond he stated that previously he had seen
but as in a glass darkly but that those who had passed over had summit
possibilities of atmic development opened up to them. Interrogated as to whether
life there resembled our experience in the flesh he stated that he had heard
from more favoured beings that their abodes were equipped with every modern
comfort and that the highest adepts were steeped in waves of volupcy of the very
purest nature. Having requested a

<font color="black">quart</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font>
of buttermilk this was brought and evidently afforded relief. Asked if he had
any message for the living he exhorted all who were still at the wrong side of
maya to acknowledge the true path for it was reported in devanic circles that
Mars and Jupiter were out for mischief on the eastern angle where the ram has
power. It was then queried whether there were any special desires on the part of
the defunct and the reply was: <u>Mind C.K. doesn&apos;t pile it on</u>. It was
ascertained that the reference was to Mr Cornelius Kelleher, manager
<br><font color="green">{ms, 014}</font>
<br> of Messrs H.J. O&apos;Neill&apos;s popular funeral establishment, a
personal friend of the defunct who had been responsible for the
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">carrying
out of the</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font> interment
arrangements. Before departing he requested that it should be told to his dear
son Patsy that the other boot which he had been looking for was at present under
the commode in the return room and that the pair should be sent to
<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font> to
be soled only as the heels were still good. He stated that this had greatly
perturbed his peace of mind in the other region and earnestly requested that his
desire should be made known. Assurances were given that the matter would be
attended to and it was intimated that this had given satisfaction.</p>
<p> He is gone from mortal haunts: O&apos;Dignam, sun of our morning. Fleet was

he, take them to hell out of my

<p class="pdi">&mdash; Give us one of your prime stinkers, Terry, says Joe.</p>
<p> And Alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with a black border round it.</p>

old dog smelling him all the time

<p class="pdi">&mdash; That so? says Joe.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; God&apos;s truth, says Alf. I heard that from the head
warder that was in Kilmainham when they hanged Joe Brady, the invincible. He
told me when they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like a poker.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ruling passion strong in death, says Joe.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That can be explained
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">by
science</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font>, says Bloom.
It&apos;s only
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">a</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font>

don&apos;t you see, because on account of the&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> And then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">phenomenon</span></span>
<font color="black">science</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font>
and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon.</p>
<p> The distinguished scientist Herr Professor Luitpold Blumenduft tendered
medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the cervical
vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would, according to the
best approved tradition of medical science, be calculated to produce
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">in the
human subject</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font> a
violent ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus,
thereby causing the elastic pores of the
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext"><u>corpus

<br><font color="green">{ms, 018}</font>
<br> dilate in such a way as to facilitate the flow of blood to that part of the
human anatomy known as the penis or male organ resulting in the phenomenon which
has been denominated by the faculty a morbid upwards and outwards
philoprogenetive erection <u>in articulo mortis per diminutionem capitis</u>.</p>
<p> So of course the citizen was only waiting for
<a name="un5018m" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5018m">the wink of the
word</a> and he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and who fears to
speak of ninetyeight and Joe with him about all the fellows that were hanged for
the cause
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">by

scabs</a><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span> and round
he goes to Bob Doran that was standing Alf a half one sucking up for what he
could get. So of course Bob Doran starts doing the bloody fool with his:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Give us the paw! Give the paw, doggy! Good old doggy! Give the paw here! Give us the paw!</p>
<p> Arrah, bloody end to the paw he&apos;d give and Alf trying to keep him from

bloody old dog<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span> and
he talking all kinds of drivel about tranning by kindness and thoroughbred dog
and intelligent dog: give you the bloody pip. Then he starts scraping a few bits
of old biscuit out of
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">the
bottom of</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font> a

hanging out for more. Near ate the tin and all, hungry bloody mongrel.</p>
<p> And the citizen and Bloom having an argument about the point, Robert Emmet
and die for your country, the Tommy Moore touch about Sarah Curran and
she&apos;s far from the land. And Bloom, of course, with

taking them off chewing the fat. And Bloom with his but <u>don&apos;t you
see?</u> and <u>but on the other hand</u>. Phenomenon!</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The memory of the dead, says the citizen taking up his pintglass and glaring at Bloom.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ay, ay, says Joe.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You don&apos;t grasp my point, says Bloom. What I mean is&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Sinn Fein</u>! says the citizen. <u>Sinn fein

<p> The last farewell was affecting in the extreme. From the belfries far and
near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the gloomy
precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums punctuated by
the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance. The deafening claps of thunder and the
dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the ghastly scene testified that the
artillery of heaven had lent its supernatural pomp to the already gruesome
spectacle. A torrential rain poured down from the floodgates of the angry
heavens upon the bared heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the
lowest computation five hundred thousand persons. The learned prelate who
administered the last comforts of holy religion
<br><font color="green">{ms, 020}</font>
<br> to the hero martyr knelt in a most christian spirit in a pool of rainwater,
his cassock above his hoary head, and offered up to the throne of grace fervent
prayers of supplication. Hand by the block stood the grim figure of the
executioner, his visage being concealed in a ten gallon pot with two circular
perforated apertures through which his eyes glowered furiously. As he awaited
the fatal signal he tested the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his
brawny forearm or decapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had
been provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary office. On a handsome
mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the quartering knife, the various
finely tempered disembowelling appliances, a terra cotta saucepan for the
reception of the duodenum, colon, blind intestine and appendix
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">etc</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font>

<font color="black">victim</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font>.
The housesteward of the amalgamated cats&apos; and dogs&apos; home was in
attendance to convey these vessels when replenished to that beneficent
institution. Quite an excellent repast consisting of rashers and eggs, fried
steak and onions, delicious hot breakfast rolls and invigorating tea had been
considerately provided by the authorities for the consumption of the central
figure of the tragedy but he expressed the dying wish (immediately acceded to)
that the meal should be divided in aliquot parts among the members of the sick
and indigent roomkeepers&apos; association as a token of his regard and esteem. The non
<br><font color="green">{ms, 021}</font>
<br> plus ultra of emotion was reached when the blushing bride elect burst her
way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself upon the
muscular bosom of him who was about to die for her sake. The hero folded her
willowy form in a loving embrace murmuring fondly &ldquo;Sheila, my own&rdquo;.
Encouraged by this use of her christian name she kissed passionately all the
various suitable areas
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">of his
person</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font> which the
decencies of prison garb permitted her ardour to reach. She swore to him as they
mingled the salt streams of their tears that she would
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">ever</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font>
cherish his memory, that she would never forget her hero boy. She brought back
to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood together on the banks
of Anna Liffey when they had indulged in the innocent pastimes of the young and,
oblivious of the dreadful present, they both laughed heartily, all the
spectators, including the venerable pastor, joining in the general
merriment.<a target="foot" id="fnz0048">&ordm;</a> But anon they were overcome
with grief and clasped their hands for the last time. A fresh torrent of tears
burst from their lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people, touched to
the inmost core, broke into heartrending sobs not the least affected being the
aged prebendary himself.
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">A most

outburst of emotion: and when he placed on the finger of his blushing

<font color="red"><sup><small>|b</small></sup></font>expensive<font color="red"><sup><small>b|</small></sup></font>
engagement ring with three emeralds set in the form of a shamrock the excitement
knew no bounds.</font><font color="red"><sup><small>a|3|</small></sup></font>
Nay, even the stern provostmarshal<a target="foot" id="fnz0050">&ordm;</a>,
lieutenant-colonel Tomkin-Maxwell Frenchmullen Tomlinson, who presided on the
sad occasion, he who had blown a considerable number of sepoys from the
cannonmouth<a target="foot" id="fnz0051">&ordm;</a> without flinching, could not
now restrain his natural emotion. With his mailed gauntlet
<br><font color="green">{ms, 022}</font>
<br> he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard, by those privileged
burghers who happened to be in his immediate entourage, to murmur to himself in a faltering undertone:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; God
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">blame
me</span></span>
<font color="black">blimey</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font>
if she aint a clinker, that there
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">bleeding</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font>
tart. Blame me it makes me kind of cry,
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">straight,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font>
it does, when I sees her cause I thinks of my old mashtub what&apos;s waiting for me down Limehouse way.</p>
<p> So then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and the
<a name="s12005bh" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12005bh">corporation
meeting</a> and all to that and the shoneens that can&apos;t speak their own
language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a quid and Bloom
putting in his
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">old</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font>
goo with his
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">cabbagy</span></span>
<font color="black">twopenny</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font>
stump<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span> that he
cadged off Joe and talking about the Gaelic league and the antitreating league
and drink, the curse of Ireland.
Antitreating<a target="foot" id="fnz0052">&ordm;</a> is about the size of it.
Gob, he&apos;d let you pour all manner of drink down his throat till the Lord
would call him before you&apos;d ever see the
<a name="un1032bk" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1032bk">froth of his
pint</a>. And one night I went in with a fellow into one of their musical
evenings, <a name="un4015aa" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4015aa">song and
dance</a>, and there was a fellow with a badge spiffing out of him in Irish and
a lot of colleen bawns
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">going</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font>
about with temperance beverages and selling medals. And then an old fellow
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">d</span></span> starts blowing
into his bagpipes and all shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of.
And one or two
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">priests</span></span>
<font color="black">sky
pilots</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font> having an eye
around that there was no goings on with the females, hitting below the belt.</p>
<p> So, as I was saying, the old dog seeing the tin was empty starts mousing
around by Joe and me. I&apos;d train him by kindness, so I would, if he
<br><font color="green">{ms, 023}</font>
<br> was my dog. Give him a rousing fine kick now and again where it wouldn&apos;t blind him.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Afraid he&apos;ll bite you? says the
citizen<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">,
jeering</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font>.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, says I. But he might take my leg for a lamppost.</p>
<p> So he calls the old dog over.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;
<a name="s12004cb" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004cb">What&apos;s on you</a>, Garryowen? says he.</p>
<p> Then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in Irish and the old
towser growling, letting on to answer, like a duet in the opera. Such growling
you never heard as they let off between them. Someone that has nothing better to
do ought to write a letter <u>pro bono publico</u> to the papers about the
muzzling order for a dog the like of that. Growling and grousing and his eye all
bloodshot and the hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws.</p>
<p> All those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the lower
animals (and their name is legion) should make a point of not missing the really
marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the famous animal Garryowen. The
exhibition, which is the result of years of training by kindness and a carefully
thought out dietary system, comprises, among other achievements, the recitation
of verse. Our phonetic experts have left no stone unturned in their efforts to
delucidate and compare the verse recited and have found it bears a striking
resemblance to the ranns of ancient Celtic bards. We are not speaking so much of
those delightful lovesongs with which the writer who conceals his identity under
the title of the &lsquo;little sweet branch&rsquo;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 024}</font>
<br> has familiarised the bookloving world but rather of the harsher and more
personal note which is found in the satirical effusions of the famous Raftery
and of Donal MacConsidine. We subjoin a specimen which has been rendered into
English by an eminent scholar whose name for the moment we are not at liberty to
disclose though we believe that our readers will find the topical allusion
rather more than an indication. The metrical system of the canine original,
which recalls the intricate alliterative and
isosyllabic<a target="foot" id="fnz0053">&ordm;</a> rules of the Welsh englyn,
is infinitely more complicated but we believe our readers will agree that the
spirit has been well caught. Perhaps it should be added that the effect is
greatly increased if the verse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a
tone suggestive of suppressed rancour.</p>
<p class="set"><u>The curse of my curses
<br> Seven days every day
<br> And seven dry Thursdays
<br> On you, Barney Kiernan,

<br> After Lowry&apos;s lights.</u></p>
<p> So he told Terry to bring some water for the dog and, gob, you could hear
him lapping it up a mile off. And Joe asked him would he have another.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I will, says he, to show there&apos;s no ill feeling.</p>
<p> Gob, he&apos;s not as green as he&apos;s cabbagelooking. Arsing around from one pub to another
<br><font color="green">{ms, 025}</font>
<br> with a dog and getting fed up by the ratepayers.
<a name="s12004ap" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004ap">Entertainment for man and beast.</a> And says Joe:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Could you make a hole in another pint?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Could a swim duck? says I.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Same again, Terry, says Joe. Are you sure you won&apos;t
have anything in the way of liquid refreshment? says he.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Thank you, no, says Bloom. As a matter of fact I just
wanted to meet Martin Cunningham, don&apos;t you see, about this insurance of
Dignam&apos;s. Martin asked me to go to the house. You see, he, Dignam, I mean,
didn&apos;t serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and
really under the act the mortgagee can&apos;t recover on the policy.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That&apos;s a good one, by God, says Joe,
laughing<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">,
if old Bridgeman is
landed</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font>. So the wife comes out top dog, what?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, that&apos;s a point,
<a name="s12001ai" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12001ai">says Bloom, for the wife&apos;s admirers</a>.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Whose admirers? says Joe.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The wife&apos;s advisers, I mean, says Bloom.</p>
<p> Then he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act and
for the benefit of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand
that Dignam owed the money and if now the wife or the widow
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">contested
the mortgagee&apos;s
right</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font> till he near

head<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span> with his
mortgagor under the act. He was bloody safe he wasn&apos;t run in himself under
the act that time as <a name="s12007m" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12007m">a

<p> So Bob Doran comes lurching around asking Bloom
<br><font color="green">{ms, 026}</font>
<br> to tell Mrs Dignam he was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about
the funeral and to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that
there was never a truer, a finer than poor little Willie that&apos;s dead to
tell her. Choking with bloody foolery. And shaking Bloom&apos;s hand doing the
tragic to tell her that. Shake hands, brother. You&apos;re a rogue and I&apos;m another.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Let me,
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">said
he,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font> so far presume
upon our acquaintance which, however slight it may appear if judged by the
standard of mere time, is founded, as I hope and believe, on a sentiment of
mutual esteem as to request of you this favour. But, should I have overstepped
the limits of reserve let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, rejoined the other, I appreciate to the full the
motives which actuate your conduct and I shall discharge the office you entrust
to me consoled by the reflection that, though the errand be one of sorrow, this
proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness of the cup.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Then suffer me to take your hand, said he. The goodness
of your heart, I feel sure, will dictate to you better than my inadequate words
the expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">of</span></span> whose poignancy,
were I to give vent to my feelings, would deprive me even of speech.</p>
<p> And off with him and out trying to walk straight. Boosed at five
o&apos;clock. Night he was near being lagged only Paddy Leonard knew the bobby.
Boosed up in a shebeen in Bride street after closing time with two shawls and a
bully
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">on
guard</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font> drinking porter out of teacups. And calling himself
<br><font color="green">{ms, 027}</font>
<br> a Frenchy for the shawls, Joseph Manuo, and talking against the Catholic
religion,

spilling the porter all over the bed and the two shawls screeching
laughing<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">:</span></span> at one
another. <u>How is your testament?</u> <u>Have you got an old testament?</u>
Only Paddy was passing there, I tell you what. Then see him of a Sunday with his

sports revival. There he is sitting there.

<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is that really a fact? says Alf.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, says Bloom. That&apos;s well known. Did you not know that?</p>
<p> So off they started about Irish sports and shoneen games the like of lawn
tennis and about hurley and putting the stone and racy of the soil and building
up a nation once again. And of course Bloom had to have his say too about if a
fellow had a weak heart violent exercise was bad. I declare to God if you took
up a straw from the floor and if you said to Bloom: <u>Look at, Bloom. Do you
see that straw? That&apos;s a straw.</u> Declare to my aunt he&apos;d talk about
it for an hour so <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">w</span></span> he would and talk steady.</p>
<p> A most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of the
O&apos;Kiernan&apos;s under the auspices of <u>Sluagh na h-Eireann</u> on the
revival of ancient Gaelic sports and the importance of physical culture, as
understood in ancient Greece and ancient Rome and ancient Ireland, for the development of the
<br><font color="green">{ms, 030}</font>
<br> race. The venerable president of the noble order was in the chair and the
attendance was of large dimensions. After an instructive discourse by the
chairman a most interesting and instructive discussion ensued as to the
desirability of the revivability of the ancient games and sports of our ancient
Irish forefathers. The wellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of our
old tongue Mr Joseph M&apos;Carthy Hynes made an eloquent appeal for the
resuscitation of the ancient Gaelic sports and pastimes as calculated to revive
the best traditions of manly strength and prowess handed down to us from ancient
ages. L. Bloom having espoused the negative the chairman brought the discussion
to a close <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">and</span></span>, in
response to repeated requests and hearty plaudits from all parts of the house,
by a remarkably noteworthy rendering of Thomas Osborne Davis&apos;s immortal
verses <u>A Nation Once Again</u> in the execution of which the veteran patriot
champion may be said without fear of contradiction to have fairly excelled
himself. His stentorian notes were heard to the greatest advantage in the
timehonoured anthem and his superb highclass vocalism was vociferously applauded
by the large audience
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">amongst</span></span> among which

<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ay, Blazes, says Alf. He let out that Myler was on the
beer to run up the odds and he swatting all the time.</p>

gold in his pocket.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; True for you, says Joe.</p>
<p> And Bloom cuts in again about lawn tennis and the circulation of the blood, asking Alf:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Now, don&apos;t you think, Bergan?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Myler dusted the floor with him, says Alf. Heenan and
Sayers was only a bloody fool to it. See the little kipper not up to his navel
and the big fellow swiping. God, he gave him one last puck in the wind,
Queensberry rules and all, made him puke what he never ate.</p>
<p> It was a historic battle. Handicapped as he was by lack of poundage
Dublin&apos;s pet lamb made up for it by superlative skill in ringcraft. The
final bout of fireworks was a gruelling for both champions. Bennett had tapped
some lively claret in the previous mixup and Myler came on looking groggy. The
soldier got to business leading off with a powerful left jab to which Myler
retaliated by shooting out a stiff one to Bennett&apos;s face. The latter ducked
but the Dubliner lifted him with a left hook, the punch being a fine one. The
men came to handigrips and the bout ended with Bennett on the ropes, Myler
punishing him. The Englishman was liberally drenched with water and when the

<font color="black">bell</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font>
went came on gamey and full of pluck. It was a fight to a finish and the best man
<br><font color="green">{ms, 032}</font>
<br> for it. The two fought like tigers and excitement ran fever high. After a
brisk exchange of courtesies during which a
smart<a target="foot" id="fnz0056">&ordm;</a> upper cut of the military man
brought blood freely from his opponent&apos;s mouth the lamb suddenly landed a
terrific left to Bennett&apos;s stomach, flooring him flat. It was a knockout
clean and clever. Amid tense expectation the Portobello bruiser was counted out
and Myler declared victor to the frenzied cheers of the public who broke through
the ringropes and fairly mobbed him with delight.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He knows which side his bread is buttered, says Alf. I
hear he&apos;s running a concert tour now up in the north.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He is, says Joe. Isn&apos;t he?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Who? says Bloom. Ah, yes. That&apos;s quite true. Yes, a
kind of summer tour, you see. Just a holiday.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Mrs B. is the bright particular star, isn&apos;t she? says Joe.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; My wife? says Bloom. She&apos;s singing, yes. I think it
will be a success too. He&apos;s an excellent man to organise. Excellent.</p>
<p> Hoho begob says I to myself says I. That explains the milk in the cocoanut
and absence of hair on the animal&apos;s chest. Blazes doing the tootle on the

grew she to peerless beauty where loquat and almond scent the air. The gardens

<p> And lo, there entered one of the clan of the O&apos;Molloy&apos;s, a comely
hero of white face yet withal somewhat ruddy, his majesty&apos;s counsel learned
in the law and with him the prince and heir of the noble line of Lambert.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Hello, Ned.</p>

<p> One of the bottlenosed tribe it was went by the name of James Wought alias
Saphiro alias Spark and Spiro put an ad in the papers saying he&apos;d give a

Swindled them all, skivvies and badhachs from

an <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">ol</span></span> ancient Hebrew
Zaretsky or something weeping in the witness box with his hat on him swearing by

<p class="pdi">&mdash; Who tried the case? says Joe.</p>

about arrears of rent and a sick wife and a squad of kids and, faith, he&apos;ll dissolve in tears on the bench.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ay, says Alf. Reuben J. was bloody lucky he didn&apos;t

<p> And he starts taking off the old recorder letting on to cry:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A most scandalous thing! This poor hardworking man! How many children? Ten, did you say?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, your worship. And my wife has

<span class="strike"><span class="striketext"><font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">unread</span></font></span></span>
I dismiss the case.</p>
<p> And on the sixteenth day of the month of the oxeyed goddess the daughter of
the skies, the virgin moon, being then in her first quarter those learned judges
repaired them to the halls of law. There Master Courtenay, sitting in his own
chamber, gave his rede and master Justice Andrews, sitting without a jury in the
probate court, weighed well and pondered the claim of the first chargeant upon the property in the matter of the
<br><font color="green">{ms, 036}</font>
<br> will propounded and final testamentary disposition of the real and personal
estate of the late lamented Jacob Halliday, vintner, deceased, versus
Livingstone, of unsound mind, and another. And to the solemn court of Green
street there came sir Frederick the Falconer. And he sat him there to administer
the law of the brehons at the commission to be holden in and for the county of
the city of Dublin. And there sat with him the high sinhedrim of the twelve
tribes of Iar, for every tribe one man, of the tribe of Patrick and of the tribe
of Hugh and of the tribe of Owen and of the tribe of Conn and of the tribe of
Oscar and of the tribe of Fergus and of the tribe of Finn and of the tribe of
Dermot and of the tribe of Cormac and of the tribe of Kevin and of the tribe of
Caolte and of the tribe of Ossian, there being in all twelve good men and true.
And he conjured them by Him who died on rood that they should well and truly try
and true deliverance make in the issue joined between their sovereign lord the
king and the prisoner at the bar and true verdict give according to the evidence
so help them God and kiss the book. And they rose in their seats, the twelve of
Iar, and they swore by the name of Him Who is from everlasting that they would
do His rightwiseness. And straightway the minions of the law led forth from
their donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of justice had apprehended in
consequence of information received. And they shackled him hand and foot and would take of him ne bail ne mainprise but
<br><font color="green">{ms, 037}</font>
<br> preferred a charge against him for he was a malefactor.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Those are nice things, says the citizen, coming over here
to Ireland filling the country with bugs.</p>
<p> So Bloom let on he heard nothing and he starts talking with Joe, telling him
he needn&apos;t trouble about that little matter till the first but if he would
just say a word to Mr Crawford. And so Joe
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext"><font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">unread</span></font></span></span>
swore high and holy he&apos;d do the devil and all.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Because, you see, says Bloom, for an advertisement you
must have repetition. That&apos;s the whole secret.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Rely on me, says Joe.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Swindling the peasants, says the citizen, and the poor of
Ireland. We want no more strangers in our house.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, I&apos;m sure that will be all right, Hynes, says
Bloom. It&apos;s just that Keyes, you see.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Consider that done, says Joe.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Very kind of you, says Bloom.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The strangers, says the citizen. Our own fault. We let
them come in. We brought them in. The adulteress and her paramour brought the Saxon robbers here.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Decree nisi, says J.J.</p>
<p> And Bloom letting on to be awfully
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">deeply</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font>
interested in nothing, a spider&apos;s web in the corner behind the barrel and
the citizen scowling after him and the old dog at his feet looking up to know who to bite and when.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A dishonoured wife, says the citizen, that was the cause of all our misfortunes.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And here she is, says Alf, that was giggling over the

<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">do</span></span> old cur after him
backing his luck with his mangy snout up. Old Mother Hubbard went to the
cupboard.</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Not there, my child, says he.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Keep your pecker up, says Joe. She&apos;d have won the money only for the other dog.</p>
<p> And J.J. and the citizen arguing about law and history with Bloom sticking in an odd word.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Some people, says Bloom, can see the mote in others&apos;
eyes but they can&apos;t see the beam in their own.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Raimeis</u>, says the citizen. Where are the twenty
millions of Irish should be here today instead of four? And our potteries and
textiles, the finest in the world! And the beds of the Barrow and Shannon they
won&apos;t deepen with a million acres of marsh and bog to make us all die of consumption?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; As treeless as Portugal we&apos;ll be soon, says John
Wyse, if something is not to reafforest the land. Larches, firs, all the trees
of the <a name="s12013b" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12013b">conifer family</a> are
<br><font color="green">{ms, 040}</font>
<br> going fast. I was reading a report&nbsp;&hellip;.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Save them, says the citizen, save the trees of Ireland for the future men of Ireland.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Europe has its eyes on you, says Lenehan.</p>
<p> The fashionable international world attended <u>en masse</u> this afternoon
at the wedding of the chevalier Jean Wyse de Nolan, grand high chief ranger of
the Irish National Foresters, with Miss Fir Conifer of Pine Valley. The bride
looked exquisitely charming in a creation of green mercerised silk, moulded on
an underslip of gloaming grey, sashed with a yoke of broad emerald and finished
with a triple flounce of darker hued fringe, the scheme being relieved by
bretelles and hip insertions of acorn bronze. The maids of honour, Miss Larch
Conifer and Miss Spruce Conifer, sisters of the bride, wore very becoming
costumes in the same tone, a dainty motif of plume rose being worked into the
pleats in a pinstripe and repeated capriciously in the jadegreen toques in the
form of heron feathers of paletinted coral.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And our eyes are on Europe, says the citizen. We had our
trade with Spain and French and with the Flemings before those mongrels were
born, Spanish ale in Galway, the winebark on the winedark waterway.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And will again, says Joe.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And with the help of the holy mother of God we will
again, says the citizen. Our harbours that are empty will be full again,
Queenstown, Kinsale, Galway, Killybegs, the third largest harbour in the wide world. And will again, says

<br> he, when the first Irish battleship is seen breasting the waves with the green flag to the fore.</p>
<p> And he took the last swig out of the pint, Moya. Cows in Connacht have long
horns. Ought to go down and address the multitude in Shanagolden where he
daren&apos;t show his nose fear the Molly Maguires would let daylight through
him for grabbing the holding of an evicted tenant.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Hear, hear to that, says John Wyse. What will you have?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; An imperial yeomanry, says Lenehan, to celebrate the occasion.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Half one, Terry, says John Wyse, and a hands up. Terry! Are you asleep?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, sir, says Terry. Small whisky and bottle of Allsop. Right, sir.</p>
<p> Hanging over the bloody paper with Alf looking for spicy bits instead of
attending to the general public. Picture of a

him</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font> to make sure of the job.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But what about the fighting navy, says Ned, that keeps our foes at bay?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I&apos;ll tell you what about it, says the citizen.
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">Hell
upon earth it is.</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font>
Read the revelations that&apos;s going on in the papers about flogging on the
training ships at Portsmouth. A fellow writes that calls himself
<u>Disgusted</u>
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black"><u>One</u></font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font>.</p>
<p> So he starts telling us about
<a name="un2015f" href="../../ff/unbs/un2all.htm#un2015f">corporal punishment</a> and about the crew of tars and
<br><font color="green">{ms, 042}</font>
<br> and officers and rearadmirals drawn up in cocked hats and the parson with
his protestant bible to witness punishment and a young lad brought out, howling
for his ma, and they tie him down on the buttend of a gun.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A rump and dozen, says the citizen, was what that old
ruffian sir John Beresford called it but the modern God&apos;s Englishman calls it caning on the breech.</p>
<p> And says John Wyse:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; &apos;Tis a custom more honoured in the breech than in the observance.</p>
<p> Then he was telling us the master at arms comes along with a long cane and
he draws out and he flogs the bloody backside off of the poor lad till he yells meila murder.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That&apos;s your glorious British navy, says the citizen,
that bosses the earth. The fellows that never will be slaves, with the only
hereditary chamber in Europe and their land in the hands of a dozen gamehogs and
cottonball barons. That&apos;s the great empire they boast about of drudges and whipped serfs.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; On which the sun never rises, says Joe.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And the tragedy of it is, says the citizen, they believe
it. The unfortunate Yahoos believe it.</p>
<p> They believe in rod, the scourger almighty,
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">flayer
of heaven and</span></span> <font color="black">creator of hell
upon</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font> earth, and in
Jacky Tar, the son of a gun, who was conceived of unholy boast, born of the
fighting navy, suffered under rump and dozen, was scarified, flayed and curried,
yelled like bloody hell, the third day he arose again from the bed, steered into
haven, sitteth on his beam end till further orders when he shall come to drudge for a living and be paid.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But, says Bloom, isn&apos;t discipline the same
everywhere. I mean wouldn&apos;t it be the same here
<br><font color="green">{ms, 043}</font>
<br> if you put force against force?</p>
<p> Didn&apos;t I tell you? As true as I&apos;m drinking this porter if he was
on his last gasp he&apos;d try to downface you that dying was living.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; We&apos;ll put force against force, says the citizen. We
have our greater Ireland beyond the sea. They were driven out of house and home
in the black &apos;47. Their mudcabins by the roadside were laid low by the
batteringram and the <u>Times</u> rubbed its hands and told the whitelivered
Saxons there would soon be as few Irish in Ireland as redskins in America. Even
the Turks sent us help. But the Sassenach tried to starve the nation at home
while the land was full of crops that the British hyenas bought and sold in Rio
de Janeiro. Ay, they drove out the peasants in hordes. Twenty thousand of them
died in the coffin ships. But those that came to the land of the free remember
the land of bondage. And they will come again and with a vengeance: the sons of Granuaile.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Perfectly true, says Bloom. But my point was&nbsp;&hellip;.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; We are a long time waiting for that day, citizen, says
Ned. Since the French landed at Killala.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ay, says John Wyse. We gave our best blood to France and
Spain, the wild geese. Fontenoy, eh? And Sarsfield and O&apos;Donnell, duke of
Tetuan in Spain and Ulysses Browne of Camus that was fieldmarshal to Maria Teresa. But what did we ever get for it?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The French! says the citizen. Set of dancing masters. Do
you know what it is? They were never worth a roasted fart to Ireland.
Aren&apos;t they trying to make an entente cordial now with perfidious Albion?
Firebrands of Europe and they always were:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Conspuez les fran&ccedil;ais</u>, says Lenehan, nobbling his beer.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And as for the Germans, says Joe, haven&apos;t we had
enough of those sausageeating bastards on the throne from George the elector
down to the flatulent old bitch that&apos;s dead?</p>
<p> Jesus, I had to laugh at the way he came out
<br><font color="green">{ms, 044}</font>
<br> with that about the old one with the winkers on her, blind drunk
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">in her

<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, says J.J. We have Edward the peacemaker now.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Tell that to a fool, says the citizen. There&apos;s a
bloody sight more pox than pax about that boyo.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And what do you think, says Joe, of the holy boys, the
priests and bishops of Ireland doing up his room in Maynooth in his racing
colours and sticking up pictures of all the horses his jockeys rode.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; They ought to have stuck up all the women he rode, says little Alf.</p>
<p> And says J.J:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Considerations of space influenced their lordships&apos; decision.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Will you try another, citizen? says Joe.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, sir, says he.
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">I
will</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You? says Joe.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Thank you, Joe, says I.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Repeat that dose, says Joe.</p>
<p> <a name="un5015ai" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5015ai">Bloom was
talking and talking with John Wyse and he quite excited</a> with his old plum eyes rolling about.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Persecution, says he,
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">all</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font>
the
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">history
of</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font> world is full of
it. Perpetuating national hatred among nations.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;
<a name="s12002cp" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12002cp">But do you know what a nation means?</a> says John Wyse</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, says Bloom</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <a name="s12002cp" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12002cp">What is it? says John Wyse</a></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A nation? says Bloom. A nation is the same people living
in
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">a</span></span>
<font color="black">the same</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font> place.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; By God, then, says Ned, laughing, if that&apos;s so
I&apos;m a nation for I&apos;m living in the same place for the past years.</p>
<p> So of course everyone had the laugh at Bloom and says he, trying to muck out of it:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Or also living in different places.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That covers my case, says Joe.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 045}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What is your nation if I may ask? says the citizen.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ireland, says Bloom. I was born here. Ireland.</p>
<p> The citizen said nothing only cleared the spit out of his gullet and, gob,
he spat an oyster out of him right in the corner.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; After you with the push, Joe, says he.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Here you are, citizen, says Joe. Take that in your right
hand and repeat after me the following words.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Which is which? says I.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That&apos;s mine, says Joe, as the devil said to the dead policeman.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And I belong to a race too, says Bloom, that is hated and
persecuted. Also now. This very moment. This very instant.</p>
<p> Gob, he near burnt the
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">c</span></span> his fingers with the butt of his old cigar.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Robbed, says he. Plundered. Insulted. Persecuted. Taking
what belongs to us by right. At this very moment, says he, putting up his fist.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Are you talking about
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">the
new</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font> Jerusalem? says the citizen.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I&apos;m talking about injustice, says Bloom.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Right, says John Wyse. Stand up to it then with force like men.</p>
<p> That&apos;s an almaniac picture for you. Old lardyface standing up to
<a name="un3050g" href="../../ff/unbs/un3all.htm#un3050g">the business end of
a</a> gun. Gob, he&apos;d adorn a sweeping brush, so he would, if he only had a
nurse&apos;s apron on him. And then he collapses all of a sudden, twisting
around all the opposite, as limp as a wet rag.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But it&apos;s no use, says he. Force, hatred, history,
all that. That&apos;s not life for men and women, insult and hatred. And
everybody knows that it&apos;s the very opposite of that that is really life.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What? says Alf</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Love, says Bloom. I mean the opposite of hatred. I must
go now, says he to John Wyse. Just round to the court a moment to see if Martin is there. If he comes just
<br><font color="green">{ms, 046}</font>
<br> say I&apos;ll be back in a second. Just a moment.</p>
<p> And off he pops.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A new apostle to the gentiles, says the citizen. Universal love.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, says John Wyse. Isn&apos;t that what we&apos;re told. Love your neighbour.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That chap? says the citizen. Beggar my neighbour is his
motto. Love, moya! He&apos;s a nice pattern of a Romeo and Juliet.</p>
<p> Love loves to love love. Nurse loves the new chemist. Constable 25 A loves
Mary Kelly. Gertie MacDowell loves the boy that has the bicycle. M.B. loves a
fair gentleman. Li Chi Han lovey up kissy Cha Pu Chow. Jumbo, the elephant,
loves Alice, the elephant. Old Mr Verschoyle with the ear trumpet loves old Mrs
Verschoyle with the turned in eye. The man in the brown mackintosh loves a lady
who is dead. His majesty the king loves her majesty the queen. Mrs Norman W.
Tupper loves officer Taylor. You love a certain person. And
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">that</span></span>
<font color="black">this</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font>
person loves that other person because everybody loves somebody but God loves everybody.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, Joe, says I, your very good health and song. More power, citizen</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Hurrah, there, says Joe.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The blessing of God and Mary and Patrick on you, says the citizen.</p>
<p> And he ups with his pint to wet his whistle.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; We know those canters, says he, preaching and picking
your pocket. What about Cromwell that put the women and children of Drogheda to
the sword with bible texts <u>God is love</u>
pasted<a target="foot" id="fnz0059">&ordm;</a> round the mouth of his cannons.
The bible! Did you read that
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">skit</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font>
in the <u>United Irishman</u> today
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">about
that Zulu chief that&apos;s visiting England</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font>?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What&apos;s that? says Joe.</p>
<p> So the citizen takes up one of his papers and he starts reading out:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A delegation of the chief cotton magnates of Manchester was presented yesterday to his
<br><font color="green">{ms, 047}</font>
<br> Majesty the Alaki of Abeakuta by Gold Stick in Waiting, Lord Walkup of
Walkup on Eggs<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span> to
tender to his majesty the heartfelt thanks of British traders for the facilities
afforded them in his dominions. The dusky potentate, in the course of a gracious
speech, freely translated by the British chaplain the reverend Ananias Praisegod
Barebones, tendered his best thanks to Massa Walkup and
emphasised<a target="foot" id="fnz0060">&ordm;</a> the cordial relations
existing between Abeakuta and the British
empire<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span>, stating
that he treasured as one of his dearest possessions an illuminated bible
presented to him by the white chief woman, the great squaw Victoria. The alaki
then drank a loving cup to the toast <u>Black and White</u> from the skull of
his immediate predecessor in the dynasty Kakachakachak, surnamed Forty Warts.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Widow woman, says
Ned.<a target="foot" id="fnz0061">&ordm;</a> I wouldn&apos;t doubt her. Wonder
did he put that bible to the same use as I would.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Same only more so, says Lenehan. And thereafter in that
fruitful land the broadleaved mango flourished exceedingly.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is that by Griffith? says John Wyse.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, says the citizen. It&apos;s not signed Shanganagh. It&apos;s only initialled: P.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And a very good initial too, says Joe.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That&apos;s how it&apos;s worked, says the citizen. Trade follows the flag.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, says J.J, if they&apos;re any worse than those
Belgians in the <a name="s12007u" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12007u">Congo
Free State</a> they must be bad. Did you read that report by a man what&apos;s this his name is?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;
<a name="s12007u" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12007u">Casement</a>, says the citizen. He&apos;s an Irishman.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, that&apos;s the man, says J.J. Raping the women and
girls and flogging the natives on the belly to squeeze all the red rubber they can out of them.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I know where he&apos;s gone,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 048}</font>
<br> Lenehan, cracking his fingers.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Who? says I.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Bloom, says he. The courthouse is a blind. He had a few
bob on <u>Throwaway</u> and he&apos;s gone to gather in the shekels.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is

says the citizen, that never backed a horse in anger in his life?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That&apos;s where he&apos;s gone, says Lenehan. I met
Bantam Lyons going to back that horse only I put him off it and he told me Bloom
gave him the tip. Bet you what you like he has a hundred shillings to five on.
He&apos;s the only man in Dublin has it. A dark horse.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He&apos;s a bloody dark horse himself, says Joe.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Mind, Joe, says I.
<a name="s12008r" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12008r">Show us the entrance out.</a></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; There you are, says Terry.</p>
<p> So I just went round the back of the yard to
<a name="un1032bv" href="../../ff/unbs/un1all.htm#un1032bv">pumpship</a> and
begob (hundred shillings to five) while I was letting off my (<u>Throwaway</u>

<p> So anyhow when I got back they were at it dingdong, John Wyse saying it was
Bloom gave the ideas for Sinn Fein to Griffith to put in his paper all kinds of
jerrymandering, packed juries and swindling the
<br><font color="green">{ms, 049}</font>
<br> taxes off the government and appointing consuls all over the world to walk
about selling Irish industries. Robbing Peter to pay Paul.
<a name="jn1039w" href="../../ff/unbs/jn1all.htm#jn1039w">Gob, that puts the
bloody kybosh on
it</a><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span> if old

<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, it&apos;s a fact, says John Wyse. And there&apos;s
the man now that&apos;ll tell you all about it, Martin Cunningham.</p>
<p> Sure enough the castle car drove up with Martin on it and Jack Power with
him and a fellow named Crofter or Crofton
<a name="un4016ce" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4016ce">pensioner</a> out of
the collector general&apos;s an orangeman Blackburn has on the registration and
he drawing his pay or Crawford jaunting around the country
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">at the
king&apos;s expense.</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font></p>
<p> Our travellers reached the rustic hostelry and alighted from their palfreys.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ho, varlet! cried he, who by his mien seemed the leader of the party. Saucy knave! To us!</p>
<p> So saying he knocked loudly with his swordhilt upon the open lattice.</p>
<p> Mine host came forth at the summons, girding him with his tabard.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Give you good den, my masters, said he with an obsequious bow.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Bestir thyself, sirrah! cried he who had knocked. Look to
our steeds. And for ourselves give us of your best for ifaith we need it.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Lackaday, good masters, said the host, my poor house has but a bare larder. I know
<br><font color="green">{ms, 050}</font>
<br> not what to offer your lordships.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; How now, fellow? cried the second of the party, a man of
pleasant countenance, So serve you the king&apos;s messengers, master Taptun?</p>
<p> An instantaneous change overspread the landlord&apos;s visage.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Cry you mercy, gentlemen, he said humbly. An you be the
king&apos;s messengers (God shield his majesty!) you shall not want for aught.
The king&apos;s friends (God bless his majesty!) shall not go afasting in my house I warrant me.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Then about! cried the traveller who had not spoken, a
lusty trencherman by his aspect. Hast aught to give us?</p>
<p> Mine host bowed again as he made answer:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What say you, good masters, to a cold pigeon pasty, a
boar&apos;s head with pistachios and a flagon of old Rhenish?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Gadzooks! cried the last speaker. That likes me well. Pistachios!</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Aha! cried he of the pleasant countenance. A poor house,
and a bare larder, quotha! &apos;Tis a merry rogue.</p>
<p> So in comes Martin asking where was Bloom.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Where is he? says Lenehan. Defrauding widows and orphans.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Isn&apos;t that a fact, says John Wyse, what I was
telling the citizen about Bloom and the Sinn Fein?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That&apos;s so, says Martin. Or so they allege.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Who made those allegations? says Alf</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I, says Joe. I&apos;m the alligator.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And after all, says John Wyse, why can&apos;t a jew love his country like the next fellow?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Why not? says J.J. when he&apos;s quite sure which country it is.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is he a jew or a gentile or what the hell is he? says Ned.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He&apos;s a perverted jew, says Martin, from a place in
<br><font color="green">{ms, 051}</font>
<br> Hungary and it was he drew up all the plans according to the Hungarian system. We know that in the castle.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Isn&apos;t he a cousin of Bloom the dentist? says Jack Power.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Not at all, says Martin. His name was Virag, the
father&apos;s name that poisoned himself. He changed it by
deedpoll<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span>, the father did.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That&apos;s the new Messiah for Ireland! says the citizen. Island of saints and sages!</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, they&apos;re still waiting for their redeemer, says Martin. For that matter so are we.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, says J.J., and
<a name="s12001bn" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12001bn">every male
that&apos;s born they think it may be their Messiah</a>.

<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, by God, says Ned, you should have seen Bloom before
that <a name="s12015f" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12015f">son</a> of his
that died was born. I met one day in the south city markets
<a name="s12015f" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12015f">buying a tin of
Neave&apos;s food</a> six weeks before the wife was delivered.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash;
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">In</span></span> En ventre sa m&egrave;re, says J.J.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do you call that a man? says the citizen.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I wonder did he ever put it out of sight, says Joe.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, there were two children born anyhow, says Jack Power.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And who does he suspect? says the citizen</p>
<p> Gob, there&apos;s many a true word spoken in jest. One of those mixed
middling he is. Lying up in the hotel pisser Burke told me
<a name="s12015e" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12015e">once a month with
headache like a totty with her courses</a>. Why are things like that let live?
Then sloping off with his five quid without putting up a pint like a man.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Charity to the neighbour, says Martin. But where is he? We can&apos;t wait.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; A wolf in sheep&apos;s clothing,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 052}</font>
<br> says the citizen. That&apos;s what he is. Virag from Hungary! Ahasuerus I call him. Cursed by God.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Have you time for a brief libation, Martin? says Ned.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Only one, says Martin. We must be quick. John Jameson.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You, Jack? Crofton? Three half ones, Terry.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Saint Patrick would want to come and convert us again,
says the citizen, after allowing things like that to contaminate our shores.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, says Martin, taking his glass. God bless all here is my prayer.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Amen, says the citizen.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And I&apos;m sure
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">he</span></span>
<font color="black">He</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font> will, says Joe.</p>
<p> And at the sound of the sacring bell the blessed company drew nigh of monks
and friars: the monks of Benedict of Spoleto, Carthusians and Camaldolesi,
Cistercians and Olivetans, Oratorians and Vallombrosans, and the friars of
Augustine, Brigittines, Premonstratesians, Servi, Trinitarians, and the children
of Peter Nolasco: and therewith from Carmel mount the children of Elijah prophet
led by Albert bishop and by Teresa of Avila, calced and other: and friars, brown
and grey, sons of poor Francis, capuchins, cordeliers, minimes and observants
and the daughters of Clara: and the sons of Dominic and of Vincent, and Ignatius
his children: and the confraternity of the christian brothers led by the
reverend brother Rice. And after came all saints and martyrs, virgins and
confessors: S. Isidore Arator and S. James the Less and S. Phocas of Sinope and
S. Julian Hospitator and S. Felix de Cantalice and S. Stephen Protomartyr and S.
John Nepomenuc and S. Thomas Aquinas and S. Ives
<br><font color="green">{ms, 053}</font>
<br> of Brittany and S. Herman-Joseph and the saints Gervasius, Servasius and
Bonifacius and S. Bride and the saints Rose of Lima and of Viterbo and S. Martha
of Bethany and S. Mary of Egypt and S. Barbara and S. Scholastica and S. Ursula
with eleven thousand virgins. And all came with nimbi and aureoles and gloriae,
bearing palms and harps and swords and olive crowns in robes whereon where woven
the blessed symbols of their efficacies, inkhorns, arrows, loaves, cruses,
fetters, axes, trees, bridges, babes in a bathtub, shells, wallets, shears,
keys, dragons, lilies, buckshot, beards, hogs, lamps, bellows, beehives,
soupladles, stars, snakes, anvils, boxes of vaseline, bells, crutches, forceps,
stags&apos; horns, watertight boots, hawks, millstones, eyes on a dish, wax
candles, aspergills, unicorns. And as they wended their way by Nelson&apos;s
Pillar, Henry street, Mary street, Capel street, Little Britain street chanting
the introit <u>in Epiphania Domini</u> which beginneth <u>Surge, illuminare</u>
and thereafter most sweetly the gradual <u>Omnes</u> which saith <u>de Saba
venient</u> they did divers wonders such as casting out devils, raising the dead
to life, multiplying fishes, healing the halt and the blind, discovering various
articles which had been mislaid, interpreting and fulfilling the scriptures,
blessing and prophesying. And last, beneath a canopy
<br><font color="green">{ms, 054}</font>
<br> of cloth of gold came the reverend Father O&apos;Flynn attended by Malachi
and Patrick. And when all had reached the appointed place the celebrant blessed
the house and censed and sprinkled the lintels thereof with blessed water and
prayed that God would bless that house as he had blessed the house of Abraham
and Isaac and Jacob and make the angels of His light to inhabit therein. And
entering he blessed the viands and the beverages and the company of all the blessed answered his prayers.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Adiutorium nostrum in nomine Domini.</u></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Qui fecit c&oelig;lum et terram.</u></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Dominus vobiscum.</u></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Et cum spiritu tuo.</u></p>
<p> And he laid his hands upon that he blessed and gave thanks and he prayer and they all with him prayed:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <u>Deus, cuius verbo sanctificantur omnia, benedictionem
tuam effunde super creaturas istas: et praesta ut quisquis eis secundum legem et
voluntatem tuam cum gratiarum actione usus fuerit per invocationem sanctissimi
nominis tui corporis sanitatem et animae tutelam, te auctore, percipiat per Christum, dominum nostrum.</u></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And so say all of us, says Jack.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Thousand a year, Lambert, says Crofton.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Right, says Ned. And butter for fish.</p>
<p> I was just looking around to see who the happy thought would strike when, be
damned but Bloom comes in again letting on to be in a hell of a hurry.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I was just round at the courthouse, says he
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">looking
for you</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font>. I hope I&apos;m not&nbsp;&hellip;.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, says Martin, we&apos;re ready.</p>
<p> Courthouse <a name="un4016cp" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4016cp">my
eye</a>. And your pockets hanging down with gold and silver. Mean bloody scut. Stand us a
<br><font color="green">{ms, 055}</font>
<br> drink itself. There&apos;s a jew for you! Hundred to five.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Don&apos;t tell anyone, says the citizen.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Beg your pardon, says Bloom</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Come on boys, says Martin, seeing it was looking blue. Come along now.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Don&apos;t tell anyone, says the citizen, letting a bawl out of him.</p>
<p> And the bloody dog woke up and let a growl.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Bye bye all, says Martin.</p>
<p> And he got them out as quick as he could, Jack Power and Crofton or whatever
you call him and old Bloom in the middle of them letting on to be all at sea and up with them on the bloody car.</p>
<p class="pdi"><font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">&mdash;
Off with you, says Martin to the jarvey.</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font></p>
<p> The milkwhite dolphin tossed his mane and, rising in the golden poop, the
helmsman spread the bellying sail upon the wind. A many comely nymphs drew nigh
to starboard and to larboard and, clinging to the sides of the noble bark, they
linked their shining forms as doth the cunning wheelwright when he fashions
about the heart of his wheel the equidistant rays whereof each one is sister to
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the
other</span></span>
<font color="black">another</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font>
and he binds them all with an outer ring and giveth speed to the feet of men
whenas they ride to a hosting or contend for the smile of ladies fair. Even so
did they come and set them those willing nymphs, the undying sisters. And they
laughed, sporting in a circle of their foam: and the bark clave the waves.</p>
<p> But begob I was just lowering the last of the pint when I saw the citizen
getting up to waddle to the door and he cursing
<a name="un4045cd" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4045cd">bell book and candle</a> in Irish and Joe and little Alf
<br><font color="green">{ms, 056}</font>
<br> trying to hold him back.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Let me alone, says he.</p>
<p> And begob he got as far as the door and they holding him and he bawls out of him.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Three cheers for Israel!</p>
<p> Arrah, sit down on the parliamentary side of your arse and don&apos;t be
making
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">a
manifestation</span></span> <font color="black">an
exhibition</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font>
of<a target="foot" id="fnz0063">&ordm;</a> yourself. Jesus, there&apos;s always
some bloody clown or other kicking up a bloody murder about bloody nothing. Gob,
it&apos;d turn the porter sour in your guts, so it would.</p>
<p> And all the ragamuffins and sluts of the place round the door and Martin
telling the jarvey to drive ahead and the citizen bawling and Alf and Joe at him
to whisht and Bloom on his high horse about the jews and the loafers calling for
a speech and Jack Power trying to get him to sit down on the car and hold his
bloody jaw and a young lad starts singing <u>The Boys of Wexford</u> and a slut shouts out of her:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Eh, mister! Your fly is open, mister!</p>
<p> And says Bloom:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Mendelssohn was a jew and Karl Marx and Mercadante and
Spinoza. And your god was a jew and his father was a jew.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He had no father, says Martin. That&apos;ll do now. Drive ahead</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Whose god? says the citizen.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, his uncle was a jew, says Bloom. Your god was a jew. Christ was a jew like me.</p>
<p> Gob, the citizen <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">w</span></span> made a plunge into the shop.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; By Jesus, says he, I&apos;ll brain that bloody jewman for
using the holy name. By Jesus, I&apos;ll
<br><font color="green">{ms, 057}</font>
<br> crucify him so I will. Give us that biscuit box here.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Stop! Stop! says Joe.</p>
<p> A large and appreciative gathering of friends and acquaintances assembled to
bid farewell to Mr L Virag on the occasion of his departure for a distant clime.
The ceremony which went off with great
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">&eacute;clat</span></span>
<font color="black"><u>&eacute;clat</u></font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font>
was characterised by the most affecting cordiality. An illuminated scroll, the
work of Irish artists, was presented to the distinguished visitor on behalf of a
large section of the community and was accompanied by the gift of a silver
casket, tastefully executed in the style of ancient Celtic ornament, a work
which reflects every credit on the makers, Messrs Jacob and Jacob. The departing
guest was the recipient of a hearty ovation, many of those who were present
being visibly moved when the select orchestra of Irish pipes struck up the
wellknown strains of <u>Come Back to Erin</u>. Amid cheers that rent the welkin
the vessel slowly moved away saluted by a final floral tribute from the
representatives of the fair sex who were present in large numbers. Gone but not forgotten.</p>
<p> He got hold of the bloody tin anyhow and out with him, and little Alf
hanging on to his elbow and he shouting like a stuck pig:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Where is he till I murder him?</p>
<p> And Ned and J.J. paralysed with the laughing.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Gob, says I, I&apos;ll be
<a name="un4017s" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4017s">in for the last gospel</a>.</p>
<p> But as luck would have it the jarvey got the nag&apos;s head round the other way and off with him.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 058}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Hold on, citizen, says Joe. Stop!</p>
<p> Begob he made a swipe and let fly. Mercy of God the sun was in his eyes.
Gob, he near sent it into the county Longford. The bloody nag took fright and
the old mongrel after the car and all the populace shouting and laughing
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">and the
old tin box clattering along the street</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font>.</p>
<p> The catastrophe was terrific and instantaneous in its effect. The
observatory of Dunsink registered in all eleven shocks and there is no record
extant of a similar seismic disturbance in our island since the earthquake of
1534, the year of the rebellion of Silken Thomas. The epicentre appears to have
been that part of the metropolis which constitutes the Inn&apos;s Quay Ward and
parish of Saint Michan. All the lordly residence in the vicinity of the palace
of justice were demolished and that noble edifice itself, in which at the time
of the catastrophe, important legal debates were in progress, is literally a
mass of ruins beneath which it is to be feared all the occupants have been
buried alive. From the reports of
eyewitnesses<a target="foot" id="fnz0064">&ordm;</a> it transpires that the
seismic waves were accompanied by a violent atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic
character. An article of headgear since ascertained to belong to the much
respected clerk of the crown and peace Mr George Fottrell and a silk umbrella
with gold handle with the engraved initials, crest, coat of arms and house
number of the erudite and worshipful chairman of quarter sessions sir Frederick
Falkiner, recorder of Dublin, have been discovered by search parties in remote
parts of the island respectively, the former on the third
<br><font color="green">{ms, 059}</font>
<br> basaltic ridge of the giant&apos;s causeway, the latter embedded to the
extent of one foot three inches in the sandy beach of Holeopen bay near the
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">lower</span></span> old head of
Kinsale. Other eyewitnesses depose that they observed an incandescent object of
enormous proportions hurtling through the atmosphere at a terrifying velocity in
a trajectory directed southwest by west. Messages of condolence and sympathy are
being hourly received from all parts of the different continents and the
sovereign
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">pontiff</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font>
has been graciously pleased to decree that a special <u>missa pro defunctis</u>
shall be celebrated simultaneously by the ordinaries of each and every parish
church of all the episcopal dioceses subject to the spiritual authority of the
holy see in suffrage of the souls of those faithful departed who have been so
unexpectedly called away from our midst. The work of salvage, removal of debris,
human remains etc has been entrusted to Messrs Michael Meade and Son, Great
Brunswick street, and Messrs T. and C. Martin, North Wall, assisted by the men
and officers of the Duke of Cornwall&apos;s light infantry under the general
supervision of H.R.H, rear admiral, the right honourable sir Hercules Hannibal
Habeas Corpus Anderson, K.G., K.P., K.T., P.C., K.C.B., M.P., J.P., M.B.,
D.S.O., S.O.D., M.F.H., M.R.I.A., B.L., Mus. Doc., P.L.G, F.R.C.P.I., and F.R.C.S.I.</p>
<p> You never saw the like of it in all your born puff. Gob, if he got that on
the side of his poll he&apos;d remember the gold cup, so he would, but begob the
citizen would have been lagged for assault and battery and Joe for aiding and
abetting. The jarvey saved his life as sure as God made me.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 060}</font>
<br> What? O, Jesus, he did. And he let a volley of oaths after him.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Did I kill him, says he, or what?</p>
<p> And he shouting to the bloody dog:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; After him, Garry! After him, boy!</p>
<p> And the last we saw was the bloody car rounding the corner and old
sheepsface on it gesticulating and the bloody mongrel after it
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">with
his lugs back</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font> for
all he was bloody well worth. Hundred to five! Jesus, he took the

<font color="black">value</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font>
of it out of him, I promise you.</p>
<p> When lo there came about them all a great brightness and they beheld the
chariot wherein he stood ascend to heaven. And they beheld him in the chariot,
clothed upon in the glory of the brightness, having raiment as of the sun, fair
as the moon and terrible that for awe they durst not look upon him. And there
came a voice out of heaven, calling: <u>Elijah! Elijah!</u> And he answered with
a main cry: <u>Abba! Adonai!</u> And they beheld him
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">even
him, ben Bloom
Elijah.</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font> amid clouds
of angels ascend to the glory of the brightness at an angle of fortyfive degrees
over Donohoe&apos;s in Little Green street like a shot off a shovel.</p> </p>  </main>
