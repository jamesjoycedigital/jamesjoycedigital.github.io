<p class="pdi">&mdash; He has shares in the <u>Tivoli</u>, &mdash; said, and it
was he got up that <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">match
between</span></span> Keogh-Bennett boxing match. I heard he made a hundred quid
over it, laying the odds. He spread the report Myler was on the beer and by God
he was training all the time. Did you see that match?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I did not.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Myler dusted the floor with him. A grand sight it was, to
see the little chap standing up to him not up to his navel, and the big fellow
swiping. Jesus, he gave him one puck in the wind made him puke what he never ate.</p>
<p> Handicapped as he was by lack of poundage Dublin&apos;s pet lamb made up for
it by superlative skill in ringcraft. The final
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">claret</span></span> round was a
gruelling for both champions. Bennett had tapped
<a name="s12003an" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12003an">claret</a> in the
previous mix-up and Myler came on looking groggy. The soldier
<br><font color="green">{ms, 11}</font>
<br> got to business, leading off with a powerful left
<a name="s12003af" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12003af">jab</a> to which
Myler retaliated by shooting out at Bennett&apos;s face. The latter ducked but
the Dubliner lifted him with a left hook, the punch being a fine one. The men
came to grips and the round ended with Bennett on the ropes, Myler punishing
him. The Englishman was well drenched with water and when the whistle went came
on refreshed and full of pluck. It was a fight to a finish. The men fought like
demons and the excitement was terrific. After a rapid exchange of blows which a
clever upper cut of the military man brought blood freely from his
opponent&apos;s mouth the lamb suddenly landed a terrific left to Bennett&apos;s
stomach which floored him flat. Amid tense excitement the Shropshire boy was
counted out and Myler declared the winner amid the frenzied plaudits of the
public who broke through the ringropes and fairly mobbed him with delight.

<p class="pdi">&mdash; I wouldn&apos;t like to see that, &mdash; said. And those
<a name="s12003al" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12003al">butting matches</a>
they have in California, going for each heads down like a bull at a gate.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And bullfighting, Mr B&mdash;, and cockfighting all those
sports are terribly inhuman and hare hunting
<br><font color="green">{ms, 12}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, yes, of course&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; What about bughunting, &mdash; asked with a grin.</p>

<p class="pdi">&mdash; Did you twig the one I gave him? &mdash; said, about the buggy jews?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Still and all, &mdash; said, he&apos;s a humane chap.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He is that, &mdash; said sourly.
<a name="s12006bt" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12006bt">He&apos;d shove a
soft hand under a hen.</a> But I&apos;d like to see him in the

<p> He sang the P&aelig;an of the Games of the Gael: he sang the Deeds of his
Prowess. Youthful he drove the Wolf and the Boar: in the chace he led the
knights of Uladh. From his godlike shoulder sped the Stone: terrible, swift as the Glance of Balor.

<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ay, that&apos;s a fact, &mdash; bore out. How many feet could you put it?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And that&apos;s what you want in Ireland today. Fine open
air games. Irish games. Irish strength and skills. Hurley, Gaelic,

Racy of the soil. That&apos;s what&apos;ll build up men Ireland a nation once again.</p>
<p> A most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of &mdash;
under the auspices of Cumann na Gadhael on the revival of ancient Gaelic sports
and the importance of physical culture, as understood in
<br><font color="green">{ms, 13}</font>
<br> ancient times, for the development of the race. The venerable president of
the ancient order of hibernians brother Michael Cusack was in the chair and
<a name="s12010l" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12010l">the attendance was of
large dimensions</a>. After an instructive discourse
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">f</span></span> by the chairman a
most instructive discussion
<a name="s12004h" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12004h">ensued</a> as to the
desirability of reviving the ancient games and sports of our |xold|x* Irish
forefathers. J. Hynes made an eloquent appeal
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">in favour</span></span> for the
resuscitation of <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the</span></span>
ancient Gaelic sports and pastimes as calculated to revive the best traditions
of manly strength and prowess handed down to us from ancient times. L Bloom
having <a name="s12002ag" href="../../ff/unbs/s12all.htm#s12002ag">espoused the
negative</a> the chairman brought the discussion to a close and, in response to
repeated requests from all parts of the house, by a remarkably noteworthy
rendering of Thomas Osborne Davis&apos;s immortal
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">anthem</span></span> <u>A Nation
Once Again</u>. <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">The
timehonoured</span></span> His stentorian notes were heard to the greatest
advantage and the timehonoured anthem was vociferously applauded by the audience
among whom were to be noticed many prominent members of the clergy as well as
representatives of the press and the bar and of the other learned professions.
