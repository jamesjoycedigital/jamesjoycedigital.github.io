really happened to me the majority of them with not a particle of love in their
natures to find two people like that nowadays full up of each other theyre
usually a bit foolish in the head shes always making love to my things too the
few old rags I have wanting to put her hair up at fifteen my powder too only
ruin her skin on her shes time enough for that all her life after of course shes

I suppose thats how he got all the gilt mirrors and carpets getting round those
rich ones off Stephens green running up to him for every little fiddlefaddle her
vagina and her cochinchina theyve money of course so theyre all right I wouldnt
marry him not if he was the last man in the world smelling around those filthy
bitches all sides asking me if what I did had an offensive odour what did he
want me to do but the one thing gold maybe what a question if I smathered it all
over his wrinkly old face for him I suppose hed know then thats a very nice
invention too by the way only I like letting myself down after as far as I can
squeeze and pull the chain then to flush it nice cool pins and needles still
theres something in it I suppose I always used to know by Millys when she was a

I knew what was coming next only natural weakness it was he excited me I dont
know how the first night ever we met when I was living in Rehoboth terrace we

great favour the very 1st opportunity he got a chance in Brighton square running
into my bedroom pretending the ink got on his hands to wash it off with the
Albion milk and sulphur soap I used to use and the gelatine still round it O I
laughed myself sick at him that day I better not make an allnight sitting on
this affair they ought to make them a bit bigger so that a woman could sit on it
properly he kneels down to do it I suppose there isnt in all creation another
man with the habits he has look at the way hes sleeping at the foot of the bed
its well he doesnt kick or he might knock out all my teeth breathing with his
hand on his nose like that Indian god he took me to show one wet Sunday in the
museum in Kildare street all yellow in a pinafore lying on his side on his hand

he has to pay for it from her O this nuisance of a thing I hope theyll have
something better for us in the other world tying ourselves up God help us thats
all right for tonight now the lumpy old jingly bed always reminds me of old
Cohen I suppose he scratched himself in it often enough easy piano God here we
are as bad as ever after sixteen years every time were just getting on right
something happens or he puts his big foot in it Thoms and Helys and Mr Cuffes
and Drimmies either hes going to be run into prison over his old lottery tickets
that was to be all our salvations or he goes and gives impudence well have him
coming home with the sack soon out of the Freeman too like the rest on account
of those Sinner Fein or the freemasons then well see if the little man he showed
me dribbling along in the wet all by himself round by Coadys lane will give him
much consolation that he says is so capable and sincerely Irish he is indeed
judging by the sincerity of the trousers I saw on him wait theres Georges church
bells wait three quarters the hour one two oclock well thats a nice hour for him
to be coming home at to anybody climbing down into the area if anybody saw him
Ill knock him off that little habit tomorrow first Ill see if he has that French letter still in his pocketbook

their poetry laughed at I always liked poetry when I was a girl first I thought
he was a poet like Byron and not an ounce of it in his composition I thought he
was quite different I wonder is he too young hes about wait 88 I was married 88
