breakfast in bed with a couple of eggs since the City Arms hotel when he used to

talk about Mr Riordan here and Mr Riordan there I suppose he was glad to get
shut of her and her dog smelling my fur and always edging to get up under my

a solicitor only for I hate having a long wrangle in bed or else if its not that
its some little bitch or other he got in with somewhere or picked up on the sly
if they only knew him as well as I do yes because the day before yesterday he
was scribbling something a letter when I came into the front room to show him
Dignam&apos;s death in the paper as if something told me and he covered it up
with the blottingpaper pretending to be thinking about business so very probably
that was it to somebody who thinks she has a softy in him because all men get a
bit like that at his age especially getting on to forty he is now so as to
wheedle any money she can out of him no fool like an old fool and then the usual
kissing my bottom was to hide it not that I care two straws now who he does it
with or knew before that way though Id like to find out so long as I dont have
the two of them under my nose all the time like that slut

<br> of oysters but I told her what I thought of her suggesting me to go out to
be alone with her I wouldnt lower myself to spy on them the garters I found in
her room the Friday she was out that was enough for me a little bit too much her
face swelled up on her with temper when I gave her her weeks notice I saw to
that better do without them altogether do out the rooms myself quicker only for
the damn cooking and throwing out the dirt I gave it to him anyhow either she or
me leaves the house I couldnt even touch him if I thought he was with a dirty
barefaced liar and sloven like that one denying it up to my face and singing
about the place in the W C too because she knew she was too well off yes because
he couldnt possibly do without it that long so he must do it somewhere and the
last time he came on my bottom when was it the night Boylan gave my hand a great

sitting out with her the night of Georgina Simpsons housewarming and then he
wanted to ram it down my neck on account of not liking to see her a wallflower

<br> because he used to be a bit on the jealous side whenever he asked who are
you going to and I said over to Floey and he made me the present of lord Byrons
poems and the three pairs of gloves so that finished that I could quite easily
get him to make it up any time I know how Id even supposing he got in with her
again and was going out to see her somewhere Id know if he refused to eat the
onions I know several ways ask him to tuck down the collar of my blouse or touch
him with my veil and gloves on going out one kiss then would send them all
spinning however alright well see then let him go to her she of course would
only be too delighted to pretend shes mad in love with him that I wouldnt so
much mind but he might imagine he was and make a declaration to her like he did
to me though I had the devils own job to get it out of him though I liked him
for that it showed he could hold in and wasnt to be got for the asking he was on
the pop of asking me too the night in the kitchen I was rolling the potato cake
theres something I want to say to you only for I put him off letting on I was in

dont wonder in the least because he was very handsome at that time trying to
look like lord Byron I said I liked though he was too beautiful for a man and he
was a little before we got engaged afterwards though she didnt like it so much

told me O yes that sometimes he used to go to bed with his muddy boots on when
the maggot takes him just imagine having to get into bed with a thing like that

ask us to marry them for if were so bad as all that comes to yes because they
cant get on without us white Arsenic she put in his tea I wonder why they call
it that if I asked him hed say its from the Greek leave us as wise as before she

taking spoonfuls of it and the waiter after him making a holy show of us
screeching and confusion for the engine to start but he wouldnt pay till he
finished it the two gentlemen in the 3rd class carriage said he was quite right
so he was too hes so pigheaded sometimes when he gets a thing into his head a
good job he was able to open the carriage door with his knife or theyd have
taken us on to Cork I suppose that was done out of revenge on him O I love

sang at where its over a year ago when was it St Teresas hall Clarendon St
little chits of missies they have now singing Kathleen Kearney and her like on
account of father being in the army and my singing the absentminded beggar and
wearing a brooch for lord Roberts when I had the map of it all and Poldy not
Irish enough was it him managed it this time I wouldnt put it past him like he
got me on to sing in the Stabat Mater by going around saying he was putting Lead
Kindly Light to music till the jesuits found out he was a freemason thumping the
piano lead Thou me on copied from some old opera yes and he was going about with
some of them Sinner Fein lately or whatever they call themselves talking his
usual trash and nonsense he says that little man he showed me without the neck
is very intelligent the coming man Griffiths is he well he doesnt look it thats
all I can say still it must have been him he knew there was a boycott I hate the
mention of their politics after the war that Pretoria and Ladysmith and
Bloemfontein where Gardner Lieut Stanley G 8th Bn 2nd East Lancs Rgt of enteric
fever he was a lovely fellow in kaki Im sure he was brave too he said I was
lovely the evening we kissed goodbye at the canal lock my Irish beauty he was
pale with excitement about going away or wed be seen from the road he couldnt
stand properly and I so hot as I never felt they could have made their peace in
the beginning or old oom Paul and the rest of the old Krugers go and fight it
out between them instead of dragging on for years killing any finelooking men
there were I love to see a regiment pass in review the first time I saw the
Spanish cavalry at La Roque it was lovely after looking across the bay from
Algeciras all the lights of the rock like fireflies or those sham battles on the

the lancers theyre grand or the Dublins that won Tugela his father made his

this ring behind want to keep turning and turning to get it over the knuckle
there or they might bell it round the town in their papers or tell the police on
me but theyd think were married O let them all go and smother themselves for all
I care he has plenty of money and hes not a marrying man so somebody better get
it out of him if I could find out whether he likes me I looked a bit washy of
course when I looked close in the handglass powdering a mirror never gives you
the expression besides scrooching down on me like that all the time with his big
hipbones hes heavy too with his hairy chest for this heat always having to lie
down for them better for him put it into me from behind the way Mrs Mastiansky
told me her husband made her like the dogs do it and stick out her tongue as far
as ever she could and he so quiet and mild with his tingating cither can you

beauty up to what was she fortyfive there was some funny story about the jealous
old husband what was it at all and an oyster knife he went no he made her wear a

looked Poldy pigheaded as usual like the soup but I could see him looking very
hard at my chest Im extremely sorry Mrs Bloom believe
<br><font color="green">{u21, 839}</font>
<br> me without making it too marked the first time after him being insulted and
me being supposed to be his wife I just half smiled I know my chest was out that

<p> I think he made them a bit firmer sucking them like that so long he made me
thirsty titties he calls them I had to laugh yes this one anyhow Ill get him to
keep that up and Ill take those eggs beaten up with marsala fatten them out for
him what are all those veins and things curious the way its made two the same in
case of twins theyre supposed to represent beauty placed up there like those
statues in the museum one of them pretending to hide it with her hand are they
so beautiful of course compared with what a man looks like with his two bags
full and his other thing hanging down out of him or sticking up at you like a
hatrack no wonder they hide it with a cabbageleaf that disgusting Cameron
highlander behind the meat market or that other wretch with the red head behind
the tree when I was passing pretending he was pissing standing out for me to see
it with his babyclothes up to one side the Queens own
<br><font color="green">{u22, 705}</font>
<br> they were a nice lot its well the Surreys relieved them I tried to draw a
picture of it before I tore it up like a sausage or something I wonder theyre
not afraid going about of getting a kick or a bang of something there the woman
is beauty of course thats admitted when he said I could pose for a picture naked
to some rich fellow in Holles street when he lost the job in Helys and I was
selling the clothes and strumming in the coffee palace would I be like that bath of the nymph
<br><font color="green">{u21, 840}</font>
<br> with my hair down yes only shes younger or Im a little like that dirty
bitch in that Spanish photo he has nymphs used they go about like that I asked
him and that word met something with hoses in it and he came out with some
jawbreakers about the incarnation he never can explain a thing simply the way a
body can understand then he goes and burns the bottom out of the pan all for his
kidney this one not so much theres the mark of his teeth still where he tried to
bite the nipple I had to scream out arent they fearful trying to hurt you I had
a great breast of milk with Milly enough for two what was the reason of that he
said I could have got a pound a week as a wet nurse all swelled out the morning
that delicate looking student that stopped in no 28 with the Citrons Penrose
nearly caught me washing through the window only for I snapped up the towel to
my face that was his studenting hurt me they used to weaning her till he got
doctor Brady to give me the Belladonna prescription I had to get him to suck
them they were so hard he said it was sweeter and thicker than cows then he
wanted to milk me into the tea well hes beyond everything I declare somebody
ought to put him in the budget if I only could remember the one half of the
