<p> Yes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his
breakfast in bed with a couple of eggs since the City Arms hotel when he used to
be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his highness to make himself
interesting for that old faggot Mrs Riordan that he thought he had a great leg
of and she never left us a farthing all for masses for herself and her soul
greatest miser ever was actually afraid to lay out fourpence for her methylated
spirit telling me all her ailments she had too much old chat in her about
politics and earthquakes and the end of the world let us have a bit of fun first
God help the world if all the women were like her down on bathingsuits and
lownecks of course nobody wanted her to wear them I suppose she was pious
because no man would look at her twice a wonder she didnt want us to cover our
faces but she was a welleducated woman certainly and her talk about Mr Riordan
here and Mr Riordan there I suppose he was glad to get shut of her and her dog
smelling my fur and always edging to get up under my petticoats especially then
still I like that in him polite to old women like that and waiters and beggars
too but not always if ever he got anything really serious the matter with him
its much better for them to go into a hospital where everything is clean but I
suppose Id have to dring it into him for a month yes and then wed have a
hospital nurse next thing on the carpet have him staying there till they throw
him out or a nun maybe like the smutty photo he has shes as much as Im not yes
because theyre so weak and puling when theyre sick they want a woman to get well if his nose bleeds
<br><font color="green">{u21, 823}</font>
<br> youd think it was O tragic and that dyinglooking one that used to be doing
skirtduty along the south circular when he sprained his foot at the choir party
at lough Bray the day I wore that dress Miss Stack bringing him flowers the
worst old ones she could find at the bottom of the basket though he looked more
like a man with his beard a bit grown in the bed father was the same besides I
hate bandaging and dosing when he cut his toe with the razor paring his corns
afraid hed get blood poisoning yes he came somewhere Im sure by his appetite
anyway love its not or hed be off his feed thinking of her so either it was one
of those night women if it was down there he was really and the hotel story he
made up a pack of lies to hide it planning it Hynes kept me who did I meet ah
yes I met do you remember Menton and who else who let me see that big babbyface
I saw him and he not long married flirting with a young girl at Pooles Myriorama
and turned my back on him when he slinked out what harm but he had the impudence
to make up to me one time well done to him mouth almighty and his boiled eyes of
all the big stupoes I ever met and thats called a solicitor only for I hate
having a long wrangle in bed or else if its not that its some little bitch or
other he got in with somewhere or picked up on the sly if they only knew him as
well as I do yes because the day before yesterday he was scribbling something a
letter when I came into the front room to show him Dignam&apos;s death in the
paper as if something told me and he covered it up with the blottingpaper
pretending to be thinking about business so very probably that was it to
somebody who thinks she has a softy in him because all men get a bit like that
at his age especially getting on to forty he is now so as to wheedle any money
she can out of him no fool like an old fool and then the usual kissing my bottom
was to hide it not that I care two straws now who he does it with or knew before
that way though Id like to find out so long as I dont have the two of them under my nose all the time like that slut

him bad enough to get the smell of those painted women off him once or twice I
had a suspicion by getting him to come near me without that one it was all his

my thumb to squeeze back singing the young May Moon shes beaming love because he
has an idea about him and me hes not such a fool he said Im dining out and going

doing that frigging drawing out the thing by the hour question and answer would
you do this that and the other with the coalman yes with a bishop yes I would

theres no danger with a priest if youre married hes too careful about himself
then give something to H H the pope for a penance I wonder was he satisfied with
me one thing I didnt like his slapping me behind going away so familiarly in the
hall though I laughed Im not a horse or an ass am I I suppose he was thinking of
his father I wonder is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am I in it he smelt
of some kind of drink not whisky or stout or perhaps the sweety kind of paste
they stick their bills up with some liqueur Id like to sip those richlooking
green and yellow expensive drinks those stagedoor johnnies drink with the opera
hats he had all he could do to keep himself from falling asleep after the last
time after we took the claret and potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes
because I felt lovely and tired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the
moment I popped straight into bed till that thunder woke me up God be merciful
to us I thought the heavens were coming down about us to punish us when I
blessed myself and said a Hail Mary like those awful thunderbolts in Gibraltar

because he doesnt know what it is to have one yes when I lit the lamp because he
must have come 3 or 4 times with that tremendous big red brute of a thing he has
I thought the vein or whatever the dickens they call it was going to burst
though his nose is not so big after I took off all my things with the blinds
down after my hours dressing and perfuming and combing it like iron or some kind
of a thick crowbar standing all the time he must have eaten oysters I think a
few dozen no I never in all my life felt anyone had one the size of that to make
you feel full up whats the idea making us like that with a big hole in the
middle of us or like a stallion driving it up into you because thats all they

amount of spunk in him when I made him pull out and do it on me considering how
big it is so much the better in case any of it wasnt washed out properly the
last time I let him finish it in me nice invention they made for women for him
to get all the pleasure but if someone gave them a touch of it themselves theyd
know what I went through with Milly nobody would believe and Mina Purefoys
husband give us a swing out of your whiskers filling her up with a child or
twins once a year as regular as the clock supposed to be healthy supposing I
risked having another not off him though still if he was married Im sure hed
have a fine strong child but I dont know Poldy has more spunk in him I suppose
it was meeting Josie Powell and the funeral and thinking about me and Boylan set
him off well he can think what he likes now if thatll do him any good I know
they were spooning a bit when I came on the scene he was dancing and sitting out
with her the night of Georgina Simpsons housewarming and then he wanted to ram
it down my neck on account of not liking to see her a wallflower that was why we
had the standup row over politics he began it not me when he said about Our Lord
being a carpenter and the first socialist still he knows a lot of mixedup things
especially about the body and the inside I often wanted to study up that myself
what we have inside us in that family physician I could always hear his voice talking when the room was
<br><font color="green">{u21, 828}</font>
<br> crowded and watch him after that I pretended I had a coolness on with her over him
<br><font color="green">{u22, 695}</font>
<br> because he used to be a bit on the jealous side whenever he asked who are
you going to and I said over to Floey and he made me the present of lord Byrons
poems and the three pairs of gloves so that finished that I could quite easily
get him to make it up any time I know how Id even supposing he got in with her
again and was going out to see her somewhere Id know if he refused to eat the
onions I know several ways
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">ask him
to tuck down the collar of my blouse
or</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font> touch him with my

alright well see then let him go to her she of course would only be too
delighted to pretend shes mad in love with him that I wouldnt so much mind but
he might imagine he was and make a declaration to her like he did to me though I
had the devils own job to get it out of him though I liked him for that it
showed he could hold in and wasnt to be got for the asking he was on the pop of
asking me too the night in the kitchen I was rolling the potato cake theres
something I want to say to you only for I put him off letting on I was in a
temper with my hands and arms full of pasty flour she used to be always
embracing me Josie whenever he was there meaning him of course glauming me over
and when I said I washed up and down as far as possible asking me did you wash
possible the women are always egging on to that putting it on thick when hes
there they know by his sly eye blinking a bit

<br> grigged her because she knew what it meant but that wasnt my fault she
didnt darken the door much after we were married I wonder what shes got like now
<br><font color="green">{u22, 696}</font>
<br> after living with that dotty husband of hers she had her face beginning to
look drawn and run down the last time I saw her she must have been just after a
row with him because I saw on the moment she was edging to draw down a
conversation about husbands and talk about him to run him down what was it she
told me O yes that sometimes he used to go to bed with his muddy boots on when
the maggot takes him just imagine having to get into bed with a thing like that
that might murder you any moment what a man well its not the one way everyone
goes mad Poldy anyhow whatever he does always wipes his feet on the mat when he
comes in wet or shine and he always takes off his hat when he comes up in the
street like then and now hes going about in his slippers to look for
&pound;10000 for a postcard u p up O Sweetheart May wouldnt a thing like that
simply bore you stiff to extinction actually too stupid even to take his boots
off now what could you make of a man like that Id rather die 20 times over than
marry another of their sex of course hed never find another woman like me to put
up with him the way I do yes and he knows that too at the bottom of his heart
take that Mrs Maybrick that poisoned her husband for what I wonder in love with
some other man yes it was found out on her wasnt she the villain to go and do a
thing like that of course some men can be dreadfully aggravating drive you mad
and always the worst word in the world what do they ask us to marry them for if
were so bad as all that comes to yes because they cant get on without us white
Arsenic she put in his tea I wonder why they call it that if I asked him hed say
its from the Greek leave us as wise as before she must have been madly in love
with the other fellow to run the chance of being hanged O she didnt care if that
was her nature what could she do besides theyre not brutes enough to go and hang a woman surely are they
<br><font color="green">{u21, 830}</font> </p>
<p> theyre all so different Boylan talking about the shape of my foot he noticed
at once even before he was introduced when I was in the D B C with Poldy
laughing and trying to listen I was waggling my foot I saw him looking with his
two old maids of sisters when I stood up and asked the girl where it was what do
I care with it dropping out of me and that black closed breeches he made me buy
takes you half an hour to let them down wetting all myself always with some
brandnew fad every other week such a long one I did I forgot my suede gloves on
the seat behind that I never got after some robber of a woman and he wanted me
to put it in the Irish Times lost in the ladies lavatory D B C Dame street
<br><font color="green">{u22, 697}</font>
<br> finder return to Mrs Marion Bloom now how did that excite him because I was
crossing them when we were in the other room first he meant the shoes that are
too tight to walk in my hand is nice like that I dont like my foot so much still
I made him spend once with my foot the night after Goodwins botchup of a concert
so cold and windy it was well we had that rum in the house to mull and the fire
wasnt black out when he asked to take off my stockings lying on the hearthrug in
Lombard street west but of course hes not natural that I what did he say I could
give nine points in ten to Kattie Lanner and beat her what does that mean I
asked him I forget what he said because the stop press edition just passed and
the man with the curly hair in the Lucan dairy thats so polite I think I saw his
face before somewhere I noticed him when I was tasting the butter so I took my
time Bartell dArcy too that he used to make fun of when he commenced kissing me
on the choir stairs after I sang Gounod&apos;s <i>Ave Maria</i> he was pretty
hot for all his tinny voice too my low notes he said if you can believe him then
he said wasnt it terrible to do that there in a place like that I dont see
anything so terrible about it Ill tell him about that some day not now and
surprise him
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">ay and
Ill take him there and show the very place
too</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font> he thinks
nothing can happen without him knowing he was much worse himself begging me to
give him a tiny bit cut off my drawers that was the evening coming along
Kenilworth square he kissed me in the eye of my glove and I had to take it off
asking me questions is it permitted to inquire the shape of my bedroom so I let
him keep it as if I forgot it to think of me when I saw him slip it into his
pocket of course hes mad on the subject of drawers thats plain to be seen always
skeezing at those brazenfaced things on the bicycles with their skirts blowing
up to their navels even when Milly and I were out with him at the open air fete
that one in the cream muslin standing right against the
<br><font color="green">{u22, 698}</font>
<br> sun so he could see every atom she had on when he saw me from behind
following in the rain I saw him before he saw me however standing at the corner
of the Harolds cross road with a new raincoat on him with the muffler in the
Zingari colours to show off his complexion and the brown hat looking slyboots as
usual what was he doing there where hed no business they can go and get whatever
they like from anything at all with a skirt on it and were not to ask any
questions but they want to know where were you where are you going I could feel
him coming along skulking after me his eyes on my neck pestered me to say yes
till I took off my glove slowly watching him he said my openwork sleeves were
too cold for the rain anything for an excuse to put his hand anear me drawers
drawers all the time till I promised to give him the pair off my doll to carry
about in his waistcoat pocket <i>O Maria Santissima</i> he did look a big fool
dreeping in the rain splendid set of teeth he had made me hungry to look at them and beseeched of me to lift the orange
<br><font color="green">{u21, 832}</font>
<br> petticoat I had on with the sunray pleats that there was nobody he said hed
kneel down in the wet if I didnt so persevering you never know what freak theyd
take alone with you theyre so savage for it if anyone was passing so I touched
his trousers outside the way I used to Gardner after to keep him from doing
worse where it was too public he was shaking like a jelly all over they want to
do everything too quick take all the pleasure out of it then he wrote me that
letter with all those words in it how could he have the face to any woman after
his company manners making it so awkward after when we met asking me have I
offended you with my eyelids down of course he saw I wasnt he had a few brains
not like that other fool Henny Doyle he was always breaking or tearing something
in the charades I hate an unlucky man and if I knew what it meant of course I
had to say no for form sake

Monday as he said at the same time four I hate people who come at all hours
answer the door you think its the vegetables then its somebody and you all
undressed or the door of the filthy sloppy kitchen blows open the day old

dinner all flushed and tossed with boiling old stew dont look at me professor I
had to say Im a fright yes but he was a real old gent in his way it was
impossible to be more respectful nobody to say youre out you have to peep out

penny to that lame sailor for England home and beauty and I hadnt even put on my
clean shift or powdered myself or a thing then this day week were to go to
Belfast just as well he has to go to Ennis his fathers anniversary the 27th it
wouldnt be pleasant if he did suppose our rooms at the hotel were beside each
other and any fooling went on in the new bed I couldnt tell him to stop and not
bother me with him in the next room or perhaps some protestant clergyman with a
cough knocking on the wall then he wouldnt believe the next day we didnt do
something its all very well a husband but you cant fool a lover after me telling
him we never did anything no its better hes going where he is besides something
always happens with him the time going to the Mallow Concert at Maryborough
ordering boiling soup for the two of us then the bell rang out he walks down the
platform with the soup splashing about taking spoonfuls of it and the waiter

would they say eloped with him that gets you on on the stage the last concert I
sang at where its over a year ago when was it St Teresas hall Clarendon St
little chits of missies they have now singing Kathleen Kearney and her like on
account of father being in the army and my singing the absentminded beggar and
wearing a brooch for lord Roberts when I had the map of it all and Poldy not
Irish enough was it him managed it this time I wouldnt put it past him like he
got me on to sing in the Stabat Mater by going around saying he was putting Lead
Kindly Light to music till the jesuits found out he was a freemason thumping the
piano lead Thou me on copied from some old opera yes and he was going about with
some of them Sinner Fein lately or whatever they call themselves talking his
usual trash and nonsense he says that little man he showed me without the neck
is very intelligent the coming man Griffiths is he well he doesnt look it thats
all I can say still it must have been him he knew there was a boycott I hate the
mention of their politics after the war that Pretoria and Ladysmith and
Bloemfontein where Gardner Lieut Stanley G 8th Bn 2nd East Lancs Rgt of enteric
fever he was a lovely fellow in kaki Im sure he was brave too he said I was
lovely the evening we kissed goodbye at the canal lock my Irish beauty he was
pale with excitement about going away or wed be seen from the road he couldnt
stand properly and I so hot as I never felt they could have made their peace in

out between them instead of dragging on for years killing any finelooking men
there were I love to see a regiment pass in review the first time I saw the

Algeciras all the lights of the rock like fireflies or those sham battles on the

going round with him shopping buying those things in a new city better leave
this ring behind want to keep turning and turning to get it over the knuckle
there or they might bell it round the town in their papers or tell the police on
me but theyd think were married O let them all go and smother themselves for all
I care he has plenty of money and hes not a marrying man so somebody better get
it out of him if I could find out whether he likes me I looked a bit washy of
course when I looked close in the handglass powdering a mirror never gives you
the expression besides scrooching down on me like that all the time with his big
hipbones hes heavy too with his hairy chest for this heat always having to lie
down for them better for him put it into me from behind the way Mrs Mastiansky
told me her husband made her like the dogs do it and stick out her tongue as far
as ever she could and he so quiet and mild with his tingating cither can you
ever be up to men the way it takes them lovely stuff in that blue suit he had on
and stylish tie and socks with the skyblue silk things on them hes certainly
well off but he was like a perfect devil for a few minutes after he came back
with the stop press tearing up the tickets and swearing blazes because he lost
20 quid he said he lost over that outsider that won and half he put on for me on
account of Lenehans tip cursing him to the lowest pits that sponger he was
making free with me after the Glencree dinner coming back that long joult over

<br> to look across see her combing it as if she loved it and was full of it
pity I only got to know her the day before we left and that Mrs Langtry the
Jersey Lily the prince of Wales was in love with I suppose hes like the first
man going the roads only for the name of a king theyre all made the one way a
beauty up to what was she fortyfive there was some funny story about the jealous
old husband what was it at all and an oyster knife he went no he made her wear a
kind of a tin thing round her and the prince of Wales yes he had the oyster
knife cant be true a thing like that like some of those books he brings me the
works of Master Francois somebody supposed to be a priest about a child born out
of her ear because her bumgut fell out a nice word for any priest to write with
that old blackguards face on him anybody can see its not true and that Ruby and
Fair Tyrants he brought me that twice I remember when I came to page 50 the part
about where she hangs him up out of a hook with a cord flagellate sure theres
nothing for a woman in that all invention made up about he drinking the
champagne out of her slipper after the ball was over like the infant Jesus in
the crib at Inchicore in the Blessed Virgins arms sure no woman could have a
child that big taken out of her because how could she
<br><font color="green">{u21, 838}</font>
<br> go to the chamber when she wanted to and she a rich lady he ought to chuck
that Freeman with the paltry few shillings he knocks out of it and go into an
office or something where hed get regular money of course he prefers plottering
about the house so you cant stir with him any side whats your programme today or
pretending to be mooching about for advertisements when he could have been in Mr
Cuffes still only for what he did then sending me to try and patch it up I could
have got him promoted there to be the manager he gave me a great eye once or
twice first he was as stiff as the mischief really and truly Mrs Bloom only I
felt rotten simply with the old rubbishy dress that I lost the leads out of the
tails with no cut in it but theyre coming into fashion again I bought it simply
to please him I knew it was no good by the finish pity I changed my mind of going to Todd and
<br><font color="green">{u22, 704}</font>
<br> Burns as I said and not Lees it was just like the shop itself rummage sale
a lot of trash nothing kills me altogether only he thinks he knows a great lot
about a womans dress and cooking mathering everything he can scour off the
shelves into it if I went by his advices every blessed hat I put on does that
suit me yes take that thats alright the one like a weddingcake standing up miles
off my head he said suited me or the dishcover one coming down on my backside on
pins and needles about the shopgirl in that place in Grafton street I had the
misfortune to bring him into and she as insolent as ever she could be with her
smirk saying Im afraid were giving you too much trouble what shes there for but
I stared it out of her yes he was awfully stiff and no wonder but he changed the
second time he looked Poldy pigheaded as usual like the soup but I could see him
looking very hard at my chest Im extremely sorry Mrs Bloom believe
<br><font color="green">{u21, 839}</font>
<br> me without making it too marked the first time after him being insulted and
me being supposed to be his wife I just half smiled I know my chest was out that
way at the door when he said Im extremely sorry and Im sure you were</p>
<p> I think he made them a bit firmer sucking them like that so long he made me
thirsty titties he calls them I had to laugh yes this one anyhow Ill get him to
keep that up and Ill take those eggs beaten up with marsala fatten them out for
him what are all those veins and things curious the way its made two the same in
case of twins theyre supposed to represent beauty placed up there like those
statues in the museum one of them pretending to hide it with her hand are they
so beautiful of course compared with what a man looks like with his two bags
full and his other thing hanging down out of him or sticking up at you like a
hatrack no wonder they hide it with a cabbageleaf that disgusting Cameron
highlander behind the meat market or that other wretch with the red head behind
the tree when I was passing pretending he was pissing standing out for me to see
it with his babyclothes up to one side the Queens own
<br><font color="green">{u22, 705}</font>
<br> they were a nice lot its well the Surreys relieved them I tried to draw a
picture of it before I tore it up like a sausage or something I wonder theyre
not afraid going about of getting a kick or a bang of something there the woman
is beauty of course thats admitted when he said I could pose for a picture naked
to some rich fellow in Holles street when he lost the job in Helys and I was
selling the clothes and strumming in the coffee palace would I be like that bath of the nymph
<br><font color="green">{u21, 840}</font>
<br> with my hair down yes only shes younger or Im a little like that dirty
bitch in that Spanish photo he has nymphs used they go about like that I asked
him and that word met something with hoses in it and he came out with some
jawbreakers about the incarnation he never can explain a thing simply the way a
body can understand then he goes and burns the bottom out of the pan all for his
kidney this one not so much theres the mark of his teeth still where he tried to
bite the nipple I had to scream out arent they fearful trying to hurt you I had
a great breast of milk with Milly enough for two what was the reason of that he
said I could have got a pound a week as a wet nurse all swelled out the morning
that delicate looking student that stopped in no 28 with the Citrons Penrose
nearly caught me washing through the window only for I snapped up the towel to
my face that was his studenting hurt me they used to weaning her till he got
doctor Brady to give me the Belladonna prescription I had to get him to suck
them they were so hard he said it was sweeter and thicker than cows then he
wanted to milk me into the tea well hes beyond everything I declare somebody
ought to put him in the budget if I only could remember the one half of the
things and write a book out of it the works of Master Poldy yes and its so much
smoother the skin much an hour he was at them Im sure by the clock all the
pleasure those men get out of a woman I can feel his mouth O Lord I must stretch
myself I wished he was here or somebody to let myself go with or if I could
dream it when he made me spend the 2nd time tickling me behind with his finger I
was coming for about five minutes I had to hug him after O Lord I wanted to
shout out all sorts of things fuck or shit or anything at all only not to look
ugly or those lines from the strain who knows the way hed take it you want to
feel your way with a man theyre not all like him thank God some of
<br><font color="green">{u22, 706}</font>
<br> them want you to be so nice about it I noticed the contrast he does it and
doesnt talk I gave my eyes that look with my hair a bit loose from the tumbling
and my tongue between my lips up to him the savage brute Thursday Friday one Saturday two

my beauty sleep I thought it was going to get like Gibraltar my goodness the
heat there and the glare of the rock standing up in it like a big giant with the
red sentries here and there the poplars and they all whitehot and the smell of
the rainwater in those tanks watching the sun all the time weltering down on you
faded all that lovely frock fathers friend Mrs Stanhope sent me from the B
Marche paris what a shame my dearest Doggerina she wrote on it she was very nice
whats this her other name was just a P C to tell you I sent the little present
have just had a jolly warm bath and feel a very clean dog now enjoyed it wogger
she called him wogger wd give anything to be back in G and hear you sing in old
Madrid or Waiting Concone is the name of those exercises he bought me one of

least thing will always think of the lovely teas we had together scrumptious
currant scones and raspberry wafers I adore well now dearest Doggerina be sure
and write soon kind she left out regards to your father also Captain Grove with
love yrs affly Hester x x x x x she didnt look a bit married just like a girl he
was years older than her wogger he was awfully fond of me when he held down the
wire with his foot for me to step over at the bullfight at La Linea when that matador Gomez was given the
<br><font color="green">{u21, 842}</font>
<br> bulls ear these clothes we have to wear whoever invented them expecting you
to walk up Killiney hill then for example at that picnic all staysed up you cant
do a blessed thing in them in a crowd run or jump out of the way

the banderilleros and the brutes of men shouting bravo toro sure the women were
as bad ripping all the whole insides out of those poor horses I never heard of
such a thing in all my life yes he used to break his heart at me taking off the
dog barking in bell lane what became of them ever I suppose theyre dead long ago
the two of them its like all through a mist makes you feel so old I made the
scones of course I had everything all to myself then a girl Hester we used to

following me along the Calle Real in the shop window then he tipped me just in
passing but I never thought hed write making an appointment I had it inside my
petticoat bodice all day reading it up in every hole and corner to find out by
the handwriting or the language of stamps singing I remember shall I wear a
white rose he was the first man kissed me under the Moorish wall it never
entered my head what kissing meant till he put his tongue in my mouth his mouth
was sweetlike young I put my knee up to him a few times to learn the way what
did I tell him I was engaged for for fun to the son of a Spanish nobleman named
Don Miguel de la Flora and he believed me that I was to be married to him in
three years time theres many a true word spoken in jest the flowers that bloom
in the spring trala a few things I told him true about myself just for him to be
imagining the Spanish girls he didnt like I suppose one of them wouldnt have him
I got him excited he crushed all the flowers on my bosom he brought me he
couldnt count the pesetas till I taught him Cappoquin he came from he said on
the Blackwater but it was too short then the day before he left up on the tiptop
under the rockgun near OHaras tower I told him all about the old

<br> Barbary apes they sent to Clapham without a tail careering all over the
show on each others back Mrs Rubio said she was a regular old rock scorpion
robbing the chickens out of Inces farm and throw stones at you if you went anear
he was looking at me I had that white blouse on open in the front to encourage
him as much as I could without too openly they
<br><font color="green">{u21, 847}</font>
<br> were just beginning to be plump I said I was tired we lay over the firtree
cove a wild place I suppose it must be the highest rock in existence the
galleries and casemates and those frightful rocks and Saint Michaels cave with
the icicles or whatever they call them hanging down and ladders all the mud
plotching my boots Im sure thats the way down the monkeys go under the sea to
Africa when they die the ships out far like chips and the sky you could do what
you liked he caressed them outside they love doing that its the roundness there
I was leaning over him with my white ricestraw hat to take the newness out of it
the left side of my face the best my blouse open for his last day he wanted to
touch mine with his for a moment but I wouldnt let him for fear you never know

out of some paper of and mandolines and lanterns O how nice I said whatever I
liked he was going to do immediately if not sooner will you be my man will you

called in Lloyds Weekly news 20 years in jail then he comes out and murders an
old woman for her money imagine his poor wife or mother or whoever she is such a

a madhouse they ought to be all shot or the cat of nine tails a big brute like
that that would attack a poor old woman to murder her in her bed Id cut them off
him so I would not that hed be much use still better than nothing the night I
thought I heard burglars in the kitchen and he went down in his shirt with a
candle and a poker as white as a sheet frightened out of his wits making as much
noise as he possibly could for the burglars benefit there isnt much to steal
indeed the Lord knows still its the feeling especially now with Milly away such
an idea for him to send the girl down there to learn to take photographs only
hed do a thing like that all the same on account of me and Boylan thats why he
did it Im certain the way he plots and plans everything out I couldnt turn round

suppose thats how he got all the gilt mirrors and carpets getting round those
rich ones off Stephens green running up to him for every little fiddlefaddle her
vagina and her cochinchina theyve money of course so theyre all right I wouldnt
marry him not if he was the last man in the world smelling around those filthy
bitches all sides asking me if what I did had an offensive odour what did he
want me to do but the one thing gold maybe what a question if I smathered it all
over his wrinkly old face for him I suppose hed know then and could you pass it
easily pass what I thought he was talking about the rock of Gibraltar the way he
put it thats a very nice invention too by the way only I like letting myself
down after as far as I can squeeze and pull the chain then to flush it nice cool
pins and needles still theres something in it I suppose I always used to know by

<br> I suppose he thinks I dont know then tucked up in bed like those babies in
the Aristocrats Masterpiece he brought me another time as if we hadnt enough of
that in real life without some old Aristocrat or whatever his name is disgusting
you more with those rotten pictures children with two heads and no legs thats
the kind of villainy theyre always dreaming about with not another thing in
their empty heads then tea and toast for him buttered on both sides and newlaid eggs I suppose Im nothing any
<br><font color="green">{u22, 723}</font>
<br> more when I wouldnt let him lick me in Holles street one night man man
tyrant as ever for the one thing he slept on the floor half the night naked and
wouldnt eat any breakfast or speak a word wanting to be petted so I thought I
stood out enough for one time and let him he does it all wrong too thinking only
of his own pleasure he forgets that wethen I dont Ill make him do it again if he
doesnt mind himself I wonder was it her Josie off her head with my castoffs hes
such a born liar too no hed never have the courage with a married woman thats
why he wants me and Boylan though as for Denis as she calls him that
forlornlooking spectacle you couldnt call him a husband yes its some little
bitch hes got in with even when I was with him with Milly at the College races
that Hornblower with the childs hat on
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">the top
of</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font> his nob let us
into by the back way he was throwing his sheeps eyes at those two doing skirt
duty up and down I tried to wink at him first no use of course and thats the way
his money goes this is the fruits of Mr Paddy Dignam yes they were all in great
style at the grand funeral in the paper Boylan brought in L Boom and Tom Kernan
that drunken little barrelly man that bit his tongue off falling down the mens W
C drunk in some place or other and Martin Cunningham and the two Dedaluses and Fanny MCoys husband white head of cabbage

<br> skinny thing with a turn in her eye trying to sing my songs shed want to be
born all over again and her old green dress like dabbling on a rainy day I see
it all now plainly and they call that friendship killing and then burying one
another and they all with their wives and families at home more especially Jack
Power keeping that barmaid he does of course his wife is always sick or going to
be sick or just getting better of it and hes a goodlooking man still though hes
getting a bit grey over the ears theyre a nice lot all of them well theyre not
going to get my husband again into their clutches if I can help it making fun of
him then behind his back I know well when he goes on with his idiotics because
he has sense enough not to squander every penny piece he earns down their
gullets goodfornothings poor Paddy Dignam all the same Im sorry in a way for him
what are his wife and five children going to do unless he was insured comical
little teetotum always stuck up in some pub corner and her or her son waiting Bill
<br><font color="green">{u22, 724}</font>
<br> Bailey wont you please come home what men wasnt he yes he was at the
Glencree dinner and Ben Dollard base barreltone the night he borrowed the
swallowtail to sing out of in Holles street squeezed and squashed into them and
grinning all over his big Dolly face didnt he look a balmy ballocks sure enough
that must have been a spectacle on the stage imagine paying 5/- in the preserved
seats for that and Simon Dedalus too he was always turning up half screwed
singing the second verse first the old love is the new was one of his so sweetly
sang the maiden on the hawthorn bough he was always on for flirtyfying too when
I sang Maritana with him at Freddy Mayers private opera he had a delicious
glorious voice Phoebe dearest goodbye sweetheart <i>sweet</i>heart he always
sang it not like Bartell D&apos;Arcy sweet <i>tart</i> goodbye of course he had
the gift of the voice so there was no art in it all over you like a warm
showerbath O Maritana wildwood flower we sang splendidly though it was a bit too
high for my register even transposed and he was married at the time to May Goulding but then hed say or
<br><font color="green">{u21, 863}</font>
<br> do something to knock the good out of it hes a widower now I wonder what
sort is his son he says hes an author and going to be a university professor of
Italian and Im to take lessons what is he driving at now I saw him driving down
to the Kingsbridge station with his father and mother I was in mourning thats
eleven years ago now yes hed be eleven though what was the good in going into
mourning for what was neither one thing nor the other of course he insisted hed
go into mourning for the cat I suppose hes a man now by this time he was an
innocent boy then and a darling little fellow in his lord Fauntleroy suit and
curly hair like a prince on the stage when I saw him at Mat Dillons he liked me
too I remember they all do wait by God yes wait yes he was on the cards this
morning when I laid out the deck a young stranger you met before I thought it
meant him but hes no chicken nor a stranger either didnt I dream something too
yes there was something about poetry in it I hope he hasnt long greasy hair what
do they go about like that for only getting themselves and their poetry laughed
at I always liked poetry when I was a girl first I thought he was a poet like
Byron and not an ounce of it in his composition I thought he was quite different
I wonder is he too young hes about wait 88 I was married 88 Milly is 15
yesterday 89 what age was he then at Dillons 5 or 6 about 88 I suppose hes 20 or
more Im not too old for him if hes 23 or 24 I hope hes not that stuck up
university sort no otherwise he wouldnt go sitting down in the old kitchen with
him taking Eppss cocoa and talking of course he pretended to understand it all
probably he told him he was out of Trinity college hes very young to be a professor I hope hes not a
<br><font color="green">{u21, 864}</font>
<br> professor like Goodwin was he was a patent professor of John Jameson they
all write about some woman in their poetry well I suppose he wont find many like
me where softly sighs of love the light guitar where poetry is in the air the
blue sea and the moon shining so beautifully coming back on the nightboat from
Tarifa the guitar that fellow played was so expressive will I ever go back there
again all new faces two glancing eyes a lattice hid Ill sing that for him theyre
my eyes if hes anything of a poet two eyes as darkly bright as loves young star
arent those beautiful words as loves young star itll be a change the Lord knows
to have an intelligent person to talk to about yourself not always listening to
him and Billy Prescotts ad and Keyess ad and Tom the Devils ad Im sure hes very
distinguished Id like to meet a man like that God not those other ruck besides
hes young those fine young men I could see down in Margate strand bathingplace
from the side of the rock standing up in the sun naked like a god or something
and then plunging into the sea with them why arent all men like that thered be
some consolation for a woman like that lovely little statue he bought I could
look at him all day long curly head and his shoulders his finger up for you to
listen theres real beauty and poetry for you I often felt I wanted to kiss him
all over also his lovely young cock there so simple I wouldnt mind taking him in
my mouth if nobody was looking so clean and white he looks with his boyish face
itll be grand if I can only get in with a handsome young poet at my age Ill read
and study all I can find so he wont think me stupid if he thinks all women are
the same and I can teach him the other part Ill make him feel all over him then
hell write about me lover and mistress publicly too with our photographs in the
papers when he becomes famous O but then what am I going to do about him though</p>
<p> no thats no way for him has he no manners nor no refinement
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">nor
nothing</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font> in his
nature slapping us behind like that on my bottom thats what you get for not
keeping them in their proper place
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">and
standing out that vulgar way in the half of a shirt they wear to be
admired</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font> of course
hes right enough in his way to pass the time as a joke
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">sure
you might as well be in bed with what with a lion God Im sure hed have something
better to say an old lion
would</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font> O well I
suppose its because they were so plump and tempting in my short petticoat he
couldnt resist they excite myself sometimes its well for men all the amount of
pleasure they get off a womans body were so round and white for them always I
wished I was one myself for a change just to try with that thing they have
swelling up on you so hard and at the same time so soft when you touch it my
uncle John has a thing long I heard those cornerboys saying passing the corner
of Marrowbone lane my aunt Mary has a thing hairy because it was dark and they
knew a girl was passing it didnt make me blush why should it either its only
nature and he puts his thing long into my aunt Marys hairy etcetera and turns
out to be you put the handle in a sweepingbrush men again all over they can pick
and choose what they please a married woman or a fast widow or a girl for their
different tastes like those houses round behind Irish street no but were to be
always chained up theyre not going to be chaining me up no fear once I start I
tell you for their stupid husbands jealousy why cant we all remain friends over
it instead of quarrelling her husband found it out well and if he did can he
undo it and then he going to the other mad extreme about the wife in Fair
Tyrants of course the man never even casts a 2nd
<br><font color="green">{u21, 866}</font>
<br> thought on the husband or wife either its the woman he wants and he gets her what else were we given
<br><font color="green">{u22, 727}</font>
<br> all those desires for Id like to know I cant help it if Im young still can
I its a wonder Im not an old shrivelled hag before my time living with him so
cold never embracing me except sometimes when hes asleep the wrong end of me not
knowing I suppose who he has any man thatd kiss a womans bottom Id throw my hat
at him after that
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black"><a name="un7006u" href="../../ff/unbs/un7all.htm#un7006u">hed

unnatural where we havent an atom of any kind of expression in us all of us the
same two lumps of lard before ever Id do that to a man pfooh the dirty brutes
the mere thought is enough of course a woman wants to be embraced 20 times a day
almost to make her look young no matter by who so long as to be in love or loved
by somebody if the fellow you want isnt there sometimes by
<font color="red"><sup><small>|6</small></sup></font><font color="black">the
Lord</font><font color="red"><sup><small>6|</small></sup></font> God I was
thinking would I go around by the quays there some dark evening where nobodyd
know me and pick up a sailor off the sea thatd be hot on for it and not care a
pin whose I was only do it off up in a gate somewhere or one of those
wildlooking gipsies in Rathfarnham had their camp pitched near the Bloomfield
laundry to try and steal our things if they could I only sent mine there a few
times for the name model laundry sending me back over and over some old ones odd
stockings that blackguardlooking fellow with the fine eyes peeling a switch
attack me in the dark and ride me up against the wall without a word what they
do themselves the fine gentlemen in their silk hats that K. C. lives up
somewhere this way coming out of Hardwicke lane the night he gave us the fish
supper on account of winning over the boxing match I knew him by his gaiters and
the walk and when I turned round a minute after there was a woman after coming
out of it too some filthy prostitute then he goes home to his wife after that
only I suppose the half of those sailors are rotten again with disease O move
over your big carcass out of that for the love of Mike so well he may sleep and
Im to be slooching around down in the kitchen to get his lordship his breakfast
will I indeed Id just like to see myself at it show them attention and they
treat you like dirt I dont care what anybody says itd be much better for the
world to be governed by the women in it you wouldnt see women going and
<br><font color="green">{u22, 728}</font>
<br> killing one another and slaughtering when do you ever see women rolling
around drunk like they do or gambling every penny they have and losing it on
horses yes because a woman whatever she does she knows where to stop sure they
wouldnt be in the world at all only for us they dont know what it is to be a
woman and a mother how could they where would they all of them be if they hadnt
all a mother to look after them thats why I suppose hes running wild now out at
night away from his books and studies and not living at home on account of the
usual rowy house I suppose you see those that have a fine son like that theyre
not satisfied and I none was he not able to make one it wasnt my fault we came
together when I was watching the two dogs up in her behind in the middle of the
naked street that disheartened me altogether I suppose I oughtnt to have buried
him in that little woolly jacket I knitted crying as I was but give it to some
poor child but I knew well Id never have another O Im not going to think myself
into the glooms about that any more I wonder why he wouldnt stay the night I
felt all the time it was somebody strange he brought in instead of roving around
the city meeting God knows who nightwalkers and pickpockets his poor mother
wouldnt like that if she was alive ruining himself for life perhaps he could
easy have slept in there on the sofa I suppose he was as shy as a boy he being
so young hardly 20 of me in the next room hed have heard me on the chamber arrah
what harm Dedalus I wonder its like those names in Gibraltar Delapaz Delagracia
they had the devils queer names there father Vilaplana of Santa Maria that gave
me the rosary Rosales y O&apos;Reilly in the Calle las Siete Revueltas and
Pisimbo and Mrs Opisso in Governor street O what a name Id go and drown myself
in the first river if I had a name like her O my and all the bits of streets
Paradise ramp and Bedlam ramp and Rodgers ramp and the devils gap steps well
small blame to me if I am a harumscarum I know I am a bit I declare to God I
dont feel a day older than then I wonder could I get my tongue round any of the
Spanish como esta usted muy bien gracias y usted see I havent forgotten it all I
thought I had only for the grammar a noun is the name of any person place
<br><font color="green">{u22, 729}</font>
<br> or thing pity I never tried to read that novel cantankerous Mrs Rubio lent
me by Valera with the questions in it all upside down the two ways I can tell
him the Spanish and he tell me the Italian then hell see Im not so ignorant what
a pity he didnt stay Im sure the poor fellow wanted a good sleep badly I could
have brought him in his breakfast in bed with a bit of toast so long as I didnt
do it on the knife for bad luck or if the woman was going her rounds with the
watercress and ground ivy something nice and tasty I could do the criada the
room looks all right since I changed it the other way you see something was
telling me all the time Id have to introduce myself not knowing me from Adam
very funny wouldnt it Im his wife or pretend we were in Spain with him half
awake without a Gods notion where he is dos huevos estrellados senor Lord the
cracked things come into my head sometimes itd be great fun supposing he stayed
with us why not theres the room upstairs empty and Millys bed in the back room
Im sure Im not going to take in lodgers off the street for him if he takes a
gesabo of a house like this Id love to have a long talk with an intelligent
welleducated person Id have to get a nice pair of red slippers like those Turks
with the fez used to sell or yellow and a nice semitransparent morning gown that
I badly want Ill just give him one more chance Ill get up early in the morning
Im sick of Cohens old bed in any case then Ill throw him up his eggs and tea I
know what Ill do Ill go about rather gay not too much singing a bit now and then
mi fa pieta Masetto then Ill start dressing myself to go out presto non son
pi&ugrave; forte Ill put on my best shift and drawers let him have a good eyeful
out of that to make his micky stand Ill let him know if thats what he wanted that his wife is fucked
<br><font color="green">{u22, 730}</font>

out that ought to satisfy him if you dont believe me feel my belly Ive a mind to
tell him every scrap and make him do it out in front of me serve him right its
all his own fault if I am an adulteress as the thing in the gallery said O much

ago I love flowers Id love to have the whole place swimming in roses theres
nothing like nature the wild mountains then the sea and the waves rushing then
the beautiful country with the fields of oats and wheat and all kinds of things
and all the fine cattle going about that would do your heart good to see rivers
and lakes and flowers all sorts of shapes and smells and colours springing up
even out of the ditches primroses and violets nature it is as for them saying
theres no God I wouldnt give a snap of my two fingers for all their learning why
dont they go and create something I often asked him atheists or whatever they
call themselves go and wash the cobbles off themselves first then they go
howling for the priest and they dying and why why because theyre afraid ah yes I
know them well who was the first person in the universe before there was anybody
that made it all who ah that they dont know neither do I so there you are they
