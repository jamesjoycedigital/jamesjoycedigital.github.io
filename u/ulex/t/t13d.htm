no manners or no refinement in his nature slapping us behind like that on my

course he&apos;s right enough in his way to pass the time as a joke O well I
suppose it&apos;s because they were so plump and tempting in my short petticoat
he couldn&apos;t resist they excite myself sometimes it&apos;s well for men all
the amount of pleasure they get off a woman&apos;s body we&apos;re so round and

no fear once I start I tell you for their stupid husband&apos;s jealousy why
can&apos;t we all remain friends over it instead of quarrelling her husband

like to know I can&apos;t help it if I&apos;m young still can I it&apos;s a
wonder I&apos;m not an old shrivelled hag before my time living with him so cold
never embracing me except sometimes when he&apos;s asleep the wrong end of me
not knowing I suppose who he has any man that&apos;d kiss a woman&apos;s bottom
I&apos;d throw my hat at him after that unnatural

no matter by who so long as to be in love or loved by somebody if the fellow you
want isn&apos;t there sometimes by God I was thinking would I go around by the
quays there some dark evening where nobody&apos;d know me and pick up a sailor
off the sea that&apos;d be hot on for it and not care a pin whose I was only do
it off up in a gate somewhere what they do themselves the fine gentlemen in
their silk hats that K.C. lives up somewhere this way coming out of Hardwicke
lane the night he gave us the fish supper

women in it you wouldn&apos;t see women going and killing one another and
slaughtering when do you ever see women rolling around drunk like they do or
gambling every penny they have and losing it on horses yes because a woman
whatever she does she knows where to stop sure they wouldn&apos;t be in the
world at all only for us they don&apos;t know what it is to be a woman and a
mother how could they where would they all of them be if they hadn&apos;t all a
mother to look after them that&apos;s why I suppose he&apos;s running wild now
out at night away from his books and studies and not living at home on account
of the usual rowy house I suppose you see those that have a fine son like that
they&apos;re not satisfied and I none was he not able to make one that
disheartened me altogether I suppose I oughtn&apos;t to have buried him in that
little woolly jacket I knitted

going to think myself into the glooms about that any more I wonder why he
wouldn&apos;t stay the night I felt all the time it was somebody strange he
brought in instead of roving around the city meeting God knows who nightwalkers
and pickpockets his poor mother wouldn&apos;t like that if she was alive ruining
himself for life perhaps he could easy have slept in there on the sofa I suppose
he was as shy as a boy he being so young hardly 20 of me in the next room
he&apos;d have heard me on the chamber arrah what harm Dedalus I wonder
it&apos;s like those names in Gibraltar Delapaz Delagracia they had the
devil&apos;s queer names there father Vilaplana of Santa Maria that gave me the
rosary Rosales y O&apos;Reilly in the Calle las Siete Revueltas and Pisimbo and
Mrs Opisso in Governor street O what a name I&apos;d go and drown myself in the

get my tongue round any of the Spanish como esta usted muy bien gracias y usted
see I haven&apos;t forgotten it all I thought I had pity I never tried
<br><font color="green">{ms, 003}</font>
<br> to read that novel
<a name="un7003ci" href="../../ff/unbs/un7all.htm#un7003ci">cantankerous</a> Mrs
Rubio lent me by Valera with the questions in it all upside down the two ways I
can tell him the Spanish and he tell me the Italian then he&apos;ll see I&apos;m
not so ignorant what a pity he didn&apos;t stay I&apos;m sure the poor fellow
wanted a good sleep badly I could have brought him in his breakfast in bed with
a bit of toast so as I didn&apos;t do it on the knife for bad luck or if the
woman was going her rounds with the watercress and ground ivy something nice and
tasty I could do the criada the room looks all right since I changed it the
other way you see something was telling me all the time I&apos;d have to
introduce myself not knowing me from Adam very funny wouldn&apos;t it I&apos;m
his wife or pretend we were in Spain with him half awake without a God&apos;s
notion where he is dos huevos estrellados se&ntilde;or Lord the cracked things
come into my head sometimes it&apos;d be great fun supposing he stayed with us
why not there&apos;s the room upstairs empty and Milly&apos;s bed in the back
room I&apos;m sure I&apos;m not going to take in lodgers off the street I&apos;d
love to have a long talk with an intelligent welleducated person I&apos;d have
to get a nice pair of red slippers like those
<a name="un6022dh" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6022dh">Turks</a> with the
<a name="un6022dg" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6022dg">fez</a> used to sell
or yellow and a nice semitransparent morning gown that I badly want I&apos;ll
just give him one more chance I&apos;ll get up early in the morning I&apos;m
sick of Cohen&apos;s old bed in any case then I&apos;ll throw him up his eggs
and tea I know what I&apos;ll do I&apos;ll go about rather gay not too much
singing a bit now and then mi fa pieta Masetto then I&apos;ll start dressing
myself to go out presto non son pi&ugrave; forte I&apos;ll put on my best shift
and drawers let him have a good eyeful out of that to make him stand I&apos;ll
let him know if that&apos;s what he wanted that his wife is fucked and damn well
fucked too not by him 4 or 5 times running serve him right it&apos;s all his own
fault if I am an adulteress as the thing in the gallery said O much about it if
that&apos;s all the
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext"><font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">unread</span></font></span></span>
harm ever we did in this
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">world</span></span> vale of tears
God knows it&apos;s not much I suppose that&apos;s what a woman is supposed to
be there for or He wouldn&apos;t have made us the way He did then if he wants to
kiss my bottom I&apos;ll stick it out in his face as large as life then
I&apos;ll tell him I want &pound;1 or perhaps 30/- I&apos;ll tell him I want to
buy underclothes then if he gives me that well he won&apos;t be too bad
I&apos;ll let him do it off on me behind provided he doesn&apos;t smear all my good drawers O I suppose that
<br><font color="green">{ms, 004}</font>
<br> can&apos;t be helped I&apos;ll do the indifferent one or two questions
I&apos;ll know by the answers when he&apos;s like that he can&apos;t keep a
thing back I&apos;ll tighten my bottom well and let out a few
<a name="un4035dc" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4035dc">smutty words</a>
then I&apos;ll suggest about yes O wait now my turn is coming I&apos;ll be quite
gay and friendly over it O but I was forgetting this bloody pest of a thing
pfooh no I&apos;ll have to wear the old things so much the better it&apos;ll be
more pointed he&apos;ll never know whether he did it or not there that&apos;s
good enough for you any old thing at all then I&apos;ll wipe him off me just
like a business then I&apos;ll go out I&apos;ll have eying up at the ceiling
where is she gone now I&apos;ll go to Lambe&apos;s there beside Findlater&apos;s
and get them to send us some flowers to put about the place in case he brings
him home tomorrow today I mean no no Friday&apos;s an unlucky day first I want
to do the place up someway then we can have music and cigarettes those fairy
cakes in Lipton&apos;s at 7&frac12; d a lb or the other ones with the cherries
in them and the pinky sugar 11 d a couple of lbs of those a nice plant for the
middle of the table I&apos;d get that cheaper in wait where&apos;s I saw them
not long ago I love flowers I&apos;d love to have the whole place swimming in
roses there&apos;s nothing like nature the wild mountains then the sea and the
waves rushing then the beautiful country with the fields of oats and wheat and
all kinds of things and all the fine cattle going about that would do your heart
good to see rivers and lakes and flowers all sorts of shapes and smells and
colours springing up even out of the
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">dit</span></span> ditches
primroses and violets nature it is as for them saying there&apos;s no God I
wouldn&apos;t give a snap of my two fingers for all their learning why
don&apos;t they go and create something I often asked him atheists or whatever
they call themselves go and wash the cobbles off themselves first then they go
howling for the priest and they dying and why why because they&apos;re afraid ah
yes I know them well who was the first person in the universe before there was
anybody that made it all that they don&apos;t know neither do I so there you are
they might as well try to stop the sun from rising the sun shines for you he
said the day we were lying among the rhododendrons on Howth head the day I got
him to propose to me
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">yes</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font>
and it was leapyear like now
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">yes</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font>
sixteen years ago my God after that long kiss I near lost my breath yes he said
I was a flower of the mountain yes so we are
<br><font color="green">{ms, 005}</font>
<br> flowers all a woman&apos;s body yes that was one true thing he said in his
life and the sun shines for you today yes that was why I liked him
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">he</span></span> because I saw he
understood or felt what a woman is and I knew I could always get round him and I
gave him all the pleasure I could leading him on till he asked me to say yes and
I wouldn&apos;t answer first only looked
<a name="s18007ac" href="../../ff/unbs/s18all.htm#s18007ac">out over the sea and
the sky</a> I was thinking of so many things he didn&apos;t know of Mulvey and
Mr Stanhope and Hester and father and old captain Groves and the Alameda gardens
and Gibraltar as a girl where I was a flower of the mountain and how he kissed
me under the Moorish wall and I thought well as well him as another and then I
asked him with my eyes to ask again and then he asked me would I to say yes my
mountain flower and first I put my arms around him and drew him down to me so he
could feel my breasts all perfume and I said I will yes.
