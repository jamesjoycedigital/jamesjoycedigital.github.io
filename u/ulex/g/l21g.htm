<p> Red Murray touched Mr Bloom&apos;s arm with the shears and whispered:</p>

stately figure entered between the

<p> A meek smile accompanied him as he lifted the counterflap, as he passed in
through the sidedoor and along the warm dark stairs and passage, along the now
reverberating boards. But will he save the circulation? Thumping, thumping.</p>
<p> He pushed in the glass swingdoor and entered, stepping over strewn packing
paper. Through a lane of clanking drums he made his way towards Nannetti&apos;s reading closet.</p>

<p> The foreman, without answering, scribbled press on a corner of the sheet and
made a sign to a typesetter. He handed the sheet silently over the dirty glass screen.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Right: thanks, Hynes said moving off.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom stood in his way.</p>

scratch slowly in the armpit of his alpaca jacket.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Like that, Mr Bloom said, crossing his forefingers at the top.</p>
<p> Let him take that in first.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom, glancing sideways up from the cross he had made, saw the
foreman&apos;s sallow face, think he has a touch of jaundice, and beyond the
obedient reels feeding in huge webs<a target="foot" id="fgg0024">&ordm;</a> of
paper. Clank it. Clank it. Miles of it unreeled. What becomes of it after? O,
wrap up meat, parcels: various uses,
<a name="un4007bn" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4007bn">thousand and one things</a>.</p>
<p> Slipping his words deftly into the pauses of the clanking he drew swiftly on the scarred woodwork.</p>

<p> Better not teach him his own business.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You know yourself, councillor, just what he wants. Then
round the top in leaded: the house of keys. You see? Do you think that&apos;s a good idea?</p>
<p> The foreman moved his scratching hand to his lower ribs and scratched there quietly.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The idea, Mr Bloom said, is the house of keys. You know,
councillor, the Manx parliament. Innuendo of home rule. Tourists, you know, from
the isle of Man. Catches the eye, you see. Can you do that?</p>
<p> I could ask him perhaps about how to pronounce that <i>voglio</i>. But then
if he didn&apos;t know only make it awkward for him. Better not.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; We can do that, the foreman said. Have you the design?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I can get it, Mr Bloom said. It was in a Kilkenny paper.
He has a house there too. I&apos;ll just run out and ask him. Well, you can do
that and just a little par calling attention. You know the usual.
Highclass<a target="foot" id="fgg0026">&ordm;</a> licensed premises. Longfelt want. So on.</p>
<p> The foreman thought for an instant.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; We can do that, he said. Let him give us a three months&apos; renewal.</p>
<p> A typesetter brought him a limp galleypage. He began to check it silently.
Mr Bloom stood by, hearing the loud throbs of cranks, watching the silent typesetters at their cases. </p>

said something about an old hat or something. No, I could have said. Looks as good as new now. See his phiz then.</p>

<p class="headline">NOTED CHURCHMAN AN OCCASIONAL

<p> The foreman handed back the galleypage suddenly, saying:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Wait. Where&apos;s the archbishop&apos;s letter? It&apos;s
to be repeated in the <i>Telegraph</i>. Where&apos;s what&apos;s his name?</p>

<p> He walked on through the caseroom, passing an old man, bowed, spectacled,
aproned. Old Monks, the dayfather. Queer lot of stuff he must have put through
his hands in his time: obituary notices, pubs&apos; ads, speeches, divorce
suits, found drowned. Nearing the end of his tether now. Sober serious man with
a bit in the savingsbank I&apos;d say. Wife a good cook and washer. Daughter
working the machine in the parlour. Plain Jane, no damn nonsense.</p>
<p class="headline">AND IT WAS THE FEAST OF THE PASSOVER</p>

Jacob&apos;s sons. And then the lamb and the cat and the dog and the stick and
the water and the butcher and then the angel of death kills the butcher and he
kills the ox and the dog kills the cat. Sounds a bit silly till you come to look
into it well. Justice it means but it&apos;s everybody eating everyone else.
That&apos;s what life is after all. How quickly he does that job.
<a name="un4054n" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4054n">Practice makes perfect.</a> Seems to see with his fingers.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom passed on out of the clanking noises through the gallery on to the
landing. Now am I going to tram it out all the way and then catch him out
perhaps. Better phone him up first. Number? Same as Citron&apos;s house. Twentyeight. Twentyeight double four.</p>
<p class="headline">ONLY ONCE MORE THAT SOAP</p>
<p> He went down the house staircase. Who the deuce scrawled all over these

always is in those works.

<p class="headline">SHORT BUT TO THE POINT</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Whose land? Mr Bloom said simply.</p>

<p class="di">&mdash; Is it his speech last night? Mr Bloom asked.</p>
<p> Ned Lambert nodded.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; But listen to this, he said.</p>
<p> The doorknob hit Mr Bloom in the small of the back as the door was pushed in.</p>

<a name="un5009aj" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5009aj">welshcombed</a> his hair with raking fingers.</p>
<p> Ned Lambert tossed the newspaper aside, chuckling with delight. An instant
after a hoarse bark of laughter burst over professor MacHugh&apos;s unshaven blackspectacled face.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Doughy Daw! he cried. </p>

<p> The inner door was opened violently and a scarlet beaked face, crested by a
comb of feathery hair, thrust itself in. The bold blue eyes stared about them and the harsh voice asked:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What is it?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And here comes the sham squire himself, professor MacHugh said grandly.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Getonouthat<a target="foot" id="fgg0046">&ordm;</a>, you

<p class="di">&mdash; Come, Ned, Mr Dedalus said, putting on his hat. I must get a drink after that.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Drink! the editor cried. No drinks served before mass.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Quite right too, Mr Dedalus said, going out. Come on, Ned.</p>
<p> Ned Lambert sidled down from the table. The editor&apos;s blue eyes roved
towards Mr Bloom&apos;s face, shadowed by a smile.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Will you join us, Myles? Ned Lambert asked.</p>
<p class="headline"><a name="un5022r" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5022r">MEMORABLE BATTLES RECALLED</a></p>

<p class="di">&mdash; In Ohio! the editor shouted.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; So it was, begad, Ned Lambert agreed.</p>
<p> Passing out, he whispered to J.J. O&apos;Molloy:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Incipient jigs. Sad case.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ohio! the editor crowed in high treble from his uplifted scarlet face. My Ohio!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A perfect cretic! the professor said. Long, short and long. </p>
<p class="headline">O, HARP EOLIAN!</p>
<p> He took a reel of dental floss from his waistcoat pocket and, breaking off a
piece, twanged it smartly between two and two of his resonant unwashed teeth.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Bingbang, bangbang.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom, seeing the coast clear, made for the inner door.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Just a moment, Mr Crawford, he said. I just want to phone about an ad.</p>
<p> He went in.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What about that leader this evening? professor MacHugh
asked, coming to the editor and laying a firm hand on his shoulder.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That&apos;ll be all right, Myles Crawford said more
calmly. Never you fret. Hello, Jack. That&apos;s all right.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Good day, Myles, J.J. O&apos;Molloy said, letting the
pages he held slip limply back on the file. Is that Canada swindle case on today?</p>
<p> The telephone whirred inside.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Twenty eight&nbsp;&hellip; No, twenty&nbsp;&hellip; Double four&nbsp;&hellip; Yes.</p>
<p class="headline">SPOT THE WINNER</p>

tissues.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who wants a dead cert for the Gold cup? he asked. Sceptre with O. Madden up.</p>
<p> He tossed the tissues on to the table.</p>
<p> Screams of newsboys barefoot in the hall rushed near and the door was flung open.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Hush, Lenehan said.
<a name="un4037s" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4037s">I hear feetstoops.</a></p>
<p> Professor MacHugh strode across the room and seized the cringing urchin by
the collar as the others scampered out of the hall and down the steps. The
tissues rustled up in the draught, floated softly in the air blue scrawls and under the table came to earth.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It wasn&apos;t me, sir. It was the big fellow shoved me, sir.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Throw him out and shut the door, the editor said.
There&apos;s a <a name="un4007q" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4007q">hurricane</a> blowing.</p>
<p> Lenehan began to paw the tissues up from the floor, grunting as he stooped twice. </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Waiting for the racing special, sir, the newsboy said. It
was Pat <a name="un6007e" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6007e">Farrell</a>
shoved me in<a target="foot" id="fgg0048">&ordm;</a>, sir.</p>
<p> He pointed to two faces peering in round the doorframe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Him, sir.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Out of this with you, professor MacHugh said gruffly.</p>
<p> He <a name="un6007ap" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6007ap">hustled</a> the boy out and banged the door to.</p>
<p> J.J. O&apos;Molloy turned the files crackingly over, murmuring, seeking:</p>

rooms?&nbsp;&hellip; Aha! I see&nbsp;&hellip; Right. I&apos;ll catch him.</p>
<p class="headline">A COLLISION ENSUES</p>
<p> The bell whirred again as he rang off. He came in quickly and bumped against
Lenehan who was struggling up with the second tissue.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>Pardon, monsieur</i>, Lenehan said, clutching him for an instant and making a grimace.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; My fault, Mr Bloom said, suffering his grip. Are you hurt? I&apos;m in a hurry.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Knee, Lenehan said.</p>
<p> He made a comic face and whined, rubbing his knee:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The accumulation of the <i>anno Domini</i>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Sorry, Mr Bloom said.</p>
<p> He went to the door and, holding it ajar, paused. J.J. O&apos;Molloy slapped
the heavy pages over. The noise of two shrill voices, a mouthorgan, echoed in
the bare hallway from the newsboys squatted on the doorsteps:</p>
<p class="diset">&mdash;<a target="foot" id="fgg0049">&ordm;</a> <i>We are the boys of Wexford</i>

<p class="di">&mdash; I&apos;m just running round to Bachelor&apos;s walk, Mr
Bloom said, about this ad of Keyes&apos;s. Want to fix it up. They tell me he&apos;s round there in Dillon&apos;s.</p>
<p> He looked indecisively for a moment at their faces. The editor who,  leaning
against the mantelshelf, had propped his head on his
hand,<a target="foot" id="fgg0050">&ordm;</a> suddenly stretched forth an arm amply.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Begone! he said. The world is before you.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Back in no time, Mr Bloom said, hurrying out.</p>
<p> J.J. O&apos;Molloy took the tissues from Lenehan&apos;s hand and read them,
blowing them apart gently, without comment.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He&apos;ll get that advertisement, the professor said,
staring through his blackrimmed spectacles over the crossblind. Look at the young scamps after him.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Show!<a target="foot" id="fgg0051">&ordm;</a> Where? Lenehan cried, running to the window.</p>

<p class="di">&mdash; Who? the professor said, turning. They&apos;re gone round
to the Oval for a drink. Paddy Hooper is there with

<p> He walked jerkily into the office behind, parting the

and against the wood as he locked his desk drawer.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He&apos;s pretty well on, professor MacHugh said in a low voice.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Seems to be, J.J. O&apos;Molloy said, taking out a

<p class="headline">THE CALUMET OF PEACE</p>
<p> He offered a cigarette to the professor and took one himself. Lenehan
promptly struck a match for them and lit their cigarettes in turn. J.J.
O&apos;Molloy opened his case again and offered it. </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>Thanky vous</i>, Lenehan said, helping himself.</p>
<p> The editor came from the inner office, a straw hat awry on his brow. He
declaimed in song, pointing sternly at professor MacHugh:</p>
<p class="diset">&mdash;<a target="foot" id="fgg0053">&ordm;</a> <i>&apos;Twas rank and fame that tempted thee,</i>
<br> <i>&apos;Twas empire charmed thy heart.</i></p>
<p> The professor grinned, locking his long lips.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Eh? You bloody old Roman empire? Myles Crawford said.</p>
<p> He took a cigarette from the open case. Lenehan, lighting it for him with quick grace, said:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Silence for my brandnew riddle!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>Imperium romanum</i>, J.J. O&apos;Molloy said gently.
It sounds nobler than British or Brixton. The word reminds one somehow of fat in the fire.</p>
<p> Myles Crawford blew his first puff violently towards the ceiling.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That&apos;s it, he said. We are the fat. You and I are the

<p class="di">&mdash; Wait a moment, professor MacHugh said, raising two quiet
claws. We mustn&apos;t be led away by words, by sounds of words. We think of Rome, imperial, imperious, imperative.</p>
<p> He extended
<a name="un4007at" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4007at">elocutionary</a>
arms from <a name="un4007bj" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4007bj">frayed stained shirtcuffs</a>, pausing:</p>

brought to every new shore on which he set his foot (on our shore he never set
it) only his cloacal obsession. He gazed about him in his toga and he said:
<i>It is</i><a target="foot" id="fgg0056">&ordm;</a> <i>meet to be here. Let us construct a watercloset.</i></p>

<p class="di">&mdash; They were nature&apos;s gentlemen, J.J. O&apos;Molloy murmured. But we have also Roman law.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And Pontius Pilate is its prophet, professor MacHugh responded. </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Do you know that story about chief baron Palles? J.J.

not mine. Mr Garrett Deasy asked me to&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O, I know him, Myles Crawford said, and knew his wife too.
The bloodiest old tartar God ever made. By Jesus, she had the foot and mouth
 disease and no mistake! The night she threw the soup in the waiter&apos;s face in the Star and Garter. Oho!</p>
<p> A woman brought sin into the world. For Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus,
ten years the Greeks. O&apos;Rourke, prince of Breffni.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Is he a widower? Stephen asked.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ay, a grass one, Myles Crawford said, his eye running down
the typescript. Emperor&apos;s horses. Habsburg. An Irishman saved his life on
the ramparts of Vienna. Don&apos;t you forget! Maximilian Karl O&apos;Donnell,
graf von Tirconnell<a target="foot" id="fgg0061">&ordm;</a> in Ireland.
<a name="un5009ah" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5009ah">Sent his heir over

<p> Professor MacHugh turned on him.</p>

<br> NOBLE MARQUESS MENTIONED</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; We were always loyal to lost causes, the professor said.
Success for us is the death of the intellect and of the imagination. We were
never loyal to the successful. We serve them. I teach the blatant Latin
language. I speak the tongue of a race the acme of whose mentality is the maxim:
time is money. Material domination. <i>Dominus!</i> Lord! Where is the
spirituality? Lord Jesus! Lord
Salisbury?<a target="foot" id="fgg0064">&ordm;</a> A sofa in a westend club. But the Greek!</p>

<p> A smile of light brightened his darkrimmed eyes, lengthened his long lips.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The Greek! he said again. <i>Kyrios!</i> Shining word!
<a name="un4007dn" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4007dn">The vowels the
Semite and the Saxon know not.</a> <i>Kyrie!</i> The radiance of the intellect.
I ought to profess Greek, the language of the mind. <i>Kyrie eleison!</i> The
closetmaker and the cloacamaker will never be lords of our spirit. We are liege
subjects of the catholic chivalry of Europe that foundered at Trafalgar and of
the empire  of the spirit, not an <i>imperium</i>, that went under with the
Athenian fleets at Aegospotami<a target="foot" id="fgg0065">&ordm;</a>. Yes,
yes. They went under. Pyrrhus, misled by an oracle, made a last attempt to
retrieve the fortunes of Greece. Loyal to a lost cause.</p>
<p> He strode away from them towards the window.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; They went forth to battle, Mr O&apos;Madden Burke said greyly, but they always fell.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Boohoo! Lenehan wept with a little noise.

<p> In mourning for Sallust, Mulligan says. Whose mother is beastly dead.</p>
<p> Myles Crawford crammed the sheets into a sidepocket.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That&apos;ll be all right, he said. I&apos;ll read the rest after. That&apos;ll be all right.</p>
<p> Lenehan extended his hands in protest.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; But my riddle! he said. What opera is like a railway

<p class="di">&mdash; Opera? Mr O&apos;Madden Burke&apos;s

<p> Lenehan announced gladly:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>The Rose of
Castile</i><a target="foot" id="fgg0067">&ordm;</a>. See the wheeze? Rows of cast steel. Gee!</p>
<p> He poked Mr O&apos;Madden Burke mildly in the spleen. Mr O&apos;Madden Burke
fell back with grace on his umbrella, feigning a gasp.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Help! he sighed. I feel
<a name="un4052r" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4052r">a strong weakness</a>.</p>
<p> Lenehan, rising to tiptoe, fanned his face rapidly with the rustling tissues.</p>
<p> The professor, returning by way of the files, swept his hand across
Stephen&apos;s and Mr O&apos;Madden Burke&apos;s loose ties.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Paris, past and present, he said. You look like communards.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Like fellows who had blown up the Bastille, J.J.
O&apos;Molloy said in quiet mockery. Or was it you shot the lord lieutenant of
Finland between you? You look as though you had done the deed. General Bobrikoff. </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; We<a target="foot" id="fgg0068">&ordm;</a> were only thinking about it, Stephen said.</p>
<p class="headline">OMNIUM GATHERUM<a target="foot" id="fgg0069">&ordm;</a></p>

<p class="di">&mdash; Literature, the press.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; If Bloom were here, the professor said. The gentle art of advertisement.</p>

<p> Lenehan gave a loud cough.</p>

in emphasis. Wait a minute. We&apos;ll paralyse Europe as Ignatius Gallaher used
to say when he was on the shaughraun, doing

cabled for a special. Remember that time?</p>
<p> Professor MacHugh nodded.</p>

Gumley mind the stones, see they don&apos;t run away. Look at here. What did
Ignatius Gallaher do? I&apos;ll tell you. Inspiration of genius. Cabled right
away. Have you <i>Weekly Freeman</i> of 17 March? Right. Have you got that?</p>
<p> He flung back pages of the files and stuck his finger on a point.</p>

<a name="un7027c" href="../../ff/unbs/un7all.htm#un7027c">divine afflatus</a>, Mr O&apos;Madden Burke said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You like it? J.J. O&apos;Molloy asked Stephen.</p>
<p> Stephen, his blood wooed by grace of language and gesture, blushed. He took
a cigarette from the case. J.J. O&apos;Molloy offered his case to Myles
Crawford. Lenehan lit their cigarettes as before and took his
<a name="un4007ct" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4007ct">trophy</a>, saying:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <a name="un4052at" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4052at">Muchibus thankibus</a>.</p>
<p class="headline"><a name="un5022aa" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5022aa">A MAN OF HIGH MORALE</a></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Professor Magennis was speaking to me about you, J.J.
O&apos;Molloy said to Stephen. What do you think really of that hermetic crowd,
the opal hush poets: A. E. the
mastermystic<a target="foot" id="fgg0095">&ordm;</a>? That Blavatsky woman
started it. She was a nice old bag of tricks. A. E. has been telling some yankee
interviewer that you came to him in the small hours of the morning to ask him
about planes of consciousness. Magennis thinks you must have been pulling A.
E.&apos;s leg. He is a man of the very highest morale, Magennis.</p>
<p> Speaking about me. What did he say? What did he say? What did he say about me? Don&apos;t ask.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; No, thanks, professor MacHugh said, waving the
cigarettecase<a target="foot" id="fgg0096">&ordm;</a> aside. Wait a moment. Let
me say one thing. The finest display of oratory I ever heard was a speech made
by John F. Taylor at the college historical society. Mr Justice Fitzgibbon, the
present lord justice of appeal, had spoken and the paper under debate was an
essay (new for those days)<a target="foot" id="fgg0097">&ordm;</a> advocating the revival of the Irish tongue.</p>
<p> He turned towards Myles Crawford and said:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You know Gerald Fitzgibbon. Then you can imagine the style of his discourse.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He is sitting with
Tim<a target="foot" id="fgg0098">&ordm;</a> Healy, J.J. O&apos;Molloy said,
<a name="un4007dh" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4007dh">rumour has it</a>,
on the Trinity college estates commission.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He is sitting with a sweet thing in a child&apos;s frock, Myles Crawford said. Go on. Well?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It was the speech, mark you, the professor said, of a
finished orator, full of courteous haughtiness and pouring in chastened
diction<a target="foot" id="fgg0099">&ordm;</a> I will not say  the vials of his
wrath but pouring the proud man&apos;s contumely upon the new movement. It was
then a new movement. We were weak, therefore worthless.</p>
<p> He closed his long thin lips an instant but, eager to be on, raised an
outspanned hand to his spectacles and, with trembling thumb and ringfinger
touching lightly the black rims, steadied them to a new focus.</p>
<p class="headline"><a name="un5022ab" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5022ab">IMPROMPTU</a></p>
<p> In ferial tone he addressed J.J. O&apos;Molloy:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Taylor had come there, you must know, from a sick bed.
That he had prepared his speech I do not believe for there was not even one
<a name="un4052ai" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4052ai">shorthandwriter</a>
in the hall. His dark lean face had a growth of shaggy beard round it. He wore a
loose neckcloth and altogether he looked (though he was not) a dying man.</p>
<p> His gaze turned at once but slowly from J.J. O&apos;Molloy&apos;s towards
Stephen&apos;s face and then bent at once to the ground, seeking. His unglazed
linen collar appeared behind his bent head, soiled by his withering hair. Still seeking, he said:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; When Fitzgibbon&apos;s speech had ended John F. Taylor
rose to reply.
<a name="un4052ae" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4052ae">Briefly</a>, as well
as I can bring them to mind, his words were these.</p>
<p> He raised his head firmly. His eyes bethought themselves once more. Witless
shellfish swam in the gross lenses to and fro, seeking outlet.</p>
<p> He began:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>Mr chairman, ladies and gentlemen:</i>
<a name="un6007c" href="../../ff/unbs/un6all.htm#un6007c"><i>Great was my
admiration</i></a> <i>in listening to the remarks addressed to the youth of
Ireland a moment since by my learned friend. It
seemed</i><a target="foot" id="fgg0100">&ordm;</a> <i>to me that I had been
transported into a country far away from this country, into an age remote from
this age, that I stood in ancient Egypt and that I was listening to the speech
of some highpriest of that land addressed to the youthful Moses.</i></p>
<p> His listeners held their cigarettes poised to hear, their smokes ascending
in frail stalks that flowered with his speech. <i>And let our crooked
smokes</i>. Noble words coming. Look out. Could you try your hand at it yourself?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>And it seemed to me that I heard the voice of that
Egyptian highpriest raised in a tone of like haughtiness and like pride. I heard
his words and their meaning was revealed to me.</i></p>
<p class="headline"><a name="un5022ac" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5022ac">FROM THE FATHERS</a></p>
<p> It was revealed to me that those things are good which yet are corrupted
which neither if they were supremely good nor unless they were
good<a target="foot" id="fgg0101">&ordm;</a> could be corrupted. Ah, curse you! That&apos;s saint Augustine. </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>Why will you jews not accept our culture, our religion
and our language? You are a tribe of nomad
herdsmen:</i><a target="foot" id="fgg0102">&ordm;</a> <i>we are a mighty people.
You have no cities nor no wealth: our cities are hives of humanity and our
galleys, trireme</i><a target="foot" id="fgg0103">&ordm;</a> <i>and quadrireme,
laden with all manner merchandise furrow the waters of the known globe</i>.
<i>You have but emerged from primitive conditions: we have a literature, a
priesthood, an agelong history and a polity.</i></p>
<p> Nile.</p>
<p> Child, man, effigy.</p>
<p> By the Nilebank the babemaries kneel, cradle of bulrushes: a man supple in
combat: stonehorned, stonebearded, heart of stone.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>You pray to a local and obscure idol: our temples,
majestic and mysterious, are the abodes of Isis and Osiris, of Horus and Ammon
Ra. Yours serfdom, awe and humbleness:
<a name="un4007cf" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4007cf">ours thunder and the
seas</a>.</i>
<a name="un5009an" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5009an"><i>Israel is weak
and few are her children: Egypt is an host and terrible are her arms.</i></a>
<i>Vagrants and daylabourers are you called: the world trembles at our name.</i></p>
<p> A dumb belch of hunger cleft his speech. He lifted his voice above it boldly:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>But, ladies and gentlemen, had the youthful Moses
listened to and accepted that view of life, had he bowed his head and bowed his
will and bowed his spirit before that arrogant admonition he would never have
brought the chosen people out of their house of
bondage,</i><a target="foot" id="fgg0104">&ordm;</a> <i>nor followed the pillar
of the cloud by day. He would never have spoken with the Eternal amid lightnings
on Sinai&apos;s mountaintop nor ever have come down with the light of
inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the tables of the
law, graven in the language of the outlaw.</i></p>
<p> He ceased and looked at them, enjoying silence.</p>
<p class="headline"><a name="un5022ad" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5022ad">OMINOUS</a> &mdash; FOR HIM!</p>
<p> J.J. O&apos;Molloy said not without regret:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And yet he died without having entered the land of promise.</p>

at &ndash; the &ndash; moment &ndash; though &ndash; from &ndash; lingering
&ndash; illness &ndash; often &ndash; previously &ndash; expectorated &ndash;
demise, Lenehan said. And with a great future behind him.</p>
<p> The troop of bare feet was heard rushing along the hallway and pattering up the staircase.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That is oratory, the professor said, uncontradicted.</p>
<p> Gone with the wind. Hosts at Mullaghmast and Tara of the kings.  Miles of
ears of porches. The tribune&apos;s words howled and scattered
<a name="un4007dm" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4007dm">to the four

<p> I have money.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Gentlemen, Stephen said. As the next motion on the

suggest that the house do now adjourn?</p>

<p> Mr O&apos;Madden Burke, following close, said with an ally&apos;s lunge of his umbrella:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Lay on, Macduff!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Chip of the old block! the editor cried, slapping Stephen
on the shoulder. Let us go. Where are those blasted keys?</p>
<p> He fumbled in his pocket, pulling out the crushed typesheets.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Foot and mouth. I know. That&apos;ll be all right.
That&apos;ll go in. Where are they? That&apos;s all right<a target="foot" id="fgg0107">&ordm;</a>.</p>
<p> He thrust the sheets back and went into the inner office.</p>
<p class="headline">LET US <a name="un5022ae" href="../../ff/unbs/un5all.htm#un5022ae">HOPE</a></p>
<p> J.J. O&apos;Molloy, about to follow him in, said quietly to Stephen:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I hope you will live to see it published. Myles, one moment.</p>
<p> He went into the inner office, closing the door behind him.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Come along, Stephen, the professor said. That is fine,
isn&apos;t it? It has the prophetic vision.

<p> The first newsboy came pattering down the stairs at their heels and rushed out into the street, yelling:</p>

<p> Dublin. <a name="un4007de" href="../../ff/unbs/un4all.htm#un4007de">I have much, much to learn.</a></p>

<p class="di">&mdash; Yes?<a target="foot" id="fgg0108">&ordm;</a> the professor
said, skipping to get into step. Crawford will follow.</p>
<p> Another newsboy shot past them, yelling as he ran:</p>

in<a target="foot" id="fgg0110">&ordm;</a> a red tin letterbox moneybox. They
shake out the threepenny bits and a sixpence and coax out the pennies with the
blade of a knife. Two and three in silver and one and seven in coppers. They put
on their bonnets and best clothes and take their umbrellas for fear it may come on to rain.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Wise virgins, professor MacHugh said.</p>
<p class="headline">LIFE ON THE RAW</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; They buy one and fourpenceworth of brawn and four slices
of panloaf at the north city diningrooms<a target="foot" id="fgg0111">&ordm;</a>
in Marlborough street from Miss Kate Collins,
proprietress.<a target="foot" id="fgg0112">&ordm;</a> They purchase four and
twenty ripe plums from a girl at the foot of Nelson&apos;s pillar to take off
the thirst of the brawn. They give two threepenny bits to the gentleman at the
turnstile and begin to waddle slowly up the winding staircase, grunting,
encouraging each other, afraid of the dark, panting, one asking the other have
you the brawn, praising God and the Blessed Virgin, threatening to come down,
peeping at the airslits. Glory be to God. They had no idea it was that high.</p>
<p> Their names are Anne Kearns and Florence MacCabe. Anne Kearns has the
lumbago for which she rubs on Lourdes water given her by a lady who got a
 bottleful from a passionist father. Florence MacCabe takes a crubeen and a
bottle of double X for supper every Saturday.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Antithesis, the professor said, nodding twice.

<p class="headline">INTERVIEW WITH THE EDITOR</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Just this ad, Mr Bloom said, pushing through towards the

just now. He&apos;ll give a renewal for two months, he says. After he&apos;ll
see. But he wants a par to call attention in the <i>Telegraph</i> too, the
Saturday pink. And he wants it if it&apos;s not too late I told councillor
Nannetti from the <i>Kilkenny People.</i> I can have access to it in the
national library. House of keys, don&apos;t you see? His name is Keyes.
It&apos;s a play on the name. But he practically promised he&apos;d give the
