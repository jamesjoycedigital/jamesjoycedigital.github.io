<p class="di">&mdash; Just cut it out, will you? Mr Bloom said, and I&apos;ll
take it round to the <i>Telegraph</i> office.</p>
<p> The door of Ruttledge&apos;s office creaked again. Davy Stephens, minute in
a large capecoat, a small felt hat crowning his ringlets, passed out with a roll
of papers under his cape, a king&apos;s courier.</p>
<p> Red Murray&apos;s long shears sliced out the advertisement from the
newspaper in four clean strokes. Scissors and paste.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I&apos;ll go through the printing works, Mr Bloom said, taking the cut square.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Of course, if he wants a par, Red Murray said earnestly, a
pen behind his ear, we can do him one.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Right, Mr Bloom said with a nod. I&apos;ll rub that in.</p>

<p> The door of Ruttledge&apos;s office whispered: ee: cree. They always build
one door opposite another for the wind to. Way in. Way out.</p>
<p> Our Saviour: beardframed oval face: talking in the dusk. Mary, Martha.
Steered by an umbrella sword to the footlights: Mario the tenor.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Or like Mario, Mr Bloom said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, Red Murray agreed. But Mario was said to be the picture of Our Saviour.</p>

<p> Mr Bloom said slowly:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Well, he is one of our saviours also.</p>
<p> A meek smile accompanied him as he lifted the counterflap, as he passed in
through the sidedoor and along the warm dark stairs and passage, along the now
reverberating boards. Thumping, thumping.</p>
<p> He pushed in the glass swingdoor and entered, stepping over strewn packing
paper. Through a lane of clanking drums he made his way towards Nannetti&apos;s reading closet.</p>

<p> Soon be calling him my lord mayor. Long John is backing him they say.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 135}</font> </p>
<p> The foreman, without answering, scribbled press on a corner of the sheet and
made a sign to a typesetter. He handed the sheet silently over the dirty glass screen.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Right: thanks, Hynes said moving off.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom stood in his way.</p>

said, pointing backward with his thumb.</p>

<p class="di">&mdash; Mm, Mr Bloom said. Look sharp and you&apos;ll catch him.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Thanks, old man, Hynes said. I&apos;ll tap him too.</p>
<p> He hurried on eagerly towards the <i>Freeman&apos;s Journal</i>.</p>
<p> Three bob I lent him in Meagher&apos;s. Three weeks. Third hint.</p>
<p class="headline">WE SEE THE CANVASSER AT WORK</p>
<p> Mr Bloom laid his cutting on Mr Nannetti&apos;s desk.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Excuse me, councillor, he said. This ad, you see. Keyes, you remember.</p>
<p> Mr Nannetti considered the cutting awhile and nodded.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He wants it in for July, Mr Bloom said.</p>
<p> The foreman moved his pencil towards it.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; But wait, Mr Bloom said. He wants it changed. Keyes, you see. He wants two keys at the top.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 116}</font> </p>
<p> Hell of a racket they make. He doesn&apos;t hear it. Nannan. Iron nerves. Maybe he understands what I.</p>
<p> The foreman turned round to hear patiently and, lifting an elbow, began to
scratch slowly in the armpit of his alpaca jacket.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Like that, Mr Bloom said, crossing his forefingers at the top.</p>
<p> Let him take that in first.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom, glancing sideways up from the cross he had made, saw the
foreman&apos;s sallow face, think he has a touch of jaundice, and beyond the
obedient reels feeding in huge webs of paper. Clank it. Clank it. Miles of it
unreeled. What becomes of it after? O, wrap up meat, parcels: various uses, thousand and one things.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 136}</font> </p>
<p> Slipping his words deftly into the pauses of the clanking he drew swiftly on the scarred woodwork.</p>
<p class="headline">HOUSE OF KEY(E)S</p>

the name. Alexander Keyes, tea, wine and spirit merchant. So on.</p>
<p> Better not teach him his own business.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You know yourself, councillor, just what he wants. Then
round the top in leaded: the house of keys. You see? Do you think that&apos;s a good idea?</p>
<p> The foreman moved his scratching hand to his lower ribs and scratched there quietly.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The idea, Mr Bloom said, is the house of keys. You know,
councillor, the Manx parliament. Innuendo of home rule. Tourists, you know, from
the isle of Man. Catches the eye, you see. Can you do that?</p>
<p> I could ask him perhaps about how to pronounce that <i>voglio</i>. But then
if he didn&apos;t know only make it awkward for him. Better not.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; We can do that, the foreman said. Have you the design?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I can get it, Mr Bloom said. It was in a Kilkenny paper.
He has a house there too. I&apos;ll just run out and ask him. Well, you can do
that and just a little par calling attention. You know the usual. Highclass licensed premises. Longfelt want. So on.</p>
<p> The foreman thought for an instant.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; We can do that, he said. Let him give us a three months&apos; renewal.</p>
<p> A typesetter brought him a limp galleypage. He began to check it silently.
Mr Bloom stood by, hearing the loud throbs of cranks, watching the silent typesetters at their cases.

<br> must have put through his hands in his time: obituary notices, pubs&apos;

Then the twelve brothers, Jacob&apos;s sons. And then the lamb and the cat and

kills the butcher and he kills the ox and the dog kills the cat. Sounds a bit
silly till you come to look into it well. Justice it means but it&apos;s
everybody eating everyone else. That&apos;s what life is after all. How quickly
he does that job. Practice makes perfect. Seems to see with his fingers.</p>
<p> Mr Bloom passed on out of the clanking noises through the gallery on to the
landing. Now am I going to tram it out all the way and then catch him out
perhaps. Better phone him up first. Number? Same as Citron&apos;s house. Twentyeight. Twentyeight double four.</p>
<p class="headline">ONLY ONCE MORE THAT SOAP</p>

walls with matches? Looks as if they did it for a bet. Heavy greasy smell there
always is in those works. Lukewarm glue in Thom&apos;s next door when I was there.</p>
<p> He took out his handkerchief to dab his nose. Citronlemon? Ah, the soap I
put there. Lose it out of that pocket. Putting back his

<p> He entered softly.</p>
<p class="headline">ERIN, GREEN GEM OF THE SILVER SEA</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The ghost walks, professor MacHugh murmured softly, biscuitfully to the dusty windowpane.</p>
<p> Mr Dedalus, staring from the empty fireplace at Ned Lambert&apos;s quizzing face, asked of it sourly:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Agonising Christ, wouldn&apos;t it give you a heartburn on your arse?</p>
<p> Ned Lambert, seated on the table, read on:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>Or again, note the meanderings of some purling rill as
it babbles on its way, fanned by gentlest zephyrs tho&apos; quarrelling with the
stony obstacles, to the tumbling waters of Neptune&apos;s blue domain, &apos;mid

o&apos;er its pensive bosom by the overarching leafage of the giants of the
forest.</i> What about that, Simon? he asked over the fringe of his newspaper. How&apos;s that for high?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Changing his drink, Mr Dedalus said.</p>
<p> Ned Lambert, laughing, struck the newspaper on his knees, repeating:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>The pensive bosom and the overarsing leafage.</i> O boys! O boys!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And Xenophon looked upon Marathon, Mr Dedalus said,
looking again on the fireplace and to the window, and Marathon looked on the sea.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That will do, professor MacHugh cried from the window. I
don&apos;t want to hear any more of the stuff.</p>
<p> He ate off the crescent of water biscuit he had been nibbling and,
<br><font color="green">{u21, 140}</font>
<br> hungered, made ready to nibble the biscuit in his other hand.</p>
<p> High falutin stuff. Bladderbags. Ned Lambert is taking a day off I see.

<p class="di">&mdash; Is it his speech last night? Mr Bloom asked.</p>

<p> J.J. O&apos;Molloy strolled to the sloping desk and began to turn back the pink pages of the file.</p>

pleaded. <i>Or again if we but climb the serried mountain peaks</i>&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

shite and onions! That&apos;ll do, Ned. Life is too short.</p>
<p> He took off his silk hat and, blowing out impatiently his bushy moustache,
welshcombed his hair with raking fingers.</p>
<p> Ned Lambert tossed the newspaper aside, chuckling with delight. An instant
after a hoarse bark of laughter burst over professor MacHugh&apos;s unshaven blackspectacled face.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Doughy Daw! he cried.

<p class="headline">WHAT WETHERUP SAID</p>
<p> All very fine to jeer at it now in cold print but it goes down like hot cake

<p> The inner door was opened violently and a scarlet beaked face, crested by a
comb of feathery hair, thrust itself in. The bold blue eyes stared about them and the harsh voice asked:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What is it?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And here comes the sham squire himself, professor MacHugh said grandly.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Getonouthat, you bloody old pedagogue! the editor said in recognition.

<p class="di">&mdash; Come, Ned, Mr Dedalus said, putting on his hat. I must get a drink after that.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Drink! the editor cried. No drinks served before mass.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Quite right too, Mr Dedalus said, going out. Come on, Ned.</p>
<p> Ned Lambert sidled down from the table. The editor&apos;s blue eyes roved
towards Mr Bloom&apos;s face, shadowed by a smile.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Will you join us, Myles? Ned Lambert asked.</p>
<p class="headline">MEMORABLE BATTLES RECALLED</p>

<p class="di">&mdash; In Ohio! the editor shouted.</p>

<p> Passing out, he whispered to J.J. O&apos;Molloy:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Incipient jigs. Sad case.</p>

<p> Screams of newsboys barefoot in the hall rushed near and the door was flung open.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Hush, Lenehan said. I hear feetstoops.</p>
<p> Professor MacHugh strode across the room and seized the cringing urchin by
the collar as the others scampered out of the hall and down the steps. The
tissues rustled up in the draught, floated softly in the air blue scrawls and under the table came to earth.</p>

<p class="di">&mdash; Throw him out and shut the door, the editor said. There&apos;s a hurricane blowing.</p>
<p> Lenehan began to paw the tissues up from the floor, grunting as he stooped twice.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 124}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Waiting for the racing special, sir, the newsboy said. It was Pat Farrell shoved me in, sir.</p>
<p> He pointed to two faces peering in round the doorframe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Him, sir.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Out of this with you, professor MacHugh said gruffly.</p>
<p> He hustled the boy out and banged the door to.</p>
<p> J.J. O&apos;Molloy turned the files crackingly over, murmuring, seeking:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Continued on page six, column four.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes&nbsp;&hellip; <i>Evening Telegraph</i> here, Mr Bloom phoned from the
<br><font color="green">{u21, 145}</font>
<br> inner office. Is the boss&nbsp;&hellip;? Yes,
<i>Telegraph</i>&nbsp;&hellip; To where?&nbsp;&hellip; Aha! Which auction
rooms?&nbsp;&hellip; Aha! I see&nbsp;&hellip; Right. I&apos;ll catch him.</p>
<p class="headline">A COLLISION ENSUES</p>
<p> The bell whirred again as he rang off. He came in quickly and bumped against
Lenehan who was struggling up with the second tissue.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>Pardon, monsieur</i>, Lenehan said, clutching him for an instant and making a grimace.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; My fault, Mr Bloom said, suffering his grip. Are you hurt? I&apos;m in a hurry.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Knee, Lenehan said.</p>
<p> He made a comic face and whined, rubbing his knee:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The accumulation of the <i>anno Domini</i>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Sorry, Mr Bloom said.</p>
<p> He went to the door and, holding it ajar, paused. J.J. O&apos;Molloy slapped
the heavy pages over. The noise of two shrill voices, a mouthorgan, echoed in
the bare hallway from the newsboys squatted on the doorsteps:</p>
<p class="diset">&mdash; <i>We are the boys of Wexford</i>
<br> <i>Who fought with heart and hand.</i></p>
<p class="headline">EXIT BLOOM</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I&apos;m just running round to Bachelor&apos;s walk, Mr
Bloom said, about this ad of Keyes&apos;s. Want to fix it up. They tell me he&apos;s round there in Dillon&apos;s.</p>
<p> He looked indecisively for a moment at their faces. The editor who,
<br><font color="green">{u22, 125}</font>
<br> leaning against the mantelshelf, had propped his head on his hand, suddenly stretched forth an arm amply.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Begone! he said. The world is before you.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Back in no time, Mr Bloom said, hurrying out.</p>
<p> J.J. O&apos;Molloy took the tissues from Lenehan&apos;s hand and read them,
blowing them apart gently, without comment.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 146}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He&apos;ll get that advertisement, the professor said,
staring through his blackrimmed spectacles over the crossblind. Look at the young scamps after him.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Show. Where? Lenehan cried, running to the window.</p>
<p class="headline">A STREET CORT&Egrave;GE</p>
<p> Both smiled over the crossblind at the file of capering newsboys in Mr
Bloom&apos;s wake, the last zigzagging white on the breeze a mocking kite, a tail of white bowknots.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Look at the young guttersnipe behind him hue and cry,
Lenehan said, and you&apos;ll kick. O, my rib risible! Taking off his flat
spaugs and the walk. Small nines. Steal upon larks.</p>
<p> He began to mazurka in swift caricature across the floor on sliding feet
past the fireplace to J.J. O&apos;Molloy who placed the tissues in his receiving hands.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What&apos;s that? Myles Crawford said with a start. Where are the other two gone?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who? the professor said, turning. They&apos;re gone round
to the Oval for a drink. Paddy Hooper is there. Came over last night.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Come on then, Myles Crawford said. Where&apos;s my hat?</p>
<p> He walked jerkily into the office behind, parting the vent of his jacket,
jingling his keys in his back pocket. They jingled then in the air and against
the wood as he locked his desk drawer.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He&apos;s pretty well on, professor MacHugh said in a low voice.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Seems to be, J.J. O&apos;Molloy said, taking out a
cigarette case in murmuring meditation, but it is not always as it seems. Who has the most matches?</p>
<p class="headline">THE CALUMET OF PEACE</p>
<p> He offered a cigarette to the professor and took one himself. Lenehan
promptly struck a match for them and lit their cigarettes in turn. J.J.
O&apos;Molloy opened his case again and offered it.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 147}</font>
<br><font color="green">{u22, 126}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>Thanky vous</i>, Lenehan said, helping himself.</p>
<p> The editor came from the inner office, a straw hat awry on his brow. He
declaimed in song, pointing sternly at professor MacHugh:</p>
<p class="diset">&mdash; <i>&apos;Twas rank and fame that tempted thee,</i>
<br> <i>&apos;Twas empire charmed thy heart.</i></p>
<p> The professor grinned, locking his long lips.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Eh? You bloody old Roman empire? Myles Crawford said.</p>
<p> He took a cigarette from the open case. Lenehan, lighting it for him with quick grace, said:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Silence for my brandnew riddle!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>Imperium romanum</i>, J.J. O&apos;Molloy said gently.
It sounds nobler than British or Brixton. The word reminds one somehow of fat in the fire.</p>
<p> Myles Crawford blew his first puff violently towards the ceiling.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That&apos;s it, he said. We are the fat. You and I are the
fat in the fire. We haven&apos;t got the chance of a snowball in hell.</p>
<p class="headline">THE GRANDEUR THAT WAS ROME</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Wait a moment, professor MacHugh said, raising two quiet
claws. We mustn&apos;t be led away by words, by sounds of words. We think of Rome, imperial, imperious, imperative.</p>
<p> He extended elocutionary arms from frayed stained shirtcuffs, pausing:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What was their civilisation? Vast, I allow: but vile.
Cloacae: sewers. The jews in the wilderness and on the mountaintop said: <i>It
is meet to be here. Let us build an altar to Jehovah</i>. The Roman, like the
Englishman who follows in his footsteps, brought to every new shore on which he
set his foot (on our shore he never set it) only his cloacal obsession. He gazed
about him in his toga and he said: <i>It is meet to be here. Let us construct a watercloset.</i></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Which they accordingly did do, Lenehan said, Our old
ancient ancestors, as we read in the first chapter of Guinness&apos;s, were partial to the running stream.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 148}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; They were nature&apos;s gentlemen, J.J. O&apos;Molloy murmured. But we have also Roman law.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And Pontius Pilate is its prophet, professor MacHugh responded.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 127}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Do you know that story about chief baron Palles? J.J.
O&apos;Molloy asked. It was at the royal university dinner. Everything was going swimmingly&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; First my riddle, Lenehan said. Are you ready?</p>
<p> Mr O&apos;Madden Burke, tall in copious grey of Donegal tweed, came in from
the hallway. Stephen Dedalus, behind him, uncovered as he entered.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>Entrez, mes enfants!</i> Lenehan cried.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I escort a suppliant, Mr O&apos;Madden Burke said
melodiously.
<font color="red"><sup><small>|9</small></sup></font><font color="black">Youth

<p class="di">&mdash; How do you do? the editor said, holding out a hand. Come in. Your governor is just gone.</p>
<p class="headline">?&nbsp;?&nbsp;?</p>
<p> Lenehan said to all:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Silence! What opera resembles a railway line? Reflect, ponder, excogitate, reply.</p>
<p> Stephen handed over the typed sheets, pointing to the title and signature.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Who? the editor asked.</p>
<p> Bit torn off.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Mr Garrett Deasy, Stephen said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That old pelters, the editor said. Who tore it? Was he short taken?</p>
<p class="set"><i>On swift sail flaming</i>
<br> <i>From storm and south</i>
<br> <i>He comes, pale vampire,</i>
<br> <i>Mouth to my mouth.</i></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Good day, Stephen, the professor said, coming to peer over
their shoulders. Foot and mouth? Are you turned&nbsp;&hellip;?</p>
<p> Bullockbefriending bard.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 149}</font> </p>
<p class="headline">SHINDY IN WELLKNOWN RESTAURANT</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Good day, sir, Stephen answered, blushing. The letter is
not mine. Mr Garrett Deasy asked me to&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O, I know him, Myles Crawford said, and knew his wife too.
The bloodiest old tartar God ever made. By Jesus, she had the foot and mouth
<br><font color="green">{u22, 128}</font>
<br> disease and no mistake! The night she threw the soup in the waiter&apos;s face in the Star and Garter. Oho!</p>
<p> A woman brought sin into the world. For Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus,
ten years the Greeks. O&apos;Rourke, prince of Breffni.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Is he a widower? Stephen asked.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ay, a grass one, Myles Crawford said, his eye running down
the typescript. Emperor&apos;s horses. Habsburg. An Irishman saved his life on
the ramparts of Vienna. Don&apos;t you forget! Maximilian Karl O&apos;Donnell,
graf von Tirconnell in Ireland. Wild geese. O yes, every time. Don&apos;t you forget that!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The moot point is did he forget it, J.J. O&apos;Molloy
said quietly, turning a horseshoe paperweight. Saving princes is a thankyou job.</p>
<p> Professor MacHugh turned on him.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And if not? he said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I&apos;ll tell you how it was, Myles Crawford began. A Hungarian it was one day&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="headline">LOST CAUSES
<br> NOBLE MARQUESS MENTIONED</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; We were always loyal to lost causes, the professor said.
Success for us is the death of the intellect and of the imagination. We were
never loyal to the successful. We serve them. I teach the blatant Latin
language. I speak the tongue of a race the acme of whose mentality is the maxim:
time is money. Material domination. <i>Dominus!</i> Lord! Where is the
spirituality? Lord Jesus! Lord Salisbury? A sofa in a westend club. But the Greek!
<br><font color="green">{u21, 150}</font> </p>
<p class="headline">KYRIE ELEISON!</p>
<p> A smile of light brightened his darkrimmed eyes, his long lips.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The Greek! he said again. <i>Kyrios!</i> Shining word! The
vowels the Semite and the Saxon know not. <i>Kyrie!</i> The radiance of the
intellect. I ought to profess Greek, the language of the mind. <i>Kyrie
eleison!</i> The closetmaker and the cloacamaker will never be lords of our
spirit. We are liege subjects of the catholic chivalry of Europe that foundered at Trafalgar and of the empire
<br><font color="green">{u22, 129}</font>
<br> of the spirit, not an <i>imperium</i>, that went under with the Athenian
fleets at Aegospotami. Yes, yes. They went under. Pyrrhus, misled by an oracle,
made a last attempt to retrieve the fortunes of Greece. Loyal to a lost cause.</p>
<p> He strode away from them towards the window.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; They went forth to battle, Mr O&apos;Madden Burke said greyly, but they always fell.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Boohoo! Lenehan wept with a little noise. Poor, poor, poor Pyrrhus!</p>
<p> He whispered then near Stephen&apos;s ear:</p>
<p class="headline">LENEHAN&apos;S LIMERICK</p>
<p class="diset">&mdash; <i>There&apos;s a ponderous pundit MacHugh</i>
<br> <i>Who wears goggles of ebony hue.</i>
<br> <i>As he mostly sees double</i>
<br> <i>To wear them why trouble?</i>
<br> <i>I can&apos;t see the Joe Miller. Can you?</i></p>
<p> In mourning for Sallust, Mulligan says. Whose mother is beastly dead.</p>
<p> Myles Crawford crammed the sheets into a sidepocket.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That&apos;ll be all right, he said. I&apos;ll read the rest after. That&apos;ll be all right.</p>
<p> Lenehan extended his hands in protest.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; But my riddle! he said. What opera is like a railway line?
<br><font color="green">{u21, 151}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Opera? Mr O&apos;Madden Burke&apos;s sphinx face repeated.</p>
<p> Lenehan announced gladly:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>The Rose of Castile</i>. See the wheeze? Rows of cast steel. Gee!</p>
<p> He poked Mr O&apos;Madden Burke mildly in the spleen. Mr O&apos;Madden Burke
fell back with grace on his umbrella, feigning a gasp.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Help! he sighed. I feel a strong weakness.</p>
<p> Lenehan, rising to tiptoe, fanned his face rapidly with the rustling tissues.</p>
<p> The professor, returning by way of the files, swept his hand across
Stephen&apos;s and Mr O&apos;Madden Burke&apos;s loose ties.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Paris, past and present, he said. You look like communards.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Like fellows who had blown up the Bastille, J.J.
O&apos;Molloy said in quiet mockery. Or was it you shot the lord lieutenant of
Finland between you? You look as though you had done the deed. General Bobrikoff.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 130}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; We were only thinking about it, Stephen said.</p>
<p class="headline">OMNIUM GATHERUM</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; All the talents, Myles Crawford said. Law, the classics&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The turf, Lenehan put in.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Literature, the press.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; If Bloom were here, the professor said. The gentle art of advertisement.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And Madam Bloom, Mr O&apos;Madden Burke added. The vocal muse. Dublin&apos;s prime favourite.</p>
<p> Lenehan gave a loud cough.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ahem! he said very softly. O, for a fresh of breath air! I
caught a cold in the park. The gate was open.</p>
<p class="headline">&laquo;YOU CAN DO IT!&raquo;</p>
<p> The editor laid a nervous hand on Stephen&apos;s shoulder.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I want you to write something for me, he said. Something with a
<br><font color="green">{u21, 152}</font>
<br> bite in it. You can do it. I see it in your face. In the lexicon of youth&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p> See it in your face. See it in your eye. Lazy idle little schemer.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Foot and mouth disease! the editor cried in scornful
invective. Great nationalist meeting in Borris-in-Ossory. All balls! Bulldosing
the public! Give them something with a bite in it. Put us all into it, damn its
soul. Father, Son and Holy Ghost

<p class="di">&mdash; We can all supply mental pabulum, Mr O&apos;Madden Burke said.</p>
<p> Stephen raised his eyes to the bold unheeding stare.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He wants you for the pressgang, J.J. O&apos;Molloy said.</p>
<p class="headline">THE GREAT GALLAHER</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You can do it, Myles Crawford repeated, clenching his hand
in emphasis. Wait a minute. We&apos;ll paralyse Europe as Ignatius Gallaher used
to say when he was on the shaughraun, doing billiardmarking in the Clarence.
Gallaher, that was a pressman for you. That was a pen. You know how he made his
mark? I&apos;ll tell you. That was the smartest piece of journalism ever known.
That was in eightyone, sixth of May, time of the invincibles, murder in the
Phoenix park, before you were born, I suppose. I&apos;ll show you.</p>
<p> He pushed past them to the files.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 131}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Look at here, he said, turning. The <i>New York World</i>
cabled for a special. Remember that time?</p>
<p> Professor MacHugh nodded.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>New York World</i>, the editor said, excitedly pushing
back his straw hat. Where it took place. Tim Kelly, or Kavanagh I mean, Joe
Brady and the rest of them. Where Skin-the-goat drove the car. Whole route, see?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Skin-the-goat, Mr O&apos;Madden Burke said. Fitzharris. He
has that cabman&apos;s shelter, they say, down there at Butt bridge. Holohan told me. You know Holohan?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Hop and carry one, is it? Myles Crawford said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And poor Gumley is down there too, so he told me, minding
stones for the corporation. A nightwatchman.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 153}</font> </p>
<p> Stephen turned in surprise.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Gumley? he said. You don&apos;t say so? A friend of my father&apos;s, is he?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Never mind Gumley, Myles Crawford cried angrily. Let
Gumley mind the stones, see they don&apos;t run away. Look at here. What did
Ignatius Gallaher do? I&apos;ll tell you. Inspiration of genius. Cabled right
away. Have you <i>Weekly Freeman</i> of 17 March? Right. Have you got that?</p>
<p> He flung back pages of the files and stuck his finger on a point.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Take page four, advertisement for Bransome&apos;s coffee,
let us say. Have you got that? Right.</p>
<p> The telephone whirred.</p>
<p class="headline">A DISTANT VOICE</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I&apos;ll answer it, the professor said, going.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; B is parkgate. Good.</p>
<p> His finger leaped and struck point after point, vibrating.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; T is viceregal lodge. C is where murder took place. K is Knockmaroon gate.</p>
<p> The loose flesh of his neck shook like a cock&apos;s wattles. An illstarched
dicky jutted up and with a rude gesture he thrust it back into his waistcoat.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Hello? <i>Evening Telegraph</i> here&nbsp;&hellip;
Hello?&nbsp;&hellip; Who&apos;s there?&nbsp;&hellip; Yes&nbsp;&hellip; Yes&nbsp;&hellip; Yes.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; F to P is the route Skin-the-goat drove the car for an

P. Got that? X is Davy&apos;s publichouse in upper Leeson street.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 132}</font> </p>
<p> The professor came to the inner door.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Bloom is at the telephone, he said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Tell him go to hell, the editor said promptly. X is Burke&apos;s publichouse, see?

<p class="headline">CLEVER, VERY</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Clever, Lenehan said. Very.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Gave it to them on a hot plate, Myles Crawford said, the whole bloody history.</p>
<p> Nightmare from which you will never awake.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I saw it, the editor said proudly. I was present. Dick
Adams, the besthearted bloody Corkman the Lord ever put the breath of life in, and myself.</p>
<p> Lenehan bowed to a shape of air, announcing:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Madam, I&apos;m Adam. And Able was I ere I saw Elba.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; History! Myles Crawford cried. The Old Woman of
Prince&apos;s street was there first. There was weeping and gnashing of teeth
over that. Out of an advertisement. Gregor Gray made the design for it. That
gave him the leg up. Then Paddy Hooper worked Tay Pay who took him on to the
<i>Star</i>. Now he&apos;s got in with Blumenfeld. That&apos;s press.
That&apos;s talent. Pyatt! He was all their daddies!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The father of scare journalism, Lenehan confirmed, and the brother-in-law of Chris Callinan.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Hello?&nbsp;&hellip; Are you there?&nbsp;&hellip; Yes,
he&apos;s here still. Come across yourself.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Where do you find a pressman like that now, eh? the editor cried.</p>
<p> He flung the pages down.</p>

<p> Professor MacHugh came from the inner office.</p>

some hawkers were up before the recorder&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O yes, J.J. O&apos;Molloy said eagerly. Lady Dudley was

<p class="di">&mdash; Well, J.J. O&apos;Molloy said, Bushe K.C., for example.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Bushe? the editor said. Well, yes: Bushe, yes. He has a
strain of it in his blood. Kendal Bushe or I mean Seymour Bushe.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He would have been on the bench long ago, the professor
said, only for&nbsp;&hellip; But no matter.</p>
<p> J.J. O&apos;Molloy turned to Stephen and said quietly and slowly:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; One of the most polished periods I think I ever listened

<p> By the way how did he find that out? He died in his sleep. Or the other story, beast with two backs?</p>

<p class="headline">ITALIA, MAGISTRA ARTIUM</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He spoke on the law of evidence, J.J. O&apos;Molloy said,

<p class="di">&mdash; Ha.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A few wellchosen words, Lenehan prefaced. Silence!</p>
<p> Pause. J.J. O&apos;Molloy took out his cigarettecase.</p>
<p> False lull. Something quite ordinary.</p>
<p> Messenger took out his matchbox thoughtfully and lit his cigar.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 157}</font> </p>
<p> I have often thought since on looking back over that strange time that it
was that small act, trivial in itself, that striking of that match, that
determined the whole aftercourse of both our lives.</p>
<p class="headline">A POLISHED PERIOD</p>
<p> J.J. O&apos;Molloy resumed, moulding his words:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He said of it: <i>that stony effigy in frozen music,
horned and terrible, of the human form divine, that eternal symbol of wisdom and of prophecy which, if aught</i>
<br><font color="green">{u22, 135}</font>
<br> <i>that the imagination or the hand of sculptor has wrought in marble of
soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live, deserves to live.</i></p>
<p> His slim hand with a wave graced echo and fall.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Fine! Myles Crawford said at once.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The divine afflatus, Mr O&apos;Madden Burke said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You like it? J.J. O&apos;Molloy asked Stephen.</p>
<p> Stephen, his blood wooed by grace of language and gesture, blushed. He took
a cigarette from the case. J.J. O&apos;Molloy offered his case to Myles
Crawford. Lenehan lit their cigarettes as before and took his trophy, saying:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Muchibus thankibus.</p>
<p class="headline">A MAN OF HIGH MORALE</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Professor Magennis was speaking to me about you, J.J.
O&apos;Molloy said to Stephen. What do you think really of that hermetic crowd,
the opal hush poets: A. E. the mastermystic? That Blavatsky woman started it.
She was a nice old bag of tricks. A. E. has been telling some yankee interviewer
that you came to him in the small hours of the morning to ask him about planes
of consciousness. Magennis thinks you must have been pulling A. E.&apos;s leg.
He is a man of the very highest morale, Magennis.</p>
<p> Speaking about me. What did he say? What did he say? What did he say about me? Don&apos;t ask.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 158}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; No, thanks, professor MacHugh said, waving the
cigarettecase aside. Wait a moment. Let me say one thing. The finest display of
oratory I ever heard was a speech made by John F. Taylor at the college
historical society. Mr Justice Fitzgibbon, the present lord justice of appeal,
had spoken and the paper under debate was an essay (new for those days) advocating the revival of the Irish tongue.</p>
<p> He turned towards Myles Crawford and said:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You know Gerald Fitzgibbon. Then you can imagine the style of his discourse.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He is sitting with Tim Healy, J.J. O&apos;Molloy said,
rumour has it, on the Trinity college estates commission.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He is sitting with a sweet thing in a child&apos;s frock, Myles Crawford said. Go on. Well?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It was the speech, mark you, the professor said, of a
finished orator, full of courteous haughtiness and pouring in chastened diction I will not say
<br><font color="green">{u22, 136}</font>
<br> the vials of his wrath but pouring the proud man&apos;s contumely upon the
new movement. It was then a new movement. We were weak, therefore worthless.</p>
<p> He closed his long thin lips an instant but, eager to be on, raised an
outspanned hand to his spectacles and, with trembling thumb and ringfinger
touching lightly the black rims, steadied them to a new focus.</p>
<p class="headline">IMPROMPTU</p>
<p> In ferial tone he addressed J.J. O&apos;Molloy:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Taylor had come there, you must know, from a sick bed.
That he had prepared his speech I do not believe
<font color="red"><sup><small>|9</small></sup></font><font color="black">for
there was not even one
<a name="un4052ai" href="../../FF/unbs/un4all.htm#un4052ai">shorthandwriter</a>
in the hall</font><font color="red"><sup><small>9|</small></sup></font>. His
dark lean face had a growth of shaggy beard round it. He wore a loose neckcloth
and altogether he looked (though he was not) a dying man.</p>
<p> His gaze turned at once but slowly towards Stephen&apos;s face and then bent
at once to the ground, seeking. His unglazed linen collar appeared behind his
bent head, soiled by his withering hair. Still seeking, he said:
<br><font color="green">{u21, 159}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; When Fitzgibbon&apos;s speech had ended John F. Taylor
rose to reply. Briefly, as well as I can bring them to mind, his words were these.</p>
<p> He raised his head firmly. His eyes bethought themselves once more. Witless
shellfish swam in the gross lenses to and fro, seeking outlet.</p>
<p> He began:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>Mr chairman, ladies and gentlemen: Great was my
admiration in listening to the remarks addressed to the youth of Ireland a
moment since by my learned friend. It seemed to me that I had been transported
into a country far away from this country, into an age remote from this age,
that I stood in ancient Egypt and that I was listening to the speech of some
highpriest of that land addressed to the youthful Moses.</i></p>
<p> His listeners held their cigarettes poised to hear, their smokes ascending
in frail stalks that flowered with his speech. <i>And let our crooked
smokes</i>. Noble words coming. Look out. Could you try your hand at it yourself?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>And it seemed to me that I heard the voice of that
Egyptian highpriest raised in a tone of like haughtiness and like pride. I heard
his words and their meaning was revealed to me.</i></p>
<p class="headline">FROM THE FATHERS</p>
<p> It was revealed to me that those things are good which yet are corrupted
which neither if they were supremely good nor unless they were good, could be
corrupted. Ah, curse you! That&apos;s saint Augustine.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 137}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>Why will you jews not accept our culture, our religion
and our language? You are a tribe of nomad herdsmen: we are a mighty people. You
have no cities nor no wealth: our cities are hives of humanity and our galleys,
trireme and quadrireme, laden with all manner merchandise furrow the waters of
the known globe</i>. <i>You have but emerged from primitive conditions: we have
a literature, a priesthood, an agelong history and a polity.</i></p>
<p> Nile.</p>
<p> Child, man, effigy.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 160}</font> </p>
<p> By the Nilebank the babemaries kneel, cradle of bulrushes: a man supple in
combat: stonehorned, stonebearded, heart of stone.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>You pray to a local and obscure idol: our temples,
majestic and mysterious, are the abodes of Isis and Osiris, of Horus and Ammon
Ra. Yours serfdom, awe and humbleness: ours thunder and the seas. Israel is weak
and few are her children: Egypt is an host and terrible are her arms. Vagrants
and daylabourers are you called: the world trembles at our name.</i></p>
<p> A dumb belch of hunger cleft his speech. He lifted his voice above it boldly:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>But, ladies and gentlemen, had the youthful Moses
listened to and accepted that view of life, had he bowed his head and bowed his
will and bowed his spirit before that arrogant admonition he would never have
brought the chosen people out of their house of bondage, nor followed the pillar
of the cloud by day. He would never have spoken with the Eternal amid lightnings
on Sinai&apos;s mountaintop nor ever have come down with the light of
inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the tables of the
law, graven in the language of the outlaw.</i></p>
<p> He ceased and looked at them, enjoying silence.</p>
<p class="headline">OMINOUS &mdash; FOR HIM!</p>
<p> J.J. O&apos;Molloy said not without regret:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And yet he died without having entered the land of promise.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; A &ndash; sudden &ndash; at &ndash; the &ndash; moment
&ndash; though &ndash; from &ndash; lingering &ndash; illness &ndash; often
&ndash; previously &ndash; expectorated &ndash; demise, Lenehan said. And with a great future behind him.</p>
<p> The troop of bare feet was heard rushing along the hallway and pattering up the staircase.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That is oratory, the professor said, uncontradicted.</p>
<p> Gone with the wind. Hosts at Mullaghmast and Tara of the kings.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 138}</font>
<br> Miles of ears of porches. The tribune&apos;s words howled and scattered to
the four winds. A people sheltered within his voice. Dead noise. Akasic records
of all that ever anywhere wherever was. Love and laud him: me no more.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 161}</font> </p>
<p> I have money.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Gentlemen, Stephen said. As the next motion on the agenda
paper may I suggest that the house do now adjourn?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You take my breath away. It is not perchance a French
compliment? Mr O&apos;Madden Burke asked. &apos;Tis the hour, methinks, when the
winejug, metaphorically speaking, is most grateful in Ye ancient hostelry.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That it be and hereby is resolutely resolved. All who are
in favour say ay, Lenehan announced. The contrary no. I declare it carried. To
which particular boosing shed&nbsp;&hellip;? My casting vote is: Mooney&apos;s!</p>
<p> He led the way, admonishing:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; We will sternly refuse to partake of strong waters, will
we not? Yes, we will not. By no manner of means.</p>
<p> Mr O&apos;Madden Burke, following close, said with an ally&apos;s lunge of his umbrella:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Lay on, Macduff!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Chip of the old block! the editor cried, slapping Stephen
on the shoulder. Let us go. Where are those
<font color="red"><sup><small>|9</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">bloody</span></span>
<font color="black">blasted</font><font color="red"><sup><small>9|</small></sup></font> keys?</p>
<p> He fumbled in his pocket, pulling out the crushed typesheets.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Foot and mouth. I know. That&apos;ll be all right.
That&apos;ll go in. Where are they?
<font color="red"><sup><small>|9</small></sup></font><font color="black">That&apos;s
all right<a target="foot" id="fgg0107">&ordm;</a>.</font><font color="red"><sup><small>9|</small></sup></font></p>
<p> He thrust the sheets back and went into the inner office.</p>
<p class="headline">LET US HOPE</p>
<p> J.J. O&apos;Molloy, about to follow him in, said quietly to Stephen:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I hope you will live to see it published. Myles, one moment.</p>
<p> He went into the inner office, closing the door behind him.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Come along, Stephen, the professor said. That is fine,
isn&apos;t it? It has the prophetic vision.</p>
<p> The first newsboy came pattering down the stairs at their heels and rushed out into the street, yelling:
<br><font color="green">{u21, 162}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Racing special!
<br><font color="green">{u22, 139}</font> </p>
<p> Dublin. I have much, much to learn.</p>
<p> They turned to the left along Abbey street.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I have a vision too, Stephen said.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes? the professor said, skipping to get into step. Crawford will follow.</p>
<p> Another newsboy shot past them, yelling as he ran:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Racing special!</p>
<p class="headline">DEAR DIRTY DUBLIN</p>
<p> Dubliners.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Two Dublin vestals, Stephen said, elderly and pious, have
lived fifty and fiftythree years in Fumbally&apos;s lane.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Where is that? the professor asked.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Off Blackpitts, Stephen said.</p>
<p> Damp night reeking of hungry dough. Against the wall. Face glistening tallow
under her fustian shawl. Frantic hearts. Akasic records. Quicker, darlint!</p>
<p> On now. Dare it. Let there be life.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; They want to see the views of Dublin from the top of
Nelson&apos;s pillar. They save up three and tenpence in a red tin letterbox
moneybox. They shake out threepenny bits and a sixpence and coax out the pennies
with the blade of a knife. Two and three in silver and one and seven in coppers.
They put on their bonnets and best clothes and take their umbrellas for fear it may come on to rain.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Wise virgins, professor MacHugh said.</p>
<p class="headline">LIFE ON THE RAW</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; They buy one and fourpenceworth of brawn and four slices
of panloaf at the north city diningrooms in Marlborough street from Miss Kate
Collins, proprietress &nbsp;&hellip; They purchase four and twenty ripe plums
from a girl at the foot of Nelson&apos;s pillar to take off the thirst
<br><font color="green">{u21, 163}</font>
<br> of the brawn. They give two threepenny bits to the gentleman at the
turnstile and begin to waddle slowly up the winding staircase, grunting,
encouraging each other, afraid of the dark, panting, one asking the other have
you the brawn, praising God and the Blessed Virgin, threatening to come down,
peeping at the airslits. Glory be to God. They had no idea it was that high.</p>
<p> Their names are Anne Kearns and Florence MacCabe. Anne Kearns has the
lumbago for which she rubs on Lourdes water given her by a lady who got a
<br><font color="green">{u22, 140}</font>
<br> bottleful from a passionist father. Florence MacCabe takes a crubeen and a
bottle of double X for supper every Saturday.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Antithesis, the professor said, nodding twice. Vestal
virgins. I can see them. What&apos;s keeping our friend?</p>
<p> He turned.</p>
<p> A bevy of scampering newsboys rushed down the steps, scattering in all
directions, yelling, their white papers fluttering. Hard after them Myles
Crawford appeared on the steps, his hat aureoling his scarlet face, talking with J.J. O&apos;Molloy.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Come along, the professor cried, waving his arm.</p>
<p> He set off again to walk by Stephen&apos;s side.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yes, he said. I see them.</p>
<p class="headline">RETURN OF BLOOM</p>
<p> Mr Bloom, breathless, caught in a whirl of wild newsboys near the
<font color="red"><sup><small>|9</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">steps</span></span>
<font color="black">offices of the

<p class="di">&mdash; Mr Crawford! A moment!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>Telegraph!</i> Racing special!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What is it? Myles Crawford said, falling back a pace.</p>
<p> A newsboy cried in Mr Bloom&apos;s face:</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Terrible tragedy in Rathmines! A child bit by a bellows!
<br><font color="green">{u21, 164}</font> </p>
<p class="headline">INTERVIEW WITH THE EDITOR</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Just this ad, Mr Bloom said, pushing through
<font color="red"><sup><small>|9</small></sup></font><font color="black">towards
the steps</font><font color="red"><sup><small>9|</small></sup></font>, puffing,
and taking the cutting from his pocket. I spoke with Mr Keyes just now.
He&apos;ll give a renewal for two months, he says. After he&apos;ll see. But he
wants a par to call attention in the <i>Telegraph</i> too, the Saturday pink.
And he wants it if it&apos;s not too late I told councillor Nannetti from the
<i>Kilkenny People.</i> I can have access to it in the national library. House
of keys, don&apos;t you see? His name is Keyes. It&apos;s a play on the name.
But he practically promised he&apos;d give the renewal. But he wants
<font color="red"><sup><small>|9</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the
par</span></span> <font color="black">just a little
puff</font><font color="red"><sup><small>9|</small></sup></font>. What will I tell him, Mr Crawford?</p>
<p class="headline">K.M.A.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Will you tell him he can kiss my arse? Myles Crawford
said, throwing out his arm for emphasis. Tell him that straight from the stable.
<br><font color="green">{u22, 141}</font> </p>
<p> A bit nervy. Look out for squalls. All off for a drink. Arm in arm.
Lenehan&apos;s yachting cap on the cadge beyond. Usual blarney Wonder is that
young Dedalus the moving spirit. Has a good pair of boots on him today. Last
time I saw him he had his heels on view. Been walking in muck somewhere.
Careless chap. What was he doing in Irishtown?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Well, Mr Bloom said, his eyes returning, if I can get the
design I suppose it&apos;s worth a short par. He&apos;d give the ad, I think. I&apos;ll tell him&nbsp;&hellip;</p>
<p class="headline">K.M.R.I.A.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He can kiss my royal Irish arse, Myles Crawford cried
loudly over his shoulder. Any time he likes, tell him.</p>
<p> While Mr Bloom stood weighing the point and about to smile he strode on jerkily.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 165}</font> </p>
<p class="headline">RAISING THE WIND</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>Nulla bona</i>, Jack, he said, raising his hand to his
chin. I&apos;m up to here. I&apos;ve been through the hoop myself. I was looking
for a fellow to back a bill for me no later than last week. Sorry, Jack. You
must take the will for the deed. With a heart and a half if I could raise the wind anyhow.</p>
<p> J.J. O&apos;Molloy pulled a long face and walked on silently. They caught up on the others and walked abreast.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; When they have eaten the brawn and the bread and wiped
their twenty fingers in the paper the bread was wrapped in they go nearer to the railings.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Something for you, the professor explained to Myles
Crawford. Two old Dublin women on the top of Nelson&apos;s pillar.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That&apos;s new, Myles Crawford said. That&apos;s copy.
Out for the waxies&apos; Dargle. Two old trickies, what?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; But they are afraid the pillar will fall, Stephen went on.
They see the roofs and argue about where the different churches are:
Rathmines&apos; blue dome, Adam and Eve&apos;s, saint Laurence
O&apos;Toole&apos;s. But it makes them giddy to look so they pull up their skirts&nbsp;&hellip;
<br><font color="green">{u22, 142}</font> </p>
<p class="headline">THOSE SLIGHTLY RAMBUNCTIOUS FEMALES</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Easy all, Myles Crawford said, no poetic licence. We&apos;re in the archdiocese here.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And settle down on their striped petticoats, peering up at
the statue of the onehandled adulterer.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Onehandled adulterer! the professor cried. I like that. I see the idea. I see what you mean.
<br><font color="green">{u21, 166}</font> </p>

<p class="di">&mdash; It gives them a crick in their necks, Stephen said, and
they are too tired to look up or down or to speak. They put the bag of plums
between them and eat the plums out of it, one after another, wiping off with
their handkerchiefs the plumjuice that dribbles out of their mouths and spitting
the plumstones slowly out between the railings.</p>
<p> He gave a sudden loud young laugh as a close. Lenehan and Mr O&apos;Madden
Burke, hearing, turned, beckoned and led on across towards Mooney&apos;s.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Finished? Myles Crawford said. So long as they do no worse.</p>

disciple of Gorgias, the sophist. It is said of him that none could tell if he
were bitterer against others or against himself. He was the son of a noble and a
bondwoman. And he wrote a book in which he took away the palm of beauty from
Argive Helen and handed it to poor Penelope.</p>

<p class="di">&mdash; Call it, wait, the professor said, opening his long lips
wide to reflect. Call it, let me see. Call it: <i>deus nobis haec otia fecit</i>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; No, Stephen said, I call it <i>A Pisgah Sight of
Palestine</i> or <i>The Parable of The Plums</i>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I see, the professor said.</p>
<p> He laughed richly.</p>
