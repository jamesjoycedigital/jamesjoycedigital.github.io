What<a target="foot" id="fpp0381">&ordm;</a> a Zeit for the goths! thought the Ondt, who was making chilly spaces at himself affront of the icinglass of his windhame<a target="foot" id="fpp0383">&ordm;</a>, which was cold Nixnixundnix. The Ondt was a weltall fellow, raumybult and abelboobied, bynear saw altitudinous wee a schelling in kopfers. He was sair sair sullemn and chairmanlooking when he
was not making spaces<a target="foot" id="fpp0390">&ordm;</a> but (laus!)<a target="foot" id="fpp0391">&ordm;</a> when he wore making spaces he ware mouche moore secred and wisechairmanlooking. Now whim the sillybilly of a Gracehoper had jingled through a jungle of love and debts and jangled through a jumble of life in doubts afterworse, wetting with the waps, drikking with the
drones,<a target="foot" id="fpp0394">&ordm;</a> bilking with bugs and horing after hornests, he fell joust as sieck as a sexton <a name="n29108e" href="../../FF/fnbs/n29all.htm#n29108e">and tanto pooveroo as a churchprince</a>, and wheer the midges to wend hemsylph, alick, he wist nit!

eaten all the whilepaper, swallowed the lustres, devoured forty flights of styearcases, chewed up all the mensas and seccles, ronged the records, made mouthballs of the ephemerals and voracioused with the very timepiece in the<a target="foot" id="fpp0401">&ordm;</a> <a name="n29161l" href="../../FF/fnbs/n29all.htm#n29161l">ternitary</a> &mdash; not too dusty a cicada for a little chip so
mity<a target="foot" id="fpp0403">&ordm;</a>. But when Chrysalmas was on the bare branches off<a target="foot" id="fpp0404">&ordm;</a> he went from Tingsomingenting. <a name="n29157j" href="../../FF/fnbs/n29all.htm#n29157j">He took a round stroll and he took a stroll round and he took a round strollagain</a> till the grillies in his head and the leivnits in his hair made him thought he had the

The Gracehoper,<a target="foot" id="fpp0408">&ordm;</a> who knew the correct
thing,<a target="foot" id="fpp0410">&ordm;</a> promptly tossed himself in the vico on top of his buzzer and the next time he  makes the<a target="foot" id="fpp0413">&ordm;</a> aquinatance of the Ondt he will beheld a world of differents. Behailed the Ondt with unshrinkables draping from his unthinkables, simply revelling in his sunnyroom, sated before his comfortumble filupsuppy of a plate o&apos;
monkynous<a target="foot" id="fpp0418">&ordm;</a> and a confucion of minthe (for he was a conformed aristotaller) as appi as a oneysucker or a baskerboy on the Libido with <a name="n29148c" href="../../FF/fnbs/n29all.htm#n29148c">Floh</a> biting his big<a target="foot" id="fpp0419">&ordm;</a> thigh and <a name="n29148c" href="../../FF/fnbs/n29all.htm#n29148c">Luse</a> lugging his left leg and
