<p> A cloud of witnesses indeed! Yet all of these are now as much no more as were they not yet now or had they then not ever been. Of Hosty, quite a musical genius in a small way, the end is unknown. O&apos;Donnell, somewhat depressed by things, is said to have accepted the (Saxon) King&apos;s shilling on the outbreak of the Crimean war, enlisting under the name of
<a name="n03080a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03080a">Blanco Buckley</a>. Peter Cloran, at the suggestion of the master in lunacy, became an inmate of an asylum. Treacle Tom passed away painlessly one hallow e&apos;en in a state of nature, propelled into the great beyond by footblows of his last bedfellows, three Norwegians of the seafaring class. Shorty disappeared from the surface of the
earth so entirely as to lead the speculative to opine that it came to pass that he (who possessed a large amount of the humorous) had removed his habitat to the interior. Again, was the reverend, the sodality director that fashionable vice preacher to whom sinning society sirens (<u>vide</u> the daily press) at times became so enthusiastically attached and was an objectionable ass who occasionally
wore a raffles ticket in his hat and was openly convicted of malpractices with his tableknife that same cad with a pipe encountered by Humphrey Chimpden?

<br> too untrustworthily irreperible but certain one thing is, that ere the following winter turned the leaves of the book of nature the shadow of the great outlander had stood at the bar of a hundred tribunals, here sentenced before trial with Jedburgh Justice, there acquitted against evidence by benefit of clergy. Big, human, erring, forgivable the unforgettable shade looms up behind the varied
judgments of those unrecapturable days. Three soldiers of the Coldstream guards were walking in Montgomery street. One gave an opinion in which all concurred. It was the first woman, they said. He showed himself a man afterwards. A coming actress (who has been called by one critic a vestpocket Siddons) was interviewed in a beauty parlour and said, while righting her cartwheel hat, she hoped he
would get a Christmas pardon because the world had been unkind. Then he has been so truly wonderful, she added. A dustman named Sevenchurches in the employ of Bullwinkle and McTigue was asked the question in a hashhouse and replied: We have just been discussing the case. All our fellows say that he is a gamey one. A more than usually sober taxidriver took a strong view said: Earywigger is a pink
joint scoundrel in private life but folks say he has parliamentary privilege. A barmaid&apos;s view was:

<br> It would be a <a name="n04163e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n04all.htm#n04163e">crying</a> shame to jail him in consequence of his health. Brian Linskey, the boy curser, was questioned and gave a snappy comeback when saying: I am for caveman sex, curse it! Them two women ought to get strangled<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span>, I say! Miss Ida Wombwell, the seventeen year
old revivalist, said concerning the fusiliers incident: That man is a brute &mdash; but a magnificent brute. Sylvia Silence, the girl detective, when told of the different facts in her cosy bachelor&apos;s flat, overlooking Anderson&apos;s mews, said quietly: Have you thought that sheer greatness was his tragedy? But in my view he should pay the full penalty. A sailor, seated on the granite setts
of the fishmarket, was encouraged to talk by his fianc&eacute;e and said: <a name="n01095n" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01095n">I lay</a> he was to blame about the two slaveys as he had his perfect right but I think there was someone else behind it about the three drummers.</p> </p>  </main>
