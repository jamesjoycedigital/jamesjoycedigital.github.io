<p class="flush">These outrages were thought to have been instigated by either or both of the rushy hollow heroines but one shortly after drank carbolic with all her life before her and her sister-in-love finding while one day doing her chores that she stripped well began to feel her hat too small for her and took to necking selling her spare time in the haymow and elsewhere. But a little thought
ought to allow the facts to fall in and take up their due places. If violence to life, limb and chattels has as often as not been an expression, direct or through a male agency, of offended womanhood has not levy of blackmail from the earliest ages followed in worldlywise.</p>
<p> First, a gateway there was for the suroptimist had bought and enlarged that shack under fair rental of one yearly sheep, value of sixpence, and one small yearly pig, value of eightpence, to grow old and happy in for the remaining years and when everything was got up for the purpose he put a gate on the place and thenabouts the gate was locked purposely by his faithful people to keep him inside
in case he felt like sticking out his chest too far and tempting gracious providence. It ought to be always remembered that
<br><font color="green">{ms, 21}</font>
<br> there was a commercial stopping in the hotel before that and he missed six pounds fifteen and found his overcoat disturbed. The gate business was in fact all threats and abuse and in this sort. Humphrey&apos;s unsolicited visitor promised through the gate outside which he was first, that he would break his head for him, next, that he would break the gate over his head the way he would crack a
nut with a <a name="n06058i" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06058i">monkey wrench</a> and, last of all, that he would give him his (Humphrey&apos;s) blood to drink. He demanded drink <a name="n06028l" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06028l">went on at a great rate</a> abusing him from ten thirty up to one in the afternoon without even a lunch interval. Earwicker, longsuffering, under restraint in
the sittingout corner of his conservatory, his thermos flask by his side, compiled a long list (now feared lost) to be kept on file of all the abusive names he was called (informer, old fruit, yellow whigger, wheatears, goldygoat, bogside beauty, muddle the plan, mister fatmeat) but did not otherwise respond beyond such sedentarity, though it was as easy as kisshands for him to reach for the hello
grip and ring up Crumlin exchange,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 22}</font>
<br> because as he explained, touching his wounded feelings in the future, the dominican mission was on at the time and he thought it might reform him. The more than considerably unpleasant bullocky before he rang off pegged a few stones, all of a size, but possibly seeing the seriousness of what he had not done made him leave down the stones and, having sobered up a bit, he left the scene, after
exhorting him to come outside so as he could burst him all up proceeded in the direction of the deaf and dumb institution.</p> </p>  </main>
