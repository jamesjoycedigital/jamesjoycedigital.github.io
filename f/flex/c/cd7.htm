<p> Now to the obverse. From velveteens to dimities is barely a fivefinger span and hence these camelback excesses are thought to have been instigated by one or either of the causing causes of all, those rushy hollow heroines in their skirtsleeves, be she the margretta be she the posque. Oh! Oh! Because it is a horrible thing to have to say to say to day but one dilalah, Lupita Lorette, shortly

<p> Now, by memory inspired, turn wheel again to the whole of the wall. There was once upon a wall and a hooghoog wall a was and such a wallhole did exist. A stonehinged gate there was for another thing while the suroptimist had bought and enlarged that shack under fair rental of one yearlyng sheep (prime), value of sixpence, and one small yearlyng goat (cadet), value of eightpence, to grow old
and happy in (hogg it and kid him) for the reminants of his years; and when everything was got up for the purpose he put a gate on the place by no means as some pretend a bedstead in loo thereof to keep out donkeys (the pigdirt hanging from the jags to this hour makes that clear) and just thenabouts the iron gape, by old custom left open to prevent the cat from getting at the

Now you must know that the gate and bandstand butchery was merely a tissue of threats and
abuse and after this sort. Humphrey&apos;s unsolicited visitor from the middle west, after having blew some quaker&apos;s (for you!) in through the houseking&apos;s keyhole to attract attention bleated through the gale outside which he was howling, first, be the hirsuiter, that he would break his head for him, next, be the heeltapper, that he would break the gage over his lankyduckling head the
same way he would crack a nut with a monkeywrench and, last of all, be the stirabouter, that he would give him his (or the umperom&apos;s) blood to drink. He demanded more wood alcohol to pitch in with, alleging that his grandfather&apos;s was all taxis and that it was only after ten o&apos;connell, and then, not easily discouraged, opened the floodgates of his wrath and went on at a wicked rate,
weathering against him from eleven thirty to two in the afternoon without even a luncheonette interval for House, son of Clay, to come out to be Executed. Earwicker, longsuffering,
