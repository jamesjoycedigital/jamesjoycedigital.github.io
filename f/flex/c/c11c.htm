Of Hosty, quite a musical genius in a small way, the end is unknown. O&apos;Mara, somewhat depressed by things &amp; <a name="sa0801w" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0801w">short of cash</a>, is said
to have accepted the (Saxon) King&apos;s shilling on the outbreak of the Crimean war, enlisting under the name of <a name="n03080a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03080a">Blanco Buckley</a>. Paul Horan, at the suggestion of the master in lunacy, became an inmate of an asylum. Sordid Sam passed away painlessly one hallow e&apos;en in a state of nature, propelled into the great beyond by footblows
of his last bedfellows, three Norwegians of the seafaring class. Shorty disappeared from the surface of the earth so entirely spoorlessly as to lead the speculative to opine that it came to pass that this <a name="n06137b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06137b">hobo man</a> (who possessed a large amount of the humorous) had removed his habitat to its interior. Again, was the reverend, the
sodality director that <a name="sa0983s" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0983s">eupeptic</a> vice flayer to whose pulpit sinning society sirens (<u>vide</u> the daily press) at times became so enthusiastically attached and was an objectionable ass who occasionally wore a raffles ticket in his hat and was openly convicted of malpractices with his tableknife that same cad with a pipe encountered by
Humphrey Chimpden?

<p> It is a well authenticated fact <a name="n06130d" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06130d">of the commonest knowledge</a> that the <a name="sa0801z" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0801z">shape of the average human face frequently alters with the passing of years</a>. Hence it is no easy matter to identify the individual in <a name="sa0803bj" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0803bj">baggy
pants</a> with already <a name="sa0803au" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0803au">an inclination to baldness</a> who was asked by some <a name="n06142i" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06142i">broadfaced</a> boardschool children on a wall to tell them that <a name="sa0983u" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0983u">bedtime</a> story. It was the Lord&apos;s day and the request was put to the party
(<a name="sa0804i" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0804i">a native of Ireland</a>, by his brogue (said to have been <a name="n06123i" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06123i">average Dublin</a>), who had <a name="sa0804b" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0804b">made the South coast of</a> <a name="n06124j" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06124j">the sister isle</a>

with <a name="n06146c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06146c">deadly accuracy</a>. <a name="sa0801ac" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0801ac">One sad circumstance</a> the narrator mentioned which goes at once to the heart of things. He <a name="sa0805y" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0805y">rose to his feet</a> to tell this group of
<a name="n06126j" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06126j">precocious</a> caremakers, in the simplest <a name="n06126i" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06126i">intensive</a> language of the now mythical <a name="sa0983di" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0983di">habiliments</a> figure <a name="sa0721ad" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0721ad">in the widewinged hat</a>, the

<br><font color="green">{ms, 7v}</font> </p>
<p> In befitting words <a name="n06147e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06147e">a bit duskish</a> <a name="n06134f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06134f">flavoured with a smile</a> seeing that <a name="n06133g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06133g">his thoughts consisted of the cheery</a>, he aptly described the scene, among other
<a name="n06149j" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06149j">items of passing interest</a> the monolith rising stark from the twilit pinebarren, the the angelus hour, the <a name="n06127n" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06127n">ditchers</a> bent upon their implements, the fallow doe belling softly her milky approach <a name="n06134k" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06134k">as the hour was quite
late</a> and how brightly he outed his wallet and gives him a topping swank cheroot and says he was <a name="n01041e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01041e">to suck that brown boyo and spend a whole half hour in Havana</a>. And says he: <a name="sa0804bs" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0804bs">As sure as eggs is</a> known to be <a name="sa0804bs" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0804bs">what
they commercially are</a> in high British quarters my business credit will immediately stand open as straight as that monument&apos;s fabrication before the hygienic globe (and here the reverent sabbath and bottle breaker uncovered himself of his tricoloured boater cordially inviting <a name="n06143f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06143f">the adolescents whom he was wising up</a> to do in like
manner) of the great Pastmaster&apos;s eye.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 6v}</font>
<br> The scene was never forgotten for later in the same century one of that little band of factferreters, then an ex <a name="n06123j" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06123j">civil servant</a> retired under the sixtyfive act, rehearsed it to a cousin of the late archdeacon Coppinger in a pullman of the transhibernian with one still sadder circumstance which is a heartskewer if ever was. For as
often as the archdeacon spoke of it by request all, hearing his cousin&apos;s description of that fellowtraveller&apos;s play of countenance, could really imagine themselves as listening to the cockshy shooter&apos;s evensong evocation of the doomed liberator, his hand protended towards the monumental leadpencil which as the Molyvdokondylon was to be his mausoleum, while over his exculpatory
features the ghost of resignation diffused a spectral appealingness similar in origin and effect to a beam of sunlight upon a coffinplate.

<p> The data, did we possess them, are too imprecisely few to warrant our certitude, the testifiers
<br><font color="green">{ms, 11}</font>
<br> too untrustworthily irreperible but certain one thing is, that ere the following winter turned the leaves of the book of nature the shadow of the great outlander had stood at the bar of a hundred tribunals, in <a name="n06008c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06008c">manor hall</a> as in <a name="sa0984r" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0984r">thieves&apos; kitchen</a> here sentenced before
trial with Jedburgh Justice, there acquitted against evidence by benefit of clergy. Big, human, erring, forgivable the unforgettable shade looms up behind the varied judgments of those unrecapturable days.</p>
<p> Three soldiers of the Coldstream guards were walking in Montgomery street. One gave an opinion in which all concurred. It was the first woman, they said. He showed himself a man afterwards. A coming actress (who has been called by one critic a vestpocket Siddons) was interviewed in a beauty parlour and said, while righting her cartwheel hat, she hoped he would get a Christmas pardon because
the world had been unkind. Then he has been so truly wonderful, she added. A dustman named Sevenchurches in the employ of Bullwinkle and McTigue was asked the question during the midday repast in a hashhouse and replied: We have just been discussing the case. All our fellows say that he is a a <a name="sa0805k" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0805k">thorough sport</a>. A more than usually sober
taxidriver who was hosing his car(?) took a strong view <a name="n06126d" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06126d">He talked as he worked &amp; this is what he told newspapermen</a>: Earywigger is just a pink joint scoundrel in private life but folks say he has parliamentary privilege. A barmaid&apos;s view was thus expressed:
<br><font color="green">{ms, 12}</font>
<br> It would be a <a name="n04163e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n04all.htm#n04163e">crying</a> shame to jail him no matter what <a name="sa0801cb" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0801cb">wrongdoing</a> went on in consequence of him enjoying such weak health. Brian Linskey, the boy curser, was questioned and gave a snappy comeback when saying: I am for caveman sex, curse it! Them two women ought to get
strangled, I say! Missioner Ida Wombwell, the seventeen year old revivalist, said concerning the incident of <a name="sa0801cr" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0801cr">interference with</a> fusiliers <a name="sa0801cs" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0801cs">or other persons using the park</a>: That man is a brute &mdash; but a magnificent brute. Sylvia Silence, the girl detective, when

easychair</a> to <a name="n06130h" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06130h">restfully</a> query: Have you thought, reporter, that sheer greatness was his tragedy? But according to my attitude he should pay the full penalty. <a name="sa0805ac" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0805ac">Section XI of C.L.A.
