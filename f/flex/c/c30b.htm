<p class="flush"><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">First</span></span> these outrages were thought to have been instigated by either or both of <a name="n01079r" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01079r">the rushy hollow</a> heroines but one drank carbolic shortly after and her sister in love, finding she stripped well, felt her hat too small for her. But a little thought will allow the
facts to fall in and take up their due places. If violence to life, limb and goods has as often as not been the expression, direct or through male agents, of offended womanhood has not levy of blackmail from the earliest ages followed upon in worldlywise</p>
<p> First, there was a gateway for <a name="n06169d" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06169d">the suroptimist</a> had <a name="n06169b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06169b">bought and enlarged that shack</a> <a name="n06169c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06169c">to grow old &amp; happy</a> in and when everything was <a name="n06167j" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06167j">got up for the
purpose</a> he <a name="n06167i" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06167i">put a gate on the place</a> and <a name="n06165a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06165a">the gate was locked to keep HCE in</a>, in case <a name="n06169f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06169f">he felt</a> <a name="n06169f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06169f">like</a> tempting providence. It ought to be always
remembered that there was <a name="n01072d" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01072d">a commercial</a> <a name="n06167f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06167f">stopping in the hotel and he missed six pounds fifteen</a> and he <a name="n06167c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06167c">found his overcoat disturbed</a>. The gate business was all threats &amp; abuse. Humphrey&apos;s unsolicited visitor
said through the gate first that he would <a name="n06165e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06165e">break his head, next that he would then break the gate over his head and finally give him his (Humphrey&apos;s) blood to drink</a>.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 8v}</font>
<br> He <a name="n06165h" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06165h">kept abusing him from ten thirty till one in the afternoon without a lunch interval</a>. Earwicker, longsuffering, compiled <a name="n06165f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06165f">a long list</a> <a name="n06165f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06165f">of all the abusive names he was called</a> but did not other wise reply
because, as he afterwards explained, the dominican <a name="n06165g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06165g">mission was on at the time &amp; he thought that might reform him</a>. The bullocky finally <a name="n06168a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06168a">rang off</a> &amp; <a name="n06160i" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06160i">left the scene</a> after
<a name="n06162a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06162a">exhorting</a> him to come out so that he cd <a name="n06160g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06160g">burst him up</a>.</p> </p>  </main>
