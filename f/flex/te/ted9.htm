Only a leaf, just a leaf and then leaves. The woods are fond always. As were wee their babes in. And robins in crews so. It is for me goolden wending. Unless? Away! Rise up, man of the hooths, you have slept so long! Or is it
only so mesleems? On your pondered palm. Reclined from cape to pede. With pipe on bowl. Terce for a fiddler, sixt for makmerriers, none for a Cole. Rise up now! And aruse! Norvena&apos;s over. I am Leafy, your goolden, so you called me, may me life, yea your goolden, silve me solve, exsogerraider! You did so drool. I was so sharm. But there&apos;s a great poet in you too.

When you&apos;re in the buckly shuit Rosensharonals near did for you. Fiftyseven and three, cosh, with the bulge. Proudpurse Alby with his pooraroon Eireen, they&apos;ll. Pride, comfytousness, enevy! You make me think of a
wonderdecker I once. Or somebalt thet sailder, the man megallant with the bangled ears. Or an earl was he, at Lucan? Or, no, it&apos;s the Iren duke&apos;s I mean. Or sombrey erse from the Dark Countries. Come and let

<br> it&apos;s those two old crony aunts held them out to the water front. Queer Mrs Quickenough and odd Miss Doddpebble. And when them two has had a good few there isn&apos;t much more dirty clothes to publish. From the Laundersdale Minssions. One chap googling the holyboy&apos;s thingabib and this lad wetting his widdle. You were pleased as Punch, recitating war exploits and pearse orations to
them jackeen gapers. But that night after, all you were wanton! Bidding me do this and that and the other. And blowing off to me, hugly Judsys, what wouldn&apos;t you give to have a

What will be is. Is is. But let them. Slops hospodch and the slusky slut too. He&apos;s for thee what she&apos;s for me. Dogging you round cove and haven and teaching me the perts of speech.

Send Arctur guiddus! Isma! Sft! It is the softest

Still, I&apos;ll take me owld Finvara for my shawldhers. The trout will be so fine at brookfisht. With a taste of roly polony from Blugpuddels after. To bring out the tang of the tay. Is&apos;t you fain for a roost

Only but, there&apos;s a but, you must buy me a fine new girdle too, nolly. When next you go to Market Norkwall. They&apos;re all saying I need it since the one from Isaacsen&apos;s slooped its line.

I always know by your brights and shades. Reach down. A lil mo. So. Drow back your glave. Hot and hairy, hugon, is your hand! Here&apos;s where the falskin begins. Smoos as an infams.

Or see only a youth in his florizel, a boy in innocence, peeling a twig, a child beside a weenywhite steed. The child we all love to place our hope in for ever. All men has done something. Be the time they&apos;ve come to the weight of old fletch. We&apos;ll lave it. So. We will take

A MacGarath O&apos;Cullagh O&apos;Muirk MacFewney sookadoodling and sweepacheeping round the lodge of Fjorn na Galla of the Trumpets! It&apos;s
like potting the po to shambe on the dresser or tamming Uncle Tim&apos;s Caubeen on to the brows of a Viker Eagle. Not such big strides, huddy foddy! You&apos;ll crush me antilopes I saved so long for. They&apos;re Penisole&apos;s. And the two goodiest shoeshoes. It is hardly a Knut&apos;s mile or seven, possumbotts. It is very good for the health of a morning. With Buahbuah. A gentle motion all
around. As leisure paces. And the helpyourselftoastrool cure&apos;s easy. It seems so long since, ages since. As if you had been long far away. Afartodays, afeartonights, and me as with you in thadark. You will tell me some time if I can believe its all. You know where I am bringing you? You remember? When I ran berrying after hucks and haws. With you drawing out great aims to hazel me from the
hummock with your sling. Oar cries. I could lead you there and I still by you in bed. Les go dutc to Danegreven, nos? Not a soul but ourselves. Time? We have loads on our hangs. Till Gilligan and Halligan call again to hooligan. And the rest of the guns, Sullygan eight, from left to right. Olobobo, ye foxy theagues! The moskors thought to ball you out. Or the Wald Unicorn&apos;s Master, Bugley
Captain from the Naul, drawls up by the door with the Honourable Whilp and the Reverend Poynter and the two Lady Pagets of Tallyhaugh, Ballyhuntus, in their riddletight raiding hats for to lift a hereshealth to their robost, the Stag, evers the Carlton hart.

There&apos;ll be others but none so for me. Yed he never knew we

One time you&apos;d stand fornenst me, fairly laughing, in your bark and tan billows of branches for to fan me coolly. And I&apos;d lie as quiet as a moss. And one time you&apos;d rush upon me, darkly roaring, like a great black shadow, with a sheeny stare to perce me rawly. And I&apos;d frozen up and pray for thawe.

And lothing their mean cosy turns. And all the greedy gushes out through their small souls. And all the lazy leaks down over their brash bodies. How small it&apos;s all! And me letting on to meself always. And
lilting on all the time. I thought you were all glittering with the noblest of carriage. You&apos;re only a bumpkin. I thought you the great in all things, in guilt and in glory. You&apos;re but a puny. Home! My people were not their sort out beyond there so far as I can. For all the bold and bad and bleary they are blamed, the seahags. No! Nor for all our wild dances in all their wild din. I can
see meself among them, allaniuvia pulchrabelled. How she was handsome, the wild Amazia, when she would seize to my other breast! And what is she weird, haughty Niluna, that she will snatch from my ownest hair! For &apos;tis they are the stormies. Ho hang! Hang ho! And the clash of our cries till we spring to be free. Auravoles, they says, never heed of your name! But I&apos;m loothing them
that&apos;s here and all I lothe. Loonely in me loneness. For all their faults. I am passing out. O bitter ending! I&apos;ll slip away before they&apos;re up. They&apos;ll never see. Nor know. Nor miss me. And it&apos;s old and old it&apos;s sad and old it&apos;s
