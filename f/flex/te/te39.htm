One in a thousand of years of the nights? All me life I have been lived among them but now they are becoming lothed to me. And I am lothing their little warm tricks.

And me letting on to meself always. And lilting on all the time.
I thought you were all glittering with the noblest of carriage. You&apos;re only a bumpkin. I thought you the great in all things, in guilt and in glory. You&apos;re but a puny. Home!

Auravoles, they says, never heed of your name! But I&apos;m loothing them that&apos;s here and all I lothe. Loonely in me loneness. For all their faults. I am passing out. O bitter ending!
