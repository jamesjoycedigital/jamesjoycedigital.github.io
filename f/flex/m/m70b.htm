<p> So anyhow to wind up after the whole beanfeast was all over poor old King Roderick O&apos;Conor the last King of all Ireland <a name="sa0302n" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0302n">who was anything you like between fiftyfour and fiftyfive years of age</a> at the time after the socalled last supper he gave or at least he wasn&apos;t actually the last King of all Ireland for the time being
because he was still such as he was the King of all Ireland after the last King of all Ireland, <a name="n01054f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01054f">Art MacMurrough Kavanagh</a>, who was King of all Ireland before he was anyhow what did he <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">too</span></span> do King Roderick O&apos;Conor the respected King of all Ireland at the time after they were
all of them gone when he was all by himself, but he just went heeltapping round his own right royal round rollicking table and faith he sucked up sure enough like a Trojan in some particular cases with the assistance of his venerated tongue one after the other in strict order of rotation whatever happened to be left in the different bottoms of the various drinking utensils left there behind them
by the departed honourable guests such as it was either Guiness&apos;s or Phoenix Brewery Stout or John Jameson and Sons or for that matter O&apos;Connell&apos;s Dublin ale as a fallback of several different quantities amounting in all to I should say considerably more than the better part of <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">an</span></span> a gill or naggin of imperial dry and liquid
measure.</p> </p>  </main>
