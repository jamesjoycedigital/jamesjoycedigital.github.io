<p class="pdi">&mdash; You are most <a name="n04157l" href="../../ff/fnbs/n04all.htm#n04157l">gloriously</a> kind as ever, dear relative, Shaun said. But <a name="n06044h" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06044h">&apos;tis time to be up and going</a>. <a name="n05010e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05010e">This place is not big enough for us now.</a> Come &mdash; our good feet,
<a name="n10024f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10024f">corns</a> and all. <a name="n06004d" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06004d">Was not our mother a</a> Runningwater? Farewell awhile till we meet to part no more. So here goes. <a name="n05007a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05007a">I bless you all to the west as Whatshisname said to the Kerryboys.</a> Won. Toe. A dry. You watch our
smoke.</p>
<p> After <a name="n06080b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06080b">poor</a> Jaun the Boast&apos;s <a name="n06080b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06080b">last words</a> ending in smoke Twentyeight &amp; one of the <a name="n06021e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06021e">paddling party</a> <a name="n06001a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06001a">came to his assistance</a> but Repulsing all
attempts at first aid I perceived greatly misunderstood Shaun to give himself some sort of a kick or prod to <a name="n05117g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05117g">sit up &amp; take notice</a> which <a name="n06007b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06007b">acted like magic</a> while all the daughters of February Filldyke voiced their approval in the customary manner by dropping to their knees
&amp; clapping together the flats of their hands as <a name="n10024a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10024a">they viewed him away</a>. <a name="n10024d" href="../../ff/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10024d">Easygoing</a> Shaun then I saw to take from the gentlest weeper amongst all the wailers who were already in half mourning for the <a name="n04154q" href="../../ff/fnbs/n04all.htm#n04154q">passing of</a> the
post the familiar yellow label into which he let fall a tear, smothered a sigh, choked a cough, checked a sob, spat a spit &amp; <a name="n10020e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10020e">blew his own trumpet</a>. Next he licked its stickyback side and stamped the badge of belief to his brow, and then having <a name="n07a02g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n07all.htm#n07a02g">turned the feminine world upside
down</a> with a half a glance from under his shaggy eyebrows, he waved a hand across the sea as notice to quit, Fain too <a name="n10031d" href="../../ff/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10031d">they have followed him dancing</a> most modestly <a name="n10053n" href="../../ff/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10053n">all the way</a>, praying of him <a name="n10043b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10043b">to give them his
blessing</a>. but
<br><font color="green">{ms, 33}</font>
<br> in selfrighting himself to exchange embraces with her he toppled slightly to the off and, making a brandnew start, by making a sign of a cross on himself hurriedly &amp; his hat blew off and he <a name="n05155k" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05155k">bucketed after</a> &amp; <a name="n10063c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10063c">kingscouriered</a> off
<a name="n06026g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06026g">on Shanks&apos;s mare</a> (the <a name="n10025a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10025a">bouchal</a>, <a name="n10047a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10047a">you would say &apos;twas on that moment they gave him the legs</a>) adown his highroad apast <font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font> Bridge
(<a name="n01074e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01074e">which, by the way, he narrowly missed fouling</a>) following which he quickly was lost to sight though still, of course, all the more on that account to memory dear.</p>
<p> Wethen, May the good people speed you, rural Shaun, export stout fellow that you are, ay, and heart &amp; soul of Shamrogueshire! May your bawny hair grow fairer &amp; rarer, our own only whiteheaded boy! Just by nature &amp; natural by design had you but been spared to us, <a name="n10055a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10055a">Jauny lad</a>, you will be long looked after from last to first
as the beam of light we follow receding on your pilgrimage to the antipodes of the past, you, who so often consigned your tidings of great joy into our never to<a target="foot" id="fqz0007">&ordm;</a> late to love <a name="n10028c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10028c">letterbox</a>, dearest Shaun of all, you of the boots our true pennyatimer! Thy now paling lamp we may perchanmce ne&apos;er see
again. Ah, <a name="n04155e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n04all.htm#n04155e">if it could only speak</a> how it would splutter out praises be to thee. <a name="n04146k" href="../../ff/fnbs/n04all.htm#n04146k">For you had &mdash; may I say it? &mdash; a glow of zeal of service such as rarely, if ever, have I seen in any 1 man&apos;s bosom.</a> There are men still unclaimed by the death angel who will
fervently pray to <a name="n04158b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n04all.htm#n04158b">the Spirit above</a> that they may never depart this earth of ours till Johnny <a name="n10029c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10029c">the Quickest</a> comes marching home. Life, it is true, will
<br><font color="green">{ms, 34}</font>
<br> be a dream without you, a slip of the time between a date and a date from tonight to yesterday morning. But you did your strong 9 furlong mile in slick &amp; slapstick style &mdash; a good deed <a name="n05134k" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05134k">man docile</a>, <a name="n05123n" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05123n">high bouncing</a> serviceman, &amp; one that will be talked of for
centuries &mdash; And already the sombrer portion of the gloom is gone. Brave footsore Shaun! Hold to! Win out, sir! The silent cock shall crow at last. The west will shake the east awake. Walk while you have the night for the noon cometh wherein every post shall sleep.</p> </p>  </main>
