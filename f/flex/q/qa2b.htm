<p> Good Shaun, as I was shortly before that made aware, next halted to take his breath &amp; to loosen both bruised boots at the weir by Lazar&apos;s Walk about 9 score or so barrelhours&apos; distance as truly he merited to do. He was there, I cd see, perspiring but happy, propped up against a slumbering warden of the peace, 1 comestabulish Sigurdsen, who had fallen asleep at the curing station
in the embraces of a confiscated bottle. Now, there were as many as 29 daughters out of the national hedgeschool (for I seem to remember how I was in a look before you leap year) learning their lesson of life there, seated as they were, upon the brink, attracted to the sight of the 1<sup>st</sup> human landmark, paddling away with their 8 &amp; 50 pedals in charming concert to the snores of the
log who looked stuck to the sod as ever &amp; anon he murmoaned,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 27}</font>
<br> visibly unmoved, over his treasure trove for the crown: Dotter deadbedstead mean smuggy sort flasky!</p>
<p> Shaun (after he had 1<sup>st</sup> bowed to all the others in that chorus of praise of goodwill girls, asking kindly after their healths, out of pure human respect for he was the most purely human creature that was ever called man) easily <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">recognised</span></span> made out the features of his dear sister Izzy nor cd he ever after forget her as he
was, besides that, her godfather as well after all.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Sister dearest, Shaun delivered himself, as he began to take leave of her express with fondest affection, I honestly believe you will sorely miss us yet we feel, as a martyr to the discharge of duty, that it is about time we wd go. This is the result of your teachings in which we were raised, you, Sis, that used to write to us the nice letters and be telling us your oldworld
tales of derringdo, you angel in our house. During
<br><font color="green">{ms, 28}</font>
<br> our brief absence<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span> <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">B</span></span> be true to as many of the 10 commandments as possible. <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">R</span></span> Never miss your last mass. Never eat bad eat<a target="foot" id="fqz0004">&ordm;</a> of a good Friday. Never let a hog of the hill
trample down your lily of the valley. Never play ladies&apos; games on the Lord&apos;s day. Especially beware please of being a party to any demoralising home life. It saps a chap. No lowcut shirtwaists. Don&apos;t acquire a <u>penchant</u> for the fag habit. Have your eye out for furnished lodgers paying for meals on tally with company and piano music, the too friendly friend type. Dip into the
lives of the saints in fortnightly instalments for the betterment of your mind. Keep cool as a cucumber your preserved chastity. Rather than part with that vestalite emerald of the first importance which you have where your nether extremities meet, let the entire ekumene universe perish to pot first in a pitfall <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">first</span></span> a 1000 times over. O
be careful during this lenten pastoral season when the spring is in the bubbling. Divulge the name &amp; address of any lapwhelp that speaks to you on the street without a proper letter of introduction and as
<br><font color="green">{ms, 29}</font>
<br> sure as back I come with the gravel spinning from beneath my feet &amp; rest assured I&apos;ll break his face for him. No, I&apos;ll tell you what I&apos;ll do instead. I&apos;ll burst his mouth: that&apos;s what I&apos;ll do. Times and oft shall I think of you far away on your pillow whilst amid the music of the double doorknockers. Little girl from Liffeyside you fill a big corner in my
heart. O, heaven, how I shall <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">kiss you</span></span>, if I live, put my arm in yours and kiss you when cherries next come back immediately following my safe return to ignorance and bliss when we shall show our kindness by adopting all the poorest babes possible. We will render social service and help clean up things. Look at the mud of Harrington
street. Bear in mind all the banana peels along Henry, Moore, Earl &amp; Talbot streets. Stand on, say, Aston&apos;s Quay &amp; take a good gaze into any adjacent shopwindow you choose &amp; in about 20 minutes&apos; time turn round &amp; you will see you will be coated with slush occasioned by the traffic in transit. Ask any disgusted lady cyclist who happened to be
<br><font color="green">{ms, 30}</font>
<br> proceeding or returning from her devotions at Adam and Eve&apos;s during the bank holiday gale &amp; downpour when slates came freely off the best part of our grand old tenements &amp; <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">even</span></span> pedestrianism was even difficult what her laundry bill came up to on last Monday. Don&apos;t wait for the answer for if you were to do such a
thing what wd be the answer which would meet your ears? Both. When will the longsuffering face of our beloved city get that longpromised wash? Or, better still account to me for the fact that if you purchase any fish and vegetables you fancy from the same perambulator and, having deposited the mackerel, let us say, as well as the cauliflower upon either of the edges of the two sidewalks, you take
your stand in some nearby hallway to carefully note <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the</span></span> result the restingplaces selected are visited in rotation by so many members of the canine tribe.</p>
<p> Sis dearest, it is my grief to go on this benedictine
<br><font color="green">{ms, 31}</font>
<br> errand but it is grand to be going to meet a king, not a king merely by surname, but the great king of Greater Dublin. I only wish everyone was as sure of anything in this present world as I am of everything in the one to come. Tell mother that. And now let ye create no scenes. Cheer up all round, let ye, till the grim reaper comes along as a blessing in disguise. No lonesome stuff! Drink it
off, ladies, please. Parting&apos;s fun. Soon shall we be dead &amp; happy together as you all know in the land of <a name="n10067j" href="../../FF/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10067j">lost of time</a>. One or two tears are all there is to it &amp; then in a click of the clock off we pop en route for His Blessed Majesty, our longlived Lord.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Listen, brother of mine, Izzy said. Accept this in place of a handkerchief. and, listen, bear it with you ever and always and when you use it, listen, think of one absent one You can send it back by return in case anything happens to you so as I&apos;ll know. Listen, I
<br><font color="green">{ms, 32}</font>
<br> will follow you with all my eyes. Teach me how to tumble, brother, and, listen, warn me whom to love.<a target="foot" id="fqz0006">&ordm;</a></p> </p>  </main>
