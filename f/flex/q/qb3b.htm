<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, ladies on gentlemen and toastmaster general, health and song and Erin go dry! To stir up love and fizz I lift this bridle&apos;s cup of her champagne, dimmydouce, tightsqueze for my snowybreasted, and while my pearlies in their sparkling wisdom are nippling her bubblets I swear (and let you swear!) by the round of our dear old Snaggletooth&apos;s solidbowl I ne&apos;er
will prove I&apos;m untrue to your liking (swear!) so long as my hole looks down.</p>
<p> So I&apos;m not forgetting my inner man monophone for I&apos;m leaving my darling proxy behind for you, Dave the Dancer, a squamous runaway and a dear old pal of mine too. He&apos;s the mightiest penumbrella I ever flourished on beyond the shadow of a post! Be sure and link him, my treasure, as often as you learn provided there&apos;s nothing between you but a plain deal table only don&apos;t
encourage him to cry lessontimes over Leperstown. Talk of wolf in a stomach, by all that&apos;s verminous! I knew I smelt the garlic league. Why, bless me quick, here he is, darling Dave, just in time as if he fell out of space, all draped in mufti, coming back from his continence after a bad passage by the 11.32, with the pork&apos;s pate in his paw and the gulls laughing lime on his natural
skunk, blushing like Pat&apos;s pig, begob! He&apos;s not damn well ashamed to carry out the testimonicals he got as a home cured emigrant in Paddyouare far beyond the sea. Bearer may leave the church, signed, Figura Porca. He&apos;s the sneaking likeness of me, faith, and every biter&apos;s
<br><font color="green">{ms, 126}</font>
<br> bit as nasal a romeo as I am, for ever cracking quips on himself, that merry, the jeenjakes, he&apos;d soon arise mother&apos;s roses with bedewing tears onto anny living girl&apos;s laftercheeks. He&apos;s a jarry queer fish betimes, I grant, but, lice and all and semicoloured stainedglasses, I&apos;m enormously proud of that foreigner, I&apos;ll say I am. We&apos;re as thick and thin now as
two tubular jawballs. I hate him about his henesy but I love him. I love his portugal&apos;s nose. Isn&apos;t he after touching every distinguished Irishman he could ever distinguish from a Yourishman for the half of a crown and peace? Bravo, chief! Sure there&apos;s nobody else to touch the darling at all for sheer dare with that potful of Spanish breens on him! A jollytan fine cemented brick!
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">He</span></span> Dave knows I have the highest of respect of anyone in my own smooth way for David Crozier. The most important man! Ho, by the holy! Someone has shaved his rough diamond skull for him as clean as Nuntius&apos; piedish! He&apos;s the spatton spit, so he is, of Shemuel Tulliver, the old crusader! Hold hard till you hear him clicking his
bull&apos;s bones! You&apos;re welcome back, Wilkins, to red berries in the frost! Give us your dyed hand here, frater! I&apos;m better pleased than ten pounds. Faith, I&apos;m proud of you, french davit! You&apos;ve surpassed
<br><font color="green">{ms, 127}</font>
<br> yourself. This is my aunt Julia Bride dying to have you languish to scandal in her bosky old manor. You haven&apos;t seen her since she went into youth&apos;s smallclothes. Embrace her out of pure luck before she goes off in pure love. I&apos;d give three shillings to the canon to see you kiss her as if she was a crucifix. Turn around, skeezy Sammy, till we see are you still full of poetry.
Could you sing us a stave encore on your jubalharp, eh, Mr Jinglejoys? Show us your imitation death of Nelson. What, sir? <u>Taurus periculosus morbus pediculosus miserere mei et miseribilibus!</u> Hoho! Begob, there&apos;s not so much green in his Ireland&apos;s eye! The bark is still there but the molars are gone. Areesh! Areesh! Did you note that worried expression on his megalogue! And did you
twig the sham leaf creeping down his blousyfrock? My oldfellow&apos;s uncle Caius Codinhand, that was garotted, used to chop that tongue of his, japlatin, with my younkle&apos;s owlseller, Wolfe Woodenbeard, that went stone bothered in the tower of Balbus as brisk, man, as I&apos;d scoff up lobscouse. But it&apos;s all deafman&apos;s duff to me, begob. Sam knows miles better than me how to work
the miracle. He&apos;ll soon tune your Erin&apos;s ear for you to read the roman while I&apos;m away from wherever thou art going in for my examinations. So pick your stops with fondness. And mind you
<br><font color="green">{ms, 128}</font>
<br> tie the two strings of your nicenames. And pull up your words as far as you can. His hearing is doubting just as my seeing is believing. So let him blink for himself where you speak the best<a target="foot" id="fqz0015">&ordm;</a> ticklish. Fond namer, let me never see thee blame a kiss for shame a knee.</p> </p>  </main>
