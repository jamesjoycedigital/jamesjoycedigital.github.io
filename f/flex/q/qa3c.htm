<p> Jaunty Jaun, as I was<a target="foot" id="fqz0008">&ordm;</a> shortly before that made aware, next halted to fetch a breath and to loosen (let God&apos;s son now be looking down on to the poor preambler!) both of his bruised brogues at the weir by Lazars&apos; Walk (for far and wide was he noted for his humane treatment of any kind of abused footgear) a matter of maybe nine score or so
barrelhours distance off, as truly he merited to do. He was there, I could see, when I took a closer look at him, greatly altered for the brighter, though still the graven image of himself as he was used to be, perspiring but happy, notwithstanding <a name="n10081d" href="../../ff/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10081d">his foot was asleep</a> on him, the way he thought
<a name="n12060e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n12all.htm#n12060e">he had a calf&apos;s hoof in his buskin</a>, with his halluxes all splendid, in Ireland untranscended, bigmouthed Posther, propped up restant against a slumbersome warden of the peace, one comestabulish Sigurdsen, who had tumbled on sleep at night duty behind the curing station

<a name="n10132f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10132f">keeping time</a> with their eight and fifty pedalettes, playing foolyfool jeway <a name="n11075c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n11all.htm#n11075c">allo misto posto</a> all barely in their teens, in a charming <a name="n10136h" href="../../ff/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10136h">nocturne</a> to the snores of the log who looked stuck to the sod as ever and oft he

<p> Jaun (after he had in the first place doffed a hat and bowed to all the others in that chorus of praise to men of goodwill girls, who they were all <a name="n12162d" href="../../ff/fnbs/n12all.htm#n12162d">rushing for the post</a> kittering about him and making a tremendous fuss over him and his rosyposy smile <a name="n10102e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10102e">mussing his hair</a> &amp;

on to make a few stray remarks anent their personal appearances and the contrary tastes displayed in their short frocks gently reproving one that the hem of her <u>hem</u> could be seen below her hem and quickly telling another that the hook of her hum was open a little at the back, to have an eye to that, hum, and all, of course, just to fill up form out of pure human respect for Jaun was

<br> human being that ever was called man, Jaun, easily made out the features of his fond sister Izzy for he knew his love by her waves of splabashing and she knew his love from her way of blabushing nor could he forget her as easily as all that ever after because he was brotherbesides her godfather as well and heaven knows he thought the world and all of her, poor good fond Jaun.</p>

last long journey and not be <a name="n10143d" href="../../ff/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10143d">the load on you</a>. This is the gross proceeds of your teachings in which we were raised, you, Sis, that used to write to us the exceeding nice letters and be telling us (full well do we recall to mind) thy oldworld tales of homespinning and derringdo and daddyho, those tales which whisked our heart so narrated
by thou to <a name="n10081g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10081g">perfection</a>, our pet of the whole family and the mainsay of our house, the time we <a name="n12090o" href="../../ff/fnbs/n12all.htm#n12090o">younkers</a> were tossing ourselves in bed, having been laid up with Parrish&apos;s syrup (<a name="n10108f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10108f">the night we well remember</a>) for to

Moreover after that bad luck to me if I don&apos;t think strongly about giving him into custody to the first policewoman I would chance to meet or for that matter if I got the wind up I might even take it into my head to swing for him and then wipe the street with him.
