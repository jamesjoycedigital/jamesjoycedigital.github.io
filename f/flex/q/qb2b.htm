<p class="flush">To stir up love and fizz I lift this bridle&apos;s cup of her champagne dimmydouce, tightfit for my snowybreasted, and while my pearlies in their sparkling wisdom <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">i</span></span> are nippling its <a name="n08070c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08070c">bubblets</a> I swear and let you swear, by the round of my old one&apos;s
solidbowl, I never will prove I&apos;m untrue to your liking so long as my hole looks down. That&apos;s that.</p>
<p> So I&apos;m leaving my proxy behind for you, Dave the Dancer, a squamous runaway and a dear old pal of mine too! Be sure and love him, my treasure, as often as you like only don&apos;t encourage him to cry over Leperstown. Here he is as if he fell out of space, all draped in mufti, coming back from his continence, with the pork&apos;s head in his hand and the gulls laughing lime on his natural
skunk, blushing like a pig, begob! He&apos;s the sneaking likeness of me, faith, and every biter&apos;s bit as nasal a romeo as I am, for ever cracking quips on himself<a target="foot" id="fqz0014">&ordm;</a> that merry, the jeenjakes, he&apos;d soon arise mother&apos;s roses with bedewing tears onto anny living girl&apos;s laftercheeks. He&apos;s a jarry queer fish betimes, I grant, but, lice and
all, I&apos;m enormously fond of that foreigner, I&apos;ll say I am. We&apos;re as thick and thin now as could possibly be. Isn&apos;t he after touching everyone else he ever knew for the half of a crown and peace? Sure there&apos;s nobody else to touch him at all with that potful of Spanish breens on him! A jollytan fine cemented brick! Dave knows I have the highest respect of anyman for David
Crozier. The most important man! Ho, by the holy, someone has shaved his skull for him as clean as Nuntius&apos; piedish! Hold hard till you hear him clicking his bull&apos;s bones. You&apos;re welcome back, Wilkins! Give us your dyed hand here.! Faith, I&apos;m proud
<br><font color="green">{ms, 123v}</font>
<br> of you, sir! This is my aunt Julia Bride dying to know you. Turn around till we see are you still full of poetry. What? <u>Taurus periculosus morbus pediculosus miserere mei et miseribilibus!</u> Hoho! Did you note that worried expression? My oldfellow&apos;s uncle Caius Codinhand, that was garotted, used to chop that tongue of his, japlatin, with my younkle&apos;s owlseller, Wolfe
Woodenbeard, in the tower of Balbus as brisk, man, as I&apos;d scoff up lobscouse. But it&apos;s all deafman&apos;s duff to me, begob. He&apos;ll soon tune your Erin&apos;s ear for you while I&apos;m away.</p> </p>  </main>
