<p> Good Shaun, as I was shortly before that made aware, next halted to take breath and loosen his boots at the weir by Lazar&apos;s Walk about nine score or so barrelminutes&apos; distance as truly he merited to do. He was there, I could see, perspiring but happy, propped up against a slumbering warden of the peace, one comestabulish Sigurdsen, who had fallen asleep in the embrace of a
confiscated bottle. There were as many as 29 daughters out of the national hedge school
<br><font color="green">{ms, 15}</font>
<br> (for I seem to remember how it was a look before you leap year) learning the lesson of life there, seated as they were upon the brink attracted by the sight of the first human landmark, paddling with their eight and fifty pedals in charming concert to the snores of the log who seemed stuck to the sod as ever &amp; anon he murmoaned over his treasure trove of the crown: Dotter deadbesty mean
lily sort flasky. Shaun, after he had bowed to all the others in that chorus of praise of girls, easily made out his dear sister Izzy</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Sister dearest, Shaun said, as he began to take leave of her immediately with fondest affection, I honestly believe you will sorely miss me yet I feel, as a martyr to the discharge of duty, that I ought to go. This is the result of your teachings, Sis, you <a name="n09091d" href="../../ff/fnbs/n09all.htm#n09091d">that used to write to me the nice</a> letters. During my brief
absence be true to the ten commandments. Never lose your last mass. Never eat bad meat of a good Friday. Never let a hog of the hill trample on your lily of the valley. Never play ladies&apos;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 16}</font>
<br> games on the Lord&apos;s day. Keep cool above all your preserved chastity. Rather than part with that vestalite emerald which you have where your two nether extremities meet, nay, let the entire ekumene universe perish to pot first a thousand times over in a pitfall. O be careful during this lenten pastoral season when the spring is in the making. Times and oft shall I think of you when amid
the music of the doorknockers. O, heaven, how I shall kiss you immediately upon my return when we shall adopt all the poorest children possible. Sis dearest, it is my grief to go away on this benedictine errand but it is grand to be going to meet a king, not a king only by surname, but the great king of Greater Dublin, the first Humphrey. I wish everyone was as sure of anything in the present
world as I am of everything in the other one. Tell mother that. Now cheer up all round. Soon shall we <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">all</span></span> be dead &amp; happy. One or two tears are all there is to it and then in a click of the clock off we pop en route for His Blessed Majesty, our longlived Lord.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 17}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Brother dear, Izzy said, accept this in place of a handkerchief duster and bear it with you ever &amp; always &amp; when you use it think of one absent one. I will follow you with all my eyes. Teach me how to tumble, dear, and warn me whom to love.<a target="foot" id="fqz0002">&ordm;</a></p> </p>  </main>
