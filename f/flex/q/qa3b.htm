<p> Jaunty Jaun, as I was<a target="foot" id="fqz0008">&ordm;</a> shortly before that made aware, next halted to fetch a breath and to loosen (let God&apos;s son now be looking down on to the poor preambler!) both of his bruised brogues at the weir by Lazar&apos;s Walk (for far and wide was he noted for his humane treatment of any kind of abused footgear) a matter of maybe nine score or so
barrelhours distance off, as truly he merited to do. He was there, I could see, when I took a better look at him, greatly altered for the brighter, though still the graven image of himself as he was used to be, perspiring but happy, propped up restant against a slumbersome warden of the peace, one comestabulish Sigurdsen, who had tumbled on sleep at night duty behind the curing station amid the
embraces of a monopolised bottle.</p>
<p> Now, there were as many as twentynine daughters out of
<br><font color="green">{ms, 46}</font>
<br> their national hedgeschool (for I seemed to remember how it was still a look before you leap year) learning their antemeridian<a target="foot" id="fqz0009">&ordm;</a> lesson of life, aseated as they were upon the brink, attracted to the sight of the first human landmark while they paddled away with their eight and fifty pedalettes, all barely in their teens, in a charming concert to the
snores of the log who looked stuck to the sod as ever and oft he murmoaned in his Dutchener&apos;s native, visibly unmoved, over his treasure trove for the crown: Dotter deadbedstead mean <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">lily</span></span> diggy smuggy flasky.</p>
<p> Jaun (after he had in the first place doffed a hat and bowed to all the others in that chorus of praise to men of goodwill girls, who they were all making a tremendous fuss over him and his rosyposy smile and <a name="n11038b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n11all.htm#n11038b">smilingly smelling</a> the nice perfume off him for he was just the killingest ladykiller now you, Jaun, asking kindlily after
their healths and those of their dollies, he next went on to make a few stray remarks anent their personal appearances and the tastes displayed in their short frocks and all, of course, out of pure human respect for Jaun was the most purely
<br><font color="green">{ms, 47}</font>
<br> human being that ever was called man, Jaun, easily made out the features of his fond sister Izzy nor could he forget her as easily as all that ever after because he was brotherbesides her godfather as well and heaven knows he thought the world and all of her, poor good fond Jaun.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Sister dearest, Jaun delivered himself express as he began to take leave of her in the first place with deep affection, we honestly believe you sorely will miss us the moment we exit yet we feel as a martyr to the discharge of duty that it is about time we would go on our last long journey. This is the net results of your teachings in which we were raised, you, Sis, that
used to write to us the exceeding nice letters and be telling us (full well do we recall to mind) <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">your</span></span> thy oldworld tales of homespinning and derringdo and daddyho, those tales which whisked our heart so narrated by thou, our pet of the whole family and the mainsay of our house, the time we were tossing ourselves in bed, having been laid
up with Parrish&apos;s syrup for to share sweet affections with thee.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 48}</font> </p>
<p> Now then during our brief absence adhere to as many of the ten commandments as possible for you. Never miss your last mass. Never eat bad meat of a Good Friday. Never let a hog of the hill trample underhoof your lily of the valley. Never play ladies&apos; games on the Lord&apos;s day. Make a strong point of not singing risky songs at smokers the like of: White limbs they never stop teasing.
Especially beware please of being a party to any demoralising home life. That saps a chap. Recollect in the first place the perils that beset green girls. Put your best foot foremost on lowcut shirtwaists. Never lay bare your heart to the first man in the street. Don&apos;t on any account acquire a <u>penchant</u> for the fagend habit in
<a name="n10015f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10015f">halldoorways</a> between night and morning. Raw spirits is the root of all evil. Put the lid firmly on that jazz craze. If you feel you want healthy physical exercise to move your bowels why go out and skip. Have your weathereye out for furnished lodgers paying for their grub on tally with company and piano tunes, the too friendly friend
sort who may soon prove
<br><font color="green">{ms, 49}</font>
<br> your undoing should you, whilst Jaun is from home, grow accustomed to sitting <font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps"><sub>unread</sub></span></font>n his knees at petting parties with him fumbling in your bodice as a lead off and going on doing his idiot every time you gave him his chance about your glad neck and prying down into our past lives. It would be a terrible state
of affairs altogether were you to be <a name="n01093g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01093g">flummoxed</a><a target="foot" id="fqz0010">&ordm;</a><a name="n01093g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01093g"></a> by becoming a company keeper. Once for all I&apos;ll have no college swankers (you see I know those nightwalkers and their intentions look like) playing around your danger zone in the
danger years.</p>
<p> Take a brother&apos;s advice. Dip into the lives of the saints in fortnightly instalments for the betterment of your mind. Keep as cool as a cucumber your best preserved chastity. Rather than part with that vestalite emerald of the first importance to our family which you treasure up so much in the sanctuary situate where your nether extremes meet, nay, rather let the entire ekumene universe
perish off to pot first in a pitfall a thousand times over. Guard that gem, dearest sister: there is nothing on this cold world of ours to touch it. This jewel dear you&apos;re
<br><font color="green">{ms, 50}</font>
<br> cracked about there&apos;s very few of them gets it for there&apos;s nothing now but sable stoles and a runabout to catch it. Sing him a ring, touch me low. And I love you, O, my so and so.</p>
<p> So and so be careful during this lenten pastoral season, I mean to say, when the spring is in the bubbling.</p>
<p> Divulge, suddenly jouted out Jaun, clenching his manlies divulge to me the name and address of any lapwhelp who speaks to you on the street and volunteers to trifle with your roundlings without producing his proper letter of introduction first and, I don&apos;t care a twopenny hang who the mucky is, as sure as back we come from east the sea, with the gravel spinning from beneath our feet rest
assured that as we value the very name of sister that as soon as we do it will be worse for him. And why do we say that? Because then we&apos;ll damn soon show you how we&apos;ll break his face for him for making up to you before taking the measurements of your finger. No, we&apos;ll tell you what we&apos;ll do instead. We&apos;ll burst his mouth that&apos;s what we&apos;ll
<br><font color="green">{ms, 51}</font>
<br> do. Moreover after that bad luck to me if I don&apos;t think strongly about giving him into custody to the first policewoman I would meet or for that matter I might even take it into my head to swing for him and then wipe the street with him. In that case I won&apos;t be complete until I half kill him especially should he turn out to be a man about town of about forty or so having the usual
large family to support.</p>
<p> So you better keep in the straight, do you hear what I&apos;m praying?, or I&apos;ll be all over you myself and I&apos;ll give one puck in the crupper that will bring the blush of shame to your cheek do you hear me now?, and that you won&apos;t obliterate for the better part of a whole year <a name="n10110g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10110g">if you fail to</a> give a good account of
yourself and that&apos;s how I&apos;ll bottle your beauty for you, my bulling heifer, for &apos;tis I that have the pair of arms that carry a wallop between them.</p>
<p> How times and oft shall we think of thee far away on the pillow all through the empty years whilst moidered by the rattle of the doubledoorknockers!
<br><font color="green">{ms, 52}</font>
<br> The poet puts it better. Little girl from Liffeyside you fill a big roomy corner in my seat of the affections. O heavens, how I shall, if I live as I am hoping to do, placing my arm in yours, <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">strain</span></span> positively cover your two pure cheeks with kisses one of those happy days when you will of your own accord kiss me back and in that way
swap smug for smug when cherries next come back immediately my safe return from my destination to ignorance and bliss when the both of us will show our kindness by adopting all the sickest and poorest babes who. We will render social service, missus, and help clean up things. Look at the sludge of Harrington street. Bear in mind all the banana peels along Henry, Moore, Earl and Talbot streets.
Stand on, say, Aston&apos;s Quay and take a good longing gaze into any adjacent shopwindow you may choose and in about twenty minutes&apos; time turn <a name="sa0681o" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0681o">on your heels</a> towards the causeway and you will see how you will be coated with mush occasioned by the traffic in transit. Ask any disgusted lady cyclist who happened to be proceeding from
her
<br><font color="green">{ms, 53}</font>
<br> suburban groove or returning from her May devotions at Adam and Eve&apos;s, <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">m</span></span> womanoovering her Dunlop roadster along a cartrut, during the bank holiday gale and downpour when slates came freely off too many of our grand old tenements and pedestrianism was even difficult, you ask her what her laundry bill ran up to on last Monday.
Don&apos;t wait for the answer for if you were to do so what would be the answer which would greet your ears? Both of them. When will the longsuffering face of our beloved city get that longpromised wash? Or, better again, account to me for the fact that should you purchase any fish and vegetables you fancy at the moment from the same child&apos;s perambulator and having deposited your, let us
say, mackerel as well as its cauliflower upon either of the edges of the two sidewalks you take your stand in some nearby hallway to carefully note result the restingplaces selected are visited in rotation with such celerity by all the bowlers in the town. Do you know what? One of those days I will refuse to walk altogether for I think now that&apos;s about the limit.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 54}</font> </p>
<p> Sis dearest, Jaun added, sadly this time, is this the end? I&apos;d ask no kinder fate than to stay where I am at this present moment by local option in the birds&apos; lodging the pheasants among till well on into the night catching trophies of sturgeon by the armful and what small money I&apos;d be possessed of by poaching I&apos;d put it into the potheen at prime cost and I bet you all you
have on that I&apos;m the boy that&apos;d make it pay like fun <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">(come back to me!)</span></span> and I&apos;d come out tophole, nothing would stop me, and before you knew where I was I&apos;d be staggering humanity and royally rolling over in my tons of cash on the nail and I&apos;d never say die till I&apos;d run my shoestring into near a million as a
firstclass dealer and everything only <a name="n03168c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03168c">for one thing</a> that I&apos;d be awful anxious about the terrible cold in the amstophere that would perish the Danes to be atramental to the better half of my health and that&apos;s the truth.</p>
<p> Sis dearest, as I was saying to myself not very long ago it is our grief to go upon this benedictine errand but it is the most glorious mission in all our history. But we feel all serene, never you fret, as far as regards our cask
<br><font color="green">{ms, 55}</font>
<br> and it is a grand thing to be going to meet a king, not an everyday king, no, by gannies, but the overking of greater Dublin. We only wish everyone was as sure of anything in this present world as we are of everything in the one that&apos;s sure to come. Tell mother that. &apos;Twill amuse her.</p>
<p> Well, to the dickens with the whole business! The ends of these our passing lives are not now so far off as you might suppose. So now let ye create no scenes after me. Just a plain shays by the fire for absenter Jaun. Cheer up all round, let ye all, and let ye not be getting grief from it on my poor head even should we forfeit our life. Some time soon shall we all be dead and happy together in
the land of lost of time. So no lonesome stuff<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">, ladies</span></span>! Drink it off, ladies, please, the last stirrup cup! Parting&apos;s fun.</p>
<p> A grand big hearty laugh hopped out of him at the bare thought and all of them were just starting to yell with the laughing, Jaun, when quick as <a name="n10066e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10066e">mercury</a>, he wheeled right with his eyes blazing rather sternly. First he sighed and they nearly cried and then he replied:
<br><font color="green">{ms, 56}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; There is something more. It&apos;s prayers, prayers all the time in the suburbs of the heavenly gardens. There are no petty family squabbles up there, I can tell you. What is our miserable here today compared beside the pleasures of the morrow when life begins properly speaking.</p>
<p> Well, <a name="n05125k" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05125k">I enjoyed your</a> pick of dinner fine, I did. It&apos;s beginning to work and presently now you&apos;ll see me off on my usual rounds again to draw Terminus Lower and Killadown and the biggest house in Ireland and it&apos;s there I&apos;ll try and collect my extra fees owing to me by Kelly Esquire for undesirable printed matter.
I&apos;ll knock it out of him. I&apos;ll box it out of him. I&apos;ll stamp it out of him. I&apos;ll rattattattatter it out of him before I&apos;ll quit his doorstep. I&apos;ll <a name="n10001d" href="../../ff/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10001d">blackmail</a> him in arrears and daily and hourly I&apos;ll curse him till he pays my fine fee.</p>
<p> Well, here&apos;s looking at ye! You can stop as you are and wait and wish in vain till the grim reaper heaves anigh as a blesing in disguise. Devil a hair I care. If any highwayman was to try to hold me up and rob me of my rights I&apos;d let him have a pair of galloper&apos;s heels in the
<br><font color="green">{ms, 57}</font>
<br> face. Console yourself the best manner you can One or two tears is all there is to it and then in a click of the clock off we pop en route for His Blessed Majesty, our longlived lord. Hooray!</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Of course, Listen, benjamin brother Izzy said, flushing as she grabbed her male correspondent, of of course I&apos;m ashamed of my life of the bit of nosepaper which is all I can call my own but all the same, listen, accept this last minute gift from my hands in place of a proper handkerchief. It is indulgenced for forty nights and, listen, bear it with you ever and always
and, of course, when you make use of it, listen, think of one absent one, of course you know who sent it, on the face of the waters, like that romance in the bottle. Of course please forward it back by return in case anything happens so as I&apos;ll know in case I don&apos;t hear from you. Listen. I will follow you publicly with all my eyes and will always show you in private the most truest proof
of my <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">sympathy</span></span> constancy to you, and, of course, never will I give you away to anyone. You may trust me. Listen, here I&apos;ll wait on you all the time you&apos;re away
<br><font color="green">{ms, 58}</font>
<br> I swear to you I will, by Christmas, and I&apos;ll dress only in pensive grey till you remember me and, listen, I swear to you again every night at this hour I&apos;ll poke well under my bed for any males. So now teach me how to tumble, Jaun, and, listen, Jaun, warn me who to wed.<a target="foot" id="fqz0011">&ordm;</a></p> </p>  </main>
