<p> A great dab was frankily at the manual arith sure enough which was the bekase he knew from his cradle no boy better why his fingures were giving him whatfor to fife with. First there was boko &amp; then wigworms &amp; next tittlies and after cheekchaps &amp; last pickpocket and pickpocketpumb &amp; pickpocketpoint &amp; pickpocketprod pickpocketpromise &amp; upwithem. Anyhows after the more he
weighed always the fonder he fell of cardinals. Always would he be areciting of them up by rota, from fursed to laced, quickmarch to decemvir, so as to know the tenners, thumbs down<a target="foot" id="flz0003">&ordm;</a>. And ever and always, strues yourthere, would he be arecreating em in <a name="n23141b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n23all.htm#n23141b">lumerous</a> ways, like to throw of your cap, pac,
on to tin tall spilicans. Ace, deuce, tricks, quarts, quims. And on the other hand, sexes, suppers, oglers, novels and dice. What signifies all that but &apos;tis as strange to relate he,<a target="foot" id="flz0004">&ordm;</a> nonparile to <a name="n23124m" href="../../ff/fnbs/n23all.htm#n23124m">read, rite and reckon</a>, always caught dull marks in his nucleud and allgobrew.

<br> Casey&apos;s, first book of, page torn and dirty, and so, at long last, as it would fall out, had he to bid adeuce to the cardinhands he greatly missed. Dear hearts of my counting, it would be then, forewheel to back numbers and, there being no help for it, please lick one and turn over.</p>
<p> Problem the first. Construct an aquilittoral triangle. Probe loom. With his first handstoe in his sole salivarium.<a target="foot" id="flz0006">&ordm;</a> Concoct an equoangular trilitter. In the name of the teaser and of the tongs and of the mythametical tripods. Beatsoon.</p>
<p> Can you not do her, numb? asks <a name="n23107b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n23all.htm#n23107b">Dolph</a>, expecting the answer know. I cont, ken you, ninny? answers Kev, suspecting the answer guess. Nor was the noer long disappointed for simple as kisshams he was told. First mull a mugful of mud. Oglores, he prays, olorum! what would I do that for? That&apos;s a goosey&apos;s ganswer you&apos;re
giving me, he is told, what would you do that for? Take your mut for a first beginning. Very liffle mud that cometh out of Mam will doob. O guess. Mux it at a point of the coastmup to be called &alpha; but pronounced olfa.
