examples and, bejove, that same gallic rite is very prevalent down to this windy night in what was before <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">that</span></span> a land of nods in spite of all the blood, all the brains, all the brawn, all the bile, that was shed, that were shot, that was shook all the while for our people have still a great faith in the old ways innovated by him and it is
verily believed
<br><font color="green">{ms, 62v}</font>
<br> that not all the liquor that&apos;s in the queen&apos;s cellar and not all the gold that the Indus contains would ever induce them to go back to their ancient habits which as his response to his curses they let drop without another word too: and talking of missions in general &mdash; of course, this has nothing to say to his private
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">tuitions</span></span> when, so to put it, on the shaughraun &mdash; and <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">re</span></span> to return for a moment to the first landing if the pretty elizabess who then gave him the advantage of a good bath at her fair hands

<br> firm, <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Lagrimae</span></span> Lagrimatae and Gemiti, it must have been a terrible grief for whohowhowhow? the poor girl!: and no wonder so many of the men people offered to console with her and that&apos;s not the last of it either <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">(</span></span> &mdash; would it were! &mdash; but to think of him
finding a second elizabess where he did and how he did &mdash; forget now was it in a street or <a name="n23101c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n23all.htm#n23101c">by accident</a> &mdash; and to try to think of her trying to get that bearded virility into her limited lap at the same time for towelling purposes as if he were a nine months&apos; babe:
<br><font color="green">{ms, 59v}</font>
<br> well, dear me and you, if that is what the gentle passion has come to out there heaven help the hindmost and yet it begins to look like it, it does indeed, and it is no use trying to stop it either or telling human beings to take warning by the past: for, if you could see inside the cerebral saucepan of any one adolescent you would see many convolouli suggestive of other times &amp; lands,
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">ay and other</span></span> tongues too, and not alone that but, looking far into futurity, your own convolouli would reel to fancy the taking of what stale words were originally found for: and the best of it is that whereas the
