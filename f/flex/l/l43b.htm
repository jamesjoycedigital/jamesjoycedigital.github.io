<p class="flush">Whiles<a target="foot" id="flz0043">&ordm;</a>, one word burrowing on another, Standfest, the towelturbaned, and Flower in her wraparound, visage full of flesh and fat as hen&apos;s in forehead, Arianna and Blueybart, that royal pair, in their house of the hundred bottles, hight, the Goat and Compasses (Phone number 17&middot;69), discusst the past, the angerache of their
love<a target="foot" id="flz0044">&ordm;</a> and the hungerbrood it bore em,<a target="foot" id="flz0045">&ordm;</a> <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">scribbled</span></span> scribbledehobbles, in whose veins runs a mixture of, are head bent on their pensums. Dogs&apos; vespers are at end. Wind will be. Flying are the evenbirds. And, for one superstationer at least, the hearse of the
kine shall pass at last. What a terrible piece of business surely. But trifid tongue, others woo will and work for, and dove without gall<a target="foot" id="flz0048">&ordm;</a> that <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">bl</span></span> backslapping gladhander, his singing likeness with her whose mind&apos;s a jilldaws nest for she tears up letters she never posed pen upon when bother her
hair&apos;s
<br><font color="green">{ms, 258}</font>
<br> in a queer of a mood, these strive and in earnest. As if that three could solve, singly or together, the twohornheaded dulcarnon that stumped Alex among anders and drove him to pulfer turnips. And, my hat, what a worldall of weariness is theirs, waiting to hear their own proper mistakes.<a target="foot" id="flz0049">&ordm;</a> For how many duitsch guilders would one post now to the pillar?
For one hundred? For one hundred&apos;s thousand? And for what will all such taradiddle<a target="foot" id="flz0050">&ordm;</a> serve them in an after reeraw lifetime? If a gas consumer, habituated to marble mantels, buys a dozen of apples <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">very</span></span> every first Friday during a whole lean<a target="foot" id="flz0051">&ordm;</a> year at the
weight of too<a target="foot" id="flz0052">&ordm;</a> many sesterces a pound overthepoise, taking abbaco as seven point seven and letting born of bulrushes stand for any woman, what a grand total of sentinels in reindeer pelts and aided by a spick span of oxen fed<a target="foot" id="flz0053">&ordm;</a> upon Trinidad&apos;s shell
<br><font color="green">{ms, 259}</font>
<br> cocoa and miring in sheets and sheets of showers will it take to paper a trench ever so mucky yards longer than a cobbler&apos;s bulk is broad?</p>
<p> Will it make of one a good milker this having been bread and buttered up on superlatives? Or will this alter go to outlands in a peajacket as a roaming catharick<a target="foot" id="flz0054">&ordm;</a> and just not be silly or, caring dumb all toppings for the birthrate lean to loungily on his lentils? Wrong! Antrist animal will live dangerously and find somehow the funds to smoke diurnally a
box<a target="foot" id="flz0055">&ordm;</a> box of matches. Or if she seeks and mates an earth of heaven will she lilt that Barney take her home again?
<br><font color="green">{ms, 260}</font>
<br> For so long as shes in dimity read sex serials in a bummeltrain with a lot of uninteresting duck trousers hanging around, it is as wholly probable as a holy parable that the worst at long leash may hope to happen, such as go to meet Mary, miss Mamie and marry Meg. Why ask any Tossy Madden or little Nelly of Holy God sense from anything that shred scenting as how every annual has its actual
aroma?<a target="foot" id="flz0056">&ordm;</a> Even recollecting of a tree is far too beautiful for her<a target="foot" id="flz0057">&ordm;</a> to listen.

<p> Small blame be hers therefore that she shook her shoe off at geography giggle, doing provinces of India, with a whispered wilfulness heard from Hazelizod round this giddying globe! Bewise of Fanciulla&apos;s heart, the heart of Fanciulla, and her hand that&apos;s as gloveless as a peer&apos;s in the presence, <u>la pura e pia bella</u> of those hazelblue eyes and that linefree face. All four
will be readymaid marrying for real palship with all or any lovethieves when Jollycomes,

<br> out for it, mashing home. Though her loinstones be of jade and her moon increscent she will swoon over Percy Bysshe so as, as in the Askhimwhose language, to get a<a target="foot" id="flz0058">&ordm;</a> crush on the cornerman and only learn from a Dalcroze teachment the how to drop her gift<a target="foot" id="flz0059">&ordm;</a> umbrella. But her truest part, as the little grey nuns will
school her without fuss or muss either, since today is well thine but whose will tomorrow&apos;s be, is to beg two makes in change for one wing. But when there&apos;s no more tay for sugar the cosey arrives
<br><font color="green">{ms, 267}</font>
<br> that divinity backshapes their ends backview them how we will. For singleness on purpose is all their gender&apos;s bugbear especially when old which they all too soon get to look.</p>
<p> Pendent this time there he who will be either crowned or hanged scans the errors of history from the parrotbook of Datas. If the santimeter of Hairyoddities or Noah&apos;s misbelieving missus was to velivole back all the ways from Wallhollow and through
<br><font color="green">{ms, 264}</font>
<br> telluspeep of Whatswhatness, just boyjones upon those pages<a target="foot" id="flz0060">&ordm;</a> she would laugh that flat that after that she had sanked down on her fat arks they would shake all to sheeks. And pending this time he who, suckled at the breast of a peasant <a name="n12181g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n12all.htm#n12181g">fosterer</a>, because he nought would wet his weapon, will be
a coward&apos;s castle pulpiticianer and apostle walker from the ball of his footup when he is not shuttling the sacred rattle,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 265}</font>
<br> oriented actually though he be, sees not her signings nor the multiplyings of her shadow but is ating, as he thinks at present, for his private salivation of the knuts of knowledge so as to befit him for the massacre, by pitchcap and triangle, of the blissbrigade of the ignorants, though still preserving that stained glass face effect (you would surely swear butter would not melt in his
breeches) and piling up sapience as sagely as Anisocrates.</p> </p>  </main>
