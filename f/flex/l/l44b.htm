<p class="flush">While in Pacata Hibernia, one word burrowing on another, Standfest, our topical hero, signs is on his big bastile back and his white patch, the towelturbaned, and Flower, a silvering for her jubilee with eve&apos;s birch leaves for her jointure, our lady in waving, girt with a wraparound, visage full of flesh and fat as hen&apos;s in forehead, Airyanna and Blowybart, that royal
pair, in their house of the hundred bottles, a palace of quicken boughs, hight, the Goat and Compasses (phone number 17:69 if you want to know) discusst the past, his sea arms round her, her eyne ashipwracked, the angerache of their love and the hungerbrood it bore em, scribbledehobbles, in whose veins runs a mixture of, are head bent hard upon their pensums.</p>
<p> It is turned of seven with eight chimes all tolled. Dogs&apos; vespers are at end. Yet wind will be ere fruminy time be come and asterisks answer the most devouted of us. Flying too are the evenbirds. And, for one superstationer at least, the hearse of the kine shall pass at last. What a terrible piece of business surely for such as keep his peace and follow his
<br><font color="green">{ms, 270}</font>
<br> war, that old king must be killed off<a target="foot" id="flz0077">&ordm;</a> withsamt his dam and embalmed in honey for dynastic continuity, rivers breaking forth for joy at his funeral!</p>
<p> But trifid tongue, others woo will and work for, becaused of his cleverism, and dove without gall, that backslapping gladhander and his singing likeness who lives more in the florid future than in a past of bloody altars with her whose mind&apos;s a jilldaw&apos;s nest since she tears up letters she ne&apos;er posed a pen upon when bother her goldfashioned&apos;s in such a queer of a mood that
she simply can&apos;t stand it, a couple and an odd one they strive and in earnest.</p>
<p> As if that three could solve, singly or together, the twohornheaded dulcarnon that stumped Alex among anders and drove him to pulfer turnips. And, my hat, what a worldall&apos;s woe of weariness is theirs, waiting to hear their own proper mistakes. For<a target="foot" id="flz0078">&ordm;</a> how many duitsch guilders would one post now to the pillar? For one hundred? For one hundred&apos;s
thousand?
<br><font color="green">{ms, 271}</font>
<br> Why for? And for what will all such taradiddle serve them in an<a target="foot" id="flz0079">&ordm;</a> after reeraw lifetime? If a gas consumer, habituated to marble mantels, buys a dozen of apples every other first Friday during a whole lean year at the weight of too many sesterces a pound overthepoise, taking abbaco as seven point seven and letting born of bulrushes stand for any woman,
what a grand total of sentinels in reindeer pelts and aided by a spick span of oxen, fed upon Trinidad&apos;s shell cocoa and miring in sheets and sheets of showers will it take to paper a trench even<a target="foot" id="flz0080">&ordm;</a> so mucky yards longer than a cobbler&apos;s bulk is broad?</p>
<p class="flush">Will it make of one a good milker this having been bread and buttered up on superlatives? Or will this alter go to outlands in a peajacket as a roaming catharick and just not be silly or, caring dumb all toppings for the birthrate lean to loungily on his lentils? Wrong! Antrist animal will live dangerously and mickleless as never a wight was, find somehow the funds to smoke
diurnally a box of matches. Or if she seeks
<br><font color="green">{ms, 272}</font>
<br> and mates an earth of heaven will she lilt that Barney take her home again? For so long as shes in dimity underalls even if one piece ensembled read sex serials in a bummeltrain with a lot of uninteresting duck trousers hanging around, it is as wholly probable as a holy parable that the worst at long leash may hope to happen, such as go to meet Mary, miss Mamie and marry Meg. Why ask any
Tossy Madden or little Nelly of Holy God sense from anything that shred scenting as how every annual has its actual aroma. Even recollecting of a tree is far too lovely a spellbinder for her to listen.</p>
<p> Small blame be hers therefore that she shook her shoe off at geography giggle, doing provinces of Persia, when Pa let me go too&apos;s tonic sulphur was outsung, with a whispered wilfulness heard from Hazelizod round this giddying globe! Bewise of Fanciulla&apos;s heart, Remember she speaks Cashmir and you cannot industand. Bewise of Fanciulla&apos;s heart, the heart of Fanciulla, and her hand
that&apos;s as gloveless as a peer&apos;s in the
<br><font color="green">{ms, 273}</font>
<br> presence, <u>la pura e pia bella</u> of those hazelblue eyes of woodside beauty and that linefree face. All four will be readymaid marrying for real palship with all or any lovethieves when Jollycomes, out for it, mashing home. Though her loinstones be of jade and her moon increscent she will swoon over Percy Bysshe so as, as in the Askhimwhose language, to get a crush on the cornerman and
only learn from a Dalcroze teachment the how to drop her umbrella.</p>
<p> But her truest part, as the little grey nuns will school her without fuss or muss either, with brother Agnus in their background, since today is well thine but whose will tomorrow&apos;s be, is to beg two makes in change for one wing. But when there&apos;s no more tay for sugar the cosey arrives that divinity showshapes their ends backview them how we will. For singleness on
purpose<a target="foot" id="flz0083">&ordm;</a> is all their gender&apos;s bugbear especially<a target="foot" id="flz0084">&ordm;</a> when old which they all too soon<a target="foot" id="flz0085">&ordm;</a> get to look.</p>
<p> Pendent this<a target="foot" id="flz0086">&ordm;</a> time there he who will be either crowned or<a target="foot" id="flz0087">&ordm;</a> hanged scans
<br><font color="green">{ms, 274}</font>
<br> the errors of history<a target="foot" id="flz0088">&ordm;</a> from the parrotbook of Datas. If the santimeter of Hairyoddities or Noah&apos;s misbelieving missus was to<a target="foot" id="flz0090">&ordm;</a> velivole back all the ways<a target="foot" id="flz0091">&ordm;</a> from Wallhollow and through their telluspeep of whatswhatness, just boyjones upon those pages she would laugh that flat
that after that she had sanked down on her fat arks they would shake all to sheeks. And pending this time too he, who, suckled at the breast of a peasant fosteress, because he nought would wet his weapon, will be a coward&apos;s castle pulpiticianer and apostle walker from the ball of his footup when he is not shuttling the sacred rattle, oriented actually though he be, sees not her signings nor
the multiplyings of her shadow but is ating, as he thinks at present, for his private salivation of the knuts of knowledge so as to befit him for the massacre, by pitchcap and triangle, of the blissbrigade of the ignorants, while still preserving that stained glass face effect (you would surely swear butter would not melt in his breeches) and piling up sapience as sagely as Anisocrates.</p> </p>
