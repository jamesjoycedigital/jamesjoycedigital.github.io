<p> A great dab was Franky at the manual arith sure enough which was the bekase he knew no boy better why his fingures were giving him whatfor. Anyhows always fond was he of cardinals. Always would he be areciting of them up by rota, from fursed to laced, quickmarch to decemvir, so as to know the tenners, thumb. And ever and always, strues yourthere, would he be arecreating em, like to throw of
your hat, pat, on to tin tall spilicans. Ace, deuce, tricks, quarts, quims. And on the other hand, sexes, suppers, oglers, novels and dice. What signifies all that but &apos;tis as strange to relate he always caught dull marks in his nucleud and allgobrew. O, that bate him up! Binomeans to be comprendered. The aximones.<a target="foot" id="flz0005">&ordm;</a> Equal to = hsaoc,</p>

<p> Can you not do her, numb? asks <font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">unread</span></font>, expecting the answer no. I cont, ken you, ninny? answers Frankey, expecting the answer yes. Nor was he long disappointed for simple as kisshands he was told. First take a mugful of mud. Oglores, he prays,! what would I do that for? That&apos;s a goosey&apos;s ganswer you give, he is
told, what would you do that for? Take your mud for a first beginning. Any liffey mud will do. Dump it at a point of coast to be called &alpha; but pronounced olfa.
