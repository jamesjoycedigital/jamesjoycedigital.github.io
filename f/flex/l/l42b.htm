<p class="flush">While, one word burrowing ~on~* another, Standfest~, the~* towelturbaned, and flower in her wrap around, face full of flesh and fat as hen&apos;s in forehead, ~[Airy Ann &amp; Blue Bart] Ariana and Blueybart, that~* royal pair in their house of the hundred bottles discusst the past the angerache of their love and the hungerbrood it bore them, the fairs at home and ~the~* expurge
trade, and walking progress hinks linkafuss foremost the shellroad path from dayfall to the shrilling of the<a target="foot" id="flz0025">&ordm;</a> crowcrested,<a target="foot" id="flz0026">&ordm;</a> scribbledehobbles are bent on their pensums. Trifid tongue, others woo will and work for, and dove without gall,<a target="foot" id="flz0027">&ordm;</a> the backslapping glandhander his singing
likeness,~[and she] with her~* whose mind&apos;s a jilldaw&apos;s<a target="foot" id="flz0028">&ordm;</a> nest<a target="foot" id="flz0029">&ordm;</a> who tears up letters she never put pen upon when bother her hair&apos;s in a queer of a mood. As if that three could<a target="foot" id="flz0030">&ordm;</a> solve a twohornheaded<a target="foot" id="flz0031">&ordm;</a> dulcarnon that stumped Alex
among anders and drove him to pulfer turnips. And, my hat, what a worldall of weariness is theirs waiting to hear their proper mistakes! For how many guldens would one post now to the pillar? For one hundred? For one hundred&apos;s thousand? And to what will&apos;t all serve them in an after reeraw ~[life] lifetime~*? If a gas consumer,<a target="foot" id="flz0032">&ordm;</a> habituated to marble
mantels,<a target="foot" id="flz0033">&ordm;</a> buys a dozen of apples every first Friday during a whole leap year at the weight of ~[seven] so many~* sesterces per pound overthepoise, taking abbaco as~[.7] 7.7~* and letting born of bulrushes stand for any ~[W] woman~* what ~a~* grand total of sentinels in reindeer pelts and aided by a span of oxen fed<a target="foot" id="flz0034">&ordm;</a> on
Trinidad&apos;s shellcocoa<a target="foot" id="flz0035">&ordm;</a> ~and miring~* in sheets and sheets of ~[rain] showers~* will it take to paper a trench fifteen yards than a cobbler&apos;s bulk is broad?
<br><font color="green">{ms, 253}</font> </p>
<p class="flush">Will it make of one a good milker the having been up on superlatives? Or will he go away in a peajacket live rough and just not be silly or not care toppings for the birthrate and lean loungingly on his lentils? Or where will he find funds to smoke a whole box of matches diurnally? Or if she makes an earth of heaven will she lilt that Barney take her home again? For so long as
shes in dimity<a target="foot" id="flz0037">&ordm;</a> read serials in a bummeltrain with a lot of uninteresting duck trousers<a target="foot" id="flz0038">&ordm;</a> hanging around it is as wholly probable as a holy parable that the worst at least at last may happen, such as go to meet Mary,<a target="foot" id="flz0039">&ordm;</a> miss Mamy and mary Meg. Why ask her or Tossy Madden sense from
anything that shred since every annual has its own aroma? <u>Quid vobis videtur?</u><a target="foot" id="flz0040">&ordm;</a> Even remembering of a tree is too beautiful for her spellbound to listen.</p>
<p class="flush">Small blame be hers therefore if she shook her shoe off at geography giggle doing rivers of India with a whisper of wilfulness heard round the giddying globe! Bewise of Fanciulla&apos;s heart, the heart of Fanciulla. And her hand that&apos;s as gloveless as a peer&apos;s in the presence|x, <u><a name="sd2759k" href="../../FF/fnbs/sd2all.htm#sd2759k">pura &egrave; pia bella</a></u>
of the hazelblue eyes,|x* and how both will be ready maid marrying when Jollicomes matching home.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 254}</font> </p>
<p class="flush">Though her loinstones be ~of~* jade and moon increscent she will swoon over Shelly to get a crush on the coalman or to learn from Dalcroze<a target="foot" id="flz0041">&ordm;</a> how to drop her umbrella. But her true line, as the little grey nuns<a target="foot" id="flz0042">&ordm;</a> will show her without fuss or muss either ~[for] since~* today is thine but whose ~will~*
tomorrow ~be,~* is to beg two makes ~[for] in change of~* a wing but when there&apos;s no more tay for sugar the cosey and she&apos;s looked her last of lonesomeness ~[for that] comes the~* divinity showshapes ~[their] her~* ends backview them how we will.
