<p class="di">&mdash; Amtsadam! Sir, to you! Eternest cittas, heil! Here we are again! I am bubub brought up under a camel act of dynasties long since out of print, the first of Shitric Shilkanbeard, but I am known throughout the world wherever my good Allenglisches&apos; Angleslachsen is spoken by Sall and Will from Augustanus to Ergastulus, as this is, protested by saints and
<br><font color="green">{f10, 414}</font>
<br> sinners eyeeye alike as a cleanliving man and, as a matter of fact, by my halfwife, I think how our public at large appreciates it most highly from me that I am as cleanliving as could be and that my game was a fair average since I perpetually kept my ouija ouija wicket up. On my very wife I never was nor can afford to be guilty of breach, crim crig con, malfeasance or trespass against parson
with the person of a youthful girl frifrif friend chirped Apples, acted by Miss Dashe, when I would touch to her dot and feel most greenily of her unripe ones, as it should prove most unniece and far too baad, nieceless to say, to my reputation for daughters-in-trade being lightly clad. I should her have awristed was she but tinkling of such a tink. And as a mere matter of fact I tell of myself
how I popo possess the ripest littlums wifukie around the globelettes globes upon which she was raping away first with the consolation prize in my serial dreams of fair women, Mannequins Passe, handicapped by two breasts in opera tops. A remarkable little garment. What spurt! I kickkick keenly love

<br> such, particularly while savouring of their flavours at their most perfect best when served with heliotrope eyelips, as this is, where I do drench my jolly soul on the pupure beauty of hers past.</p>
<p> She is my bestpreserved wholewife, sowell her as herafter, in Evans&apos;s eye, with the smallest shoenumber outside of Chinatins. They are jolly dainty. May we not recommend them? And, alas, our private chaplain of Lambeyth and Dolekey, an always sadfaced man, who has visited our various hard hearts and reins by imposition of fufuf fingers, in that Upper Room, can speak loud to you some quite
complimentary things about my clean characteracting even, when detected, in the dusk, painful though such recital prove to me, as this is, when I introduced her (frankfurters numbourines why drive fear!) to our fourposter singing with euphonium in our altogether duckkyheim homesweetened gleegloom there&apos;s gnome sweeplaces like theresweep Norwage. First Murkiss, or so they sang. Dodo! O

Michael Engels is your man. Let Michael relay Sutton and tell you people here who have the phoney habit (it was remarketable) in his

I have been told I own stolemines or something of that sort in the sooth of Spainien. Hohohoho! Have I said ogso how I abhor myself vastly (truth to

Paybads florinners moved against us and I matt them Bartholomew: milreys (mark!) onfell and (luc!) I arose, Daniel in Leonden.
The soord of Whenhislaws was mine and mine great great great. I schicked Duke Wellinghof to shockle Roy Shackleton, walhalloo, walhalloo, walhalloo mourn in playn! I braved Brien Berueme to berow him against the Loughlins, all her tolkies shraking: Fugabollags! Lusqu&apos;au bou! Under law&apos;s marshall did I thole till lead&apos;s plumbate relieved me. I made preyer upon acorpolous and fastings

For sleeking beautes I spinned their nightinveils, to slumbred beasts I tummed the tief air. All in my thicville was thorough fair but in the meckling of my burgh was the site forbid: I made uisance of wellpressed meadows and peddled freely in the scrub: I
heard my libertilads making fray through their curraghcoombs and my trueblues herusalaming before Wailingtone&apos;s Wall: I have reared my vonderbilt hut in the night and at morn I was encompassed of mushroofs: the more secretly bi built, the more openly plastered. I considered the lilies on the veldt and unto Balkis did I disclothe mine glory. Lo, I have looked long upon my pompadours in their

gathered em: Wherefore has my sovereign lord V. King regards for me and he has given to me my neckname (flister it!) which is second fiddler to nomen. Idle were it, repassing to the elder disposition, in so and such a matter as me it so besitteth, to inquire whether I, huddledtogether, be the massproduct of teamwork or I, draggedasunder, the forced outcome of group marriage or carried of cloud
