<br> book and ruling rod, vien of my vergin page, her chastener ever, I did learn my little anna countrymouse in alpabeater cameltemper, from alderbirk to tannenyou, with myraw rattan atter dundrum, ooah oyir oyir oyir: my seven wynds I trailed to maze her and ever a wynd had saving closes and all these closes flugged with the gust, hoops for her, hats off for him and reruffles through
Neeblow&apos;s garding. And that was why Blabus was razing his wall and eltering the suzannes of his nighboors. And I did spread before my Livvy, where Lord Street lolls and ladies linger and Cammomile Pass cuts Primrose Rise and Coney Bend bounds Mulbreys Island but never a blid had bledded or bludded since long agore when the whole blighty acre was bladey well pessovered, my selvage mats of
lecheworked lawn, my carpet gardens of Guerdon City, with chopes pyramidous and mouselimes and beaconphires and colossets and pensilled turrisses for the busspleaches of the summiramies and esplanadas statuesque and templeogues: the pardonell of Maynooth, Fra Teobaldo, Nielsen, rare admirable, Jean de Porteleau, Conall Gretecloke, Guglielmus Caulis and the eiligh ediculous Passivucant
(glorietta&apos;s inexcelsiored!): for irkdays and for folliedays till the comple anniums of calendarias, gregoromaios and gypsyjuliennes as such are pleased of theirs to walk: and I planted for my own hot lisbing lass a quickset vineyard and rigs of barlow and bowery nooks and greenwished villas and pampos animos and (N.I.) necessitades iglesias and pons for aguaducks, a hawthorndene, a
feyrieglenn, the hallaw vall, the dyrchace, Finmark&apos;s Howe, and I fenced it about with huge Chesterfield elms and Kentish hops against budmonth and gleanermonth with a magicscene wall (rimrim! rimrim!) for a Queen&apos;s Garden of her Phoenix: and (hush! hush!) I brewed for my alpine plurabelle, wigwarming wench (speakeasy!), my granvilled brandold Dublin lindub, the free, the froh, the
frothy freshener, the pusspuss pussyfoot, to split the spleen of her maw: and I laid down before the trotters of my eblanite my stonybattered waggonways, my nordsoud circulums, my eastmoreland and westlandmore,  running boullawards and syddenly parading (hearsemen, opslo! nuptiallers, get storting!)
<br><font color="green">{f10, 431}</font>
<br> whereon, in mantram of truemen like yahoomen (expect till dutc cundoctor summoneth him all fahrts to pay, velkommen all hankinhunkn in this vogn of Hoseyeh!), claudesdales with arabinstreeds, Roamer Reich&apos;s rickyshaws with Hispain&apos;s king&apos;s trompateers, madridden mustangs,
<br><font color="green">{f39, 554}</font>
<br> buckarestive bronchos, postershays and turnintaxis and tall tall tilburys and nod nod noddies, others gigging gaily, some sedated in sedans, my priccoping gents aroger, aroger, my damsels softsidesaddled covertly, covertly, and Lawdy Dawe a perch behind, the mule and the hinny and the jennet and the mustard nag and piebald shjelties and skewbald awknees steppit lively for her pleashadure
(lift ye the left and rink ye the right!): and she lafaughed in her diddydid domino to the switcheries of the whip. Down with them! Kick! Playyup!</p>
