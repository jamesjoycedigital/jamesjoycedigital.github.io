On my very wife I never was nor can afford to be guilty of breach, crim crig con, malfeasance or trespass against parson
with the person of a youthful girl frifrif friend chirped Apples, acted by Miss Dashe, when I would touch to her dot and feel most greenily of her unripe ones, as it should prove most unniece and far too baad to my reputation for daughters-in-trade being lightly clad.
