<p> O tell me all now about Anna Livia. I want to know all about Anna Livia. Well, you know Anna Livia? Yes, of course, I know Anna. Tell me all. Tell me now. You&apos;ll die when you hear. Well, you see, when the old chap did what you know. Yes, I know, go on. Or whatever it was he did in <a name="n09062f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n09all.htm#n09062f">the park</a>. He&apos;s an awful old rep. What was
it he did at all? It was in the paper what he did. O, the old rep! What age is he at all at all? Sure, she&apos;s nearly as bad herself. Who? Anna Livia? Yes, Anna Livia. Do you know that she was calling girls into him? She was? Ah, go to God? O, tell me all I want to hear. Letting on she didn&apos;t care. Didn&apos;t you see her at the window

Well, I never heard the like of that. Tell me more. Tell me all. Well, the old chap was as
glum as anything, sitting moping all by himself &amp; there was Anna Livia running about as if she was ten in a short skirt and painted cheeks trying to <a name="n06002j" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06002j">whistle</a> the rakes of Mallow and not a budge out of him no more than the wall. Is that a fact? That&apos;s a fact. And do you know what she started singing then? You&apos;ll never guess.
Tell me. Tell me. I loved you better than you knew. Ah, go to

<br> God, is it Anna Livia? As God is my judge. And then she&apos;d go &amp; stand in the door and every servant girl that passed she&apos;d <a name="n08004e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08004e">make a sign</a> to step inside. You don&apos;t say! I do! I do! Calling them all &amp; holding up a half a crown &amp; showing them how to <a name="n08033l" href="../../ff/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08033l">bill

<p> O go on &amp; tell me more. Tell me every single thing. I want to know every single thing. Well, now comes the childer&apos;s part. How many childer has she at all? God only knows. <a name="n08189d" href="../../ff/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08189d">I hear she has 111</a> A hundred &amp; how? They did well to call her Plurabelle. O my! Such a flock! She must have been a gadabout in her day, so she must.
So she was, you bet. Tell me, tell me, who was the 1st? She says herself she never knew who he was or what he did or when he crossed her.

There was a holy hermit there near <a name="n08147l" href="../../ff/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08147l">Luggelaw</a> one day in July and so young &amp; shy &amp; so <font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font> she looked he put his two hands in her flowing hair, that was rich red like the brown bog and he couldn&apos;t help, thirst was too hot for him, he cooled his
lips time after time again at Anna Livia&apos;s freckled cheek. Why was she freckled? How long was her hair? O go on, go on, go on! I mean about what you know. I know what you mean. I&apos;m going on. <a name="n03076f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03076f">Where did I stop?</a> Don&apos;t stop. Go on, go on!</p>
<p> Well after it was put in the papers <a name="n07a02j" href="../../ff/fnbs/n07all.htm#n07a02j">everywhere</a> ever you went you found <a name="n07a02j" href="../../ff/fnbs/n07all.htm#n07a02j">his picture</a> <a name="n09136m" href="../../ff/fnbs/n09all.htm#n09136m">upside down</a> so she made a plan, the <a name="sa0801be" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0801be">mischiefmaker</a>, the like of
it now you never heard. What plan. Tell me quickly! What the mischief did she do? Well, she borrowed a bag, a mailbag, from one of her sons, Shaun the Post, and then she went &amp; made herself up. O, I can&apos;t tell you. It&apos;s too funny. Here, sit down, go easy, be quiet. Tell me slowly. Take
<br><font color="green">{ms, 77}</font>
<br> your time. Breathe deeply. That&apos;s the way. Slowlier.</p>
<p> She let her hair loose and down to her heels it flowed and then she washed herself from crown to sole with bogwater and <a name="n08128e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08128e">mud</a>soap and then she wove a garland for her hair <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">of</span></span> and pleated it and plaited it of meadowgrass &amp;
<a name="sa0984t" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0984t">riverflags</a> and bulrushes &amp; waterweeds &amp; leaves of weeping willow and then she made her bracelets and her anklets and her necklet of cobblestones and pebbles and <a name="n08100j" href="../../ff/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08100j">rich gems &amp; rare</a> gems. And then she sent her maid to Humphrey with a request that she might leave him
for a moment and then with her bag upon her shoulder out at last she came.</p>
