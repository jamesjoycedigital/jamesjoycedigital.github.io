are rusty rubbing the mouldaw stains. And the dneepers of wet and the gangres of sin in it! What was it he did a tail at all on Animal Sendai? And how long was he under lough and neagh? It was put in the papers what he did, nicies and priers, the King fierceas Humphrey, with illysus distilling, exploits and all. But time will tell. I know it will. Time untamed will hist for no man. O, the old old
rep! And the cut of him! And the strut of him! How he used to hold his head as high as a howeth, the famous old duke alien, with a hump of grandeur on him like a walking rat! And his derry&apos;s own drawl and his corksown blather and his doubling stutter and his gullaway swank. Ask Lictor Hackett or Lector Reade or Garda Growley or the Boy with the Billyclub. How eld is he a called at all? Huges
Caput Earlyfouler. Or where was he born or how was he found? Urgothland, Tvistown on the Kattekat? New Hunshire, Concord on the Merrimake? Was her banns never loosened in Adam and Eve&apos;s and were him and her ever spliced? Flowey and Mount on the brink of time makes wishes and fears for a happy isthmass. O, pass me that and oxus another! Don Dom Dombdomb and his wee follyo! I heard he dug good
tin with his doll when he raped her home, Sabrine asthore, in a perokeet&apos;s cage, by dredgerous lands and devious delts, playing catched and mythed with the gleam of her shadda, past auld min&apos;s manse and Maisons Allfou and the rest of incurables and the last of immurables, the quaggy way for stumbling. Who sold you that jackalantern&apos;s tale? In a gabbard he barqued it, the boat of
life, from the harbourless Ivernikan Okean, till he spied the loom of his landfall and he loosed two croakers from under his tilt, the old Phenician rover. By the smell of her kelp they made the pigeonhouse. Like fun they did! But where was Himself, the timoneer? That marchantman he follied their scutties right over the wash, his cameleer&apos;s burnous breezing up on him, till with his runagate

Didn&apos;t you know he was a bairn of the sea, Wasserbourne the waterbaby? Havemmarea, so he was. H.C.E. has a briny ee. Sure, she&apos;s nearly as bad as him herself. Who? Anna Livia? Ay, Anna Livia! Do you know she was calling backwater girls from all around to go in till him, her erring man, and tickle the pontiff aisy-oisy? She was? Gota pot! Well, that&apos;s the limmat!

Didn&apos;t you spot her in her windeye, wubbling up on an osiery chair, with a meusic before her all cunniform letters, pretending to ribble a reedy derg on a fiddle she bows without a band on? Sure she can&apos;t fiddan a dee, with bow or abandon! Srue, she can&apos;t! Just a suck. Well, I never heard the like of that! Tell me

<p> Well, old Humber was as glommen as grampus, with the tares at his thor and the buboes for ages and neither bowman nor shot abroad and bales ablaze on the crests of rockies and devil a lamp in kitchen or church and giant&apos;s holes in Grafton&apos;s causeway, setting moping on his benk, drammen and drummin, his childlinen scarf to encourage his obsequies, where he&apos;d check their

And there she was, Anna Livia, she darent catch a winkle of sleep, purling around like a chit of a child, in a Lapsummer skirt and damazon cheeks for to wiss a bonzour to her dear dubber Dan, with neuphraties and sault from his maggias.

And brahming to him down the feedchute, with all kinds of fondling endings, the poother rambling off her nose: <i>Vuggybarney, Wickerymandy! Hello, ducky, please don&apos;t die!</i> Do you
know what she started cheeping then, the voice of her like a watergluck? You&apos;ll never guess. Tell me. Tell me. <i>Phoebe, dearest, tell, O tell me</i> and <i>I loved you better nor you knew</i>. And letting on she was daft about the old warbly sangs from over holmen, <i>High hellskirt saw ladies hensmoker lilyhung pigger</i>, and Oom Bothar below in his sandy cloak as deaf as a yawn. Go away!
Poor deef old deery! Yare only teesing! Anna Liv? As Chalk is my judge! And didn&apos;t she up and rise and go and trot down and stand in her douro, puffing her old dudheen, and every country wench or farmerette walking the pilend roads, Sowy, Fundally, Daery or Maery, Milucre, Awny or Graw, usedn&apos;t she make her a sign to slip inside by the sullyport? You don&apos;t say the sillypost? I did.
And I do. Calling them in one by one (To Blockbeddum here! Here the Shoebenacaddie!) and legging a jig or so on the sihl to show them how to shake their benders and the dainty how to bring to mind the gladdest garments out of sight and all the way of a maid with a man and making a sort of a cackling noise like two and a penny or half a crown and holding up a silver shiner. Lordy, lordy, did she
so? Well, of all the ones ever I heard! Throwing all the nice little whores in the world at him! To any captured wench you wish of no matter what sex of playful ways two add a tammar a lizzy alass to hug and have haven in Humpy&apos;s apron!</p>

Some say she had three figures to fill and confined herself to a hundred eleven. She can&apos;t
remember half of the cradlenames she smacked on them by the grace of her boxing bishop&apos;s infallible slipper. A hundred and how? They did well to rechristien her Plurabelle. O loreley!

She says herself she hardly knows whuon the annals her graveller was, a dynast of Leinster, a wolf of the sea,
or what he did or how young she played or when and where and how often he jumnpad her. She was just a young thin pale soft shy slim slip of a thing then, sauntering, and he was a heavy trudging lurching lieabroad of a Curraghman, making his hay for the sun to shine on, as tough as the oaktrees (peats be with them!) used to rustle that time down by the dykes of killing Kildare, that forstfellfoss

Neya, narev, naux and no! Then whereabouts in Ow and Ovoca? Was it
north by south or Lucan Yokan or where the hand of man has never set foot? Dell me where, the very first time! I will if you listen. You know the dingling dale of Luggelaw? Well, there once dwelt a local heremite, Michael Arklow was his riverend name (with many a sigh I aspersed his lavabibs!), and one venersderg in junojuly, so sweet and so fresh and so limber she looked, Nance the Nixie, Nanon
L&apos;Escaut, in the silence, of the sycomores, all listening, the kind of curves you simply can&apos;t stop feeling, he plunged both of his newly anointed hands up to his wrists in the singing saffron streams of her hair, parting them and soothing her and mingling it, that was deepdark and ample like the red bog at sundown. Maass! He cuddle not help himself, thurst was too hot on him, he had to
forget the monk in the man, so, rubbing her up and smoothing her down, he cooled his lips in smiling mood, kiss akiss after kisokiss (as he warned her never to, never to, never), on Anna-na-Poghue&apos;s

Two lads in their breeches went through her before that, Barefoot Byrne and Wary Wade, Lugnaquillia&apos;s noble pair, before she had a hint of a hair at her fanny to hide or a bossom to tempt a birch canoedler, not to mention a bulgy porterhorse barge. And ere that
again, ledy, ledy, all unredy, too faint to buoy the fairiest rider, too frail to flirt with a cygnet&apos;s plume, she was licked by a hound, Chirripa-Churruta, while poing her pee, pure and simple, on the spur of the hill in old Kippure, in birdsong and shearingtime, but first of all, worst of all, the wiggly livvly, she sideslipped out by a gap in the Devil&apos;s Glen while Sally her nurse was
sound asleep in a sloot and fell over a spillway before she found her stride and lay and wriggled in all the stagnant black pools of rain under a fallow coo and she laughed innocefree with her limbs aloft and a whole drove of maiden hawthorns blushing and looking askance upon her.</p>

<br> Through her catchment ring she freed them easy, with her hips&apos; hurrahs for her knees&apos; dontelleries. The only pair with frills in old the plain. So they are. Well, well! And there&apos;s her nubilee letters too. Ellis on quay in scarlet thread. Linked for the world on a flushcoloured field. Annan exe after to show they&apos;re not Laura Kehoe&apos;s.

<p> First she let her hair fall and down it flussed to her feet its teviots winding coils. Then, mothernaked, she sampood herself with galawater and mudsoap, upper and lower, from crown to sole. Next she greased the groove of her keel, warthes and wears and mole and itcher, with antifouling butterscotch and turfentine and serpenthyme, and with leafmould she ushered round prunella isles and islets
dun allover her little mary. And after that she wove a garland for her hair. She pleated it. She plaited it. Of meadowgrass and riverflags, the bulrush and waterweed, and of fallen griefs of weeping willow. Then she made her bracelets and her anklets and her armlets and a jetty amulet for necklace of clicking cobbles and pattering pebbles and rumbledown rubble, richmond and rare, of Irish
rhinestones and shellmarble bangles. That done, a dawk of smut to her airy eye, and the lellipos cream to her lippeleens and the pick of the paintbox for her pommettes, from strawbirry reds to extray violates, and she sent her boudeloire maids to His Affluence, Ciliegia Grande and Kirschie Real, with respecks from his missus, seepy and sewery, and a request she might leave him for a minnikin. A

eyes: and a fishnetzeveil she had to keep the sun from spoiling her wrinkles: potatorings boucled the loose lobs of her listeners: her nude cuba stockings were salmonspotspeckled: she sported a shimmy of hazegrey tinto that never was fast till it ran in the washing: stout stays, the rivals, lined her length: her bloodorange bockknickers, a two in one garment, showed natural nigger boggers,
fancyfastened, free to undo: her blackstripe tan joseph was sequansewn and teddybearlined, with wavy rushgreen epaulettes and a leadown here and there of royal swansruff: a brace of gaspers stuck in her hayrope garters: her civvy codroy coat with alpheubett buttons was boundaried round with a twobar tunnel belt: a fourpenny bit in each pocketside weighed her safe from the blowaway windrush: she
had a clothespeg tight astride of her joki&apos;s nose and she kept on grinding a sommething quaint in her fiumy mouth: and the rrreke of the fluve of the tail of the gawan of her snuffdrab siouler&apos;s skirt trailed ffiffty Irish miles behind her long the road.</p>
<p> Hellsbells, I&apos;m sorry I missed her! Sweet umptyum and nobody fainted. But in whelk of her mouths? Was her naze alight? Everyone that saw her said the dowse little delia looked a bit queer.

The rivulets ran to see, the glashaboys, the pollynooties. Out of the paunshaup on to the pyre. And they all about her, youths and maidens,
rickets and riots, like the Smyly boys at their vicereine&apos;s levee, chipping her and raising a bit of a jeer or cheer, long live, little Anne, old Anna, high life, every time she&apos;d neb in her culdee sack of rubbish she robbed and reach out her maundy merchandise, stinkers and heelers, laggards and primelads, her furzeborn sons and dribblederry daughters, a thousand and one of them, and

<p> My colonial, wardha bagful! That&apos;s what you may call a tale of a tub. All that and more under one crinoline envelope if you dare to break the porkbarrel seal. No wonder they&apos;d run from her pison plague. Throw us your hudson soap for the honour of Clane! The wee taste the water left. I&apos;ll raft it back first thing in the marne. Ay, and don&apos;t forget the reckitts I lent you.

I know how racy they move his wheel. My hands are blawcauld between isker and soda like that piece of pattern chayney there, lying below. Or where is it? Lying beside the sedge I saw it. Hoangho, my
sorrow, I&apos;ve lost it! With that turbary water who could see? But O, gihon! I love a gabber. I could listen to more and mauve again. Rain onder river. Flies do your float. Thick is the life for mere.</p>
<p> Well, you know or don&apos;t you kennet or haven&apos;t I told you every story has an end and that&apos;s the he and the she of it. Look, look, the dusk is growing. Fieluhr? Filou! What age is at? It saon is late. &apos;Tis endless now since I or anyone last saw Waterhouse&apos;s clock. They took it asunder, I heard them say. When will they reassemble it? O, my back, my back, my back! I&apos;d
want to go to Aches-les-Pains. Wring out the clothes! Wring in the dew! Godavari, vert the showers! And grant of Thy grace! Aman. Will we spread them here now? Ay, we will. Spread on your bank and I&apos;ll spread mine on mine. It&apos;s what I&apos;m doing. Spread! It&apos;s churning chill. Der went is rising. I&apos;ll lay a few stones on the hostel sheets. A man and his bride embraced between
them. Else I&apos;d have sprinkled and folded them only. And I&apos;ll tie my butcher&apos;s apron here. It&apos;s suety yet. The strollers will pass it by. Six shifts, ten kerchiefs, nine to hold to the fire and this for the code, the convent napkins, twelve, one baby&apos;s shawl. Where are all her childer now? In kingdome gone or power to come or gloria be to them farther? Allalivial,
allalluvial! Some here, more no more, more again lost to the stranger. I&apos;ve heard tell that same brooch of the Shannons was married into a family in Spain. And all the Dunders de Dunnes in Markland&apos;s Vineland beyond Brendan&apos;s herring pool takes number nine in yangsee&apos;s hats. And one of Biddy&apos;s

<br> one kneebuckle and two hooks in the front. Do you tell me that now? I do, in troth. And didn&apos;t you hear it a deluge of times? You deed, you deed! I need, I need! It&apos;s that irrawaddyng I&apos;ve stuck in my aars. It all but husheth the lethest sound. Oronoko! What&apos;s your trouble? Is that the great Finnleader himself in his joakimono on his statue riding the high horse there
forehengist? Father of Otters, it is himself! Yonne there? Is it that? On Fallareen Common? You&apos;re thinking of Astley&apos;s Amphitheayter where the bobby restrained you making sugarstuck pouts to the ghostwhite horse of the Peppers. Throw the cobwebs from your eyes, woman, and spread your washing proper. It&apos;s well I know your sort of slop. Ireland sober is Ireland stiff. Your prayers.
Were you lifting your elbow, tell us, glazy cheeks, in Conway&apos;s Carrigacurra canteen? Was I what, hobbledyhips? Amn&apos;t I up since the damp dawn with Corrigan&apos;s pulse and varicose veins, soaking and bleaching boiler rags, and sweating cold, a widow like me, for to deck my tennis champion son, the laundryman with the lavender flannels? You won your limpopo limp from the husky hussars
when Collar and Cuffs was heir to the town and your slur gave the stink to Carlow. Holy Scamander! I saw it again! Near the golden falls. Icis on us! Seints of light! There! Subdue your noise, you poor creature! What is it but a blackburry growth or the dwyergray ass them four old codgers owns. Are you meanam Tarpey and Lyons and Gregory? I mean now, thank all, the four of them, and the roar of
them, that draves that stray in the mist and old Johnny MacDougal along with
<br><font color="green">{f39, 215}</font>
<br> them. Is that the Poolbeg flasher beyant or a fireboat coasting nigh the Kishtna or a glow I behold within a hedge or my Garry come back from the Indes? Wait till the honeying of the lune, love! Die, eve, little eve, die! We see that wonder in your eye. We&apos;ll meet again, we&apos;ll part once more. The spot I&apos;ll seek if the hour you&apos;ll find. My chart shines high where the blue
milk&apos;s upset. Forgivemequick, I&apos;m going! And you, pluck your watch, forgetmenot. My sights are swimming thicker on me by the shadows to this place. I&apos;ll sow home slowly now by own way, moyvalley way. Tow will I too, rathmine.</p>
<p> Ah, but she was the queer old skeowsha anyhow, Anna Livia, trinklytoes! And sure he was the quare old buntz too, Dear Dirty Dumpling, foostherfather of fingalls and fotthergills! Gammer and gaffer, we&apos;re all their gangsters. Hadn&apos;t he seven dams to wive him? And every dam had her seven

<br> crutches. And every crutch had its seven hues. And each hue had a differing cry. Sudds for me and supper for you and the doctor&apos;s bill for Joe John. Before! Before! He married his markets, cheap by foul, I know, like any Etrurian Catholic Heathen, in their pinky limony creamy birnies and their turkiss indienne mauves. But at milkidmass who was the spouse? Then all that was was fair. In
Elvenland! Teems of times and happy returns. The same anew. Ordovico or viricordo. Anna was, Livia is, Plurabelle&apos;s to be.
