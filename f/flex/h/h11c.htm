<p> O tell me all now about Anna Livia! I want to hear all about Anna Livia. Well, you know Anna Livia? Yes, of course, we all know Anna Livia. Tell me all. Tell me now. You&apos;ll die when you hear. Well, you see, when the old chap went and did what you know. Yes, I know, go on.

they try to make out he tried to do in the Phoenix park. He&apos;s an awful old rep. Look at the shirt of him. Look at the dirt of it. What was it he did at all? It was put in the papers what he did. But time will tell. I know it will. O, the old old rep! What age is he at all at all? Or where was he born or how was he found? <a name="n08114c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08114c">And were him

H.C.E has blue in his ee. Sure, she&apos;s nearly as bad as him herself. Who, Anna Livia? Ay, Anna Livia! Do you know she was calling girls to go in &amp; tickle him? She was? Go to God! O, tell me all I want to
hear! Letting on she didn&apos;t care. Didn&apos;t you see her in her windeye pretending to play <a name="n01019d" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01019d">a tune or two</a> a fiddle she has without a bottom? Sure, she can&apos;t play the fiddle, bottom or not. Of course, she can&apos;t. It was all a blind. Well, I never heard the like of that. Tell me more. Tell me all.

<p> Well, old Humper was as glum as a <a name="n08036h" href="../../ff/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08036h">grampus</a>, sitting moping on his benk <a name="n01039k" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01039k">hungerstriking</a> by himself, his hair combed over his eyes, dreeing his weird, with his dander up holding <a name="n05161e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05161e">doomsday over himself</a>, and keeking
on loft at the face the sternes and there she was, Anna Livia, <a name="n08101b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08101b">she couldn&apos;t snatch a wink of sleep</a>, running around like a girl of ten in a short summer skirt and painted cheeks.

And then she&apos;d try to whistle a tune <u>The Heart Bowed Down</u> or <u>The

a voice on her like a water gluck? You&apos;ll never guess. Tell me. Tell me. Phoebe dearest, tell, O tell me and I loved you better than you knew. And letting on she was daft about the old songs from over the holm: High hellskirt saw ladies hen smoke a lily hung pigger. Go away! Is it Anna Livia. As God is my judge. And didn&apos;t she go and trot down &amp; stand in the door and

You don&apos;t say the sallyport? I did. I do.

how to bring to mind the <a name="n01097l" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01097l">gladdest garments</a> out of sight and all the way of a maid with a man and making a kind of a cackling noise like two and a penny or half a crown and holding up a silver shiner.

<p> And what about the rhyme she made! O that! Tell me that! I&apos;m dying down off my feet until I hear Anna Livia&apos;s rhyme. <a name="n05159a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05159a">I can see that. I can see you are.</a> How does it go? Listen now. This is the rhyme Anna Livia made</p>
<p> By earth and heaven but I badly want a brandnew backside, bedad and I do, and a plumper at that</p>
<p> For the putty affair I have is worn out, so it is, sitting yawning &amp; waiting for my old Dane the dodderer, <a name="n08047i" href="../../ff/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08047i">my life in death companion</a> my frugal key of the larder, my muchaltered camel&apos;s hump, my jointspoiler, my maymoon&apos;s honey, my fool to the last Decemberer, to wake up out of his winter&apos;s doze

<br> and shout me down like he used to.</p>

<p> Only for my featherbed is as snug as it smells it&apos;s out I&apos;d lep and off with me to the mouth of the <a name="n08087b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08087b">Tolka</a> or to the Bull of Clontarf to feel the gay air of my sweet Dublin bay &amp; the race of the seawind up my hole!</p>
<p> O go on! Tell me more! Tell me every tiny bit! I want to hear every single thing. Well, now comes the childer&apos;s part. How many childer has she at all? I can&apos;t rightly tell you that God only knows. They say she had 111. She can&apos;t remember half the names she put on them. A hundred and how. They did well to christen her Plurabelle. O
<a name="n04160m" href="../../ff/fnbs/n04all.htm#n04160m">laws</a>! What a flock! She must have been a gadabout in her day, so she must <a name="n08063i" href="../../ff/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08063i">more than most</a>. So she was, you bet. Tell me, tell me how did she come through all her fellows, <a name="n06102m" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06102m">the daredevil</a>? Who was the first that ever

<br><font color="green">{ms, 83}</font>
<br> she hardly knew who he was or what he did or when he crossed her. She was just a young thin pale slip of a thing then <a name="n08090f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08090f">sauntering</a> and he was a heavy lurching lieabroad Curraghman making hay for the sun to shine as strong as the oaks there used to grow that time in killing Kildare that first fell across her. You&apos;re wrong there.
You&apos;re all wrong. It was ages long before that in the county Wicklow, the garden of Erin, before she ever dreamt she&apos;d end in the barleyfields and pennylands of Humphreystown and lie with a landleaper, well on the wane. Was it, was it? Are you sure? Where in Wicklow? Tell me where, the very first time! I will if you listen. You know the hazel dell of Luggelaw? Well there once dwelt a
local hermit named Michael <a name="n08158e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08158e">Orkney</a> and one day in warm June so young and shy &amp; so limber she looked, <a name="n08096g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08096g">the kind</a> of <a name="n08107d" href="../../ff/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08107d">curves</a> <a name="n08096g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08096g">you simply can&apos;t stop

<p> First she let her hair fall and down it flowed to her feet and then mothernaked she with bogwater &amp; mudsoap from her crown to her sole.

Then she wove a garland for her hair. She pleated it, she

Then she made her bracelets &amp; her anklets &amp; her armlets &amp; an amulet for necklet of cobbles and pebbles and rich gems &amp; rare ones, of rhinestones &amp; watershellmarbles.
