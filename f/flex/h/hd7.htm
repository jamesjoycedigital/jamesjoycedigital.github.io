And how long was he under lough and neagh? It was put in
the papers what he did, illysus distilling and all. But time will tell. I know it will. Time and tide will wash for no man. O, the old old rep! And the cut of him! And the strut of him! How he used to hold his head as high as a howeth, the famous old duke alien, with a hump of grandeur on him like a walking rat! What age is he at all at all? Or where was he born or how was he found and were him
and her ever spliced? I heard he dug good tin with his doll when he brought her home, Sabine asthore, in a perokeet&apos;s cage, the quaggy way for stumbling. Who sold you that jackalantern&apos;s tale? In a gabbard he landed, the boat of life, and he loosed two croakers from under his tilt, the old Phenician rover. By the smell of her kelp they made the pigeonhouse. Like fun they

You&apos;d think all was dead belonging to him. He had been belching for severn years. And there she was, Anna Livia, she darent catch a winkle of sleep, purling around like
a chit of a child, in a Lapsummer skirt and damazon cheeks. And an odd time she&apos;d cook him up blooms of fisk and lay to his heartsfoot her meddery eygs and staynish beacons on toasc and a cupenhave of greenland&apos;s tay and a shinking bread for to plaise that man hog stay his stomicker till her pyrraknees shrunk to nutmeg graters, and as rash as she&apos;d rush with her peakload of vivers

And then she&apos;d try to vistule a hymn, <i>The Heart Bowed Down</i> or <i>The Rakes of Mallow</i>. What harm if she knew how to cockle her mouth! And not a mag out of Hum no more than out of the

Hello, ducky, please don&apos;t die!</i> Do you know what she started cheeping then, the voice of her like a watergluck? You&apos;ll never guess. Tell me. Tell me. <i>Phoebe, dearest, tell, O tell

And letting on she was daft about the old warbly sangs from over holmen, <i>High hellskirt saw ladies hensmoker lilyhung pigger</i>, and Oom Bothar below in his sandy cloak as deaf as a yawn. Go away! You&apos;re only jeering! Anna Liv? As Chalk is my judge! And didn&apos;t she up and rise and go and trot down and stand in the door, puffing her
old dudheen, and every country wench or farmerette walking the pilend roads usedn&apos;t she make her a sign to slip inside by the sullyport? You don&apos;t say the sillypost? I did. And I do. Calling them in one by one and legging a jig or so to show them how to shake their benders and the dainty how to bring to mind the gladdest garments out of sight and all the way of a maid with a man and
making a sort of a cackling noise like two and a penny or half a crown and holding up a silver shiner. Lordy, lordy, did she so? Well, of all the ones ever I heard!

I can&apos;t rightly tell you that. Close only knows. Some say she had a hundred and eleven.

She must have been a gadabout in her day, so she must, more than most. Shoal she was, you bet! She had a flewmen of her owen. Tell me, tell me, how could she cam through all her fellows, the
daredevil? Linking one and knocking the next and palling in and petering out and clyding by on her eastway. Who was the first that ever burst? Someone it was, whoever you are. Tinker, tailor, soldier, sailor, Paul Pry or polishman. That&apos;s the thing I always want to know. She can&apos;t put her hand on him for the moment. It&apos;s a long long way, walking weary! Such a long way backwards to
row! She says herself she hardly knows who her graveller was or what he did or how young she played or when and where and how often he jumped her. She was just a young thin pale soft shy slim slip of a thing then, sauntering, and he was a heavy trudging lurching lieabroad of a Curraghman, making his hay for the sun to shine on, as tough as the oaktrees (peats be with them!) used to rustle that
time down by the dykes of killing Kildare, that forstfellfoss with a plash across her. She thought she&apos;d sink under the ground with shame when he gave her the tigris eye! You&apos;re wrong there, corribly wrong! It was ages behind that when nullahs were nowhere, in county

Two lads in their breeches went through her before that, Barefoot Byrne and Willy Wade, Lugnaquillia&apos;s noble pair, before she had a hint of a hair at her fanny to hide and ere that again she was licked by a hound while poing her pee, pure and simple, on the spur of the
hill in old Kippure, in birdsong and shearingtime, but first of all, worst of all, she sideslipped out by a gap in the Devil&apos;s Glen while Sally her nurse was sound asleep in a sloot and fell over a spillway before she found her stride and lay and wriggled in all the stagnant black pools of rain under a fallow cow and she laughed innocefree with her limbs aloft and a whole drove of maiden
hawthorns blushing and looking askance upon her.</p>
<p> Drop me the sound of the shorthorn&apos;s name. And drip me why in the something was she freckled. And trickle me through was she marcelwaved or was it weirdly a wig she wore. Are you in the swim or are you out? O go on, go on, go on! I mean about what you know. I know right well what you mean. What am I rinsing now and I&apos;ll thank you? Is it a pinny or is it a surplice? Arran,
where&apos;s your nose? And where&apos;s the starch? That&apos;s not the benediction smell. I can tell from here by their <i>eau de Niels</i> and the scent of her moisture they&apos;re Mrs Magrath&apos;s. And you ought to have aired them. They&apos;ve just come off her. Creases in silk they are, not crampton lawn.

<br> The only pair with frills in old the plain. So they are. Well, well! And there&apos;s her nubilee letters too. Ellis on quay in scarlet thread. And an ex after to show they&apos;re not Laura Kehoe&apos;s. Ormond the devil twist your safety pin! Now, who has been tearing the leg of her drawers on her? Which leg is it? The one with the bells on it. Rinse them out and aston along with you! Where

<p> Well, after it was put in the Beggar&apos;s Monday Journal even the snow that fell on his hoaring hair had a skunner against him. Everywhere ever you went and every bung you ever dropped into or wherever you scoured the countryside from Nannywater to Vartryville you found his pixture upside down or the cornerboys burning his guy and Pat the Man reeling and rolling around the local with
oddfellow&apos;s triple tiara busby rotundarinking round his scalp. She swore she&apos;d be level with all of them yet. So she said to herself she&apos;d frame a plan to fake a shine, the mischiefmaker, the like of it you never heard. What plan? Tell me quickly. What the mischief did she make? Well, she bergened a bag, a shammy mailbag, off one of her swapsons, Shaun the Post, and then she went
and made herself up. O goggle of

If you don&apos;t like my story get out of the punt. Well, have it your own way so. Here, sit down and do as you&apos;re bid.
Lisp it slaney and crisp it quiet. Tell me longsome. Take your time now. Breathe deep. That&apos;s the fairway. Hurry slow and scheldt you go. Give us your blessed ashes here till I scrub the canon&apos;s underpants. Flow now. Ower more.</p>
<p> First she let her hair fall and down it flussed to her feet its teviots winding coils. Then, mothernaked, she washed herself with bogwater and mudsoap, upper and lower, from crown to sole. Next she greased the groove of her keel with antifouling butterscotch and turfentine and serpenthyme, and with leafmould she ushered round prunella isles and islets dun allover her little mary. And after
that she wove a garland for her hair. She pleated it. She plaited it. Of meadowgrass and riverflags, the bulrush and waterweed, and of fallen <font color="red"><sup><small>|7</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">leaves</span></span> <font color="black">griefs</font><font color="red"><sup><small>7|</small></sup></font> of weeping willow. Then she made her bracelets and
her anklets and her armlets and a jetty amulet for necklace of clicking cobbles and pattering pebbles and rumbledown rubble, richmond and rare, of Irish rhinestones and shellmarble bangles. That done, a dawk of smut to her airy eye, and she sent her boudeloire maid to His Affluence with respecks from his missus, seepy and sewery, and a request she might leave him for a minnikin. She said she
wouldn&apos;t be half her length away. Then, then, with her mealiebag slung over her shoulder, Anna Livia, oysterface, out at last she came.</p>

What had she on, the little old oddity? How much did she scallop, harness and
weights? Here she is, Amnisty Ann! Call her calamity electrifies man.</p>
<p> No electress at all but old Moppa Necessity, mother of injins. I&apos;ll tell you now. But you must sit still. Will you hold your peace and listen well to what I am going to say now? It might have been ten or twenty to one when the flip of her hoogly igloo fluttered and out stepped a fairy woman, the dearest little mother ever you saw, nodding around her, all smiles, between two ages, a judy
queen not up to your

<br> elb. And look at her sharp and seize her quick for the longer she lives the shorter she grows. Save us and tagus! No more? Why where did you ever pick a Lambay chop as big as a battering ram? Ay, you&apos;re right. I was forgetting. The height of my hough, I say! She wore a ploughboy&apos;s nailstudded clogs, a pair of ploughfields in themselves: a sugarloaf hat with a gaudyquivery peak and a
band of gorse and a hundred streamers dancing off it and a golden pin to pierce it: owlglassy bicycles boggled her eyes: and a fishnet veil she had to keep the sun from spoiling her wrinkles: potatorings buckled the loose ends of her ears: her nude cuba stockings were salmonspotspeckled: she sported a shimmy of hazegrey that once was blued till it ran in the washing: stout stays, the rivals, lined
her length: her bloodorange knickers showed natural nigger boggers, fancyfastened, free to undo: her blackstripe tan joseph was teddybearlined, with wavy rushgreen epaulettes and a leadown here and there of royal swansruff: a brace of gaspers stuck in her hayrope garters: her civvy coat was boundaried round with a twobar tunnel belt: she had a clothespeg tight astride of her nose and she kept on
grinding something quaint in her mouth: and the tail of her snuffdrab shuiler&apos;s skirt trailed fifty Irish miles behind her on the road.</p>
<p> Hellsbells, I&apos;m sorry I missed her! Sweet umptyum and nobody fainted. But in whelk of her mouths? Was her naze alight? Everyone that saw her said the <font color="red"><sup><small>|7</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">douce</span></span> <font color="black">dowse</font><font color="red"><sup><small>7|</small></sup></font> little delia looked a bit queer.
Lotsy trotsy, mind the poddle! Funny poor frump she must have charred. Kickhams a rummier ever you saw. Making soft mullet&apos;s eyes at her boys dobelong. And they crowned her the queen of the may. Of the may? You don&apos;t say! Well for her she couldn&apos;t see herself.
<br><font color="green">{f10, 164}</font>
<br> I warrant that&apos;s why she murrayed her mirror. She did? Mersey me! There was a gang of drouthdropping surfacemen,

<br> boomslanging and plugchewing, lolling and leasing on Lazy Wall by the Jook of Yoick&apos;s and as soon as they saw her meander by in her grasswinter&apos;s weeds and twigged who was under her deaconess bonnet, Avondale&apos;s fish and Clarence&apos;s poison, says one to another: <i>Between me and you and the granite we&apos;re warming, as round as a hoop, Alp has doped</i>.</p>
<p> But what was the game in her mixed bag? I want to get it while it&apos;s fresh. I bet my beard it&apos;s worth while poaching on. Shake it up, do, do! I promise I&apos;ll make it worth your while. And I don&apos;t mean maybe. Tell me more but tell me true.</p>
<p> Well, arondgirond she pattered and swung and sidled, dribbling her boulder through narrows of mosses, not knowing which medway to strike it, like Santa Claus at the call of the pale and puny, with a Christmas box apiece for each and every one of her childer. The rivulets ran to see, the glashaboys, the pollynooties. And they all about her, youths and maidens, rickets and riots, chipping her

<p> Well, you know or don&apos;t you know or haven&apos;t I told you every story has an end and that&apos;s the he and the she of it. Look, look, the dusk is growing. What time is it? It must be late. It&apos;s ages now since I or anyone last saw Waterhouse&apos;s clock. They took it asunder, I heard them say. When will they reassemble it? O, my back, my back, my back! I&apos;d want to go to
Aches-les-Pains. Wring out the clothes! Wring in the dew! Will we spread them here now? Ay, we will. Spread on your bank and I&apos;ll spread mine on mine. It&apos;s what I&apos;m doing. Spread! It&apos;s churning chill. Der went is rising. I&apos;ll lay a few stones on the hotel sheets. A man and his bride embraced between them. Else I&apos;d have sprinkled and folded them only. And I&apos;ll tie
my butcher&apos;s apron here. It&apos;s suety yet. The strollers will pass it by. Six shifts, ten kerchiefs, the convent napkins, twelve, one baby&apos;s shawl. Where are all her childer now? Some here, more no more, more again lost to the stranger. I&apos;ve heard tell that same brooch of the Shannons was married into a family in Spain. And all the Dunnes beyond Brendan&apos;s sea takes number
nine in hats. And one of Biddy&apos;s

<br> beads went bobbing lonesome till she rounded up last histereve with a marigold and a cobbler&apos;s candle in a main drain off Bachelor&apos;s Walk. But all that&apos;s left to the last of the Meaghers is
<br><font color="green">{f10, 168}</font>
<br> one kneebuckle and two hooks in the front. Do you tell me that now? I do, in troth. Oronoko! What&apos;s <font color="red"><sup><small>|7</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the</span></span> <font color="black">your</font><font color="red"><sup><small>7|</small></sup></font> trouble? Is that the great Finnleader himself in his joakimono on his statue riding the
high horse there forehengist? There? Is it that? On Fallareen Common? Throw the cobwebs from your eyes, woman, and spread your washing proper. It&apos;s well I know your sort of slop. Were you lifting your elbow, tell us, glazy cheeks, in the Carrigacurra canteen? Was I what, hobbledyhips? Amn&apos;t I up since the damp dawn with varicose veins, soaking and bleaching boiler rags, and sweating
cold, a widow like me, to deck my tennis champion son, the laundryman with the lavender flannels? Holy Scamander! I saw it again! Near the golden falls. Icis on us! There! Subdue your noise, you poor creature! What is it but a blackberry growth or the dwyergray ass them four old codgers owns. Are you maining Tarpey and Lyons and Gregory? I mean now, thank all, the four of them, and the roar of
them, that owns that stray in the mist and old Johnny MacDougal along with
<br><font color="green">{f39, 215}</font>
<br> them. Is that the Poolbeg flasher beyant or the mast of a coaster nigh the Kish or a glow I behold within a hedge? Wait till the rising of the moon. My sights are swimming thicker on me by the shadows to this place. I&apos;ll sow home slowly now by own way, moyvalley way. <font color="red"><sup><small>(+7</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Row will</span></span>

<p> Ah, but she was the queer old skeowsha anyhow, Anna Livia, twinkletoes! And sure he was the queer old buntz too, Dear Dirty Dumpling, foostherfather of fingalls and fotthergills! Gammer and gaffer, we&apos;re all their gangsters. Hadn&apos;t he seven dams to wive him? And every dam had her seven
<br><font color="green">{f10, 169}</font>
<br> crutches. And every crutch had its seven hues. And each hue had a differing cry. Suds for me and supper for you and the doctor&apos;s bill for Joe John. Before! Before! He married his markets, cheap by foul, I know, but at milkidmass who was the spouse? Then all that was was fair. In Elvenland! Teems of times and happy returns. The same anew. Ordovico or viricordo. Anna was, Livia is,
Plurabelle&apos;s to be. Northmen&apos;s thing made southfolk&apos;s place but howmulty plurators made eachone in person? Latin me that, my trinity scholard. <i>Hircus Civis Eblanensis!</i> He had buckgoat paps on him, soft ones for orphans. Ho, Lord! Twins of his bosom. Lord save us! And ho! Hey? What all men. Hot? His tittering daughters of. Whawk?</p>
<p> Can&apos;t hear with the waters of. The chittering waters of. Flittering bats, fieldmice bawk talk. Ho! Are you not gone ahome? What Tom Malone? Can&apos;t hear with bawk of bats, all the liffeying waters of. Ho, talk save us! My foos woon&apos;t moos. I feel as old as yonder elm. A tale told of Shaun or Shem? All Livia&apos;s daughtersons. Dark hawks hear us! Night! Night! My ho head halls. I
feel
<br><font color="green">{f39, 216}</font>
<br> as heavy as yonder stone. Tell me of John or Shaun? Who were Shem and Shaun the living sons or daughters of? Night now! Tell me, tell me, tell me, elm! Nighty night! Tell me tale of stem or stone. Beside the rivering waters of, hitherandthithering waters of. Night!</p>  </main>
