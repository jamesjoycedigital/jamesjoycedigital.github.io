<p> O tell me all now about Anna Livia! I want to hear all about Anna Livia. Well, you know Anna Livia? Yes, of course, I know Anna Livia. Tell me all. Tell me now. You&apos;ll die when you hear. Well, you see, when the old chap went and did what you know. Yes, I know, go on. Or whatever it was they try to make out he tried to do in the Phoenix park. He&apos;s an awful old rep. What was it he did
at all? It was put in the papers what he did. But time will tell. I know it will. O, the old old rep! What age is he at all at all? Or where was he born or how was he found? Don&apos;t you know he&apos;s a bairn of the sea, Waterhouse the waterbaby? O, I know, so he was. H.C.E has blue in his ee. Sure, she&apos;s nearly as bad as he is herself. Who, Anna Livia? Ay, Anna Livia! Do you know she was
calling girls to go into him? She was? Go to God! O, tell me all I want to hear! Letting on she didn&apos;t care. Didn&apos;t you see her in her windeye pretending to play a fiddle she has without a bottom? Sure, she can&apos;t play the fiddle, bottom or not. Of course, she can&apos;t. It was all a blind. Well, I never heard the like of that. Tell me more. Tell me all.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 80}</font> </p>
<p> Well, old Humper was as glum as could be, sitting moping all on his benk by himself, his hair combed over his eyes, dreeing his weird, and keeking on loft <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">up</span></span> at the sternes and there <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">w</span></span> she was, Anna Livia, running around like a girl of ten in a short summer skirt and painted
cheeks. And an odd time she&apos;d cook him up blooms of fisk and meddery eyes to plaise him and as quick as she&apos;d run with them up on the tray the old chap&apos;d cast them from him, if he didn&apos;t peg the tea in her face believe me <a name="n06095f" href="../../FF/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06095f">she was safe enough</a>. And then she&apos;d try to whistle a tune <u>The Heart Bowed Down</u> or
<u>The Rakes of Mallow</u> and <a name="n03129d" href="../../FF/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03129d">not a mag out of him</a> no more than the wall. Is that a fact? That&apos;s a fact. And calling to him down the feedchute the powder tumbling off her nose: Hello, ducky! Please don&apos;t die! Do you know what she started singing then like a water gluck? You&apos;ll never guess. Tell me. Tell me. I loved you
better than you knew. And letting on she was daft about the old songs from over the holm: High hellsker saw ladies hen smoke a lily pigger. Go away! Is it Anna Livia. As God is my judge. And then she&apos;d go and trot down &amp; stand in the door and
<br><font color="green">{ms, 81}</font>
<br> every servant girl that went the road she&apos;d make her a sign to slip inside by the sallyport? You don&apos;t say the sallyport? I did. I do. Calling them one by one and legging a jig or two to show them how to shake their benders and how to show what&apos;s out of sight and all the way of a maid with a man and making a kind of a cackling noise like half a crown and holding up a silver
shiner. Well of all the ones ever I heard! To any girl of no matter what sex of playful ways a half a crown a go to sit and have fun in Humpy&apos;s lap!</p>
<p> And what about the rhyme she made! O that! Tell me that! I&apos;m dying down off my feet until I hear Anna Livia&apos;s rhyme. How does it go? Listen now.</p>
<p> By earth and heaven but I badly want a brandnew backside, bedad and I do, and a plumper at that</p>
<p> For the putty affair I have is worn out, so it is, sitting yawning &amp; waiting for my old Dane the dodderer, my frugal key of the larder, my muchaltered camel&apos;s hump, my jointspoiler, my maymoon&apos;s honey, my fool to the last Decemberer, to wake up out of his winter&apos;s doze
<br><font color="green">{ms, 82}</font>
<br> and shout me down like he used to.</p>
<p> Is there a lord of the manor going at all, I wonder, that&apos;d tip me a pound or two in cash for washing &amp; darning his <a name="n06161m" href="../../FF/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06161m">worshipful</a> socks for him now we&apos;re run out of horsemeat and milk?</p>
<p> Only for my featherbed is as snug as it smells it&apos;s out I&apos;d lep and off with me to the mouth of the <a name="n08087b" href="../../FF/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08087b">Tolka</a> or to the Bull of Clontarf to feel the gay air of my sweet Dublin bay &amp; the race of the seawind up my hole!</p>
<p> O go on! Tell me more! Tell me every tiny bit! I want to hear every single thing. Well, now comes the childer&apos;s part. How many childer has she at all? I can&apos;t rightly tell you that God only knows. They say she had 111. She can&apos;t remember half their names. A hundred and how. They did well to christen her Plurabelle. O my! What a flock! She must have been a gadabout in her day, so
she must. So she was, you bet. Tell me, tell me how did she come through all her fellows? Who was the first that ever burst? That&apos;s a thing I always want to know. She says herself
<br><font color="green">{ms, 83}</font>
<br> she hardly knew who he was or what he did or when he crossed her. She was just a young thin pale slip of a thing then and he was a heavy lurching Curraghman as strong as the oaks there used to grow that time in killing Kildare that first fell across her. You&apos;re wrong there. You&apos;re all wrong. It was ages long before that in the county Wicklow, the garden of Erin, before she ever
dreamt she&apos;d end in the barleyfields and pennylands of Humphreystown and lie with a landleaper, well on the wane. Was it, was it? Are you sure? Where in Wicklow? Tell me where, the very first time! I will if you listen. You know the glen of Luggelaw? Well <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">once</span></span> there once dwelt a hermit and one day in warm June so young and shy &amp;
so limber she looked he plunged both of his blessed hands up to his wrists in her flowing hair that was rich red like the brown bog. And he couldn&apos;t help it, thirst was too hot for him, he cooled his lips in smiling mood kiss after kiss on Anna Livia&apos;s freckled cheek. O, wasn&apos;t he the bold priest! And wasn&apos;t she the naughty Livvy! Naughtynaughty is
<br><font color="green">{ms, 84}</font>
<br> her name. Two lads in their breeches went through her before that, Barefoot Byrne and Billy Wade, before she had a hint of a hair there to hide and ere that again she was licked by a hound while doing her pee, sweet and simple, on the side of a hill in shearing time but first of all, worst of all, she ran out by a gap when her nurse was asleep and fell before she found her stride and lay
&amp; wriggled under a cow.</p>
<p> Tell me the name of the cow and tell me why was she freckled and tell me too how long was her hair? O go on, go on, go on! I mean about what you know. I know well what you mean. I&apos;m going on. Where did I stop. Don&apos;t stop. Go on, go on!</p>
<p> Well after it was put in the papers everywhere ever you went and every bung you ever dropped into or wherever you scoured the countryside you found his picture upside down or the cornerboys burning his guy, so she made a plan, the mischiefmaker, the like of it now you never heard. What plan? Tell me quickly! What the
<br><font color="green">{ms, 85}</font>
<br> mischief did she do? Well, she borrowed a bag, a mailbag from one of her sons, Shaun the Post, &amp; then she went &amp; made herself up. O, God of gigglers, I can&apos;t tell how! It&apos;s too funny! O but you must, you must really! I&apos;d give my chance of going to heaven to hear it all, every word. Here, sit down, go easy, be quiet. Tell me slow. Take your time now. Breathe deep.
That&apos;s the way. Slow now. Slower still.</p>
<p> First she let her hair fall and down it flowed to her heels and then mothernaked she with bogwater &amp; mudsoap from her crown to her sole. Then she greased the groove of her keel with butterscotch &amp; multiplied brown moles all over her little mary <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">&amp;</span></span>. Then she wove a garland for her hair. She pleated it, she plaited it. Of
meadowgrass and riverflags, of bulrushes &amp; waterweeds, of leaves of weeping willow. Then she made her bracelets &amp; her anklets &amp; her armlets &amp; an amulet for necklet of cobbles and pebbles and rich gems &amp; rare ones, of rhinestones &amp; watermarbles. That done she sent her boudoir maid
<br><font color="green">{ms, 86}</font>
<br> to Humphrey with a request that she might leave him for a moment &amp; said she wouldn&apos;t be any length away. Then with her mealiebag slung over her shoulder, Anna Livia, oysterface, out at last she came.</p>
<p> Describe her! I must hear that! What had she on? What did she carry? Here she is. What has she got? A loin of jubilee mutton?</p>
<p> I tell you now but you must sit still. Will you hold your peace &amp; listen <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">to</span></span> well to what I am going to say now. The door of the ugly igloo opened &amp; out stepped a fairy woman the height of your knee. Go away! No more. The height of your knee. She wore a ploughboy&apos;s nailstudded
<a name="n01049b" href="../../FF/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01049b">boots</a>: a sugarloaf hat with a sunrise peak &amp; a band of gorse and a golden pin to pierce it: olwglasses shaded her eyes: potatorings buckled the loose ends of her ears: her nude cuba stockings were salmonspotspeckled: her bloodorange knickers showed natural <a name="sa0051t" href="../../FF/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0051t">nigger bockers</a>
fancy fastened: her blackstripe tan joseph was teddybearlined
<br><font color="green">{ms, 87}</font>
<br> with a border of swansdown: a brace of gaspers stuck in her hayrope garters: her civvy coat was zoned by a twobar <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">belting</span></span> tunnel belt: she had a clothespeg tight astride of her nose and something or other in her mouth &amp; the tail of her snuffbrown skirt trailed 50 behind her on the road.</p>
<p> <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">O</span></span> hellsbells, <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">what</span></span> I&apos;m sorry I missed. She must have looked a <a name="n01054h" href="../../FF/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01054h">funny poor dear</a>. <a name="n01070h" href="../../FF/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01070h">Dickens a</a> funnier ever you saw.

<p> Give me the soap &amp; tell me the rest. I could listen to more &amp; more again. This is the life for me.</p>

Wring out the clothes. Wring in the dusk. Will we spread them here? Spread on your side and I&apos;ll spread mine on mine. Where are all her childer now?
