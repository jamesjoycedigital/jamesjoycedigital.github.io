<p> Ah ho! This poor Glugg! It was so said of him about of his old fontmouther. Truly deplurabel! A dire, O dire! And all the freightfulness whom he inhebited after his colline born janitor. Sometime towerable! With that hehry antlets on him and the baublelight bulching out of his sockets whiling away she sprankled his allover with her noces of interregnation: How do you do that lack a lock and
pass the poker, please? And bids him tend her, lute and airly. Sing, sweetharp, thing to me anone! So that Glugg, the poor one, in that limbopool which was his subnesciousness he could scares of all knotknow whither his morrder had bourst a blabber or if the vogalstones that hit his tynpan was that mearly his skoll missed her. Misty&apos;s trompe or midst his flooting? Ah, ho! Cicely, awe!</p>
<p> The youngly delightsome frilles-in-pleyurs are now showen drawen, if bud one, or, if in florileague, drawens up consociately at the hinder sight of their commoner guardian. Her boy fiend, or theirs, if they are so plurielled, cometh up as a trapadour, sinking how he must fend for himself by gazework what their colours wear as they are all showen drawens up. Tireton, cacheton, tireton, bas!
Doth that not satisfy youth, sir? O quanty purty bellas here, Madama Lifay! And what are you going to charm them to, Madama, do say? Cinderynelly angled her slipper; it was cho chiny yet braught her a groom. At next lineup he will angskt of them from their commoner guardian (who is really the rapier of the two, though thother brother can hold his own, espacially for he bandishes it with his hand

But if he&apos;ll go to be a son to France&apos;s she&apos;ll stay daughter of Clare. Bring tansy, throw myrtle, strew rue, rue, rue. She is fading out like Journee&apos;s clothes so you can&apos;t see her now. Still we
know how Day the Dyer works, in dims and deeps and dusks and darks. And among the shades that Eve&apos;s now wearing she&apos;ll meet anew fiancy, tryst and trow. Mammy was, Mimmy is, Minuscoline&apos;s to be. In the Dee dips a dame and the dame desires a demselle but the demselle dresses dolly and the dolly does a dulcydamble. The same renew. For though she&apos;s unmerried she&apos;ll after
truss up and help that hussyband how to hop. Hip it and trip it and chirrub and sing. Lord Chuffy&apos;s sky sheraph and Glugg&apos;s got to swing.

<p> So and so, toe by toe, to and fro they go round, for they are the ingelles, scattering nods as girls who may, for they are an angel&apos;s garland.</p>
<p> Catchmire stockings, libertyed garters, shoddyshoes quicked out with selver. Pennyfeir caps on pinnyfore frocks and a ring on her fomefing finger. And they leap so looply, looply, as they link to light. And they look so loovely, loovelit, noosed in a nuptious night. Withasly glints in. Andecoy glants out. They ramp it a little, a lessle, a lissle. Then rompride round in rout.</p>

Joshua Croesus, son of Nunn! Though he shall live for millions of years a life of billions of years, from their roseaced glows to their violast lustres, he shall not forget that pucking Pugases.

<p> But, by Jobe, Chronides, Seed of Summ, after at he had bate his breastplates for, forfor, forforget, forforgetting his birdsplace, it was soon that, that he, that he rehad himself. By a prayer? No, that comes later. By contrite attrition? Nay, that we passed. Mid esercizism? So is richt.

Why was that man for he&apos;s doin her wrong? Lookery looks, how he&apos;s knots in his entrails! Mookery mooks, it&apos;s a grippe of his gripes. Seekeryseeks, why his biting he&apos;s head off?

<br> Cokerycokes, it&apos;s his spurt of coal. And may his tarpitch dilute not give him chromitis! For the mauwe that blinks you blank is mostly Carbo. Where the inflammabilis might pursuive his comburenda with a pure flame and a true flame and a flame alltoogasser. Soot. The worst is over. Wait! And the Dubuny Mag may gang to preesses. With Dinny Finneen, me canty ho! In the lost of the gleamens.
