<p> Yet, ah tears, who can her mater be? She&apos;d<a target="foot" id="fkk0172">&ordm;</a> promised he&apos;d eye her. To try up her pretti. But now it&apos;s so longed and so fared and so forth.</p>
<p> Poor Isad sits a glooming,<a target="foot" id="fkk0175">&ordm;</a> so gleaming in the gloaming. She is fading out like Journee&apos;s clothes so you can&apos;t see her now. Still we know how Day the Dyer works, in dims and deeps and dusks and darks. And among the shades that Eve&apos;s now wearing she&apos;ll meet anew fiancy, tryst and trow. For though she&apos;s unmerried she&apos;ll after
truss up and help that hussyband how to hop. Hip it and romp it and chirrub and sing. <a name="n38186f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n38all.htm#n38186f">Lord Chuffy&apos;s</a> sky sheraph and Glugg&apos;s got to swing. </p>
<p> So and so, toe by toe, to and fro they go round, for<a target="foot" id="fkk0180">&ordm;</a> they are the ingelles, scattering nods as girls who may, for they are an angel&apos;s garland.</p>
<p> Catchmire stockings, libertyed garters, shoddyshoes<a target="foot" id="fkk0181">&ordm;</a> quicked out with selver.

And they look so loovely, loovelit, all in a nuptious

<p> R is Rubretta and A is Arancia, Y is for Yilla and N for Greenerin. B is Boyblue with odalisque O while W waters the fleurettes of <a name="n38195a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n38all.htm#n38195a">novembrance</a>. Though they&apos;re all but merely a schoolgirl yet these way went they. The grocer&apos;s wife she<a target="foot" id="fkk0186">&ordm;</a> slips her hand in the haricot bag, the lady in
waiting sips her sup from the paraffin can, Mrs the Doctor runs out on the road the moment she hears of a tinkle of tunder, the widow Magrievy she<a target="foot" id="fkk0187">&ordm;</a> knits cats&apos; cradles, this bountiful actress hides a sixpence under her tongue, and here&apos;s the girl who she kneeled in coldfeshion<a target="foot" id="fkk0188">&ordm;</a> and told her priest she spat on a
chop and this lass not least she&apos;s a very rich woman who she writes foot fortunes ever and over in the nursery dust with her capital thumb. And these ways wend they. And those ways wend<a target="foot" id="fkk0192">&ordm;</a> they. Winnie, Olive and Beatrice, Nelly and Ida, Amy and Rue. Here they come back, all the gay pack, for they are the florals, from foncey and pansey to papavere&apos;s
blush, forsake-me-nought<a target="foot" id="fkk0193">&ordm;</a>, while there&apos;s leaf there&apos;s hope, with primtim&apos;s<a target="foot" id="fkk0194">&ordm;</a> ruse and marrymay&apos;s blossom, all the flowers of the ancelles&apos; garden.</p>
<p> But vicereversing what tornaments of rages racked the divlun&apos;s punchpoll as he displaid all the oathword science of his visible disgrace!<a target="foot" id="fkk0199">&ordm;</a> He dove his head into Wat Murrey, gave Stewart Ryall a puck on the plexus, wrestled a hurry-come-union with the Gille Beg, wiped<a target="foot" id="fkk0201">&ordm;</a> all his sinses, martial and menial, out of
