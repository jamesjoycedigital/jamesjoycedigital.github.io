She murmured:</p>
<p class="set">&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p class="flush">My precious<a target="foot" id="fzz0022">&ordm;</a> since last we parted it seems to me that I have been continually in your company, even when I close my eyes <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">to s</span></span> at night, seeing you, hearing you, meeting you in different places<a target="foot" id="fzz0023">&ordm;</a> so that I&apos;m beginning to wonder whether my
soul does not take leave of my body in sleep and go to seek you and what is more find you,<a target="foot" id="fzz0024">&ordm;</a> or perhaps <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">or perhaps</span></span> this is only a phantasy. Tell me,<a target="foot" id="fzz0025">&ordm;</a> Daniel, my precious darling.</p>
<p> Hero<a target="foot" id="fzz0026">&ordm;</a> of tens of scrums, kisser of hundreds, blocker of thousands, ejaculater of myriads aloudly spoke his voice falling in strange ineffectual dropkick, so; in the language of diplomacy<a target="foot" id="fzz0029">&ordm;</a></p>
<p class="set">&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p class="flush">Pourquoi es-tu <a name="n03006c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03006c">entr&eacute;e</a> dans my vie, Henriette?<a target="foot" id="fzz0031">&ordm;</a> Je croyais mon &acirc;me d&eacute;j&agrave; morte<a target="foot" id="fzz0032">&ordm;</a>

<p class="flush">She lifted her head, her eyes content. For now she knew that she it was and not that ginger bitch Kateagnes Halloran<a target="foot" id="fzz0035">&ordm;</a></p>
<p> He, the gentleman, was sodavisaged.

taproom, Marie Louise all fun and fleas, tipsy Suzanne catch as catch can, and, last but not least, the rawboned housekeeper of the local parish priest. Ghastlily, he pastloveyed her.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Smiling Johnny, pleaded she, do you care for me just a little?</p>
<p> Partially<a target="foot" id="fzz0040">&ordm;</a> selfstrangled he replied:</p>

<p class="pdi">&mdash; Lady, I am not worthy. If you but knew. Why were we born in two different places? Wherefore have we met<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">?</span></span><a target="foot" id="fzz0041">&ordm;</a> yesterday so to speak? Why this strangulation, this yearning for a <u>bonum arduum</u> as distinguished from a <u>bonum simpliciter</u>? Wellaway, alas, for death in, with,
for and on account of my wellbeloved I mutely yearn.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O, can that sobstuff, answered Isolde
<br><font color="green">{ms, 1v}</font>
<br> impatiently after her waiting patiently all through the damned old dinner of burnt loinchops and ignoble potatoes with everybody talking about loinchops and potatoes and the pig&apos;s arse and cabbage of the day before and the silverside boiled cowbeef of the day<a target="foot" id="fzz0043">&ordm;</a> before that again with purpletop swedes and equally ignoble
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">potatoes</span></span> colieflower without a morsel of appetite. Love she wanted, the best obtainable, true new blind bottomless staggerhumanity love at first sight for which reason she again kissed him and he, being a gentleman, counterkissed because it was his one maxim in life that if a lady, for example, wanted a bite of a piece of Stilton cheese
and he happened, for argument&apos; sake, to have a quarter of a pound or so of Stilton cheese in his pocket<a target="foot" id="fzz0046">&ordm;</a> why he&apos;d just simply put his hand in his pocket, don&apos;t you know, and well he&apos;d just give her the cheese, don&apos;t you see, to take a bite off. However<a target="foot" id="fzz0047">&ordm;</a> first &amp; foremost, before testing her
triangle to prove whether she was as the newspapers reported a <u>virgo intacta</u>, he asked her whether she had ever indulged in clandestine fornication.</p>
<p> No, nein, never,, she swore. By the axecleft of my notch! By the hairs of my dearest parents! By the inviolable dew of Ben Bulben! By the freshwater pullan herring!</p>
<p> Her mournful embracer pointed to the starry host. By them he bade her swear, them that were and are and shall be, the silently

<br> strewing<a target="foot" id="fzz0049">&ordm;</a>, the strikingly shining, the twittingly twinkling, and (as <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">her</span></span> he truly remarked), the lamplights of lovers</p>
<p> Up they gazed, skyward, while in her ear that loveless lover, sinless sinner, breathed:
<br> How gentle &amp; kind I am, Issy. <a name="sa0804bv" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0804bv">I never hurt the feelings of another</a>. And, I say, what a lovely nature is mine!</p>
