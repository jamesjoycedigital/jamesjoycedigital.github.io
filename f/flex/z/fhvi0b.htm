<p class="poemSp">&mdash; Three caws for <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">for</span></span> Mister Mark
<br> Sure he hasnt got much of a bark
<br> And sure any he has is all beside the mark.
<br> O Eagle <a name="n03168e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03168e">Highflighty</a> wouldn&apos;t it be a sky of a lark
<br> To see that old busard whooping around in his shirt in the dark
<br> And he hunting about for his speckled trousers in Palmerston park.
<br> O moulty Mark
<br> Youre the rummest old rooster ever crawled out of a <span class="strike"><span class="striketext"><font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">unread</span></font></span></span> Noah&apos;s ark
<br> And you think you&apos;re the cock of the walk.
<br> Fowls up! Tristan&apos;s a spry young spark
<br> That&apos;ll tread her and wed her and bed her and red her
<br> Without even winking the tale of a feather
<br> And that&apos;s how that chap&apos;s going to make his money and mark.</p>
<p class="flush">The Four Waves of Ireland also heard, leaning upon the staves of memory. Four <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">emin</span></span> eminently respectable old gentlemen they looked got up in sleek holiday toggery for the occasion, grey half tall hat, <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">gre</span></span> frock coat to match fathomglasses and soforth, you know,
for all the world like the fourth viscount Powerscourt at the royal Dublin socities annual horseshow. They had seen their share.. the capture of Sir Arthur Casement in the year 432 Coronation of Brian by the Danes at Clonmacnois
<br><font color="green">{ms, 3v}</font>
<br> The drowning of poor Mat Keane of Dunlearey the scattering of the flemish armada off the coasts of Galway and Longford, the landing of St Patrick in the year 1798, the dispersal of the French fleet under General Boche in the year 2002. And such was their memory that they had been appointed extern<a target="foot" id="fzz0019">&ordm;</a> professors to the four chief seats of learning in Erin,
the Universities of killorcure, <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">kill them all</span></span> killthemall, killeachother, killkelly-on-the-Flure, whither they wirelessed four times weekly lectures in the four modes of history, past, present, absent and future. Saltsea widowers all four they had been many ages before divorced by their respective spouses (with whom they had parted on the
best of terms) by a decrees absolute issued by Mrs Justice Smashman in the married male offenders court at bohernabreena, one for inefficiency in backscratching, too for having broken wind from behind without having first made a request in writing on stamped foolscap paper, three for having attempted hunish familiarities after a meal decompsed crab, four on account of the general appearance of his
face. Though that was ever so long ago they could still with an effort of memory and by counting carefully the four buttons of the fly of their trousers recall the name of the four beautiful sisters Brinabride who were at <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">p</span></span> the moment touring the <a name="n03073b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03073b">United States</a>

<br> Yet were they fettlesome anon, lured by beauty Often would they cling to the sides of the Northwall and Hollyhead boats and the Isle of Man tourist steamers, peering with glaucomatose <span class="strike"><span class="striketext"><font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">unread</span></font></span></span> eyes through the cataractic portholes of honeymoon cabins or salon
ladies toilet apartements. {B}ut, when those gossers aforesaid the <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">four waves</span></span> Four Waves of Erin, heard the detonation of the osculation which with ostentation Tristan to Isolde gave then lifted they up round Irelands shores the wail of old men&apos;s glee.</p>
<p class="flush">Highchanted the elderly <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">w</span></span> Waves of Erin, in-four-part Palestrian melody, four for all, all one in glee of grief of loneliness of age but with a bardic license there being about of birds and stars quite a sufficient number</p>
<p class="flush">This was their <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">way</span></span> wavechant:</p>
<p class="set">A birdless heaven, seadusk and one<a target="foot" id="fzz0020">&ordm;</a> star,
