<p class="flush">Isolde, her longfamous lashes butterflykissing his near and farfamous cheek, felt him sweeter than cherry or plum, than candykisses or Lipton&apos;s fruitcake, than the hawthorn valley in the 1st fortnight of May, than the finest band music going<a target="foot" id="fzz0021">&ordm;</a> than lovely thick with the sleep. She murmured googooeyes:</p>
<p class="set">&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p class="flush">My precious<a target="foot" id="fzz0022">&ordm;</a> since last we parted it seems to me that I have been continually in your company, even when I close my eyes at night, I am continually seeing you, hearing you, meeting you in different places<a target="foot" id="fzz0023">&ordm;</a> so that I am beginning to wonder whether my soul does not take leave of my body in sleep and go to
seek you and what is more find you,<a target="foot" id="fzz0024">&ordm;</a> or perchance this is only a phantasy. Tell me,<a target="foot" id="fzz0025">&ordm;</a> Daniel, my precious darling.</p>
<p> He, her whitehaired doughboy, Hero<a target="foot" id="fzz0026">&ordm;</a> of tens of scrums, carrier of the ovum, kisser of hundreds, blocker of thousands, ejaculater of jugfuls<a target="foot" id="fzz0027">&ordm;</a> aloudly sniffled<a target="foot" id="fzz0028">&ordm;</a> his nasal voice falling in strange ineffectual dropkick, so; in the language of

<a name="n01022e" href="../../FF/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01022e">contracted a stubborn cough</a> by medical advice of Dr Codd he had been lowering daily potions of extract of willow bark to keep off the Hibernian flu.

<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yes, Lady, I am not worthy. You little know a man&apos;s past. Why were we born in two different places? Wherefore have we met<a target="foot" id="fzz0041">&ordm;</a> yesterday so to speak? Why this strangulation, this yearning for a <u>bonum arduum</u> as distinguished from a <u>bonum simpliciter</u>? <a name="n03006a" href="../../FF/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03006a">Will you accept
a portion of my divided heart?</a> Wellaway, alas, for death in, with, for and on account of my wellbeloved I mutely yearn.</p>

<br> impatiently after her waiting patiently all through the damned old dinner of burnt loinchops and ignoble potatoes with everybody talking from soup to nuts all about loinchops and mashed murphies and the pig&apos;s arse and cabbage of the day before and they saying it wasn&apos;t a patch on the silverside boiled cowbeef of the stewsday day<a target="foot" id="fzz0043">&ordm;</a> before that

Love she wanted, the biggest obtainable, true new blind bottomless highspeed stunning staggerhumanity caveman love at first sight the universal super
jewel<a target="foot" id="fzz0044">&ordm;</a> for which reason she again kissed him and he, being an inborn gentleman with a gift of blushing as well as of backgammon, counterkissed because it was his one maxim in this life that if a lady, for example, happened to have a libido<a target="foot" id="fzz0045">&ordm;</a> a bite of a piece of Stilton cheese and he happened, for argument&apos; sake, to
have a quarter of a pound or so of feetygreen Gorgonzola in his pocket<a target="foot" id="fzz0046">&ordm;</a> why he&apos;d just simply put his hand in his pocket, don&apos;t you know, and well he&apos;d just give her the cheese, don&apos;t you see, to take a bite off. However<a target="foot" id="fzz0047">&ordm;</a> first &amp; foremost, before testing her triangle to prove whether she was as the
newspapers reported a <u>virgo intacta</u>, he asked her whether she had ever indulged in clandestine fornication with or without contraceptives.</p>
<p> No, nein, never in God&apos;s world, innocent as the undriven snow, his almost aunt swore whilst she adhered to that big left Neagh York shoulder of his. By the axecleft of my notch! By the hairs of my dearest parents! By the inviolable dew of Ben Bulben! By the freshwater pullan herring! No plunderer has ever wandered<a target="foot" id="fzz0048">&ordm;</a> has ever beheld the hundred wonders
of my underland</p>
<p> Her mournful embracer pointed to the sidereal host. By them he bade her swear, them that were and are and shall be, the silently

<p> Up they gazed, skyward to <a name="n01110e" href="../../FF/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01110e">stardom</a>, while in his <a name="n03128h" href="../../FF/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03128h">girleen&apos;s</a> ear that loveless lover, sinless sinner, breathed:
<br> How gentle &amp; kind I am, Issy. <a name="sa0804bv" href="../../FF/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0804bv">I never hurt the feelings of another</a>. And, I say, what a lovely nature is mine!</p>
