<p class="poemSp">&mdash; Three caws for Mister Mark
<br> Sure he hasnt got much of a bark
<br> And sure any he has is all beside the mark.
<br> O Wreneagle <a name="n03168e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03168e">Highflighty</a> wouldn&apos;t it be a sky of a lark
<br> To see that old busard whooping around in his shirt in the dark
<br> And he hunting about for his speckled trousers in Palmerston park.
<br> O moulty Mark
<br> Youre the rummest old rooster ever crawled out of a Noah&apos;s ark
<br> And you think you&apos;re the cock of the walk.
<br> Fowls up! Tristan&apos;s a spry young spark
<br> That&apos;ll tread her and wed her and bed her and red her
<br> Without even winking the tale of a feather
<br> And that&apos;s how that chap&apos;s going to make his money and mark.</p>
<p class="flush">The Four Waves of Erin also heard, leaning upon the staves of memory. Four eminently respectable old heladies they looked got up in sleek holiday toggery for the occasion, grey half tall toque, tailormade frock coat to match fathomglasses and soforth, you know, for all the world apart from the salt water like the fourth viscount Powerscourt or North the auctioneer at the royal
Dublin socities annual horseshow. They had seen their share.. the capture of Sir Arthur Casement in the year 1132 Coronation of Brian by the Danes at Clonmacnois the drowning of Pharoah Phitzharris in the (proleptically) red sea
<br><font color="green">{ms, 3v}</font>
<br> The drowning of poor Mat Keane of Dunlearey the scattering of the flemish armada off the coasts of Galway and Longford, the landing of St Patrick at Tara in the year 1798, the dispersal of the French fleet under General Boche in the year 2002. And such was their memory that they had been appointed extern<a target="foot" id="fzz0019">&ordm;</a> professors to the four chief seats of learning in
Erin, the Universities of killorcure, killthemall, killeachother, killkelly-on-the-Flure, whither they wirelessed four times weekly lectures in the four modes of history, past, present, absent and future. Saltsea widowers all four they had been many ages before summarily divorced by their respective shehusbands (with whom they had parted on the best of terms) by a decrees absolute issued by Mrs
Justice Squelchman in the married male offenders court at bohernabreena, one for inefficiency in backscratching, too for having broken rere-wind without having first made a request in writing on stamped foolscap paper, three for having attempted hunish familiarities after a meal decompsed crab, four on account of his general cast of countenance. Though that was ever so long ago they could still
with an effort of memory and by counting accurately the four periwinkle buttons of the fly of their knickybockies recall the name of the four beautiful sisters Brinabride who were at the moment touring the <a name="n03073b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03073b">United States of Africa</a>

<br> Yet were they fettlesome anon, lured by the immortal rose of Wombman&apos;s beauty Often would they cling tentacularly about the <a name="sa0981ek" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0981ek">ships&apos; waists</a> of the Northwall and Hollyhead boats and the Isle of Man tourist steamers, peering with glaucomatose eyes through the cataractic portholes of honeymoon cabins or saloon ladies toilet
apartements. {B}ut, when those jossers aforesaid the Four Waves of Erin, heard the detonation of the osculation (cataclysmic <a name="sa0851bw" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0851bw">cataglotism</a>) which with ostentation (osculum cum basio necnon suavioque) Tristan to Isolde gave then lifted they up round Irelands shores the wail of old men&apos;s planxty:</p>
<p class="flush">Highchanted the elderly Waves of Erin, in-four-part Palestrian melody, four for all, all one in glee of grief of loneliness of age but with a bardic license there being about of birds and stars and noise quite a sufficient quantity</p>
<p class="flush">This plashed their wavechant:</p>
<p class="set">A birdless heaven, seadusk and one<a target="foot" id="fzz0020">&ordm;</a> star,
<br> low in the west
<br> And thou, poor heart, loves image, faint and far,
<br> Rememberest</p>
<p class="set">&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p class="set">Her seacold eyes and her soft foamwhite brown
<br> And fragrant hair,
<br> Falling as through the silence falleth now
<br> Dusk from the air.</p>
