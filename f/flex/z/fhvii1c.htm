<p class="flush">strewing, the strikingly shining, the twittingly twinkling,<a target="foot" id="fzz0050">&ordm;</a> &amp; as<a target="foot" id="fzz0051">&ordm;</a> he uranographically remarked<a target="foot" id="fzz0052">&ordm;</a> the lamplights of lovers)<a target="foot" id="fzz0053">&ordm;</a> in the Beyond<a target="foot" id="fzz0054">&ordm;</a></p>
<p> Up they gazed skyward to stardom<a target="foot" id="fzz0055">&ordm;</a> while in his girleen&apos;s ear that loveless lover<a target="foot" id="fzz0056">&ordm;</a> sinless sinner<a target="foot" id="fzz0057">&ordm;</a> breathed<a target="foot" id="fzz0058">&ordm;</a></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; How gentlemanlike am I, Issy. I never hurt the feelings of another?<a target="foot" id="fzz0059">&ordm;</a></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And, Tris, what a sweet nature is mine, is not it?</p>
<p> It wasn&apos;t exactly anything he said or it wasn&apos;t anything he actually did but all the same it was smthg about him like the way he was always sticking his finger into his trousers pockets<a target="foot" id="fzz0060">&ordm;</a> &amp; then sticking it into his eye like a borny baby, the great big slob<a target="foot" id="fzz0061">&ordm;</a> or the once she dropped her ittly ittly
hankyfuss &amp; the way so graceful he picked it up with his near hoof and footed it up so politefully to her ittly ittly nibbleurs. <a name="sd1034i" href="../../ff/fnbs/sd1all.htm#sd1034i"></a>She was tearing.<a name="sd1034i" href="../../ff/fnbs/sd1all.htm#sd1034i"></a></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Go away instantly, she roared, you scum!</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Perfect, he said, you bloody bitch<a target="foot" id="fzz0062">&ordm;</a></p>
<p> He took French leave of her &amp; circulated as bidden. Before many instants had passed she let out a whistle. Hearing his name called most sagaciously he ceased to walk about &amp; turned on her, his look now charged with purpose seemed to say<a target="foot" id="fzz0063">&ordm;</a></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Curse your stinking putrid soul to hell, you thing, &amp; all belonged to you<a target="foot" id="fzz0064">&ordm;</a></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No, come back, she ogled. Forget me not. I do so want you.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It is perfect, her all but nephew said.</p>
<p> Having already stopped<a target="foot" id="fzz0065">&ordm;</a> he turned and circulated in reverse direction and presently halted vis a vis<a target="foot" id="fzz0066">&ordm;</a> his soon to be aunt who welcomed him as she said:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; How nobly you have responded to our call, loyal one.</p> </p>  </main>
