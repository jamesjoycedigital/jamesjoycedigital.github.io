</p> <p class="set"><big>Her Charms</big>

</p> <p class="spbr">FOR HER PITY there were times <a name="n03085b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03085b">she even pitied the damned old devil himself</a> playing demon patience after his <a name="n03118b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03118b">lunch of hot air</a> and fanning himself <a name="n03085c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03085c">with his asbestos slippers in the coolingroom in hell</a>.
</p> <p class="spbr">For her charity one day when it was sneezing cold she met a beggargirl in the park and, having no small change about her, she went behind a bramblebush, slipped off her <a name="n01090h" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01090h">sprigged</a> <a name="n03132d" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03132d">petticoat and gave it to the beggargirl</a> who instantly disappeared (she having been in point of fact Saint Dympna who got up the exhibition of poverty on purpose) along with the petticoat.
</p> <p class="spbr">On another occasion there was a pestilence caused by a certain dragon who said it would go on for ever unless she took off all her glad rags and <a name="n01053j" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01053j">walked round Ireland, her left hand to the sea</a>. So she did this, but she had herself painted green all over her body as far as mother nature allowed. And when they heard the moaning of the Shees telling she was off, the weakness of death fell on everybody and everybody pulled down all the blinds in Ireland. The dragon there and then got a grip on the big clean ideals and converted and entered a nunnery.
</p> <p class="spbr">She could do two things at same time, <a name="n01070c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01070c">cook hash and read</a> <a name="n01007a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01007a">Harry Coverdale&apos;s Courtship</a>, only sometimes it was how she would be studying something like the day God knows she sat down in the plate of soup.
</p> <p class="spbr">And flahoolagh, bless her pretty face, <a name="n01035b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01035b">she had shaken cocktails</a>, no lie, <a name="n01035b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01035b">for</a> <a name="n01073b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01073b">pistoleers</a>, gunmen, <a name="n01049g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01049g">parabellumites</a> and <a name="n01112g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01112g">munitioners</a> from every barony in Ireland.

</p> <p class="set"><big>The Staves of Memory</big>

</p> <p class="spbr">THE FOUR WAVES OF ERIN also heard, leaning upon the staves of memory. Four eminently respectable old heladies they looked, got up in sleek holiday toggery for the occasion, grey half tall toque, tailormade frockcoat to match, fathomglasses and so forth, you know, for all the world, apart from the salt water, like the fourth viscount Powerscourt or North the auctioneer at the royal Dublin society&apos;s annual horseshow.
</p> <p class="spbr">They had seen their share: the capture of Sir Arthur Casement in the year 1132, the coronation of Brian by the Danes at Clonmacnois, the drowning of Pharaoh Phitsharris in the (proleptically) red sea, the drowning of poor Matt Kane of Dunleary, the scattering of the Flemish armada off the coasts of Galway and Longford, the landing of St Patrick at Tara in the year 1798, the dispersal of the French fleet under General Boche in the year 2002.
</p> <p class="spbr">And such was their memory that they had been appointed extern professors to the four chief seats of learning in Erin, the Universities of Killorcure, Killthemall, Killeachother, Killkelly-on-the-Flure, whither they wirelessed four times weekly lectures in the four modes of history: past, present, absent and future.
</p> <p class="spbr">Saltsea widowers all four, they had been many ages before summarily divorced by their respective shehusbands (with whom they had parted on the best of terms) by a decree absolute issued by Mrs Justice Squelchman in the married male offenders court at Bohernabreena, one for inefficiency in backscratching, two for having broken rerewind without having first made a request in writing on stamped foolscap paper, three for having attempted hunnish familiarities after a meal of decomposed crab, four on account of his
general cast of countenance. Though that was ever so long ago, they could still with an effort of memory and by counting accurately the four periwinkle buttons of the fly of their knickybockies recall the name of the four beautiful sisters Brinabride who were at the moment touring the <a name="n03073b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03073b">United States of Africa</a>.
</p> <p class="spbr">Yet were they fettlesome anon, lured by the immortal rose of Wombman&apos;s beauty. Often would they cling tentacularly about the <a name="sa0981ek" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0981ek">ships&apos; waists</a> of the Northwall and Holyhead boats and the Isle of Man tourist steamers, peering with glaucomatose eyes through the cataractic portholes of honeymoon cabins or saloon ladies&apos; toilet apartments. But when those jossers aforesaid, the Four Waves of Erin, heard the detonation of the osculation (cataclysmic <a name="sa0851bw" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0851bw">cataglotism</a>) which with ostentation (osculum cum basio necnon suavioque) Tristan to Isolde gave, then lifted they up round Ireland&apos;s shores the wail of old men&apos;s planxty.
</p> <p class="spbr">Highchanted the elderly Waves of Erin in four-part Palestrian melody, four for all, all one in glee of grief of loneliness of age but with a bardic license, there being about of birds and stars and noise quite a sufficient quantity.
</p> <p class="spbr">This plashed their wavechant:
</p> <p class="set"><i>A birdless heaven, seadusk and one star,
<br>Low in the west
<br>And thou, poor heart, loves image, faint and far,
<br>Rememberest
</p> <p class="set">Her seacold eyes and her soft foamwhite brown
<br>And fragrant hair,
<br>Falling as through the silence falleth now
<br>Dusk from the air.
</p> <p class="set">A why wilt thou,
<br>A why wilt thou remember these,
<br>A why,
<br>Poor heart, repine,
<br>If the dear love she yielded with a sigh
</p> <p class="set">Was never thine!</i>

</p> <p class="set"><big>The Lion&apos;s Mouth</big>

</p> <p class="spbr">AND CONGRUOUSLY ENOUGH the confusion of its composition was fitly capped by the zigzaggery of its delivery, and not for the first time in history just as, it has been more than once pointed out, the demise of one parish priest or curate is sure to be followed sooner or later by other parochial demises of an allied nature.
</p> <p class="spbr">Though, coming now to the postman hastily left on p 80, though his qualifications for that particular postal, or office, were known only to a limited circle of friends, the spectacle of the Lucalizod lettercarrier, a most capable official of very superior appearance in his emptybottlegreen jerkin, at once gave doubtersful a vouch for his bilateralist zeal. His movements showed that North and South sides of the roadway were visited by him in turn in the discharge of his important duty during which he got a number of stumbles which appeared to startle him very much and, while he allowed simple and unfranked correspondence to escape automatically from the mailbag issued to him, the unerring zeal with which, amid a blizzard with low visibility and on uneven ground, he sorted and secured for immediate home delivery all packages containing bullion or eatables in a manner made of Shawn the Post a man seen, felt for, envied and looked up to.
</p> <p class="spbr">Thus was a woman&apos;s petition, maid, wife and mother, brought by two sons of wild earth, since sainted scholasts, Iacopus Pennifera and Johannes Epistolophorus, to their and of all the Lord, offering to him from whom all things had come to them their gift of her knowledge, thereby giving him of his own (the lion&apos;s mouth).
But when the facsimile of the letter <a name="n06138c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06138c">written by the joint author</a> finally reached the alderman&apos;s ears his surprise
was practically complete so much so as to <a name="n01083m" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01083m">give him the raspberry</a>. With <a name="n06156i" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06156i">groanings which could not be all uttered</a> <a name="n06029m" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06029m">down he sat</a>, he lifted up his <a name="sa0121as" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0121as">shirtsleeves</a>, while many in the <a name="n06127m" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06127m">baronet publican&apos;s</a> <a name="n06030n" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06030n">banner room</a>, who did not dare, heard him declare: <a name="n01106e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01106e">I will give &pound;10 tomorrow gladly to the first fellow who will put her in the royal canal</a>.
