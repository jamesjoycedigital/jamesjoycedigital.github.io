<p> It was one night at a long time ago when <a name="n25067a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n25all.htm#n25067a">Adam was delvin &amp;</a> his <a name="n25130f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n25all.htm#n25130f">madamene</a> <a name="n25067a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n25all.htm#n25067a">spinning watersilts</a> Sir Howther had his burnt head up in his lamphouse laying cold hands on himself. And his two little jimminies were
not yet kicking on the oilcloth of the van homerigh <a name="n25048a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n25all.htm#n25048a">homecashel</a> <a name="n25048c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n25all.htm#n25048c">earthenhouse</a>, Tristopher &amp; Hilary. With their dummy. And who come to the keep of his inn but the <a name="n25130a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n25all.htm#n25130a">niece of his</a> prankwench. And the prankwench picked
a rosy one &amp; made her <a name="n25127g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n25all.htm#n25127g">wit</a> forenenst the dour. And spoke she to the dour in petty perusienne: Why do I like a <a name="n25127j" href="../../ff/fnbs/n25all.htm#n25127j">poss of porter</a>pease. But the dour handworded her <a name="n25057e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n25all.htm#n25057e">grace</a> in
<a name="n25072c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n25all.htm#n25072c">dootch nossow</a>: Shut. So her <a name="n25057e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n25all.htm#n25057e">grace o&apos;malice</a> snapped up Tristopher and she rain rain rain. And Sir Howther <a name="n25126j" href="../../ff/fnbs/n25all.htm#n25126j">warlessed</a> after her in his Finngallese: Stop deef stop. Come back to
<a name="n25027l" href="../../ff/fnbs/n25all.htm#n25027l">my Earin</a> Stop. But she swareded to him: Unlikelyhood. And there was a brandnewwail that same <a name="n25072o" href="../../ff/fnbs/n25all.htm#n25072o">sabbaoth</a> <a name="n25052c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n25all.htm#n25052c">somewhere in Erio</a> Then the prankwench went for a forty years walk and she washed the blessings off the jiminy
and she had her four owlers <a name="n25127h" href="../../ff/fnbs/n25all.htm#n25127h">monitors</a> for to taught him
<br><font color="green">{ms, 93v}</font>
<br> his tickles and she came raining back through the <a name="n25031e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n25all.htm#n25031e">westerness</a> back again <a name="n25127e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n25all.htm#n25127e">in a brace of samers</a> back to Sir Howther another night at another time. And where did she come but to the bar of his <a name="n25058h" href="../../ff/fnbs/n25all.htm#n25058h">bristolry</a>. And Sir
Howther had his heels drowned in his cellarmalt <a name="n10107i" href="../../ff/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10107i">shaking warm hands with himself</a> and his little jiminy, Hilary, and his dummy were on the tearsheet of the cashel, wringing &amp; coughing in their first infancy. And the prankwench picked a paly one &amp; made <a name="n25127g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n25all.htm#n25127g">witter</a> before the
wicked. Why do I like 2 <a name="n25127j" href="../../ff/fnbs/n25all.htm#n25127j">poss of</a> porterpeace.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 90v}</font>
<br> But the wicked handworded her <a name="n25057e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n25all.htm#n25057e">grace</a>. Shut. Then her <a name="n25057e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n25all.htm#n25057e">grace o&apos;malice</a> put down Tristopher &amp; picked up with Hilary and she rain, rain, rain. And Sir Howther bleethered atter her: Stop Damd stop Come back with my Earring. Stop But she swareadid to him: Am liking it.
And there was a funtold <a name="n25057f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n25all.htm#n25057f">grandnewwail</a> that altarsame sobbaoth <a name="n25052c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n25all.htm#n25052c">somewhere in Erio</a>. Then the prankwench went for a hundred years walk with Hilary and she punched curses into him &amp; she had her four larksical
<a name="n25127h" href="../../ff/fnbs/n25all.htm#n25127h">monitrix</a> to taught him his tears &amp; then she went with her Larryhill for another hundred years walk &amp;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 87v}</font>
<br> in a <a name="n25127f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n25all.htm#n25127f">pair of changes</a> she was back to Sir Howther. And why did she halt at all, but by the ward of his mansionhome a third time for the charm. Sir Howther had his hurricane hips up to his pantrybox and his little jiminy Toughertrees &amp; the dummy were belord on the watercloth, kissing &amp; spitting, &amp; roguing &amp;
<a name="n25074g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n25all.htm#n25074g">poghuing</a> in their second infancy. And the prankswench she picked a blank &amp; made her <a name="n25127g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n25all.htm#n25127g">wittest</a> in front of the Arkway of Triumph &amp; asked: Why do I like 3 <a name="n25127j" href="../../ff/fnbs/n25all.htm#n25127j">poss</a> porterpeace And Sir Howther came hip hip handicap
out through his arkway of his 3 cashels <a name="n25137i" href="../../ff/fnbs/n25all.htm#n25137i">yellow green blue red orange violet in his</a> broadginger <a name="n25060c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n25all.htm#n25060c">civic chollar</a> &amp; <a name="n25059d" href="../../ff/fnbs/n25all.htm#n25059d">allbuff</a>shirt like a <a name="n25137i" href="../../ff/fnbs/n25all.htm#n25137i">redyellin orangeman
in his violet indigonation</a> to the whole longth of the strongth of his bowman&apos;s <a name="n25104g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n25all.htm#n25104g">bill</a>. And he put his rude hand to his <a name="n25127k" href="../../ff/fnbs/n25all.htm#n25127k">E C Haitch</a>. And his thick speech spuck for her to shut up shop, dammy. And the dummy shot the shutter down and they all drank free. And that was the
first peace of porter of <a name="n25127i" href="../../ff/fnbs/n25all.htm#n25127i">illiterative</a> porthery in the whole flooding. The prankwench was to hold her dummyship &amp; the jiminies was to keep their peacewave &amp; Sir Howther was to get the wind up.</p> </p>  </main>
