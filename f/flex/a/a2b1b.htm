<p> It was of a night at a long time agone when Adam was delvin and his madame spinning watersilts and Sir Howther had his burnt head high up in his lamphouse, laying cold hands on himself. And his two little jiminies, cousins of ours, Tristopher and Hilary, were not yet kickaheeling on the oilcloth flure of his homerigh, cashel and earthenhouse. And who come to the keep of his inn only the niece
of his, the prankquean? And the prankquean picked a rosy one and made her wit forenenst the dour. And spoke she to the dour in her petty perusienne: Why do I am alook alike a poss of porterpease? But the dour handworded her grace in dootch nossow: Shut. So her grace o&apos;malice snapped up his jiminy Tristopher and <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">out</span></span> into the
westerness she rain, rain, rain. And Jarl van Houther warlessed after her: Stop deef stop come back to my earin stop. But she swaradid to him: Unlikelihut. And there was a brandnewwail that same sabboath<a target="foot" id="faz0007">&ordm;</a> somewhere in Erio. And the prankquean went for her forty years&apos; walk and she washed the blessings off the jiminy and she had her four owlers masters
for to taught him his tickles and then she started to rain
<br><font color="green">{ms, 33}</font>
<br> and to rain and she was back again with Jarl van Houther&apos;s in a brace of samers of another night at another time. And where did she come but to the bar of his bristolry. And the Jarl had his heels drowned in his cellarmalt, shaking warm hands with himself, and the jiminy hilary and the dummy, in their first infancy, were below on the tearsheet, wringing and coughing. And the prankquean
picked a paly one and she made her witter before the wicked, saying: Why do I alook alike two poss of porterpease? And: Shut, says the wicked, handwording her. So her grace o&apos;malice set down a jiminy and took up a jimminy and rain rain rain <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">with her hillary hollary</span></span>. And the Jarl bleethered atter her: Stop damb stop come back with my
earring stop. But the prankquean swaraded: Am liking it. And there was a fineold
<br><font color="green">{ms, 34}</font>
<br> grandnewwail that altarsame sabbaoth somewhere in Erio. And the prankwench went for a forty days walk and she punched the curses into the jiminy and she had her four larksical monitrix to taught him his tears and then she started raining raining and in a pair of changers she was back again at the Jarl&apos;s and her larryhill with her. And why would she halt at all only by the ward of his
mansionhouse of another night for the third charm. And the Jarl van Houther had his hurricane hips up to his pantrybox and the jiminy Toughertrees and the dummy were <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">belor</span></span> below on the watercloth, kissing and spitting and roguing and poghuing and in their second infancy. And the prankwench picked a blank and she made her wittest in front
of the arkway of triumph, asking: Why do I alook alike three poss of porterpease?
<br><font color="green">{ms, 35}</font>
<br> And van Houten himself came hip hip handihip, out through the arkway of his three castles, in his gingerbroad hat and his civic chollar and his allabuff shurt like a red yellan orangeman in his violet indigonation to the whole longth of the strongth of his bowman&apos;s bill. And he clapped his rude hand to his E.C. Haitch and he ordered and his thick speech spuck for her to shut up shop,
dammy. And the dummy shot the shutter up and they all drank free. And that was the first peace of illiterative porthery in the whole floody world. The prankquean was to hold her dummyship and the jiminies was to keep the peacewave and van Houther was to get the wind up.
