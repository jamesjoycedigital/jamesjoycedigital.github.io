<p> It was of a night, late, lang time agone in an auldstane eld when Adam was delvin and his madameen spinning watersilts when big mountin man was <a name="n25134e" href="../../FF/fnbs/n25all.htm#n25134e">everybully</a> and the first leal ribberrobber every<a name="n01053c" href="../../FF/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01053c">buddy</a> else to his makin eyes and when everybilly lived alove with everybiddy
else and Jarl van Houther had his burnt head high up in his lamphouse, laying cold hands on himself. And his two little jiminies, cousins of ours, Tristopher and Hilary, were not yet kickaheeling their dummy on the oilcloth flure of his homerigh, cashel and earthenhouse. And, be dermot, who come to the keep of his inn only the niece of his, the prankquean? And the prankquean
<a name="n25132a" href="../../FF/fnbs/n25all.htm#n25132a">pulled</a> a rosy one and made her wit forenenst the dour. And she lit up. And spoke she to the dour in her petty perusienne: <a name="n25133b" href="../../FF/fnbs/n25all.htm#n25133b">Mark the Wans</a>, Why do I am alook alike a poss of porterpease? And that was how the
<a name="n25125b" href="../../FF/fnbs/n25all.htm#n25125b">skirtmisshes</a> began. But the dour handworded her grace in dootch nossow: Shut. So her grace o&apos;malice kidsnapped up the jeminy Tristopher and into the shandy westerness she rain, rain, rain. And Jarl van Houther warlessed after her with <a name="n25130l" href="../../FF/fnbs/n25all.htm#n25130l">soft dovesgall</a>: Stop deef stop come
back to my earin stop. But she swaradid to him: Unlikelihut. And there was a brandnewwail that same sabboath<a target="foot" id="faz0007">&ordm;</a> night of <a name="n25132g" href="../../FF/fnbs/n25all.htm#n25132g">falling angles</a> somewhere in Erio. And the prankquean went for her forty years&apos; walk in <a name="n23ffrb" href="../../FF/fnbs/n23all.htm#n23ffrb">Tourlemounde</a> and she
washed the blessings of the <a name="n23128m" href="../../FF/fnbs/n23all.htm#n23128m">lovespots</a> off the jiminy with soap sulliver&apos;s <a name="n25131g" href="../../FF/fnbs/n25all.htm#n25131g">suddles</a> and she had her four owlers masters for to taught him his tickles and she convorted him to the onesure allgood and he became a luderman and then she started to rain
<br><font color="green">{ms, 33}</font>
<br> and to rain and, be red tom, she was back again at Jarl van Houther&apos;s in a brace of samers and the jiminy with her in her <a name="n25133a" href="../../FF/fnbs/n25all.htm#n25133a">pinafrond</a> lace at night at another time. And where did she come but to the bar of his bristolry. And the Jarl had his <a name="n25135c" href="../../FF/fnbs/n25all.htm#n25135c">baretholo</a>bruised heels
drowned in his cellarmalt, shaking warm hands with himself, and the jiminy hilary and the dummy, in their first infancy, were below on the tearsheet, wringing and coughing, like brodar and <a name="n25150a" href="../../FF/fnbs/n25all.htm#n25150a">histher</a>. And the prankquean nipped a paly one and lit up again &amp; she made her witter before the wicked, saying: Mark the Twy Why do I am alook
alike two poss of porterpease? And: Shut, says the wicked, handwording her <a name="n25133e" href="../../FF/fnbs/n25all.htm#n25133e">modesty</a>. So her <a name="n25133e" href="../../FF/fnbs/n25all.htm#n25133e">modesty</a> a&apos;forethought set down a jiminy and took up a jimminy and all the lilipath ways to <a name="n25048l" href="../../FF/fnbs/n25all.htm#n25048l">Woeman&apos;s land</a> she rain
rain rain. And the Jarl bleethered atter her with a <a name="n25130m" href="../../FF/fnbs/n25all.htm#n25130m">loud finegale</a>: Stop damb stop come back with my earring stop. But the prankquean swaraded: Am liking it. And there was a fineold
<br><font color="green">{ms, 34}</font>
<br> grandnewwail that altarsame <a name="n25132i" href="../../FF/fnbs/n25all.htm#n25132i">laurency</a> night of <a name="n25132h" href="../../FF/fnbs/n25all.htm#n25132h">starshootings</a> somewhere in Erio. And the prankquean went for her forty days walk <font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font> and she punched the curses of
<a name="n25089a" href="../../FF/fnbs/n25all.htm#n25089a">cromcruwell</a> with the nail of a top into the jiminy and she had her four larksical monitrix to taught him his tears and she <a name="n25133k" href="../../FF/fnbs/n25all.htm#n25133k">convorted</a> him to the <a name="n22085k" href="../../FF/fnbs/n22all.htm#n22085k">onecertain allserene</a> and he became a tristian and then she started
raining raining and in a pair of changers, be dom ter, she was back again at the Jarl&apos;s and her larryhill with her in her abromette. And why would she halt at all if not by the ward of his mansionhome of another nice lace for the third charm. And the Jarl van Houther had his hurricane hips up to his pantrybox ruminating in his all four stomachs (Dare! O dare!) and the jiminy Toughertrees and
the dummy were below on the watercloth, kissing and spitting and roguing and poghuing like <a name="n19040c" href="../../FF/fnbs/n19all.htm#n19040c">knavepaltry</a> and <a name="n19041j" href="../../FF/fnbs/n19all.htm#n19041j">naivebride</a> and in their second infancy. And the prankquean picked a blank &amp; <a name="sa0721e" href="../../FF/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0721e">lit out</a> and she made her
wittest in front of the arkway of triumph, asking: Mark the Tris Why do I alook alike three poss of porterpease?
<br><font color="green">{ms, 35}</font>
<br> But that was how the <a name="n25125b" href="../../FF/fnbs/n25all.htm#n25125b">skirtmisshes</a> endupped. For like the Campbells coming with a lance of lightning van Houten himself, the old terror of the dames, came hip hip handihip, out through the opened arkway of his three shuttoned castles, in his broadginger hat and his civic chollar and his allabuff shurt like a rudd yellan gruebleen
orangeman in his violet indigonation to the whole longth of the strongth of his bowman&apos;s bill. And he clopped his rude hand to his <a name="n25135a" href="../../FF/fnbs/n25all.htm#n25135a">eacy hitch</a> and he ordered and his thick spich spuck for her to shut up shop, dammy. And the dummy shot the shutter up and they all drank free. And that was the first peace of illiterative porthery in
the whole <a name="n25131a" href="../../FF/fnbs/n25all.htm#n25131a">flamend</a> floody <a name="n25131a" href="../../FF/fnbs/n25all.htm#n25131a">flatuous</a> world. The prankquean was to hold her dummyship and the jiminies was to keep the peacewave and van Houther was to get the wind up. Thus the <a name="n25131d" href="../../FF/fnbs/n25all.htm#n25131d">hearsomeness of the burger</a> felicitates
