Sir Tristram, violer d&apos;amores, fr&apos;over the short sea, had passencore rearrived from North Armorica on this side the scraggy isthmus of Europe Minor to wielderfight his penisolate war: nor had topsawyer&apos;s rocks by the stream Oconee exaggerated themselse to Laurens County&apos;s gorgios while they went doublin their mumper all the time:
nor avoice from afire bellowsed mishe mishe to tauftauf thuartpeatrick: not yet, though venisoon after, had a kidscad buttended a bland old isaac: not yet, though all&apos;s fair in vanessy, were sosie sesthers wroth with twone nathandjoe.

The great fall of the offwall entailed at such short notice the schute of Finnigan, erse solid man, that the humptyhillhead of
humself prumptly sends an unquiring one well to the west in quest of his tumptytumtoes: and their upturnpikepointandplace is at the knock out in the park where oranges have been laid to rust upon the green since Devlins first loved livy.
