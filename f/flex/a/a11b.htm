<p> The tale of the fall

<br> is retaled early in bed and later on life down through all christian minstrelsy. The great fall of the wall entailed at such short notice the schute of Finnigan, once solid man, that the humptyhillhead of humself prumptly sends an unquiring one well to the west in quest of his tumptytumtoes: and their upturnpikepointingplace is at the knock out in the park where oranges have been laid to rest
upon the green ever and evermore since Devlins first loved livy.</p>
