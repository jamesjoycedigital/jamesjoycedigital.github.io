<p> It was of a night, late, lang time agone, in an auldstane eld, when Adam

<br> was delvin and his madameen spinning watersilts, when mulk mountynotty man was everybully and the first leal ribberrobber that ever had her ainway everybuddy else to his lovesaking eyes and when everybilly lived alove with everybiddy else and Jarl van Hoother had his burnt head high up in his lamphouse, laying cold hands on himself. And his two little jiminies, cousins of ours, Tristopher and
Hilary, were kickaheeling their dummy on the oilcloth flure of his homerigh, castle and earthenhouse. And, be dermot, who come to the keep of his inn only the niece-of-his-in-law, the prankquean. And the prankquean pulled a rosy one and made her wit forenenst the dour. And she lit up and fireland was ablaze. And spoke she to the dour in her petty perusienne: Mark the Wans, why do I am alook alike
a poss of porterpease? And that was how the skirtmisshes began. But the dour handworded her grace in dootch nossow: Shut! So her grace o&apos;malice kidsnapped up the jiminy Tristopher and into the shandy westerness she rain, rain, rain. And Jarl van Hoother warlessed after her with soft dovesgall: Stop deef stop come back to my earin stop. But she swaradid to him: Unlikelihud. And there was a
brannewwail that same sabbaoth night of falling angles somewhere in Erio. And the prankquean went for her forty years&apos; walk in Tourlemonde and she washed the blessings of the lovespots off the jiminy with soap sulliver suddles and she had her four owlers masters for to tauch him his tickles and she convorted him to the onesure allgood and he became a luderman. So then she started to rain and
to rain and, be redtom, she was back again at Jarl van Hoother&apos;s in a brace of samers and the jiminy with her in her pinafrond, lace at night, at another time. And where did she come but to the bar of his bristolry. And Jarl van Hoother had his baretholobruised heels drowned in his cellarmalt, shaking warm hands with himself, and the jiminy Hilary and
<br><font color="green">{f39, 22}</font>
<br> the dummy in their first infancy were below on the tearsheet, wringing and coughing, like brodar and histher. And the prankquean nipped a paly one and lit up again and redcocks flew flackering from the hillcombs. And she made her witter before the wicked, saying: Mark the Twy, why do I am alook alike two poss of porterpease? And: Shut! says the wicked, handwording her madesty. So her madesty
a&apos;forethought set down a jiminy and took up a jiminy and all the lilipath ways to Woeman&apos;s Land she rain, rain, rain. And Jarl van Hoother bleethered atter her with a loud finegale: Stop domb stop come back with my earring stop. But the prankquean swaradid: Am liking it. And there was a wild old grannewwail that altarsame laurency night of starshootings somewhere in Erio. And the
prankquean went for her forty years&apos; walk in Turnlemeem and she punched the curses of cromcruwell with the nail of a top into the jiminy and she had her four larksical monitrix
<br><font color="green">{f10, 18}</font>
<br> to tauch him his tears and she provorted him to the onecertain allsecure and he became a tristian. So then she started raining, raining, and in a pair of changers, be dom ter, she was back again at Jarl van Hoother&apos;s and the Larryhill with her under her abromette. And why would she halt at all if not by the ward of his mansionhome of another nice lace for the third charm? And Jarl van
Hoother had his hurricane hips up to his pantrybox, ruminating in his holdfour stomachs (Dare! O dare!), and the jiminy Toughertrees and the dummy were belove on the watercloth, kissing and spitting, and roguing and poghuing, like knavepaltry and naivebride and in their second infancy. And the prankquean picked a blank and lit out and the valleys lay twinkling. And she made her wittest in front of
the arkway of trihump, asking: Mark the Tris, why do I am alook alike three poss of porterpease? But that was how the skirtmisshes endupped. For, like the campbells acoming with a forklance of lightning, Jarl van Hoother Boanerges himself, the old terror of the dames, came hip hop handihap out through the pikeopened arkway of his three shuttoned castles in his broadginger hat and his civic chollar

But barley&apos;s up again, begrained to it! The lads is attending school nessons regular, sir. Spelling beesknees with hathatansy and turning out tables by mudapplication. All for the books and never pegging
smashers

<br> after Tom Bowe-Glassarse or Timmy the Tosser. &apos;Tisraely the truth! Now isn&apos;t it, roman pathoriks? You were the doublejoynted janitor the morning they were delivered and you&apos;ll be a grandfer yet entirely when the ritehand seizes what the lovearm knows. Kevin&apos;s just a doat with his cherub cheek and his little lamp and schoolbelt and bag of knicks, chalking oghres on walls
and playing postman&apos;s knock round the diggings, and if the seep were milk you could lieve his olde by his ide. But, laus sake, the devil does be in that knirps of a Jerry sometimes, the tarandtan plaidboy, making encostive inkum out of the last of his lavings and writing a blue streak over his bourseday shirt. Hetty Jane&apos;s a Child of Mary. She&apos;ll be coming (for they&apos;re sure to
choose her) in her white of gold with a tourch of ivy to rekindle the flame on Felix Day. And Essie Shanahan has let down her skirts. You remember Essie in Our Luna&apos;s Convent? They called her Holly Merry her lips were so ruddy berry and Pia de Purebelle when the redminers&apos; riots was on about her. Were I a clerk designate to the Williamswoods menufactors I&apos;d poster those pouters on
every jamb in the town. She&apos;s making her rep at Lanner&apos;s twicenightly. With the tabarine tamtammers of the whirligigmagees. Beats that cachucha flat. &apos;Twould dilate your heart to go.

<p> Aisy now, you decent man, with your knees and lie quiet and repose your honour&apos;s lordship!</p>
<p> Hold him there, Ezekiel Irons, and may God strengthen you! It&apos;s our warm spirits, boys, he&apos;s spooring. Dimitrius O&apos;Flagonan, cork that cure for the Clancartys! You swamped enough since Portobello to float the Pomeroy. Fetch neahere, Pat Koy! And fetch nouyou, Pam Yates! Be nayther angst of Wramawitch! Here&apos;s lumbos. Where misties swaddlum, where misches lodge none, where
mystries pour kind on, O sleepy! So be yet!</p>
<p> I&apos;ve an eye on queer Behan and old Kate and the butter, trust me. She&apos;ll do no jugglywuggly with her war souvenir postcards to help to build me murial. Tippers, I&apos;ll trip your traps! Assure a sure there! And we put on your clock again, sir, for you. Did or didn&apos;t we, sharestutterers? So you won&apos;t be up a stump entirely. Nor shed your remnants. The sternwheel&apos;s
crawling strong. I

<br> seen your missus in the hall. Like queenoveire. Arrah, it&apos;s herself that&apos;s fine, sure, don&apos;t be talking! Shirksends? You storyan Harry chap longa me Harry chap storyan grass woman plelthy good trout. Shakeshands. Dibble a hayfork&apos;s wrong with her only her lex&apos;s salig. Bald Tib does be yawning and smirking cats&apos; hours on the Pollockses&apos; woolly round tabouret
cushion watching her sewing a dream together, the tailor&apos;s daughter, stitch to her last. Or, while waiting for winter to fire the enchantment, decoying more nesters to fall down the flue. It&apos;s an allavalonche that blows nopussy food. If you only were there to explain the meaning, best of men, and talk to her nice of guldenselver. The lips would moisten once again. As when you drove with
her to Findrinny Fair. What with reins here and ribbons there all your hands were employed so she never knew was she on land or at sea or swooped through the blue like Airwinger&apos;s bride. She was flirtsome then and she&apos;s fluttersome yet. She can second a song and adores a scandal when the last post&apos;s gone by. Fond of a concertina and pairs passing when she&apos;s had her forty winks
for supper after kanekannan and abbely dimpling and is in her merlin chair assotted, reading her <i>Evening World</i>. To see is it smarts, full lengths or swaggers. News, news, all the news. Death, a leopard, kills fellah in Fez. Angry scenes at Stormount. Stilla Star with her lucky in goingaways. Opportunity fair with the China floods and we hear these rosy rumours. Ding Tams he noise about all
same Harry chap. She&apos;s seeking her way, a chickle a chuckle, in and out of their serial story, <i>Les Loves of Selskar et Pervenche</i>, freely adopted to <i>The Novvergin&apos;s Viv</i>. There&apos;ll be bluebells blowing in salty sepulchres the night she signs her final tear. Zee End. But that&apos;s a world of ways away. Till track laws time. No silver ash or switches for that one! While
flattering candles flare. Anna Stacey&apos;s how are you! Worther waist in the noblest, says Adams and Sons, the wouldpay

<br> actionneers. Her hair&apos;s as brown as ever it was. And wivvy and wavy. Repose you now! Finn no more!</p>
<p> For, be that samesake sibsubstitute of a hooky salmon, there&apos;s already a big rody ram lad at random on the premises of his
<br><font color="green">{f39, 29}</font>
<br> haunt of the hungred bordles, as it is told me, Shop Illicit, flourishing like a lordmajor or a buaboabaybohm, litting flop a deadlop (aloose!) to lea but lifting a benbranch a yardalong (ivoeh!) on the breezy side (for showm!), the height of Brewster&apos;s chimpney and as broad below as Phineas Barnum, humphing his share of the showthers is senken on him he&apos;s such a granfallar, with a
pocked wife in pickle that&apos;s a flyfire and three lice nittle clinkers, two twilling bugs and one midgit pucelle. And aither he cursed and recursed and was everseen doing what your fourfootlers saw or he was neverdone seeing what you coolpigeons know, weep the clouds aboon for smiledown witnesses, and that&apos;ll do now about the fairyhees and the frailyshees. Though Eseb fibble it to the
zephiroth and Artsa zoom it round her heavens for ever. Creator, he has created for his creatured ones a creation. White monothoist? Red theatrocrat? And all the pinkprophets cohalething? Very much so! But however &apos;twas &apos;tis sure for one thing, what Sherif Toragh voucherfors and Mapqiq makes put out, that the man, Humme the Cheapner, Esc, overseen as we thought him, yet a worthy of the
naym, came at this timecoloured place where we live in our paroqial fermament one tide on another with a bumrush in a hull of a wherry, the twin turbane dhow <i>The Bey for Dybbling</i>, this archipelago&apos;s first visiting schooner, with a wicklowpattern waxenwench at her prow for a figurehead, the deadsea dugong updipdripping from his depths, and has been repreaching himself like a fishmummer
these sixtyten years ever since, his shebi by his shide, adi and aid, growing hoarish under his turban and changing cane sugar into sethulose starch (Tuttut&apos;s cess to him!), as also that, batin the bulkihood he bloats about when innebbiated, our old offender was humile, commune and ensectuous from his nature, which you may gauge after the bynames was put under him in lashons of languages
(honnein suit and praisers be!), and, totalisating him, even hamissim of himashim, that he, sober serious, he is ee and no counter he who will be ultimendly respunchable for the hubbub caused in Edenborough.</p>  </main>
