<p> How warming &apos;twas to have been in there! But how keling is the airabouts here! Such reasonable weather too. The wind is sowesterly around the downs &amp; on every blasted knolly-rock there&apos;s the same gnarlybird gathering up a runlittle dolittle preelittle porelittle wipelittle kicksalittle waitlittle pinelittle kenlittle aleavenalittle pilfalittle gnarlybird.

funferall. Fumfum fumfum!</p>
