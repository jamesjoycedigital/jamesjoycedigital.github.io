<p> Lowly, longly a wail went forth. Pure Yawn lay low. On the mead of the hillock he lay, brief wallet to his side, an arm loose by his staff of citron briar, tradition stick-pass-on. Most distressfully (but, my dear, how successfully!) to wail he did, his locks of a Lucan tinge, quickrich, ripely rippling, unfilleted, those lashbetasselled lids on the verge of closing time, whiles ouze of his
sidewiseopen mouth the breath of him evenso languishing as the princeliest treble treacle or lichee chewchow purse could buy. Yawn in a semiswoon lay awailing and (hooh!) what helpings of honeyful swoothead! (phew!) which earpiercing dulcitude! As were you suppose to go and push with your bluntblank pin in hand upintohis fleshasplush cushionettes of some chubby boybold love of an angel. Hwoah!</p>
<p> When, as the buzzer brings the light brigade, keeping the home fires burning, so on the churring call themselves came at him, three kings of three suits and a crowner, from all their cardinal parts, along the amber way where Brosna&apos;s furzy. To lift them they did, senators four, by the first quaint skreek of the gloaming, and they hopped it up the mountainy molehill, traversing climes of
old times gone by, of the days not worth remembering,  inventing some excusethems, any sort, having a sevenply
<br><font color="green">{f39, 475}</font>
<br> sweat of nightblues moist upon them &mdash; feefee! phopho!! foorchtha!!! aggala!!!! jeeshee!!!!! paloola!!!!!! ooridiminy!!!!!!! Afeard themselves were to wonder at the class of a crossroads puzzler he would likely be, length by breadth nonplussing his thickness, ells upon ells of him, making so many square yards of him, one half of him in Conn&apos;s half but the whole of him nevertheless
in Owenmore&apos;s five quarters. There would he lay till they would him descry, spancelled down upon a blossomy bed at one foul stretch amongst the daffydowndillies, the flowers of narcosis fourfettering his footlights, a halohedge of wild spuds
<br><font color="green">{f10, 369}</font>
<br> hovering over him, epicures waltzing with gardenfillers, puritan shoots advancing to Aran chiefs. Phopho!! The meteorpulp of him, the seamless rainbowpeel. Aggala!!!! His bellyvoid of nebulose with his neverstop navel. Paloola!!!!!! And his veins shooting melanite phosphor, his creamtocustard cometshair and his asteroid knuckles, ribs and members. Ooridiminy!!!!!!! His electrolatiginous
twisted entrails belt.</p>
<p> Those four claymen clomb together to hold their sworn starchamber quiry on him. Up to the esker ridge it was, Mullingar parish, to a mead that was not far, the son&apos;s rest. First klettered Shanator Gregory, seeking spoor through the deep timefield; then Shanator Lyons, tailing the wavy line of his partition footsteps (something in his blisters was telling him all along how he had been in
that place one time); then His Recordership, Dr Shunadure Tarpey, caperchasing after honourable sleep, hot on to the aniseed; and, up out of his prompt corner, old Shunny Mac, MacDougal the hiker, in the rere of them on the run to make a quorum. Roping their ass he was, their skygrey globetrotter, by way of an afterthought, and such legs on him they were that much oneven it was tumbling he was by
four lengths, the big ass, to hear with his unaided ears the harp in the air, the bugle
<br><font color="green">{f39, 476}</font>
<br> dianablowing, wild as wild, the mockingbird whose word is misfortune, so &apos;tis said, the bulbul down the wind.</p>
<p> The proto was traipsing through the tangle then, Mathew Walker, and his station was a few perch to the weatherside of the knoll Usnach and it was from no other place unless there, how and ever, that he proxtended aloof upon the ether Mesmer&apos;s Manuum, the hand making silence. The buckos beyond on the lea then stopped wheresoever they found their standings and that way they set watch about
him, upholding their broadawake probers&apos; hats on their firrum heads. And a crack quatyouare of stenoggers they made of themselves, solons and <font color="red"><sup><small>|s9</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">psychomooers</span></span>
<font color="black">psychomorers<a target="foot" id="frr0058">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>s9|</small></sup></font>, all told, with their hurts and daimons, spites and clops, not even to the seclusion of their beast by them that was the odd trick of the pack, trump and no friend of carrots. And, what do you think, who above all other persons should be laying there forenenst them
only Yawn! All of asprawl he was laying too amengst the poppies and, I can tell you something more than that, drear writer, he was profoundly asleep. And it was far more similar to a satrap he lay there with unctuous beauty, by satellites all surrounded, or for whatall I know like the Lord Lumen coaching his preferred constellations in faith and doctrine, for old Matt Gregory &apos;tis he had the
starmenagerie: Marcus Lyons and Lucas Metcalfe Tarpey and the mack that never forgave the ass that lurked behind him, Johnny na Hossaleen.</p>
<p> More than their good share of their five senses ensorcelled you would say themselves were, fuming censor, the way they could not rightly tell their heels from their stools, as they cooched down a mamalujo by his cubical crib to play tops or kites or hoops or marblies, curchycurchy, gawking on him for the issuance of his pnum and softnoising one of them to another one, the boguaqueesthers.
<br><font color="green">{f39, 477}</font>
<br> And it is what they began to say to him then, the masters, what way was he.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He&apos;s giving, the wee bairn. Yun has lived.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Yerra, why dat, my leader?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Wisha, is he boosed or what, alannah?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Or his wind&apos;s from the wrong cut, says Ned of the Hill.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Lesten!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Why so and speak up, do you hear me, you, sir?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Or he&apos;s rehearsing somewan&apos;s funeral.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Whisht outathat! Hubba&apos;s up!</p>
<p> And as they were spreading abroad on their octopuds their drifter nets, the chronies, gleamy seiners&apos; nets, and no lie, there was words of assonance being softspoken among those quartermasters.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Get busy, kid!</p>

<p class="di">&mdash; The present hospices is a good time.</p>

would be meshing that way, when he rose to it, the quavers of scaly silver and their clutches of chromes of the highly lucid spanishing gold, whilst, as hour gave way to mazing hour, with Yawn himself keeping time with his thripthongue, to ope his blurbeous lips he would and let out classy the way myrrh of the moor and molten moonmist would be melding mellifond indo his mouth.

You told my larned friend rather previously a moment since about this mound or barrow. Now I suggest to you that ere there was this plagueburrow, as you seem to call it, there was a burial boat. Would you bear me out in that, relatively speaking? The Frenchman, I say, was an orange
boat. He is a boat. You see him. The both how you see is they! Draken af Danemork! What? Spake ab laut!</p>

Now, to come to the midnight middy on this levantine ponenter, I will crusade on with the parent ship far away from those green hills. A station, Ireton tells me, bonafide for keeltappers.

<p class="di">&mdash; Now you are nearer the mark, Lansdowne Road. She&apos;s threwed her pippin&apos;s thereabouts and they&apos;ve cropped up teeth on edge. Now, follow the spotlight, please! Are you acquainted with a pagany better known as Toucher Thom who is? I suggest Finglas as his habitat. Consider yourself on the stand now and watch your words, take my advice. Let your motto be: <i>Inter
nubila numbum</i>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Never you mind about my mother or her hopitout. I consider, if I did, I would feel frightfully ashamed of admired vice. </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; He is a man of around fifty, struck on Anna Lynsha&apos;s Pekoe with milk and whisky, who does messages. Have you ever heard of this old boy Thom who belongs to Kimmage, a crofting district, and is not all there, and is all the more to himself since he is not so, being most of his time down at the Green Man with the coat on him skinside out against rapparitions and
systematically mixing with the public going for groceries, slapping greats and littlegets soundly with his cattegut belts and waltzywembling about in his accoutrements always in font of the tubbernickels, like a longarmed lugh, when he would be finished with his tea? Crazy, isn&apos;t that?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Is it that fellow? As mad as the brambles he is. Touch him. O wait till I tell you!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; We are not going yet.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And look here! Here&apos;s what he done!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Get out! You&apos;re not! Unhindered and odd times? Mere thumbshow? Lately?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; How do I know? Ask the horneys.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Now, just wash and brush up your memoirias a little bit. So I find, referring to the pater of the present man, I am wondering to myself in my mind was Toucher, a methodist, whose name is not really Thom, was this old son of a century from Batterstown, Shivering William, wearing false clothes of a brewer&apos;s grains pattern with back buttons with his motto on, <i>Yule
Remember</i>, ostensibly for that occasion only of the Twelfth Day Pax and Quantum wedding, I&apos;m wondering. </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I bet you are. Well, he was wandering, give him his due, in his mind too, whatever was his matter, for I am sorry to have to tell you, hullo and evoe, they were coming down from off him.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; How culious an epiphany! <i>Hodie casus esobhrakonton</i>?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; It looked very like it.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; And were P and &#43004;, Clopatrick&apos;s cherierapest, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, in pretty much the same pickle?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Prettiest pickling of mute aunties I ever bopeeped at.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Were they now? And were they watching you as watcher as well?
<br><font color="green">{f39, 509}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; They were watching the watched watching. Vechers all.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Good. Now, retouching friend Tomsky, did you gather much from what he let drop? We are sitting here for that.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I was rooshian mad, no lie.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I suspect you must have been.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; But I was dung sorry for him too.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; O Schaum! Not really? Were you sorry you were mad with him then?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; When I tell you I was rooshiamarodnimad with myself altogether, so I was, for being sorry for him.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; So?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Absolutely.

<p class="di">&mdash; The tail as you tell it nearly takes your own breath away. How many were married amid that top of all strapping mornings, my good watcher?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That&apos;d be telling.</p>

<p class="di">&mdash; I horridly did. On the stroke of the dozen. I&apos;m sure I&apos;m wrong but I heard the irreverend Mr Magraw, in search of a stammer, kuckkuck kicking the bedding out of the old sexton, Red Fox-Goodman, around the sacristy while I and flood and the other men was gickling his missus to gaggles in the hall, the divileen, with her cygncygn leckle and her twelve pound lach.</p>

<p class="di">&mdash; Lollgoll! You don&apos;t soye so! All upsydown her whole creation? So there was nothing serical between you? And Drysalter, father of Izod, how was he now?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; In the pink, man, like an allmanox. Squeezing the life out of the liffey. </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; The must of his glanzfull coaxing the beam in her eye?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Aye aye, she was lithe and pleasable.</p>

<br><font color="green">{f39, 514}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You&apos;ve said it! They were simple scandalmongers! Normand, Desmond, Osmund and Kenneth. Making history all over the show!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; You are sure it was not a rebel&apos;s redding or a winker&apos;s wake you were at?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Precisely. </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Flood&apos;s. The pinkman, the squeeze, the pint with the kick. He was culping for penance while you were ringing his belle. Did the kickee, Goodman roed Fox, say anything important? Mmm?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Nnn ttt wrd.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>Fortitudo eius rhodammum tenuit?</i></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Five maim! Or something very similar.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; That sounds an isochronism. But it is good laylaw. We may take those wellmeant kicks for free granted. Happily you were not quite so successful in the process verbal whereby you would sublimate your blepharospasmockical suppressions, it seems?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; What was that?</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Were you or were you not? Ask yourself the answer. I&apos;m not giving you a short question.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Quite so.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Now, not to mix up, cast your eyes around Capel Court. I want you, witness, to reconstruct for us as briefly as you can, inexactly the same as a mind&apos;s eye view, how these funeral games took place.</p>

son of his, a litterydistributer in Saint Patrick&apos;s Lavatory, to turn a Roman and leave the chayr and gout in his bare socks, the sweep, and buy the usual jar of porter at the Morgue and Cruses and set it down before the wife with her fireman&apos;s halmet on her, bidding her mine the hoose, the strumpet, while him and his lagenloves were rampaging the roads in all their paroply under the
noses of the Heliopolitan constabulary? Prepare the way! Where&apos;s that gendarm auxiliar, arianautic sappertillery, that reported on the whole hoodlum, relying on his morse-erse wordybook and the truncheon up his tail? Roof Seckesign van der Deckel! Recall Sickerson, the lizzyboy, and get his story from him! Seckersen, man of Errick! Sackerson! </p>
