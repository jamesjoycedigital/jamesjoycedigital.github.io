O my dawrling! No, I swear to you by Fibsburrow churchdome and Sainte Andr&eacute;e&apos;s Undershift, by all I hold secret from my world and in my underworld of nighties and naughties and in all the other wonderwearlds!

Why do you prefer its in these dark nets, if why may ask, my sweetykins? Shsh! Longears is flying. No, sweetissest, why would that ennoy me? But don&apos;t! You want to be slap well slapped for that. Your
delighted lips, love, be careful! Mind my duvetyne dress above all! It&apos;s golded silvy, the newest sextones with princess effect. For Rutland blue&apos;s got out of passion. So, so, my precious! O, I can see the cost, chara! Don&apos;t tell me! Why, the boy in sheeps&apos; lane knows that. If I sell whose, dears? Was I sold here&apos;s, tears? You mean those conversation lozenges? How awful!
The bold shame of me! I wouldn&apos;t, chickens, not for all the juliettes in the twinkly way! I could snap them when I see them winking at me in bed. I didn&apos;t did so, my intended, or was going to or thinking of. Shshsh! Don&apos;t start like that, you wretch! I thought ye knew all and more, ye aucthors, to explique to ones the significat of their exsystems. It&apos;s only another queer fish
or otther in the damned old river again, God bless us and spare her! Excuse me for swearing, love, I swear I didn&apos;t mean to, by this armlet! Did you really never in all our lives speak clothse to a girl&apos;s before? No! Not even to the charmermaid? How mawfellous! Of course I believe you, my own dear doting liest, when you tell me. As I&apos;d live to, O, I&apos;d love to! Liss, liss! I
muss whiss! Never that ever or I can remember dearstreaming faces, you may go through me! Never in all my whole white light of my matchless and pair! Or ever for bitter be the frucht of this hour!

<p> <span style="font-variant:small-caps">answer:</span> No, blank ye! So you think I have impulsivism? Did they tell you I am one of the fortysixths? And I suppose you heard I had a wag on my ears? And I suppose they told you too that my roll of life is not natural? But before proceeding to conclusively confute this begging question it would be far fitter for you (if ye dare!) to hasitate to
consult with and consequentially attempt at my disposals of the same dime-cash problem elsewhere, naturalistically, of course, from the blinkpoint of so eminent a spatialist. From it you will here notice, Schott, upon my for the first remarking you that the sophology of Bitchson while driven as under by a purely dime-dime urge is not without his cash-cash characktericksticks, borrowed for its
nonce ends from the fiery goodmother Miss Fortune (who the lost time we had the pleasure we have had our little <i>recherch&eacute;</i> brush with, what, Schott?) and as I further could have told you, as brisk as your D.B.C., behaviouristically <i>paillet&eacute;</i> with a coat of homoid icing which is in reality only a done by chance ridiculisation of the whoo-whoo and where&apos;s hairs
theorics of Winestain. To put it all the more plumbsily, the speechform is a mere sorrogate whilst the quality and tality (I shall explex what you ought to mean by this with its proper when and where and why and how in the subsequent sentence) are alternativomentally harrogate and arrogate, as the gates may be.</p>
<p> Talis is a word often abused by many passims (I am working out a quantum theory about it for it is really a most tantumising state of affairs). A pessim may frequent you to say: Have you been
<br><font color="green">{f39, 150}</font>
<br> seeing much of Talis and Talis those times?, optimately meaning: Will you put up a three of irish? Or a ladyeater may perhaps have casualised to you as you temptoed her <i>&agrave; la sourdine</i>: Of your plates, is Talis de Talis, the swordswallower, who is on at the Craterium the same Talis von Talis, the penscrusher (no funk you!), who runs his duly mile? Or this is a perhaps cleaner
example. At a recent postvortex piece infustigation of a determinised case of chronic spinosis an extension lecturer on The Ague who out of matter of form was terging his seesers, Dr &apos;s Het Ubeleeft, borrowed the question: Why&apos;s which Suchman&apos;s <i>talis qualis</i>? To whom, as a fatter of macht, Dr Gedankje of Stoutgirth, who was wiping his whistle, toarsely retoarted: While thou
beast one zoom of a whorl! (Talis and Talis originally mean the same thing, hit it&apos;s: Qualis.)</p>  </main>
