for you (if ye dare!)<a target="foot" id="fff0394">&ordm;</a> to hasitate to consult with and consequentially attempt at my disposals<a target="foot" id="fff0395">&ordm;</a> of the same dime-cash problem elsewhere, naturalistically,<a target="foot" id="fff0396">&ordm;</a> of course, from the blinkpoint of so eminent a spatialist. From it you will here notice, Schott, upon my for the first
remarking you that the sophology of Bitchson while driven as under by a purely dime-dime urge is not without<a target="foot" id="fff0397">&ordm;</a> his cash-cash<a target="foot" id="fff0398">&ordm;</a> characktericksticks, borrowed for its nonce ends from the fiery goodmother Miss Fortune (who <a name="n26010j" href="../../ff/fnbs/n26all.htm#n26010j">the lost time we had</a> the pleasure we have
had our little <i>recherch&eacute;</i> brush with, what, Schott?) and<a target="foot" id="fff0399">&ordm;</a> as I further could have told you,<a target="foot" id="fff0400">&ordm;</a> as brisk as your <a name="n26009i" href="../../ff/fnbs/n26all.htm#n26009i">D.B.C.</a>,<a target="foot" id="fff0401">&ordm;</a> <a name="n05152i" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05152i">behaviouristically</a>
<i>paillet&eacute;</i> with a coat of homoid icing which is in reality only a done by chance ridiculisation of the whoo-whoo and where&apos;s hairs theorics of Winestain. To put it all the more plumbsily, the<a target="foot" id="fff0402">&ordm;</a> speechform is a mere sorrogate whilst<a target="foot" id="fff0403">&ordm;</a> the quality and tality (I shall explex what you ought to mean by this
with its proper <a name="n26016b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n26all.htm#n26016b">when and where and why and how</a> in the subsequent sentence) are alternativomentally harrogate and arrogate, as the gates may be.</p>
<p> Talis is a word often abused by many passims. A pessim may frequent you to say: Have you been
<br><font color="green">{f39, 150}</font>
<br> seeing much of Talis and Talis those times?,<a target="foot" id="fff0405">&ordm;</a> optimately meaning: Will you put up a three<a target="foot" id="fff0406">&ordm;</a> of irish? Or a ladyeater may perhaps have casualised to you<a target="foot" id="fff0407">&ordm;</a> as you temptoed her <i>&agrave; la sourdine</i>: Of your plates, is<a target="foot" id="fff0408">&ordm;</a> Talis de Talis,
the swordswallower, who is on at the Craterium the same Talis von Talis, the penscrusher (no funk you!),<a target="foot" id="fff0409">&ordm;</a> who runs his duly mile? Or this is a perhaps cleaner example. At a recent postvortex piece infustigation of a determinised case of chronic spinosis an extension lecturer on The Ague who out of matter of form was
terging<a target="foot" id="fff0410">&ordm;</a> his seesers, Dr &apos;s Het<a target="foot" id="fff0411">&ordm;</a> Ubeleeft, borrowed the question: Why&apos;s which Suchman&apos;s <i>talis qualis</i>?<a target="foot" id="fff0412">&ordm;</a> To<a target="foot" id="fff0413">&ordm;</a> whom, as a fatter of macht, Dr Gedankje of Stoutgirth, who was wiping his whistle, toarsely retoarted: While thou
beast<a target="foot" id="fff0414">&ordm;</a> one zoom of a whorl! (Talis and Talis originally mean the same thing, hit it&apos;s: Qualis.)<a target="foot" id="fff0415">&ordm;</a></p>  </main>
