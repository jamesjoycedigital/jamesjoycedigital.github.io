<p> <span style="font-variant:small-caps">answer:</span><a target="foot" id="fff0393">&ordm;</a> No, blank ye! So you think I have impulsivism? Did they tell you I am one of the fortysixths? And I suppose you heard I had a wag on my ears? And I suppose they told you too that my roll of life is not natural? But before proceeding to conclusively confute this begging question it would be far fitter
for you (if ye dare!)<a target="foot" id="fff0394">&ordm;</a> to hasitate to consult with and consequentially attempt at my disposals<a target="foot" id="fff0395">&ordm;</a> of the same dime-cash problem elsewhere, naturalistically,<a target="foot" id="fff0396">&ordm;</a> of course, from the blinkpoint of so eminent a spatialist. From it you will here notice, Schott, upon my for the first
remarking you that the sophology of Bitchson while driven as under by a purely dime-dime urge is not without<a target="foot" id="fff0397">&ordm;</a> his cash-cash<a target="foot" id="fff0398">&ordm;</a> characktericksticks, borrowed for its nonce ends from the fiery goodmother Miss Fortune (who <a name="n26010j" href="../../ff/fnbs/n26all.htm#n26010j">the lost time we had</a> the pleasure we have
had our little <i>recherch&eacute;</i> brush with, what, Schott?) and<a target="foot" id="fff0399">&ordm;</a> as I further could have told you,<a target="foot" id="fff0400">&ordm;</a> as brisk as your <a name="n26009i" href="../../ff/fnbs/n26all.htm#n26009i">D.B.C.</a>,<a target="foot" id="fff0401">&ordm;</a> <a name="n05152i" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05152i">behaviouristically</a>
<i>paillet&eacute;</i> with a coat of homoid icing which is in reality only a done by chance ridiculisation of the whoo-whoo and where&apos;s hairs theorics of Winestain. To put it all the more plumbsily, the<a target="foot" id="fff0402">&ordm;</a> speechform is a mere sorrogate whilst<a target="foot" id="fff0403">&ordm;</a> the quality and tality (I shall explex what you ought to mean by this
with its proper <a name="n26016b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n26all.htm#n26016b">when and where and why and how</a> in the subsequent sentence) are alternativomentally harrogate and arrogate, as the gates may be.</p>
<p> Talis is a word often abused by many passims (I am working out a quantum theory about it for it is really a<a target="foot" id="fff0404">&ordm;</a> most tantumising state of affairs). A pessim may frequent you to say: Have you been
<br><font color="green">{f39, 150}</font>
<br> seeing much of Talis and Talis those times?,<a target="foot" id="fff0405">&ordm;</a> optimately meaning: Will you put up a three<a target="foot" id="fff0406">&ordm;</a> of irish? Or a ladyeater may perhaps have casualised to you<a target="foot" id="fff0407">&ordm;</a> as you temptoed her <i>&agrave; la sourdine</i>: Of your plates, is<a target="foot" id="fff0408">&ordm;</a> Talis de Talis,
the swordswallower, who is on at the Craterium the same Talis von Talis, the penscrusher (no funk you!),<a target="foot" id="fff0409">&ordm;</a> who runs his duly mile? Or this is a perhaps cleaner example. At a recent postvortex piece infustigation of a determinised case of chronic spinosis an extension lecturer on The Ague who out of matter of form was
terging<a target="foot" id="fff0410">&ordm;</a> his seesers, Dr &apos;s Het<a target="foot" id="fff0411">&ordm;</a> Ubeleeft, borrowed the question: Why&apos;s which Suchman&apos;s <i>talis qualis</i>?<a target="foot" id="fff0412">&ordm;</a> To<a target="foot" id="fff0413">&ordm;</a> whom, as a fatter of macht, Dr Gedankje of Stoutgirth, who was wiping his whistle, toarsely retoarted: While thou
beast<a target="foot" id="fff0414">&ordm;</a> one zoom of a whorl! (Talis and Talis originally mean the same thing, hit it&apos;s: Qualis.)<a target="foot" id="fff0415">&ordm;</a></p>  </main>
