<p> As my explanations here are probably above your understandings I shall revert to a more expletive method which I frequently use when I have to sermo with muddleclass pupils. Imagine for my purpose that you are a squad of urchins, snifflynosed, goslingnecked, clottyheaded, tangled in your lacings, tingled in your pants etc etc. And you, Smith, take your tongue out of your inkpot! As none of you
know javanese I will give you a free translation of the old fibulist&apos;s parable. <i>Audi</i>, Joe Peters! <i>Audi</i>, Fax!</p>
<p class="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">the</span> <span style="font-variant:small-caps">mookse and the gripes</span></p>
<p> Eins within a space and a weary wide space it wast ere wohned a Mookse. The onesomeness wast alltolonely, archunsitslike, broady oval, and a Mookse he would a walking go (My hood! cries Antony Romeo), so one grandsumer evening, after a great morning and his good supper of gammon and spittish, having flabelled his eyes, pilleoled his nostrils, vacticanated his ears and palliumed his throat, he
put on his impermeable, seized his impugnable, harped on his crown and stepped out of his immobile <i>De Rure Albo</i> (socolld becauld it was chalkfull of masterplasters and had borgeously letout gardens strown with cascadas, pintacostecas, horthoducts and currycombs) and set off from Ludstown <i>a spasso</i> to see how badness was badness in the weirdest of all pensible ways. As he so set off
with his father&apos;s sword, his <i>lancia spezzata</i>, he was girded on, and with that between his legs and his tarheels, our once in only Bragspear, he clanked, to my clinking, from veetoes to threetop every inch of an immortal. He had not walked over a pentiad of parsecs from his azylium when at the turning of the Shinshone Lanteran near
<br><font color="green">{f39, 153}</font>
<br> Saint Bowery&apos;s-without-his-Walls he came
<br><font color="green">{f10, 122}</font>
<br> (secunding to the one one oneth of the propecies, <i>Amnis Limina Permanent</i>) upon the most unconsciously boggylooking stream he ever locked his eyes with. Out of the colliens it took a rise by daubing itself Ninon. It looked little and it smelt of brown and it thought in narrows and it talked showshallow. And as it rinn it dribbled like any lively purl-it-easy: <i>My, my, my! Me and me!
Little down dream, don&apos;t I love thee!</i> And, I declare, what was there on the yonder bank of the stream that would be a river, parched on a limb of the olum, bolt downright, but the Gripes? And no doubt he was fit to be dried for why had he not been having the juice of his times?</p>
<p> His pips had been neatly all drowned on him; his polps were charging odours every older minute; he was quickly for getting the dresser&apos;s desdaign on the flyleaf of his frons; and he was quietly for giving the bailiff&apos;s distrain on to the bulkside of his <i>cul de pompe</i>. In all his specious heavings, as he lived by Optimus Maximus, the Mookse had never seen his Dubville
brooder-on-low so nigh to a pickle.</p>
<p> Adrian (that was the Mookse now&apos;s assumptinome) stuccstill phiz-&agrave;-phiz to the Gripes in an accessit of aurignacian. But Allmookse must to Moodend much as Allrouts, austereways or wastersways, in roaming run through Room. Hic sor a stone, singularly illud, and on hoc stone Seter satt huc sate which it filled quite poposterously and by acclammitation to its fullest justotoryum and
whereopum with his unfallable encyclicling upom his alloilable, diupetriark of the wouest, and the athemystsprinkled pederect he always walked with, <i>Deusdedit</i>, cheek by jowel with his frisherman&apos;s blague, <i>Bellua Triumphans</i>, his everyway addedto wallat&apos;s collectium, for yea longer he lieved yea broader he betaught of it, the fetter, the summe and the haul it cost, he looked
the first and last micahlike laicness of Quartus the Fifth and Quintus the Sixth and Sixtus the Seventh giving allnight sitting to Lio the Faultyfindth.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Good appetite us, Sir Mookse! How do you do it? cheeped the Gripes in a wherry whiggy maudelenian woice and the jackasses
<br><font color="green">{f39, 154}</font>
<br> all within bawl laughed and brayed for his intentions for they knew their sly toad lowry now. I am rarumominum blessed to see you, my dear mouster. Will you not perhopes tell me everything, if you are pleased, sanity? All about aulne and lithial and allsall allinall about awn and liseias. Ney?</p>
<p> Think of it! O miserendissimest retempter! A Gripes!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Rats! bullowed the Mookse most telesphorously, the concionator, and the sissymusses and the zozzymusses in their robenhauses quailed to hear his tardeynois at all, for you cannot wake a silken noise out of a hoarse oar. Blast yourself and your anathomy infairioriboos! No, hang you for an animal rurale! I am superbly in my supremest poncif! Abase you, baldyqueens! Gather
behind me, satraps! Rot!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I am till infinity obliged with you, bowed the Gripes, his whine having gone to his palpruy head. I am still always having a wish on all my extremities. By the watch, what is the time, pace?
<br><font color="green">{f10, 123}</font> </p>
<p> Figure it! The pining peever! To a Mookse!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ask my index! Mund my achilles! Swell my obolum! Woshup my nase serene! answered the Mookse, rapidly byturning clement, urban, eugenious and celestian in the most formose of good grogory humours. Quote awhore? That is quite about what I came on <i>my</i> missions with <i>my</i> paladin&apos;s intentions <i>laudibiliter</i> to settle with <i>you</i>, barbarousse. Let thor be
orlog. Let Pauline be Irene. Let you be Beeton. And let me be Los Angeles. Now measure your length! Now estimate my capacity! Well, sour? Is this space of our couple of hours too dimensional for you, temporiser? Will you give you up? <i>Como? Fuert it!</i></p>
<p> <i>Sancta Patientia!</i> You should have heard the voice that answered him! <i>Culla vosellina.</i></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I was just thinkling upon that, swees Mookse, but, for all the rime on my raisins, if I cannow make my submission, I canoss give you up, the Gripes whimpered from the nethermost of his wanhope. Ishallassoboundbewilsothoutoosezit. My tumble, loudy bullocker, is my own. My velicity is too fit in one stockend. And my spetial inexshellsis the belowing things ab ove. But I will
never be abler to tell Your Honoriousness (here he near lost
<br><font color="green">{f39, 155}</font>
<br> his limb), though my corked father was bott a pseudowaiter, whose o&apos;cloak you ware.</p>
<p> Incredible? Well, hear the inevitable!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>Your</i> temple, <i>sus in cribro</i>! Semperexcommunicambiambisumers. Tugurios-in-Newrobe or Tukurias-in-Ashies. Novarome, my creature, blievend bleives. <i>My</i> building space in lyonine city is always to let to leonlike <i>Men</i>, the Mookse with immediate jurisdiction constantinently concluded. (What a crammer for the shapewrucked Gripes!) And I regret to proclaim
that it is out of my temporal to help you from being killed by inchies (what a thrust!) as we first met each other newwhere so airly. (Poor little sowsieved subsquashed Gripes! I begin to feel contemption for him!) My side, thank decretals, is as safe as motherour&apos;s houses, he continued, and I can seen from my holeydome what it is to be wholly sane. Unionjok and be joined to yok! Parysis,
<i>tu sais</i>, crucycrooks, belongs to him who parises himself. And there I must leave you subject for the pressing. I can prove that against you, weight a momentum, mein goot enemy, or Cospol&apos;s not our star. I bet you this dozen odd. This foluminous dozen odd. <i>Quas primas</i> &mdash; but &apos;tis bitter to compote my knowledge&apos;s fructos of. Tomes.</p>
<p> Elevating, to give peint to his blick, his jewelled pederect to the allmysty cielung, he luckystruck blueild out a few shouldbe santillants, a cloister of starabouts over Maples, a lucciolys in Teresa street and a stopsign before Sophy Barratt&apos;s. He gaddered togodder the odds docence of his vellumes, gresk, letton and russicruxian, onto the lapse of his prolegs, into umfullth
onescuppered, and sat about his widerproof.</p>
<p> He proved it pompifically, in a most consistorous allocution, well whoonearth

Juncroom. And after that, with Cheekee&apos;s gelatine and Alldaybrandy&apos;s formolon, he reproved it ehrltogether,

<p> While that Mooksius with preprocession and with proprecession, duplicitly and diplussedly, was promulgating ipsofacts and sadcontras this raskolly Gripos he had allbust seceded in monophysicking his illsobordunates. But asawfulas he had caught his base semenoyous sarchnaktiers to combuccinate upon the silipses of his aspillouts and the acheporeoozers of his haggyown pneumax to synerethetise
with the breadchestviousness of his sweeatovular ducose sofarfully the loggerthuds of his sakellaries were fond at variance with the synodals of his somepooliom and his babskissed nepogreasymost got the hoof from his philioquus.</p>

<p> And bullfolly answered volleyball.</p>
<p> Nuvoletta in her lightdress, spunn of sisteen shimmers, was looking down on them, leaning over the bannistars and listening all she childishly could. How she was brightened when Shouldrups in his glaubering hochskied his welkinstuck and how she was overclused when Kneesknobs on his zwivvel was makeacting such a paulse of himshelp! She was alone. All her nubied compinions were asleeping with
the squirrels. Their mivver, Mrs Moonan, was off in the Fuerst quarter scrubbing the backsteps of Number 28. And as for fuvver, that Skand, he was up in Norwood&apos;s sokaparlour eating oceans of Voking&apos;s Blemish. Nuvoletta listened as she reflected herself, though the heavenly one with his constellatria and his emanations stood between, and she tried all she tried to make the Mookse look up
at her (but <i>he</i> was fore too adiaptotously farseeing) and to make the Gripes hear how coy she could be (though he was much too schystimatically auricular about <i>his ens</i> to heed her) but it was all mild&apos;s vapour moist. Not even her feignt reflection, Nuvoluccia, could they take their gnoses off, for their minds with intrepifide fate and bungless curiasity were conclaved with
Heliogobbleus and Commodus and Enobarbarus and whatever the coordinal dickens they did as their damprauch of papyrs and buchstubs said. As if that was their spiration! As if theirs could duiparate her queendim! As if she would be third perty to search on search proceedings! She tried all the winsome wonsome ways her four winds had taught her. She tossed her sfumastelliacinous hair like <i>la
princesse de la Petite Bretagne</i> and she rounded her mignons arms like Mrs Cornwallis-West and she smiled over herself like the beauty of the image of the pose of the daughter of the queen of the Emperour of Irelande and she sighed after herself as were she born

<br> to bride with Tristis Tristior Tristissimus. But, sweet madonine, she might fair as well have carried her daisy&apos;s worth to Florida. For the Mookse, a dogmad Accanite, were not amoosed and the Gripes, a dubliboused Catalick, wis pinefully obliviscent. I see, she sighed. There are menner.</p>
<p> The siss of the whisp of the sigh of the softzing at the stir of the ver grose O arundo of a long one in midias reeds: and shades began to glidder along the banks, greepsing, greepsing, duusk unto duusk, and it was as glooming as gloaming could be in the waste of all peacable wolds. Metamnisia was allsoonone coloroform brune; citherior spiane an eaulande, innemorous and unnumerose. The Mookse
had a sound eyes right but he would not all hear. The Gripes had light ears left yet he could but ill see. So he ceased, and he ceased, tung and trit, and it was neversoever so dusky of both of them. But still Moo thought on the deeps of the undths he would profoundth come the morrokse and still Gri feeled of the scripes he would escipe if by grice he had luck enoupes.</p>
<p> O, how it was duusk! From Vallee Maraia to Grasyaplaina, dormimust echo! Ah dew! Ah dew! It was so duusk that the tears of night began to fall, at first by ones

<br> and twos, then by threes and fours, at last by fives and sixes of sevens, for the tired ones were weeping, as we weep now with them. <i>O! O! O! Par la pluie!</i></p>
<p> Then there came down to the thither bank a woman of no appearance (I believe she was a Black with chills at her feet) and she gathered up his hoariness the Mookse motamourfully where he was spread and caried him away to her invisible dwelling, thats hights, <i>Aquila Rapax</i>, for he was the holy sacred solemn and poshup spit of her bushop&apos;s apron. So you see the Mookse he had reason as
I knew and you knew and he knew all along. And there came down to the hither bank a woman to all important (though they say that she was comely, spite the cold in her heed) and, for he was as like it as blow it to a hawker&apos;s hank, she plucked down the Gripes, torn panicky autotone, in angeu from his limb and cariad

<br> shieling, it is, <i>De Rore Coeli</i>. And so the poor Gripes got wrong, for that is always how a Gripes is, always was and always will be. And it was never so thoughtful of either of them. And there were left now an only elmtree and but a stone. Polled with pietrous, sierre but saule. O, yes! And Nuvoletta, a lass.</p>
<p> Then Nuvoletta reflected for the last time in her little long life and she made up all her myriads of drifting minds in one. She cancelled all her engauzements. She climbed over the bannistars. She gave a childy cloudy cry: <i>Nu&eacute;e! Nu&eacute;e!</i> A lightdress fluttered. She was gone. And into the river that had been a stream (for a thousand of tears had gone on her and come on her
and she was stout and struck on dancing and her muddied name was Missisliffi) there fell a tear, a singult tear, the loveliest of all tears (I mean for those who are &ldquo;keen&rdquo; on the pretty-pretty commonface sort of thing you meet by hopeharrods) for it was a leaptear. But the river tripped on her by and by, lapping as though her heart was brook: <i>Why, why, why! Weh, O weh! I&apos;se so
silly to be flowing but I no canna stay!</i></p>
