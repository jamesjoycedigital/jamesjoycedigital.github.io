<p> As my explanations here are probably above your understandings I shall revert to a more expletive method which I frequently use when I have to sermo with muddleclass pupils. Imagine for my purpose that you are a squad of urchins, snifflynosed, goslingnecked, clottyheaded<a target="foot" id="fff0459">&ordm;</a>, tangled in your lacings, tingled in your pants etc etc. And you, Smith, take your
tongue out of your inkpot! As none of you know <a name="n26131b" href="../../FF/fnbs/n26all.htm#n26131b">javanese</a> I will give you a free translation of the old fibulist&apos;s parable. <a name="n18094d" href="../../FF/fnbs/n18all.htm#n18094d"><i>Audi</i></a>, Joe Peters! <i>Audi</i>, Fax!</p>

<p></p>
<p> A Mookse<a target="foot" id="fff0469">&ordm;</a> he would a walking go (My hood! cries Antony Romeo),<a target="foot" id="fff0470">&ordm;</a> so one evening, after his good supper of gammon and spittish, having drubbed his eyes, ascented his nostrils, packed up his ears and comforted his throat<a target="foot" id="fff0471">&ordm;</a>, he put on his impermeable, seized his
impugnable,<a target="foot" id="fff0472">&ordm;</a> harped on his crown and stepped out of his immobile <i>De Rure Albo</i> and set off <i>a spasso</i> to see how badness was badness in the weirdest of all pensible ways. As he so<a target="foot" id="fff0474">&ordm;</a> set off with his father&apos;s sword he was girded on, and with that between his legs and his
tarheels<a target="foot" id="fff0476">&ordm;</a>, our great and only Breakespeare, he<a target="foot" id="fff0477">&ordm;</a> clanked, to my clinking, every inch of an immortal. He had not walked over a pair of <a name="n21026d" href="../../FF/fnbs/n21all.htm#n21026d">parsecs</a> when at the turning of the wrong lane near
<br><font color="green">{f39, 153}</font>
<br> Saint Patrick&apos;s-without-his-Walls he came  upon the most unconsciously boggylooking stream he ever locked his eyes on. It looked little and it smelt of brown and it thought in narrows and it talked showshallow. And as it rinn it dribbled like any lively purl-it-easy<a target="foot" id="fff0480">&ordm;</a>: <i>My, my,</i><a target="foot" id="fff0481">&ordm;</a> <i>my! Me and me! Little
down dream,</i><a target="foot" id="fff0482">&ordm;</a> <i>don&apos;t I love thee!</i> And, I declare, what was there on the yonder bank of the stream that would be a river, parched on a limb of the olum but the Gripes? And no doubt he was fit to be dried for why had he not been having the juice of his times?</p>
<p> His pips had been neatly all drowned on him; his polps were charging odours every older minute; he was quickly for getting the dresser&apos;s desdaign on the flyleaf of his frons; and he was quietly for giving the bailiff&apos;s distrain on to the bulkside of his <i>cul de pompe</i>.<a target="foot" id="fff0483">&ordm;</a> In all his specious heavings, as he lived by Optimus Maximus, the
Mookse had never seen his brooder-on-low so nigh to a pickle.</p>
<p> Adrian (that was the Mookse&apos;s restingname) stuck still phiz-&agrave;-phiz to the Gripes in an outfit of Aurignacian. He sor a stone and on that stone he sate his seat which it filled to its fullest justotoryum and whereupon with his unfallable upon his alloilable and the pederect he always walked with cheek by jowl with his fresherman&apos;s blague, <i>Bellua
Triumphans</i><a target="foot" id="fff0486">&ordm;</a>, he looked the first and last laical lakeness of Quartus the Fifth and Quintus the Sixth and Sixtus the Seventh giving allnight sitting to Leo the <a name="n26175g" href="../../FF/fnbs/n26all.htm#n26175g">Faultyfindth</a>.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Good appetite us, Sir<a target="foot" id="fff0487">&ordm;</a> Mookse! How do you do it? cheeped the Gripes in a wherry whiggy woice and the jackasses
<br><font color="green">{f39, 154}</font>
<br> all within bawl laughed and brayed for his intentions for they knew their <a name="n26084a" href="../../FF/fnbs/n26all.htm#n26084a">sly toad lowry</a> now. I am blessed to see you, my dear mister. Will you not perhopes tell me everything,<a target="foot" id="fff0489">&ordm;</a> if you are pleased, sanity?</p>
<p> Think of it! A Gripes<a target="foot" id="fff0491">&ordm;</a>!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Rats! roared the Mookse and the mice quailed to hear him at all,<a target="foot" id="fff0492">&ordm;</a> for you cannot wake a silken noise out of a hoarse oar. Blast yourself and your infairioriboos! No, hang you! I am superbly in my supremest <a name="n21017b" href="../../FF/fnbs/n21all.htm#n21017b">poncif</a>! Rot!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I am till infinity obliged with you, bowed the Gripes, his whine having gone to his head. I am still always having a wish on all my extremities. By the watch, what is the time, pace? </p>
<p> Figure it! To a Mookse!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ask my index!<a target="foot" id="fff0494">&ordm;</a> answered the Mookse, rapidly byturning<a target="foot" id="fff0499">&ordm;</a> clement, urban and celestian <a name="n08050g" href="../../FF/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08050g">in the</a> <a name="n08050g" href="../../FF/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08050g">highest</a>

That is quite about what I came with <i>my</i> intentions to settle with <i>you</i><a target="foot" id="fff0504">&ordm;</a>. Let there be orlog. Let here be Irene. Let you be Beeton. And let me be Los
Angeles. Now measure your length!<a target="foot" id="fff0505">&ordm;</a> Now estimate my capacity!<a target="foot" id="fff0506">&ordm;</a> Well, sour? Is this space of our couple of hours too dimensional for you, temporiser? Will you give you up?</p>
<p> <i>Sancta</i><a target="foot" id="fff0508">&ordm;</a> <i>Patientia!</i> <a name="n20154b" href="../../FF/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20154b">You should have heard the voice that answered</a> him!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I was just thinking of that, noble Mookse, but I can never give you up, the Gripes whimpered from the<a target="foot" id="fff0511">&ordm;</a> nethermost of his wanhope. My temple is my own. But I will never be abler to tell you (here he near lost
<br><font color="green">{f39, 155}</font>
<br> his limb) whose o&apos;cloak you ware.</p>
<p> Incredible?<a target="foot" id="fff0513">&ordm;</a> Well, hear the inevitable!<a target="foot" id="fff0514">&ordm;</a></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; <i>My</i><a target="foot" id="fff0516">&ordm;</a> building space is always to let to <i>Men</i><a target="foot" id="fff0517">&ordm;</a>, the Mookse concluded. (What<a target="foot" id="fff0519">&ordm;</a> a crammer for the shapewrecked Gripes!)<a target="foot" id="fff0520">&ordm;</a> And I regret to announce that I cannot see my way to help you from being killed by time (what
a thrust!)<a target="foot" id="fff0521">&ordm;</a> as we first met each other never so early. (Poor little squashed Gripes<a target="foot" id="fff0522">&ordm;</a>! I begin to feel contemption for him!)<a target="foot" id="fff0523">&ordm;</a> My side is as safe as houses, he continued, and I can see what it is to be seen. Parysis, <i>tu sais</i>, belongs to him who parises himself. I can prove that
against you, my good enemy! I bet you this dozen of tomes.</p>
<p></p>
<p> He<a target="foot" id="fff0527">&ordm;</a> proved it to the extinction of Niklaus altogether (Niklaus Alopysius having been the Gripes&apos;s hinder nimbum),<a target="foot" id="fff0529">&ordm;</a> by Neuclidius and by Inexagoras, by<a target="foot" id="fff0530">&ordm;</a> Mummsen and by<a target="foot" id="fff0531">&ordm;</a> Thumpson, by Orasmus and by Amenius.
And<a target="foot" id="fff0537">&ordm;</a> after that he reproved it altogether by the binomial dioram and the penic walls and the inklespill<a target="foot" id="fff0542">&ordm;</a> legends and the rule of the hoop and the blessons of expedience and the jugicants of Puncher&apos;s Pylax.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; In a thousand years, Oh Gropes,<a target="foot" id="fff0544">&ordm;</a> you will be blind to the world,<a target="foot" id="fff0545">&ordm;</a> said the Mookse.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; In a thousand years, replied the Gripes, Ah Mookse,<a target="foot" id="fff0546">&ordm;</a> you may be still<a target="foot" id="fff0547">&ordm;</a> more bothered.<a target="foot" id="fff0548">&ordm;</a></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I shall be chosen as the first of the last by the electress of Vale Hallow<a target="foot" id="fff0549">&ordm;</a>, said the Mookse nobly, for I am in the stabulary and that&apos;s what they all like best.<a target="foot" id="fff0552">&ordm;</a></p>
<p></p>
<p class="di">&mdash; I, confessed the Gripes limply,<a target="foot" id="fff0558">&ordm;</a> shall not even be the last of the first, I hope, when we are visited by the veiled horror<a target="foot" id="fff0559">&ordm;</a>. And,<a target="foot" id="fff0560">&ordm;</a> he added,<a target="foot" id="fff0561">&ordm;</a> I am relying entirely upon the weightiness of my
breath.<a target="foot" id="fff0562">&ordm;</a></p>
<p>
<br><font color="green">{f39, 157}</font> </p>
<p> And they villainised each and<a target="foot" id="fff0567">&ordm;</a> other with the wildest ever wielded since Tarriestinus lashed Pissasphallium.</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Unicorn!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Ungulant!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Uvuloid!</p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Uskybeak! </p>
<p> And bullfolly answered <a name="n08191c" href="../../FF/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08191c">volleyball</a>.</p>
<p> Nuvoletta in her lightdress was looking down on them, leaning over the bannistars and listening all she childishly could. She was alone. All her nubied compinions<a target="foot" id="fff0571">&ordm;</a> were asleeping with the squirrels. Their mivver, Mrs Moonan, was off in the Fuerst quarter<a target="foot" id="fff0572">&ordm;</a> scrubbing the
backsteps<a target="foot" id="fff0573">&ordm;</a> of Number 28. And as for fuvver<a target="foot" id="fff0574">&ordm;</a>, that Skand,<a target="foot" id="fff0575">&ordm;</a> he was up in Norwood&apos;s sokaparlor eating<a target="foot" id="fff0576">&ordm;</a> oceans of Voking&apos;s Blemish. Nuvoletta listened as she reflected herself, though the heavenly one with his constellatria and his
emanations<a target="foot" id="fff0577">&ordm;</a> stood between,<a target="foot" id="fff0578">&ordm;</a> and she tried all she tried to make the Mookse look up at her (but <i>he</i> was far too farseeing) and to make the Gripes hear how coy she could be (though he was much too auricular about <i>himself</i> to heed her) but it was all mild&apos;s vapour moist. Not even her dimmed reflection,
Nuvoluccia, could they take<a target="foot" id="fff0579">&ordm;</a> their noses off,<a target="foot" id="fff0580">&ordm;</a> for their minds were beset with Heliogobbleus and Commodus and Enobarbarus and whatever they did as they said. She tried all the winsome wonsome ways her four winds had taught her. She tossed her hair like <i>la princesse de la Petite Bretagne</i> and she rounded her mignons
arms like <a name="n26277l" href="../../FF/fnbs/n26all.htm#n26277l">Mrs Cornwallis-West</a> and she smiled over herself like the beauty of the image of the pose of the daughter of the queen of the Emperour of Irelande and she sighed after herself as were she born
<br><font color="green">{f39, 158}</font>
<br> to bride with Tristis Tristior Tristissimus. But she might just as well have carried her daisy&apos;s worth<a target="foot" id="fff0582">&ordm;</a> to Florida. For the Mookse were not amused and the Gripes was painfully obliviscent. &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; she sighed.<a target="foot" id="fff0584">&ordm;</a> &ldquo;There are menner.&rdquo;</p>
<p> The shades began to glidder along the banks, dusk unto dusk, and it was as glooming<a target="foot" id="fff0585">&ordm;</a> as gloaming could be in the waste of all peacable wolds<a target="foot" id="fff0586">&ordm;</a>. The Mookse<a target="foot" id="fff0589">&ordm;</a> had a sound eyes right but he would<a target="foot" id="fff0590">&ordm;</a> not all hear. The Gripes had light ears left yet
he could but ill see. So he<a target="foot" id="fff0591">&ordm;</a> ceased, and<a target="foot" id="fff0592">&ordm;</a> he ceased,<a target="foot" id="fff0593">&ordm;</a> and<a target="foot" id="fff0594">&ordm;</a> it was ever so dusky<a target="foot" id="fff0595">&ordm;</a> of both of them. But still one thought of the deeps he would profound on the morrow and still the other thought of the
scrapes he would escape if he had luck enough.</p>
<p> O,<a target="foot" id="fff0596">&ordm;</a> how it was dusk! It was so dusk that the tears of night began to fall, at<a target="foot" id="fff0598">&ordm;</a> first <a name="n22024a" href="../../FF/fnbs/n22all.htm#n22024a">by ones  and twos</a>, then by threes and fours, at last by fives and sixes of sevens, for the tired ones were weeping,<a target="foot" id="fff0599">&ordm;</a> as we weep
now<a target="foot" id="fff0600">&ordm;</a> with them. <i>O! O! O!</i><a target="foot" id="fff0601">&ordm;</a> <i>Par la pluie!</i><a target="foot" id="fff0602">&ordm;</a></p>
<p> Then there came down to the hither bank a woman of no appearance (I believe she was a Black with chills<a target="foot" id="fff0603">&ordm;</a> at her feet) and she gathered up the Mookse where he was spread and carried him away to her invisible dwelling for he was the holy sacred solemn<a target="foot" id="fff0605">&ordm;</a> spit of her bushop&apos;s apron. So you see the Mookse he had
reason as I knew and you knew and he knew <a name="n21062h" href="../../FF/fnbs/n21all.htm#n21062h">all along</a>. And there came down to the thither bank a woman to all important (though they say that she was comely, spite<a target="foot" id="fff0606">&ordm;</a> the cold in her heed) and, for he was as like it as blow it to a hawker&apos;s hank, she plucked down the Gripes from his limb and
carried him away with her to her unseen
<br><font color="green">{f39, 159}</font>
<br> shieling. And so the poor Gripes got wrong,<a target="foot" id="fff0607">&ordm;</a> for that is always how a Gripes<a target="foot" id="fff0608">&ordm;</a> is, always was and always will be. And it was never so thoughtful of either of them. And there were left now an only elmtree and but a stone. O, yes!<a target="foot" id="fff0610">&ordm;</a> And Nuvoletta, a lass.</p>
<p> Then Nuvoletta reflected for the last time in her little long life and she made up all her myriads of drifting minds in one. She climbed over the bannistars. She<a target="foot" id="fff0611">&ordm;</a> gave a childy cloudy cry: <i>Nu&eacute;e! Nu&eacute;e!</i><a target="foot" id="fff0612">&ordm;</a> A lightdress fluttered. She was gone. And into the river that had been a stream (for a thousand
of tears had gone on<a target="foot" id="fff0613">&ordm;</a> her and come on her)<a target="foot" id="fff0614">&ordm;</a> there fell a tear, the loveliest of all tears (I mean for those who are &ldquo;keen&rdquo;<a target="foot" id="fff0615">&ordm;</a> on the pretty-pretty sort of thing you meet by Harrod&apos;s) for it was a leap tear. But the river tripped on her by and by, lapping as though her
heart was brook: <i>Why, why, why! Weh,</i><a target="foot" id="fff0616">&ordm;</a> <i>O weh! I&apos;se so silly to be flowing but I no canna stay!</i></p>
