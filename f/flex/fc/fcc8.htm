The
Mookse<a target="foot" id="fff0589">&ordm;</a> had a sound eyes right but he would<a target="foot" id="fff0590">&ordm;</a> not all hear. The Gripes had light ears left yet he could but ill see.

and<a target="foot" id="fff0594">&ordm;</a> it was neversoever so dusky<a target="foot" id="fff0595">&ordm;</a> of both of them. But still Moo thought on the deeps of the undths he would profoundth come the morrokse and still Gri feeled of the <a name="n34083c" href="../../FF/fnbs/n34all.htm#n34083c">scripes he would escipe</a> if by grice he had luck enoupes.</p>
<p> O,<a target="foot" id="fff0596">&ordm;</a> how it was <a name="n34092d" href="../../FF/fnbs/n34all.htm#n34092d">duusk</a>!

It was so duusk that the tears of night began to fall, at<a target="foot" id="fff0598">&ordm;</a> first
<a name="n22024a" href="../../FF/fnbs/n22all.htm#n22024a">by ones  and twos</a>, then by threes and fours, at last by fives and sixes of sevens, for the tired ones were weeping,<a target="foot" id="fff0599">&ordm;</a> as we weep now<a target="foot" id="fff0600">&ordm;</a> with them. <i>O! O! O!</i><a target="foot" id="fff0601">&ordm;</a> <i>Par la

<p> Then there came down to the thither bank a woman of no appearance (I believe she was a Black with chills<a target="foot" id="fff0603">&ordm;</a> at her feet) and she gathered up <a name="n34083a" href="../../FF/fnbs/n34all.htm#n34083a">his hoariness</a> the Mookse motamourfully where he was spread and caried<a target="foot" id="fff0604">&ordm;</a> him away to her invisible dwelling, thats

So you see the Mookse he had reason as I knew and you knew and he knew <a name="n21062h" href="../../FF/fnbs/n21all.htm#n21062h">all along</a>. And there came down to the hither bank a woman
to all important (though they say that she was comely, spite<a target="foot" id="fff0606">&ordm;</a> the cold in her heed) and, for he was as like it as blow it to a hawker&apos;s hank, she plucked down the Gripes, torn panicky autotone, in <a name="n34022g" href="../../FF/fnbs/n34all.htm#n34022g">angeu</a> from his limb and <a name="n34022f" href="../../FF/fnbs/n34all.htm#n34022f">cariad</a> him
away with her to her unseen
<br><font color="green">{f39, 159}</font>
<br> shieling, it is, <a name="n33256d" href="../../FF/fnbs/n33all.htm#n33256d"><i>De Rore Coeli</i></a>. And so the poor Gripes got wrong,<a target="foot" id="fff0607">&ordm;</a> for that is always how a Gripes<a target="foot" id="fff0608">&ordm;</a> is, always was and always will be. And it was never so thoughtful of either of them. And there were left now an only elmtree and but a stone.
<a name="n33328b" href="../../FF/fnbs/n33all.htm#n33328b">Polled with pietrous, sierre</a><a target="foot" id="fff0609">&ordm;</a> <a name="n33328b" href="../../FF/fnbs/n33all.htm#n33328b">but saule.</a> O, yes!<a target="foot" id="fff0610">&ordm;</a> And Nuvoletta, a lass.</p>
<p> Then Nuvoletta reflected for the last time in her little long life and she made up all her myriads of drifting minds in one. <a name="n33309g" href="../../FF/fnbs/n33all.htm#n33309g">She cancelled all her engauzements.</a> She climbed over the bannistars.

<a name="n33207b" href="../../FF/fnbs/n33all.htm#n33207b">Missisliffi</a>)<a target="foot" id="fff0614">&ordm;</a> there fell a tear, a singult tear, the loveliest of all tears (I mean for those who are &ldquo;keen&rdquo;<a target="foot" id="fff0615">&ordm;</a> on the pretty-pretty <a name="n33287a" href="../../FF/fnbs/n33all.htm#n33287a">commonface</a> sort of thing you meet by hopeharrods) for
it was a leaptear. But the river tripped on her by and by, lapping as though her heart was brook: <i>Why, why, why! Weh,</i><a target="foot" id="fff0616">&ordm;</a> <i>O weh! I&apos;se so silly to be flowing but I no canna stay!</i></p>
