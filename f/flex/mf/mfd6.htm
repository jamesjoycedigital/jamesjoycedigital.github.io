<p> Down.</p>
<p> Like Jukoleon, the seagoer, when he bore down in his pyrryboat he had raised a slide and shipped his orders and seized his pullets and primed their plumages, the fionnling and dubhlet, the dun and the fire, and, sending them one by other to fare fore forn, he had beheld the residmance of a delugion: the foggy doze still going strong, the old thalassocrats of invinsible empores, maskers of the
waterworld, facing one way to another way and this way on that way, from severalled their four dimmansions. Where the lighning leaps from the numbulous; where coold by cawld breide lieth langwid; the bounds whereinbourne our solied bodies all attomed attaim arrest: appoint, that&apos;s all. But see what follows. Wringlings upon wronglings among incomputables about an uncomeoutable (an angel
prophetethis? kingcorrier of beheasts? the calif in his halifskin? that eyriewinging one?) and the voids bubbily vode&apos;s dodos across the which the boomomouths from their dupest dupes were in envery and anononously blowing great.

<p> Not to pad them behaunt in the fear. Not to go and bungley well chute the rishing gianerant. Not to woking around at small hours about the murketplots smelling okey boney this little figgy and arraky belloky this little pink into porker but to let the gentleman out of the culpuration live his own left leave by perusual of the petpubblicities without inwoking his also&apos;s between

And not to not be always treeing unselves up with one exite but not to never be caving nicely, precisely, quicely, rebustly, tendrolly, unremarkably, forsakenly, haltedly, reputedly, firstly, somewhatly yesayenolly about the back excits. Never to weaken up in placed of the broths. Never to vvollusslleepp in the pleece of the poots.
And never to ate the sour deans if they weren&apos;t having anysin on their consients. And to never, narks, cease till the finely ending was consummated by the completion of accomplishment. </p>
<p> And thus within the tavern&apos;s secret booth The wisehight ones who sip the tested sooth Bestir them as the Just has bid to jab the punch of quaram on the mug of truth.</p>
