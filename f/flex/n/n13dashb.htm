<p> As slow their ship, the sea being slight, upon the face of waters moved by courtesy of God that handsome brineburnt sixfooter Gaelic, rugger and soccer champion and the dinkum belle of Lucalizod quite charming in her oceanblue brocade and an overdress of net darned with gold well in advance of the newest fashion exhibits bunnyhugged scrumptiously when it was dark whilst they dissimulated
themself on the eighteen inch loveseat behind the chieftaness stewardess&apos;s cabin whilst also with sinister dexterity he alternately rightandlefthandled fore and aft<a target="foot" id="fnz0023">&ordm;</a> on and offside her palpable rugby and association bulbs. She, after a cough, murmurously then gave her firm order for tootsweet if he wouldn&apos;t please mind though not too much of the six
best national poetry quotations reflecting on the situation so long as it was a stroke or two above it&apos;s a fine night and yon moon shining<a target="foot" id="fnz0024">&ordm;</a> bright and all to that, the plain fact of the matter being that being a natural born lover of nature in all her moods and senses,<a target="foot" id="fnz0025">&ordm;</a> by the light of the moon, of the silvery
moon,<a target="foot" id="fnz0026">&ordm;</a> she longed to spoon before her honeyoldmoon at the same time drinking in long draughts of purest air serene and revelling in the great outdoors. That mouth of mandibles vowed to pure beauty promptly elocutionised to her a favourite lyrical bloom bellclear in iambic decasyllabic hexameter:</p>

<p> Lady, it was just too gorgeous for words, the whole sensation. The sea, of a lovely tint embellished by the best charms of nature, with its wellmannered wavelets (the dirty horrid rude ones from the Belfast and Lagan Lough neighbourhood being very properly locked up in cubbyhole) looked really awfully pretty at the mid hour of night and more especially he being emphatically the right man in
the right place, the weather conditions could not possibly have been improved upon. Praises be to fair sea. Her r&ocirc;le was to roll onthedark blueo ceanroll that rolled on round the round roll that Robert Roly rolled round. Breathtaking beauty, Ireland&apos;s bonniest, she did but gaze while from his altitude of<a target="foot" id="fnz0029">&ordm;</a>

<p> So sang seaswans:</p>

<br> Sure he hasn&apos;t got much of a bark
<br> And sure any he has it&apos;s all beside the mark
<br> But O Wreneagle Almighty wouldn&apos;t un be a sky of a lark
<br> To see that old buzzard whooping about for uns shirt in the dark
<br> And he hunting round for uns speckled trousers around by Palmerston Park.
<br> Hohohoho moulty Mark
<br> You&apos;re the rummest old rooster ever flopped out of a Noah&apos;s ark
<br> And you think you&apos;re cock of the wark.
<br> Fowls up Tristy&apos;s the spry young spark
<br> That&apos;ll tread her and wed her and bed her and red her
<br> Without ever<a target="foot" id="fnz0034">&ordm;</a> winking the tail of a feather
