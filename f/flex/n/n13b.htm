<p> As slow their ship, the sea being slight, upon the face of waters moved by courtesy of God that handsome brineburnt sixfooter Gaelic, rugger and soccer champion and the dinkum belle of Lucalizod quite charming in her oceanblue brocade and an overdress of net darned with gold well in advance of the newest fashion exhibits bunnyhugged scrumptiously when it was dark whilst they dissimulated
themself on the eighteen inch loveseat behind the chieftaness stewardess&apos;s cabin whilst also with sinister dexterity he alternately rightandlefthandled fore and aft<a target="foot" id="fnz0036">&ordm;</a> on and offside her palpable rugby and association bulbs. She, after a cough, murmurously then gave her firm order for tootsweet if he wouldn&apos;t please mind though not too much of the six
best national poetry quotations reflecting on the situation so long as it was a stroke or two above it&apos;s a fine night and yon moon shining<a target="foot" id="fnz0037">&ordm;</a> bright and all to that, the plain fact of the matter being that being a natural born lover of nature in all her moods and senses,<a target="foot" id="fnz0038">&ordm;</a> by the light of the moon, of the silvery moon
she longed to spoon before her honeyoldmoon at the same time drinking in long draughts of purest air serene and revelling in the great outdoors. That mouth of mandibles vowed to pure beauty promptly elocutionised to her a favourite lyrical bloom bellclear in iambic decasyllabic hexameter:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Rollon thoudeep anddark blueo ceanroll!<a target="foot" id="fnz0039">&ordm;</a></p>
<p> Lady, it was just too gorgeous for words, the whole sensation. The sea, of a lovely tint embellished by the
<br><font color="green">{ms, 102}</font>
<br> best charms of nature, with its wellmannered wavelets (the dirty horrid rude ones from the Belfast and Lagan Lough neighbourhood being very properly locked up in cubbyhole) looked really awfully pretty at the mid hour of night and more especially he being emphatically the right man in the right place, the weather conditions could not possibly have been improved upon. Praises be to fair sea.
Her r&ocirc;le was to roll onthedark blueo ceanroll that rolled on round the round roll that Robert Roly rolled round. Breathtaking beauty, Ireland&apos;s bonniest, she did but gaze while from his altitude of one yard onehundredandthirtytwo lines his deepseapeepers gazed O gazed O dazedcrazedgazed into her darkblue rolling ocean orbs.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Thanks ever so much, she sighed, thrilled by that olive throb of his nude neck, and ever so much again for that tiny quote. It sort of made everything ever so much more delightful. How perfectly sweet of you!</p>
<p> Nothing if not amorous, he, rosecrumpler, thrilldriver, sighinspirer, having prealably dephlegmatised his guttur of that ticklish frog in the throat, his useful arm getting busy on the touchline due south of her western shoulder, uttered what was to follow with grand passion from his toploftical voicebox:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Isolde!</p>
<p> By elevation of eyelids t&apos;ward her dear coolun that she<a target="foot" id="fnz0040">&ordm;</a> invoked insinuated desideration of more declaration.</p>
<p> He was instant and he declared:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Isolde! O Isolde! Sister soul and hand! When
<br><font color="green">{ms, 103}</font>
<br> theeuponthus sir Tristan binoculises his most unwitting ego most subconsciously senses the deprofundity of multimathematical immaterialities whereby in the pancosmic urge the allimmanence of that which Itself is Itself Alone exteriorates on this here our plane in disunited solid, liquid and gaseous bodies in pearlwhite passionpanting intuitions of reunited selfhood as the higherdimensional
selfless Allself.</p>
<p> Hear, O hear, all ye caller herring! Silent be, O Moyle! Milky Way, strew dim light!</p>
<p> Right here a pretty thing happened. When her flattering hand of pure diversion mayhap had jessaminely at the just right moment shut his duckhouse the vivid girl,<a target="foot" id="fnz0041">&ordm;</a> deaf with love, (You know her, that angel being, one of passion&apos;s fadeless wonderwomen! You dote on her! You love her to death!) with a queer little cry reunited milkymouthily his her their
disunited lips when tonguetasting the golden opportunity of a lifetime quick as greased pigskin the Armorican champion with one virile tonguethrust drove the advance messenger of love flash past the double line of eburnean forwards rightjingbangshot into the goal of her gullet.</p>
<p> Now, I am just putting it direct to you as one manowoman to another, what the blankety blank diggings do you for example candidly suppose that she, a strapping young modern old ancient Irish princess, a good eighteen hands high and scaling nine stone twelve paddock weight in her madapolam smock with nothing under her hat but red hair and solid ivory not
<br><font color="green">{ms, 104}</font>
<br> forgetting a firstrate pair of bedroom eyes of most unholy hazel cared at that precise psychoanalytical moment about tiresome old King Mark that tiresome old milkless ram with his duty peck and his bronchial tubes, the tiresome old ourangoutan beaver,<a target="foot" id="fnz0042">&ordm;</a> in his tiresome old twentytwoandsixpenny shepherd&apos;s plaid trousers? Not as much as a pinch of
henshit and that&apos;s the meanest thing now was ever known since Adam was in the boy&apos;s navy. No, heaven knows, far from it, if the unvarnished truth must be told at the very first blush lovingly she lovegulped her American&apos;s pulpous propeller and both together in the most fashionable weather they all went off a lulliloving a dither me<a target="foot" id="fnz0043">&ordm;</a> dandy O
after which, believing in safety first, before the regulation ten seconds were up volatile Brittany considerately allowed his farfamed sparkling<a target="foot" id="fnz0044">&ordm;</a> plug chokegrip to relax and precautiously withdrew the instrument of rational speech from the procathedral of amorous seductiveness.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I&apos;m right glad I ran on to you, Tris, you fascinator you! Miss Erin said<a target="foot" id="fnz0045">&ordm;</a> when she had won free, laughing at the same time delightfully in dumpling<a target="foot" id="fnz0046">&ordm;</a> bliss, being awfully bucked by her gratifying experience of the love embrace from a highly continental bigtimer the like of him possessed of a
handsome face well worth watching with an interesting tallow complexion from which great things very<a target="foot" id="fnz0047">&ordm;</a> expected as a film star for she fully realised that he was evidently a notoriety in the poetry department as well for he never saw her to drink an orange but he
<br><font color="green">{ms, 105}</font>
<br> offered to bring her a porringer and to cut a long story short taking him by and large the onliest boy of her choice meant pretty well everything to her just then, her beau ideal of a true girl&apos;s friend with red blood in his veins neither big ugly nor small nice.</p>
<p> Over them the winged ones screamed shrill glee: seahawk, seagull, curlew and plover, kestrel and capercailzie. All the birds of the sea they trolled out rightbold when they smacked the big kuss of Trustan with Usolde.</p>
<p> So sang seaswans:</p>
<p class="poemSp">&mdash; Three quarks for Muster Mark
<br> Sure he hasn&apos;t got much of a bark
<br> And sure any he has it&apos;s all beside the mark
<br> But O Wreneagle Almighty wouldn&apos;t un be a sky of a lark
<br> To see that old buzzard whooping about for uns shirt in the dark
<br> And he hunting round for uns speckled trousers around by Palmerston Park.
<br> Hohohoho moulty Mark
<br> You&apos;re the rummest old rooster ever flopped out of a Noah&apos;s ark
<br> And you think you&apos;re cock of the wark.
<br> Fowls up Tristy&apos;s the spry young spark
<br> That&apos;ll tread her and wed her and bed her and red her
<br> Without ever<a target="foot" id="fnz0048">&ordm;</a> winking the tail of a feather
<br> And that&apos;s how that chap&apos;s going to make his money and mark.</p> </p>  </main>
