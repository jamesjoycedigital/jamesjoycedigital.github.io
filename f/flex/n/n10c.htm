She murmurously asked for some but not too much of the best
poetry quotations reflecting on the situation, smtg a stroke above its a fine night and the moon shines bright and all to that the plain fact of the matter was that by the light of the moon of the silvery moon she loved to spoon before her honeyoldmoon at the same time drinking deep draughts of purest air serene.
