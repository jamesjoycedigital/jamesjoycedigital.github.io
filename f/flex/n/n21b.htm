<p class="flush">And there they were too listening in as hard as they could to the solans and sycamores and mistle thrushes and all the birds of the sea, all four of them, listening. They were the big four, the four master waves of Erin, all listening<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span>, four. There was old Matt Gregory and then besides old Matt there was old Marcus Lyons,
the four waves, and oftentimes they used to be saying grace together right enough: here now we are the four of us: old Matt Gregory and old Marcus and old Luke Tarpey: the four of us and sure thank God there are no more of us: and sure now you wouldn&apos;t go and leave out old Johnny MacDougall: the four of us and no more of us and so now pass the fish for Christ sake, Amen: the way they used to
be saying their grace before fish for auld lang syne. And so there they were spraining their ears listening and listening to the oceans of kissening with their eyes glistening all the four when he was kiddling and cuddling his colleen bawn and cuddling her and kissing her with his poghue like Arrah-na-poghue the dear dear annual they all four remembored how they used to be
<a name="sa0981cj" href="../../FF/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0981cj">cuddling and kiddling</a> her under her mistlethrush and kissing and listening in the good old bygone days of Dion Boucicault in Arrah-na-poghue where they knew the man on the door when they were all four collegians in the queen&apos;s colleges. Ah ho! It brought
<br><font color="green">{ms, 14}</font>
<br> the dear scenes all back again as fresh as of yore Matt and Marcus and now there he was and his Arrah-na-poghue before the four of them and now thank God there were no more of them and he poguing and poguing and there they were listening with their mouths watering so pass the pogue for Christ&apos; sake, Amen. Listening and watering all the four Luke and Johnny MacDougall and all wishening
for anything at all of the bygone times for a cup of kindness yet for four farback tumblerfuls of woman squash with them all four listening and spraining their ears and all their mouths making water.</p>
<p> Ah well sure that&apos;s the way up and there was poor Matt Gregory up and up the others and now really and truly they were four dear old heladies and really they looked so nice and respectable with their grey half a tall hat and tailormade frock coat and then they had their fathomglasses to find out all the fathoms and their half a tall hat just now like the marquess of powerscourt only
for<a target="foot" id="fnz0013">&ordm;</a> the saltwater or the auctioneer there in front of the place near that street where the statue of Mrs Dannie O&apos;Connell behind the Trinity college that arranges all the auctions of the valuable colleges, Smith like the auctioneer
<br><font color="green">{ms, 7}</font>
<br> Smith that sells all the fine statues and powerscourts James H North <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">J.P.</span></span> the jaypee in Hoggin Green going to the <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">horsehow</span></span> horseshow with all the horses over from England and American visitors all over in his grey half a tall hat and how do you do and his fathomglasses to
find out all the colleges and how do you do, Mr James, and all the horsepowers. And now that reminds me of poor Marcus Lyons and poor Johnny and the four of us and there they were now listening right enough the four saltwater widowers and all they could remembore long long ago and Lally when my heart knew no care, the landing of sir James Casement in 1132 and the coronation of King Brian by his
grace the bishop in his shovel hat, sir J.P. Bishop senior and then there was the drowning of Pharoah and they were all drowned in the sea, the red sea, and then poor Martin Cunningham out of the castle when he was drowned off Dunleary in the red sea and thank God there were no more of him. Ay, ay. So he was.</p>
<p> And then there was the Flemish armada all scattered and all drowned off the coast of Cunningham and saint Patrick and Kevin &amp;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 8}</font>
<br> our first marents and Lapoleon and all they remembored and then there was the French fleet in 1132 landing under general Boche in his half a grey<a target="foot" id="fnz0014">&ordm;</a> hat and there he was cuddling and poguing her under the sycamores in Arrah-na-pogue near the queen&apos;s colleges in Alice&apos;s street behind the century man on the door. And then they used to give the
grandest lectures by pictures postcard in Roman history to the collegians green and all the old senate in the four trinity colleges of <a name="sa0641cr" href="../../FF/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0641cr">Ulcer, Moonster, Leanstare and Cannought</a>, the four colleges of Killorcure and Killthemall and Killeachother and Kilkelly-on-the-Flure. Those were the four grandest history colleges in the Jane
Andersdaughter university for auld acquaintance sake for all the Roman history of the spirit of nature as divinely developed in time<a target="foot" id="fnz0015">&ordm;</a> the past and present and present and absent and past and present and future <u>arma virumq romano</u>. Ah dearo dearo how it all came back to them to hear him there kissing her and cuddling her in the Roman arms by Cornelius

<p> Queh? Ah dearo dearo dear it was so sorry for the four of us and Lally and Lapole and Tim Tom Tarpey and the four widowers. And that reminds me of the four waves in their
<br><font color="green">{ms, 9}</font>
<br> half a Roman hat in Chichester college auction and thank God they were all summarily divorced by their dear poor shehusbands in dear bygone days and never brought to mind but still they parted on the best of terms and be forgot. And so they parted. Ay, ay. <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">S</span></span> Ah well, sure that&apos;s the way. Ay, ay. By decree absolute.</p>
<p> And well they could remembore
<br><font color="green">{ms, 10}</font>
<br> Mrs Justice Squelchman in her fullbottom wig and beard in 1132 at the Married Male Auctioneers&apos; court in Arrahnapogue. Poor Johnny MacDougal and the four masters because he was so slow at backscratching all divorced by their dear faithful and poor Marcus Powerscourt all persecuted by everybody<a target="foot" id="fnz0016">&ordm;</a> by decree absolute all because he made wind and water
and because he forgot to remembore to sign an old paper a request in writing to herself on stamped parchment before saying his grace before fish and then there was poor Dion Boucicault all drowned too<a target="foot" id="fnz0017">&ordm;</a> before the world and her husband because he attempted to &mdash; well, he was a bit bad in his health, he said, with the shingles falling off him &mdash;
because he &mdash; ah, well now,<a target="foot" id="fnz0018">&ordm;</a> we won&apos;t be too hard on him as an old presbyterian and then he went to confession to Mother Evangelist Sweeney and now tell the truth there were faults on both sides &mdash; well he attempted &mdash; <a name="sa0901bt" href="../../FF/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0901bt">ah, sure, he was only funning</a> &mdash; attempted some
hunnish familiarities after eating a bad crab in the red sea and sure he was deadseasickabed, the poor old fellow, in the hospice for the dying and trying to hold the nurse&apos;s hand. Ah dearo dearo dear! And where do you leave Matt? They were all so sorry for poor Matt in his saltwater hat too big for him and his overalls all falling over him in folds &mdash; sure he hadn&apos;t the energy to
pull them up &mdash; poor Matt sitting there with his face to the wall in sight of the poorhouse with his can of tea and two bits of brown loaf and dilisk waiting for the end to come &mdash; God of heaven, when you think of it! Ah ho! All divorced by act of parliament by woman squelch and all on account of the smell of brown loaf and his mouth watering and so now pass the loaf for Christ&apos;
sake. Amen. And so. And all.</p>
<p> Matt. And loaf. Ah, God be good to us. Poor Martin Cunningham. Ay, ay.</p>
<p> And still and all they were always up thinking of the auld man syne<a target="foot" id="fnz0019">&ordm;</a> up their four masters that were four up beautiful sisters and there they were always counting the lovely periwinkle buttons in the lapper part of their dresses
<br><font color="green">{ms, 10v}</font>
<br> up one up two up one up four and there she was, the deary, the beautiful four sisters and that was her name right enough and they used to be getting up at the kookaburra bell at all hours every night on their mistletoes, the four old oldsters, when nobody wouldn&apos;t even let them sleep, changing their wet beds and falling over all the opticals, looking everywhere for the jool the rancers
the rathure&apos;s evelopmen in spirits of time in all the fathoms of space and then they had their night tentacles and there they used to be<a target="foot" id="fnz0020">&ordm;</a> hanging around<a target="foot" id="fnz0021">&ordm;</a> the waists of the ships, the clipperbuilts and Lally and Roe and Johnny MacGory, dear Mister John, and all the other annalists, the steamships and the
women-o&apos;-war and playing ladies&apos; foursome and their bottlegreen eyes and peering in through the steamy windows into the honeymoon cabins on board the big steamadories and the saloon ladies&apos; toilet chambers lined with prawn silk and rubbing off the salty cataract off the windows listening to see all the hunnishmooners and the toilet ladies in all their familiarities saying their
grace before steamadory so pass the pogue for grace sake Amen. And all trembling and shaking. Ay, ay.</p>
<p> And they used to be counting all their peributtons up one up four to remembore her beautiful maiden name in the dream. And Greg and Doug and poor Greg the four sisters. And there she was now right enough, that lovely sight, the maiden lady bawn asthore, as in days of yore of planxty Gregory.</p>
<p> Ay, ay. And sure that reminds me now <a name="sa0803ar" href="../../FF/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0803ar">like another story</a> how they used to be up always at their singing round up the wet fire register with their cold knees and their poor up feet asleep and all dolled up in their blankets and maternity mufflers and plimsoles and their bowl of brown bread and milky and clots and holding hands and
waiting and pinching poor Mucus Lyons to pass the teeth for choke shake Armensch when they were all sickamore with the phlegmish whooping cough and all a possabed after eating a bad cramp and Johnny MacGories and backscratching and their farthing dip and reading a letter or two, a capital letter out of their old book of old year&apos;s eve 1132, their Senchus Mor, final buff lunch edition and
Lally through their gangrene spentacles and Roe and O&apos;Driscoll and Riscoll and all and Lap and Morion and Buffler and Daddy De Wyer, old bag of broth and singing. And so now they started singing their steamadorion and old Luke and Senchus Mor for auld luke syne and she haihaihail her kobber coiner sehehet on the praze savohohole Shanghai.</p> </p>  </main>
