<p class="flush">The handsome 6footer rugger and soccer champion and the dinkum belle of Lucalizod quite charming in her oceanblue brocade with iris petal sleeves and an overdress of net darned with gold well in advance of the fashion bunnyhugged scrumptiously in the dark whilst they dissimulated themself behind the chieftaness stewardess&apos;s cabin whilst with sinister dexterity he alternately
rightandlefthandled fore and aft on and offside her palpable rugby and association bulbs. She murmurously asked for some though not too much of the best poetry quotations reflecting on the situation, so long as it was a stroke or two above its a fine night and the moon shines bright and all to that, the plain fact of the matter being that by the light of the moon, of the silvery moon, she longed
to spoon before her honeyoldmoon at the same time drinking deep draughts of purest sea air serene. He promptly then elocutionised to her a favourite lyrical bloom in iambic decasyllabic hexameter:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Roll on<a target="foot" id="fnz0001">&ordm;</a> thou deep and darkblue ocean, roll!</p>
<p> It was just too gorgeous for words the whole sensation. The sea with wellmannered waves, looked awfully pretty at the twilight hour and more especially he being exactly the right man in the right place, the weather conditions could not possibly have been improved on. Her r&ocirc;le was to roll on the darkblue ocean roll that rolled on round the round roll Robert Roly rolled round. She did but
gaze while from his altitude of one yard eleven inches his deepseapeepers gazed O gazed O dazedcrazedgazed into her darkblue rolling ocean orbs.</p>
<p> Nothing if not amorous he then having dephlegmatised his guttur of that tickly frog in the throat and, getting busy on the touchline, uttered what follows from his toploftical voicebox:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Isolde!</p>
<p> By elevation of eyelids that She addressed insinuated desideration of his declaration.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Isolde, O Isolde! When theeuponthus I oculise my most inmost Ego most subconsciously senses the deprofundity of multimathematical immaterialities whereby in the pancosmic urge the allimmanence of That Which is Itself exteriorates on this here our plane in disunited solid, liquid and gaseous bodies
<br><font color="green">{ms, 95v}</font>
<br> in pearlwhite passionpanting intuitions of reunited Selfhood in the higherdimensional selflessness.</p>
<p> Hear, O hear, all ye caller herring! Silent be, O Moyle! Milky Way, strew dim light!</p>
<p> When he had shut his duckhouse the vivid girl reunited milkymouthily his her and their disunited lips and, quick as greased lightning the <a name="sa0301ac" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0301ac">Armorican</a> champion drove the advance messenger of love with one virile tonguethrust past the double line of ivoryclad forwards fullback right jingbangshot<a target="foot" id="fnz0002">&ordm;</a>
into the goal of her gullet.</p>
<p> Now what do you candidly suppose she, a strapping young old Irish princess, 18 hands high and scaling nine stone twelve in her madapolam smock with nothing under her hat but red hair and solid ivory and a firstrate pair of bedroom eyes cared at that precise physiological moment about tiresome old King Mark with his duty peck and his bronchial trouble, the tiresome old ourangoutan beaver in his
tiresome old twentytwoandsixpenny and sixpenny shepherd&apos;s plaid trousers? Not as much as a pinch of henshit and that&apos;s the meanest thing that was ever known in this wide world. No, far from it, if the unvarnished truth must be told lovingly she lovegulped his pulpous propeller while both together in the most fashionable weather they all went off a
<a name="sa0981fo" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0981fo">lulliloving</a> <font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font> after which before the traditional 10 seconds were up Brittany considerately allowed his farfamed chokegrip to relax and <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">considerately</span></span> precautiously withdrew the instrument of rational
speech from the procathedral of amorous seductiveness.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I&apos;m real glad to have run on to you, Trist, you fascinator, you! she said, awfully bucked by her gratifying experience of the love embrace from a bigtimer like him with an interesting tallow complexion from whom great things were expected as he was evidently a notoriety in the poetry department as well for he never saw an orange but he thought of a porringer and to cut
a long story short taking him by and large he meant everything to her just then, beau ideal of a true girl&apos;s friend neither big ugly nor small nice.</p> </p>  </main>
