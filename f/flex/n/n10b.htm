<p class="flush">The handsome sixfoottwo rugger and soccer champion and the belle of Chapelizod in her oceanblue brocade bunnyhugged scrumptiously in the dark behind the chief steward&apos;s cabin while with sinister dexterity he alternately rightandlefthandled fore and aft <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the</span></span> her palpable rugby and association bulbs. She murmurously
asked for some but not too much of the best poetry reflecting on the situation her reason being that by the light of the moon of the silvery moon she loved to spoon before her honeymoomoon. He promptly then elocutioned to her in decasyllabic iambic hexameter:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Roll on, thou deep and darkblue ocean, roll!</p>
<p> It was a gorgeous sensation he being exactly the right man in the right place and the weather conditions could not possibly have been improved. Her role was to roll on the darkblue ocean roll that rolled on round the round roll Robert Roly rolled round. She gazed while his deep sea peepers gazed O gazed O dazedcrazedgazed into her darkblue rolling ocean eyes.</p>
<p> He then having dephlegmatised his throat <a name="n03046b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03046b">uttered as follows</a> from his voicebox:</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Isolde!</p>
<p> By elevation of eyelids that She addressed insinuated desideration of his declaration.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Isolde, O Isolde, when theeupon I <a name="n03078f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03078f">oculise</a> my most inmost Ego most vaguely senses the profundity of multimathematical immaterialities whereby in the pancosmic urge the Allimmanence of That Which Is Itself exteriorates on this here our plane of disunited solid liquid and gaseous bodies in pearlwhite passionpanting
intuitions of reunited Selfhood in the higherdimensional Selflessness.</p>
<p> Hear, O hear, all ye caller herrings! Silent be, O Moyle! Milky Way, strew dim light!</p>
<p> She reunited milkymouthily his her and their disunited lips and quick as greased lightning the Breton champion drove the advance messenger of love with one virile tonguethrust past the double line of ivoryclad forwards fullback rightjingbangshot into the goal of her gullet.</p>
<p> Now what do you candidly suppose she, a strapping young Irish princess scaling nine stone twelve in her pelt cared at that precise physiological moment about tiresome old King Mark, <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the</span></span> that tiresome old pantaloon in his tiresome old twentytwoandsixpenny shepherd&apos;s plaid trousers? Not as much as a pinch of henshit and that&apos;s
the meanest thing that was ever known. No, on the contrary, if the truth must be told lovingly she lovegulped his pulpous propeller and both together in the
<br><font color="green">{ms, 94v}</font>
<br> most fashionable weather they both went all of a shiveryshaky quiveryquaky mixumgatherum yumyumyum. After which before the traditional ten seconds were up Tristan considerately allowed his farfamed chokegrip to relax and precautiously withdrew the instrument of rational speech from the procathedral of amorous seductiveness.</p>
