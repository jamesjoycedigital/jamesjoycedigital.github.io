<p class="flush">And there they were too listening in as hard as they could to the solans and sycamores and the migratories and mistle thrushes and all the birds of the sea, all four of them, listening. They were the big four, the four master waves of Erin, all listening, four. There was old Matt Gregory and then besides old Matt there was old Marcus Lyons, the four waves, and oftentimes they used
to be saying grace together right enough: here now we are the four of us: old Matt Gregory and old Marcus and old Luke Tarpey: the four of us and sure thank God there are no more of us: and sure now you wouldn&apos;t go and leave out <a name="n05145a" href="../../FF/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05145a">the other fellow and</a> old Johnny MacDougall: the four of us and no more of us and so now pass the fish
for Christ sake, Amen: the way they used to be saying their grace before fish for auld lang syne. And so there they were spraining their ears listening and listening to the oceans of kissening with their eyes glistening all the four when he was kiddling and cuddling his colleen bawn that was very wrong most improper and cuddling her and kissing her with his poghue like Arrah-na-poghue the dear
dear annual they all four remembored who made the world and how they used to be <a name="n05144b" href="../../FF/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05144b">at that time</a> <a name="sa0981cj" href="../../FF/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0981cj">cuddling and kiddling</a> her from under her mistlethrush and kissing and listening in the good old bygone days of Dion Boucicault

colleges <a name="n05145a" href="../../FF/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05145a">with another fellow</a>. Ah ho! It brought

<br> the dear scenes all back again as fresh as of yore Matt and Marcus and <a name="n05144c" href="../../FF/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05144c">after that</a> now there he was and his Arrah-na-poghue before the four of them so <a name="n05160l" href="../../FF/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05160l">shocking</a> and <a name="n05160o" href="../../FF/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05160o">scandalous</a> and now thank God there were no
more of them and he poghuing and poghuing and there they were listening <a name="n05163k" href="../../FF/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05163k">as tired as they were</a>, the three jolly topers, with their mouths watering along <a name="n05145a" href="../../FF/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05145a">with the other fellow</a> so pass the poghue for Christ&apos; sake, Amen. Listening and poghuing and watering all the four, the
old men of the sea, Luke and Johnny MacDougall and all wishening for anything at all of the bygone times for a cup of kindness yet for four farback tumblerfuls of woman squash with them all four listening and spraining their ears and all their mouths making water.</p>
<p> Johnny. Ah well sure that&apos;s the way up and <a name="n05144d" href="../../FF/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05144d">it so happened</a> there was poor Matt Gregory up and up the others and now really and truly they were four dear old heladies and really they looked so nice and respectable with their grey half a tall hat and tailormade frock coat and
<a name="n05144c" href="../../FF/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05144c">after that</a> they had their fathomglasses to find out all the fathoms and their half a tall hat just now like the marquess of Powerscourt only for<a target="foot" id="fnz0013">&ordm;</a> the saltwater or the auctioneer there in front of the place near Clery&apos;s that <a name="n05148d" href="../../FF/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05148d">ancient</a>
