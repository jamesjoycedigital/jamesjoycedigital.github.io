<p class="flush">Hark!</p>
<p class="flush">Tolv two eleven kater ten sax.</p>
<p class="flush">Hork!</p>
<p class="flush">Pedwar pemp. Foify tray. Twelve!</p>
<p> Methought &apos;twas the peal of midnight&apos;s chimes from out the belfry of the cute old speckled church sounding so faint a 12 as nighthood rendered all British objects nonviewable to human watchers save perchance anon some glistery gleam darkling adown surface of <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the</span></span> a fluvial flowandflow as again might be garments of laundry
reposing a greensward close by in full expectation. And methought broadmouth was heard and all vociferated, echoating: Shaun! Shaun! Post the post! And lo, methought somewhat came of the noise &amp; somewho seemed amove among allmurk, now &apos;twas as clump, now mayhap. When lo was light and now &apos;twas as flasher now more as the glow. Ah! &apos;Twas, in verity &apos;twas his belted lamp. Yes,
he who swayed a will of a wisp before me, dressed like an earl, with a classy coat of superior ruggedness from one shoulder, was none other from (the blessings of God &amp; Mary &amp;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 20}</font>
<br> Patrick be all over him!) other than (<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">his</span></span> may his 100,000 welcome letters multiply &amp; plultiply!) Shaun himself.</p>
<p> Had I the concordant wiseheads of Messrs Gregory &amp; Lyons along with Dr Tarpey&apos;s &amp; the Rev. Mr MacDougall&apos;s but I, poor ass, am but as their fourpart ass. Yet methought Shaun (holy messenger angels be uninterruptedly nudging him among &amp; along the winding ways of random ever!) Shaun in proper person (may all the sliding constellations continue to be his changeable
timetable!) was before me <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">for he sproke</span></span> and he was looking grand, he was immense, swell for he sproke When lo meheard I saw the voice of Shaun how so it sighed to scented nightlife as softly as the loftly marconimasts from Clifden sigh open tireless secrets to Nova Scotia&apos;s listing sisterpoles</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Alas alone alanna aroon! Shaun said, complaining of the fact while he stared upon the native soil he loved best, how all too unworthy am I, a mere mailman of peace, for such eminence
<br><font color="green">{ms, 21}</font>
<br> or promenade, to be exact, as to be the bearer of these letter on His Majesty&apos;s service!</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But have I asked you, dear Shaun, I remembered, who it was who gave you the permit?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Everybody, Shaun replied. I have it from Saint Columkille&apos;s prophecies</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Then, I explained, you might be so by order.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Forgive me, Shaun replied, it was made known in the prophecies and there is a power over me that is put upon me from on high &amp; I am hopeless to do anything about it.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Dear Shaun, I agreed, what then were it you who will maybe bear those letter?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; As, Shaun replied, to that I have the power.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Would you mind telling me, dear Shaun, I proposed, where mostly are you able to work?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I, Shaun replied, <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">am</span></span> mostly am able to walk. It was foretold for me never to work for otherwise I wd get into a blame but, believe me, I can truthfully say say my prayers regularly
<br><font color="green">{ms, 22}</font>
<br> in fact always have.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yet 1 minute&apos;s observation, dear Shaun, as I observe you have painted the town green.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well I confess to have,. Shaun replied. It is grandiose from the prophecies With my post lamp.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do you mean, I gathered, whether varnish will or verdure?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It is a confounded lie to say it, bad luck to you, Shaun replied, What wd I be doing besides your varnish? Understand me when I tell you that in the past parcel office, so much deplored by my previous friend, Miss Sanders, postmistress in general to the Irish Goat Society, albeit blessed with 22,000 sorters out of a
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">po</span></span> biggest possible 22,000, too much administrative stationery was eaten by those goats. It is also one of my avowed intentions at some time to compose a savings book surrounding that matter.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But what, dear Shaun, I continued, wd be the biography of your <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">shor</span></span> softbodied uniform?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; None whatsoever, Shaun replied,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 23}</font>
<br> though it wd be very romantic. All of it was handed over by myself amongst my neighbours of every description, entitled the evicted tenants. Therefore I am plainly enveloped, which you will shortly see, in <a name="n10036b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10036b">care of</a> one of Guinness&apos;s registered barrels.<a target="foot" id="fpz0007">&ordm;</a></p> </p>  </main>
