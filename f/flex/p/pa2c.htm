<p> Methought <a name="n10054c" href="../../FF/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10054c">as I</a> going asleep somewhen in <a name="n05153f" href="../../FF/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05153f">nonland</a> of wheres please I heard as &apos;twere the peal of midnight&apos;s chimes from out the belfry of the cute old speckled church sounding so faint a 12 as nighthood rendered all
<a name="n10066f" href="../../FF/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10066f">animated</a> British objects nonviewable to human watchers save perchance anon some glistery gleam darkling adown surface of a fluvial flowandflow as again might be garments of laundry reposing a greensward close by in full expectation. And <a name="n10054c" href="../../FF/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10054c">as I was</a> going along in a dream as
dozing I was <a name="n10040d" href="../../FF/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10040d">dawdling</a> methought broadmouth was heard and all vociferated, echoating: Shaun! Shaun! Post the post! With a high voice &amp;, O, the higher his voice the deeper &amp; low. I heard it so And lo, methought somewhat came of the noise &amp; somewho seemed amove among allmurk, now &apos;twas as clump, now mayhap. When lo was
light and now &apos;twas as flasher now more as the glow. Ah! in <a name="n05153d" href="../../FF/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05153d">unlitness</a> &apos;Twas, in verity &apos;twas his belted lamp. Yes, he who swayed a will of a wisp before me, dressed like an earl, in just <a name="n06014l" href="../../FF/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06014l">the correct wear</a>, with a classy o&apos;coat of superior ruggedness
<a name="n07a02h" href="../../FF/fnbs/n07all.htm#n07a02h">freeswinging</a> from one shoulder &amp; thickwelted brogues on him <a name="n05bcrh" href="../../FF/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05bcrh">made to suit the Irish people and climate</a> &amp; his coat of woollies with <a name="n07a02f" href="../../FF/fnbs/n07all.htm#n07a02f">green &amp; yellow effects</a> out of it &amp; a softrolling lapel to &amp; the
most successfully carried trousers you ever saw breaking over the ankle &amp; hugging the shoeheel &amp; his invulnerable <a name="sa0984bl" href="../../FF/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0984bl">burlap</a> waistcoat and inside of it he was showing off his bluespangled zephyr over<a name="n08095j" href="../../FF/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08095j">shirt</a> that had a
<a name="n08095j" href="../../FF/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08095j">decidedly surplice</a> short &mdash; everything the best, was none other from (<a name="n05175e" href="../../FF/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05175e">Ah, then,</a> the blessings of God &amp; Mary &amp;
<br><font color="green">{ms, 20}</font>
<br> Patrick be rambling all over him!) other than (may his 100,000 welcome letters multiply &amp; plultiply!) Shaun himself.</p>
<p> Had I the concordant wiseheads of Messrs Gregory &amp; Lyons along with Dr Tarpey&apos;s &amp; the Rev. Mr MacDougall&apos;s but I, poor ass, am but as their fourpart ass. Yet methought Shaun (holy messenger angels be uninterruptedly nudging him among &amp; along the winding ways of random ever!) Shaun in proper person (may all the
<a name="n10040c" href="../../FF/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10040c">backsliding</a> constellations continue to be his changeable timetable!) was before me in more than his usual health and I tell you my word he <a name="n06047a" href="../../FF/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06047a">looked the stuff</a>. Now, without deceit <a name="n01043d" href="../../FF/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01043d">it is hardly too much to say</a> he was
looking grand, so fired smart he was immense, quite swell and so <a name="n10033e" href="../../FF/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10033e">jaunty</a> with a <a name="n01035k" href="../../FF/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01035k">schoolgirl complexion</a> on him plainly <a name="n01041g" href="../../FF/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01041g">out on the mash</a> for he was after having a great time in a
<a name="sa0801i" href="../../FF/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0801i">porterhouse</a> where he had <a name="n05bcrg" href="../../FF/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05bcrg">recruited his health</a> by his three principal meals, his <a name="n06087d" href="../../FF/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06087d">breakfast of a half a pound of bacon &amp; eggs, then his dinner of a half a pound of round steak with some chops</a> thrown in by the
proprietoress and <a name="n06080d" href="../../FF/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06080d">gravy with potatoes and a raw tomato and then finally his supper, videlicet, bacon</a> with some cold breast of veal. I don&apos;t mean to say he was greedy but he liked his <a name="n10017b" href="../../FF/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10017b">feed</a> a lot. So Then he sproke When lo meheard I saw the voice of Shaun how so it sighed
to scented nightlife as softly as the loftly marconimasts from Clifden sigh open tireless secrets to Nova Scotia&apos;s listing sisterpoles</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Alas alone alanna aroon! Shaun <a name="n10021a" href="../../FF/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10021a">yawned</a>, <a name="n10029e" href="../../FF/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10029e">addressing himself</a> &amp; complaining of the fact <a name="n10057a" href="../../FF/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10057a">of earning his bread in sweat of feet</a> as, having moistened his mouth in quiet, scooped his teeth clean
with his forefinger, as he sank down at once upon the native soil he loved <a name="n06014e" href="../../FF/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06014e">covered with virgin bush</a>. <a name="n06019p" href="../../FF/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06019p">Well, I&apos;m shot seeing myself like this!</a> How all too unworthy am I, a mere mailman of peace, for such eminence
<br><font color="green">{ms, 21}</font>
<br> or promenade, to be exact, as to be the bearer of these <a name="n10028f" href="../../FF/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10028f">missive</a> on His Majesty&apos;s service! <a name="n05099d" href="../../FF/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05099d">I cannot recollect having done</a> anything to earn it at all</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But have we until now besought you, dear Shaun, we remembered, who it was, <a name="n01039f" href="../../FF/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01039f">to begin with</a>, who gave you the permit?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Everybody, Shaun replied. It is my <a name="n06124d" href="../../FF/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06124d">heaviest cross</a> &amp; I have it from Saint Columkille&apos;s prophecies</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Then, we explained, you might be so by order.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Forgive me, Shaun replied with his liquid lips, it was condemned for me in the prophecies and there is a power over me that is put upon me from on high &amp; so <a name="n05078h" href="../../FF/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05078h">as it is</a> I have <a name="n06023a" href="../../FF/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06023a">nothing to look forward at</a> and am hopeless to do anything about it.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Honest Shaun, we agreed, <a name="n05179f" href="../../FF/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05179f">a whisper reaches us</a> that it may turn out to be you you who will maybe bear those <a name="n10066i" href="../../FF/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10066i">open</a> letter?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; As, Shaun replied <a name="n10019b" href="../../FF/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10019b">patly</a>, to that I have the power. And that <a name="n06080i" href="../../FF/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06080i">has a lot to do with everything</a></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Would you mind telling us, Shaun honey, we proposed to that dear youth, where mostly are you able to work?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I, Shaun replied, mostly am able to walk. <a name="n10064c" href="../../FF/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10064c">I am always telling them</a> how It was foretold for me to be disbarred from unnecessary servile work of all sorts work for otherwise I wd get into a blame. <a name="n06044j" href="../../FF/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06044j">His Holy Will be done.</a> But, believe me, I can truthfully
declare with my hand on the <a name="n10020f" href="../../FF/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10020f">epistles</a> I am <a name="n10035d" href="../../FF/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10035d">awful good</a> &amp; always I do my reasonable best to say my prayers regularly
<br><font color="green">{ms, 22}</font>
<br> in fact always have.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Yet 1 minute&apos;s observation, dear domestic Shaun, as we observe you have painted the town green.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <a name="n06019d" href="../../FF/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06019d">O, murder,</a> Shaun replied. Well so be it &amp; I will confess to have, <a name="n10096f" href="../../FF/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10096f">yes,</a> so long as I&apos;m <a name="n10067c" href="../../FF/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10067c">prepaid</a>. And <a name="n06013m" href="../../FF/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06013m">it wasn&apos;t my first
time</a>. Somebody may perhaps say I am wrong. But It is grandiose from the prophecies and they were particularly written by a gentleman for gentlemen. It was with my post lamp.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do you mean, we gathered, whether varnish will or verdure?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It is a confounded lie to say it, bad luck to you, Shaun, the firy boy, replied, naturally very <a name="n04153c" href="../../FF/fnbs/n04all.htm#n04153c">incensed</a>, Another time Please confine your <a name="sa0803ax" href="../../FF/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0803ax">glaring insinuations</a> to some other body What <a name="n05151i" href="../../FF/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05151i">on the
face of this earth</a> wd I be doing besides your varnish? That is <a name="n01053g" href="../../FF/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01053g">more than I can say</a> anyway. <a name="n10097f" href="../../FF/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10097f">So let you &amp; I</a> drop that. Understand me when I tell you that in the past parcel office, so much deplored by my
<a name="n10006k" href="../../FF/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10006k">erstwhile</a> cousin friend, Miss Sanders, postmistress in general to the Irish Goat Society, albeit blessed with 22,000 sorters out of a biggest possible 22,000, too much administrative stationery was eaten by those goats. It is also one of my avowed intentions at some time when <a name="n06057h" href="../../FF/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06057h">I
am not prepared to say</a> to compose quite a <a name="n10049e" href="../../FF/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10049e">patent</a> savings book surrounding that matter.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; But what, dear Shaun, we continued, wd be the biography of your softbodied uniform?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; None whatsoever, Shaun replied,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 23}</font>
<br> though it wd be very romantic. All of it <a name="n06020a" href="../../FF/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06020a">I might say</a> was handed over by myself amongst my neighbours of every description, entitled the evicted tenants. <a name="n06088o" href="../../FF/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06088o">What I say is</a> and I am no fool, permit me to tell you. Therefore I am plainly enveloped, which you will shortly
receive, in <a name="n10036b" href="../../FF/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10036b">care of</a> one of Moosyears Guinness&apos;s registered barrels.<a target="foot" id="fpz0007">&ordm;</a></p> </p>  </main>
