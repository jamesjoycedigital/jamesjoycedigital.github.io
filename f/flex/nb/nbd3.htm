<p> And there they were too listening in as hard as they could to the solans and sycamores and the migratories and mistlethrushes and all the birds of the sea, all four of them, listening: They were the big four, the four master waves of Erin, all listening, four. There was old Matt Gregory and then besides old Matt there was old
<br><font color="green">{f10, 298}</font>
<br> Marcus Lyons, the four waves, and oftentimes they used to be saying grace together right enough: here now we are the four of us: old Matt Gregory and old Marcus and old Luke Tarpey: the four of us and sure thank God there are no more of us: and sure now you wouldn&apos;t go and <font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">forget
and</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font> leave out the other fellow and old Johnny MacDougall: the four of us and no more of us and so now pass the fish for Christ&apos; sake, Amen: the way they used to be saying their grace before fish <font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">repeating
itself</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font> for auld lang syne. And so there they were spraining their ears listening and listening to the oceans of kissening with their eyes glistening all the four when he was kiddling and cuddling his colleen bawn that was very wrong

<br> cuddling and kiddling her from under her mistlethrush and kissing and listening in the good old bygone days of Dion Boucicault the elder in Arrah-na-poghue in one of the farback centuries when who made the world <font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">where</span></span>

man on the door when they were all four collegians on the nod with their slates and satchels in the queen&apos;s colleges with another fellow. Ah ho! It brought the dear
<br><font color="green">{f10, 299}</font>
<br> scenes all back again as fresh as of yore Matt and Marcus and after that now there he was and his Arrah-na-poghue before the four of them so shocking and scandalous and now thank God there were no more of them and he poghuing and poghuing and there they were listening as tired as they were, the three jolly topers, with their mouths watering along with the other fellow so pass the poghue for
Christ&apos; sake, Amen. Listening and poghuing and watering, all the four, the old men of the sea, Luke and Johnny MacDougall and all wishening for anything at all of the bygone times for a cup of kindness yet for four farback tumblerfuls of woman squash with them all four listening and spraining their ears and all their mouths making water.</p>
<p> Johnny. Ah well sure that&apos;s the way up and it so happened there was poor Matt Gregory up and up the others and now really and truly they were four dear old heladies and really they looked so nice and respectable with their grey half a tall hat and tailormade frock coat and after that they had their fathomglasses to find out all the fathoms and their half a tall hat just now like the

<br> from the Curragh and confusionaries over from England and American visitors (so they say) all over in his grey half a tall hat (how do you do, jaypee?) and his fathomglasses to find out all the improper colleges (and how do you do, Mr Dame James? get out of my way!) and all the horsepowers. But now that reminds me of the poor Marcus of Lyons and poor Johnny and what do you think of the four
of us and there they were now listening right enough, the four saltwater widowers, and all they could remembore long long ago in the olden times and Lally when my heart knew no care and after that then there was the landing of Lady James Casement in the year of the flood 1132 and the christening of Queen Battersby the Fourth according to her grace the bishop, alderwoman J. P. Bishop, Senior, and
then there was the drowning of Pharoah and all his pedestrians and they were all completely drowned into the sea, the red sea, and then poor Martin Cunningham out of the castle on pension when he was completely drowned off Dunleary at that time in the red sea and a lovely mourning paper and thank God there were no more of him. And that now was how it was. Ay, ay. And so he was.</p>
<p> Marcus. And after that<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">, not forgetting,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font> there was the Flemish armada all scattered and all drowned there and then on a lovely morning after the flood at about eleven thirtytwo <font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">(was
it?)<a target="foot" id="fnn0125">&ordm;</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font> off the coast of Cunningham and saint Patrick the anabaptist and Kevin the lacustrian and Powerscourt and Dana our first marents and Lapoleon, the equestrian and all they remembored and then there was the French fleet round about the year of Notre Dame 1132
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">or so</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font> landing from under Madam-general Bonaboche in his half a grey hat and after that there he was, so terrestrial, cuddling and poghuing her scandalous and very wrong under the sycamores in Arrah-na-poghue, so silvestrious, near the queen&apos;s colleges in 1132
Bride street behind the century man on the door. And then again they used to give the grandest known lectures from sea to sea (Matt speaking!) according to the pictures postcard in Roman history repeating itself (Marcus Lyons speaking!) to the collegians green and all the old trinitarian senate and the Plymouth brethren nodding and sleeping away
<font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">there like <a name="n01094d" href="../../FF/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01094d">forgetmenots</a></font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font> in the four trinity colleges of Ulcer, Moonster, Leanstare and Cannought, the four grandest colleges of Killorcure and Killthemall and Killeachother and Killkelly-on-the-Flure.
Those were the
<br><font color="green">{f10, 302}</font>
<br> grandest gynecollege histories (Lucas calling, hold the line!) in the Jane Andersdaughter university for auld acquaintance sake (this unitarian lady lived to a great age at or in or about No. 1132 <font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">or 1169</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font> Fitzmary Round where she was seen by many and widely
liked) for teaching the Woman history repeating herself of the spirit of nature as divinely developed in time by psadatepholomy, the past and present (Johnny MacDougall speaking, give me trunks, miss!) and present and absent and past and present and future <i>arma virumque romano</i>. Ah, dearo dear! How it all came back to them to hear him there kissing her and cuddling her in his Roman catholic
arms by the Cornelius Nepos. Mnepos. Anumque. Umque.</p>
<p> Queh? Quos?</p>
<p> Ah, dearo dearo dear! It was so sorry for all the whole twice two four of us and Lally when he lost part of his half a hat and repeating himself and telling him <font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">to forget the past and all</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font> about Lally and his old fellow and all the old drakes ever he had up in the
bohereen and the old folks at home and Duignam and Lapole and he couldn&apos;t stop laughing over Tom Tim Tarpey, the Welshman, and the four widowers. And now that reminds me <font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext"><a name="sa0591j" href="../../FF/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0591j">of</a></span></span> <font color="black">not to

water laughing, on the best of terms and be forgot which was plainly foretold by their old pilgrim song <i>As I was going to Ballymacarett we fell in with a lout by the name of Peebles</i> as also in another place by their orthodox proverb <i>That old fellow knows milk though he&apos;s not used to it latterly</i>. And so they parted. Ay, ay. The good go and the wicked is left over. Ay, ay. Ah,
well, sure that&apos;s the way. Woman. Squash. Part. Ay, ay. By decree absolute.</p>

sign an old morning paper, a request in writing to herself on stamped parchment before saying his grace before fish and then and there and too there was poor Dion Boucicault all drowned too poor Dion before the world and her husband because it was most improper and most wrong when he attempted to &mdash; well, he was shocking bad in his health, he said, with the shingles falling off him &mdash;
because he &mdash; ah, well now, we won&apos;t be too hard on
<br><font color="green">{f10, 304}</font>
<br> him as an old Manx presbyterian, and after that he made his last will and went to confession on his two bare marrowbones to Mother Evangelist Sweeney and he was so sorry, he was really, because he left the boot button in the hansom cab and now tell the truth there
<br><font color="green">{f39, 392}</font>
<br> were faults on both sides &mdash; well, he attempted (or so they say) &mdash; ah, <font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><font color="black">now, forget and forgive,<a target="foot" id="fnn0205">&ordm;</a> and</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font> sure, he was only funning, with his andrewmartins and his old age coming over him &mdash; well, he attempted or
he was tempted to attempt some hunnish familiarities after eating a bad crab in the red sea and sure he was deadseasickabed (it was really too bad!), her poor old divorced male, in the hospice for the dying and trying to hold the nursetender&apos;s hand, ah, the poor old coax, and count the buttons and her hand and frown on a bad crab and dying to remembore who made a who a snore. Ah dearo dearo
dear!</p>
<p> And where do you leave Matt? They were all so sorry for poor Matt in his saltwater hat that she grew all out of too big for him of Mnepos and his overalls all falling over her in folds &mdash; sure, he hadn&apos;t the heart in him to pull them up &mdash; poor Matt, the old peregrine matriarch, and a queenly man, sitting there Themistletocles on his multilingual tombstone with her face to the
wall in sight of the poorhouse amid the rattle of <font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">hailstones</span></span> <font color="black">hailstorms</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font>, with her ivyclad hat and gripping an old pair of curling tongs belonging to Mrs Dana O&apos;Connell to blow his brains with, with his
can of tea from Anne Lynch and two cuts of Shackleton&apos;s brown loaf and dilisk, waiting for the end to come &mdash; God of heaven, when you think of it! Ah ho! It was too bad entirely! All divorce by active parlourmen of woman squelch and all on account of the
<br><font color="green">{f39, 393}</font>
<br> smell of Shackleton and Scratchman and his mouth watering and so now pass the loaf for Christ&apos; sake, Amen. And so. And all.
<br><font color="green">{f10, 305}</font> </p>
<p> Matt. And loaf. Ah, God be good to us! Poor Andrew Martin Cunningham! Ay, ay!</p>
<p> And still and all at that time they were always thinking up <font color="red"><sup><small>|3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">of</span></span> <font color="black">and forgetting about</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3|</small></sup></font> auld lang syne up their four hosenbands that were four up beautful sister masters, now happily married, and there they
