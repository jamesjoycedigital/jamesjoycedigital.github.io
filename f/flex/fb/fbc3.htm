<p class="headline">I.6&sect;2 (FW 150.15 - 152.03) </p>
<p> Professor Levis-Brueller (though,<a target="foot" id="fff0416">&ordm;</a> as I shall promptly prove,<a target="foot" id="fff0417">&ordm;</a> his whole account of the Sennacherib as distinct from the Shalmaneser<a target="foot" id="fff0418">&ordm;</a> sanitational<a target="foot" id="fff0419">&ordm;</a> reforms and of the Mr Shekels<a target="foot" id="fff0420">&ordm;</a> and Dr Hydes problem
in the same connection differs <i>toto coelo</i> from the fruit of my own investigations &mdash; though the reason I went to Jericho must remain for certain reasons a political secret especially<a target="foot" id="fff0421">&ordm;</a> as <a name="n27a01h" href="../../FF/fnbs/n27all.htm#n27a01h">I shall shortly be wanted in</a> Cavantry, <a name="n27a01b" href="../../FF/fnbs/n27all.htm#n27a01b">I
congratulate myself</a>, for the same and other reasons &mdash; as being again hopelessly vitiated by what I have now resolved to call the dime and cash diamond fallacy) in his talked off confession which recently met with such a leonine uproar on its escape after its confinement,<a target="foot" id="fff0422">&ordm;</a> <i>Why am I not born like a Gentileman and why I
am</i><a target="foot" id="fff0423">&ordm;</a> <i>now so speakable about my own eatables</i> (Feigenbaumblatt and Father, Judapest, 5688, A.M.),<a target="foot" id="fff0424">&ordm;</a> wholeheartedly<a target="foot" id="fff0425">&ordm;</a> takes off his gabbercoat and wig, honest draughty fellow,<a target="foot" id="fff0426">&ordm;</a> in his public interest, to make us see
how,<a target="foot" id="fff0427">&ordm;</a> though, as he says,<a target="foot" id="fff0428">&ordm;</a> &ldquo;by Allswill&rdquo;,<a target="foot" id="fff0429">&ordm;</a> the inception and the descent and the endswell of Man is <i>temporarily</i><a target="foot" id="fff0430">&ordm;</a> wrapped in obscenity. Looking<a target="foot" id="fff0431">&ordm;</a> through at these accidents with the
faroscope of television (this nightlife instrument needs still some subtractional betterment in the readjustment of the more refrangible angles to the squeals of his hypothesis on the outer tin sides)<a target="foot" id="fff0432">&ordm;</a> I can easily believe heartily in my own most spacious immensity
<br><font color="green">{f39, 151}</font>
<br> as my ownhouse and microbemost cosm when I am reassured by ratio that the cube of my volumes is to the surfaces of their subjects as the<a target="foot" id="fff0433">&ordm;</a> sphericity of these globes (I am very pressing for a parliamentary motion which, under my guidance, would establish the deleteriousness of decorousness in the morbidisation of the modern mandaboutwoman type) is to the
feracity of Fairynelly&apos;s vacuum. I need not anthropologise<a target="foot" id="fff0434">&ordm;</a> for any <a name="n21014e" href="../../FF/fnbs/n21all.htm#n21014e">obintentional</a> (I must here correct all that school of neoitalian or paleoparisien schola of tinkers and spanglers who say I&apos;m wrong <i>parceqeue</i><a target="foot" id="fff0435">&ordm;</a> I want to be) downtrodding on my
foes,<a target="foot" id="fff0436">&ordm;</a> Professor Levis-Brueller F.D.<a target="foot" id="fff0437">&ordm;</a> finds, because the number of squeer faiths in weakly<a target="foot" id="fff0440">&ordm;</a> circulation will not be appreciably augmended<a target="foot" id="fff0441">&ordm;</a> by the netherslogging<a target="foot" id="fff0442">&ordm;</a> of my cupolar clods. What the romantic in
rags pines after and what he<a target="foot" id="fff0444">&ordm;</a> importunes our <i>Mitleid</i> for is the poorest waste of time. <i>His</i> everpresent toes are always out through<a target="foot" id="fff0445">&ordm;</a> his overpast boots. Hear <i>him</i> squeak<a target="foot" id="fff0446">&ordm;</a>! <i>When</i> Mullocky won the couple of colds, <i>when</i> we were stripping in number three,
I would like the neat drop that would malt in my mouth but I  fail to see <i>when</i>.<a target="foot" id="fff0447">&ordm;</a> (I am purposely refraining from expounding the obvious fallacy as to the specific gravitates of the two liquids implied though<a target="foot" id="fff0450">&ordm;</a> students of mixed hydrostatics and pneumodipsics will after some difficulties grapple away with my
meinungs.)<a target="foot" id="fff0451">&ordm;</a> But, on Professor Levis-Brueller F.D. Ph.Dr&apos;s<a target="foot" id="fff0452">&ordm;</a> showings, the plea, if he pleads, is all posh and rabbage<a target="foot" id="fff0453">&ordm;</a> on a melodeontic scale since his man&apos;s <i>when</i> is no otherman&apos;s <i>quandom</i><a target="foot" id="fff0454">&ordm;</a> (mine, dank
you!)<a target="foot" id="fff0455">&ordm;</a> while (for<a target="foot" id="fff0456">&ordm;</a> aught I care for the contrary?)<a target="foot" id="fff0457">&ordm;</a> the all is <i>where</i> in love as war and
