<p> Professor Levis in his (though, as I shall promptly prove, his whole account of the Sennacherib affair and the introduction of the Mr Shekels and Dr Hyde problem differs toto coelo from mine again hopelessly vitiated by what I shall now call the diamond and cash diamond fallacy) in his talked off confession <u>Why Am I not a</u>

<br> <u>Born Like a Gentileman?</u> (Feigenbaumblatt and Father, Judapest) wholeheartedly takes off his coat and wig, honest fellow, to make us see how as he says &apos;by Allswill the inception and the descent and the endswell of man is temporarily wrapped in obscenity,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 145}</font>
<br> looking at these accidents through the faroscope of television (this nightlife instrument needs still some subtractional betterment in the adjustment of the refrangibility angle to the squeals of the hypothesis on the outer tinsides) I can easily believe heartily in my own most spacious immensity of my ownhouse &amp; microbemost cosm when I am quite reassured that the cubes of my volumes are
to the surfaces of their subjects as the sphericity of these globes is to the feracity of Fairynelly&apos;s vacuum. I <u>need not</u> antropologise

<br> for downtrodding on my foes, Professor Levis Brueller finds, because the number of squeer faiths in weakly circulation will not be appreciably augmended by the netherslogging of my cupolar clods. What the romantic in rags pines after &amp; what he importunes our <u>Mitleid</u> for is a waste of time. <u>His</u>

<br> everpresent toes are always out through his past boots. Hear him squeak! When Mullocky won the couple of bob. When we were stripping in number three I would like the neat drop that would malt in my mouth but I cannot see when. (I am purposing refraining from exposing the obvious fallacy as to the specific gravities
<br><font color="green">{ms, 148}</font>
<br> of the two lickquids implied. Students of mixed hydrostatics &amp; pneumodipsics will after some difficulties grapple away with my meanings) But, on Professor Levis Brueller&apos;s showing, the plea is all posh and rabbage on a melodeontic scale since his man&apos;s when is no other man&apos;s quandour. While, while, ought I care for the contrary?, the all is <u>where</u> in love as
