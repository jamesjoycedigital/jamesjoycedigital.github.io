<p class="flush">Answer: No, blank you! But Before proceeding to conclusively confute this begging question it would be much fitter for you, if you dare, to consult with and consequentially attempt at my disposals of the same dime-cash problem elsewhere, naturalistically, of course, from the blinkpoint of a spatialist. From it you will will notice, Schott, upon my first remarking that the
sophology of Bitchson while driven by a purely dime-dime urge is not without its cash-cash
<br><font color="green">{ms, 143v}</font>
<br> charactericksticks, borrowed for its nonce ends from the fiery goodmother Miss Fortune (who we have had our little private brush with, what, Schott?) &amp; as I could have told you <a name="n05152i" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05152i">behaviouristically</a> <u>paillet&eacute;s</u> with a coat of homoid icing, which is in reality a ridiculisation of the whoo-whoo and where&apos;s-hairs
theorics of Winestain. To put it all the more plumbly. The speechform is a mere surrogate whilst the quality and
<br><font color="green">{ms, 142v}</font>
<br> tality (I shall explain what you ought to mean by this in the subsequent sentence) are alternativamentally harrogate or arrogate, as the gates may be. Talis is a word often abused by many <u>passim</u>. A person will frequently say: Are you seein much of Talis and Talis those times? meaning: Will you put up a three of irish? Or a ladyeater may have perhaps casualised to you as you temptoed
her <u>&agrave; la sourdine</u>: Of you plates? Is Talis and Talis, the swordswallower, who is on
<br><font color="green">{ms, 141v}</font>
<br> at the <u>Craterium</u> the same Talis and Talis, the pencrusher, no funk you! who runs his duly mile? Or this is a perhaps better example. At a recent postvortex piece-examination of a determined case of spinosism, an extension lecturer on the Ague who was trying seesers, Dr &apos;sHet Ubeleeft asked the question: Why is which Suchman <u>talis qualis</u>: to whom Dr Gedankje of Stoutgirth
who was wiping his whistle toarsely returted: While though beast a zoom of a whorl!</p> </p>  </main>
