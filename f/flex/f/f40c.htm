<p class="flush">As I have now successfully explained to you my natural rations which are even in excise of my brainvault tell me I am a much more deserving case. I feel symbathos for him as an ever devoted friend and halfloafed brother (darling <font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font>! darling
<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font>!) because he is such a barefooted robber with my supersocks pulled over his face which I publicked in my best backgarden. You will say it is most unenglish and I hope you will be right. But (will you come over and let us
<br><font color="green">{ms, 139v}</font>
<br> moomor to each other far beneath our vocies). i am being underheerd by old billfaust. wilsh is <a name="n12199f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n12all.htm#n12199f">full of corks</a>. the coolskittle is full of deblinite. mr wist is thereover beyeind the wantnot. wilsh and wist are as thick of each other as faust and the deblinite. And from the point of fun which I am crying to arrive you at they are all
as foibleminded as you can see they are fablebodied.</p>
<p> My heeders will recall with leisure
<br><font color="green">{ms, 138v}</font>
<br> how in the beginning before trespassing on the space question where even michelangelines fool to dread I proved to myself &amp; your sotisfiction how his abject all through (the <u>quickquid</u> of Professor Ciondoloni&apos;s too frequently hypothecated <u>Bettlermensch</u>) is nothing so much more than a mere cashdime however genteel he may want us to feel about it (I am speaking of us in
the second person) for to this grade of intelleckuals dime
<br><font color="green">{ms, 137v}</font>
<br> <u>is</u> cash and the cash system (you must not be allowed to forget that this is all contained, I mean the system is, in the origen of spurious) means that I cannot now have &amp; nothave a piece of cheeps in your pocket at the same times &amp; with the same manners as unless Burrus &amp; Caseous have or have not simultaneously selldear to soldhere once in the dear dairy days of buy &amp;
buy,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 134v}</font> </p>
<p class="flush">Burrus, let us like to imagine, is the genuine prime, the real choice, whereas Caseous is obversely the revise of him, and in fact, not an ideal cheese by any meals, though the better man of the two is meltingly addicted to the more caseal side of the arrival and, let me say it at once, as zealous over him as passably he.</p>
<p class="flush">The old Kaeser, unbeurrable from age, having always &amp; chewly been removed the twin types are set to make their reupprearance on the deserted table I could paint you that butter if you had some wash.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 127v}</font> </p>
<p class="flush">Caseous may think himself a thought of a caviller but Burrus has the richly rounded head of thoftthinking <a name="n26138g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n26all.htm#n26138g">fideism</a>. He has milk and wisdom in every tooth of him whereas the other fellow. It was aptly &amp; correctly stated (it is really unnecessary for me to say by whom) that his seeingcraft was so clarety that were the
whole borough of Saint Poutresbourg to be avalanched over him he could still make out with his eyestritch the green moat in Ireland&apos;s Eye. Let me sell you the <a name="n26059k" href="../../ff/fnbs/n26all.htm#n26059k">fulltruth</a> of Burrus when he wor a <a name="n19064h" href="../../ff/fnbs/n19all.htm#n19064h">younker</a>. Here
<br><font color="green">{ms, 126v}</font>
<br> is in six by sevens. A cleanly thing, by the gods! A cheery ripe outlook, so help me Deusfidius! If I were to say my entire mindful about it I should call him the <a name="n26207j" href="../../ff/fnbs/n26all.htm#n26207j">Ormuzd</a> element in our midst. <u>Butyrum et mel comedet ut sciat reprobare malum et eligere bonum</u>. This also will explain why <u>Der Hansli ist ein Butterbrot,
Butterbrot, Butterbrot. Und Kobi ist ein Schtinkenkott. Ja, ja, ja.</u>
<br><font color="green">{ms, 125v}</font>
<br> This, in fact, is Caseous, the brotherscoth or por tyron! a hole or two, the stink aforefelt, and some prigging worms. However you complain and Hi Hi High must say you are not mistaken. We cannot (this is what has) escape our likes and mislikes exiles or ambusheers, beggar and neighbour <u>Next quovis burro num fit mercaseous?</u> I am not thereby giving my final endorsement to the learned
ignorance the <a name="n26020l" href="../../ff/fnbs/n26all.htm#n26020l">Cusanus</a> philosophy in which old <a name="n26020l" href="../../ff/fnbs/n26all.htm#n26020l">Nicholas</a> pegs it down that the smarter the spin of the top the the sounder the span of the bottom. (What he ought to have said, of
<br><font color="green">{ms, 124v}</font>
<br> course, was: the more stolidly immobile <u>in space</u> appears to be the bottom which is presented to us <u>in time</u> by the top primomobile). And I shall be misunderstood if understood to give an unconditional sineque to the heroical fury of the Nolanus theory or, at any rate, of that subsub of a part of his theory where Theophily
<br><font color="green">{ms, 134v}</font>
<br> While I
<br><font color="green">{ms, 133v}</font>
<br> am not recommending the Silkebjorg tyrodynamo machine for the more economic helixtrolysis of these adipates until I have looked into it for myself a little more closely I shall go on with my decisions after having shown you in time of what both products of our social stomach are in mutuearly
<br><font color="green">{ms, 131v}</font>
<br> polarised. Positing two male poles, the one the pictor of the other and the other the &sigma;&kappa;&omicron;&tau;&omicron; of the one, &amp; looking around our so undistributed middle between males we wofully want a female to focus and in this way, pleasantly, this cowrymaid introduces herself at some precise hour which we shall agree to call zero
<br><font color="green">{ms, 130v}</font>
<br> and I so like that other son of a kish who went out to found his father&apos;s ashes we come home gently on our asses to meet Margareen.</p>

<p class="flush"><a name="sa0051bd" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0051bd">Margareena she&apos;s very fond of Burrus but, alick and alack!, she velly fond of chee.</a> The important influence on everything of this eastasian import has not till now been fully favoured, but we can distinctly taste it here. I shall come back for more after a brief space. A cleopatrician in her own right she
complicates the position, while Burrus and Caseous are contending for her misstery, by implicating herself with an elusive Antonius who would seem to hug a personal interest in refined chees of all chades while he wags an antomine art of being rude like the boor. The Antonius-Burrus-Caseous grouptriad may be said to equate the <u>qualis</u> equivalent with the older socalled <u>talis</u> on
<u>talis</u> one. And this is why any simple fool you like to dress may be awfully green on one side and frightfully blue on the other which will not
<br><font color="green">{ms, 120v}</font>
<br> screen him from appearing in my eyes as a bloody blasted bleating blatant bloaten blooming blephorous idiot!</p>
<p> No. I have now said it 12 tabular times and what, if not the Word of Man, is sacred. Wing man in the rong place right words in the right order. <u>Ubi lingua nuncupassit ibi fas Adversus hostem semper sac!</u> She that will not bare me preach
<br><font color="green">{ms, 116v}</font>
<br> let her be to thee as the hoyden and the impudent! That man that hoth no moses in his soul nor is not mused by conquist of word&apos;s laws, who never with himself was fed and leaves his soil and laves his head when his heart&apos;s in his highlows from whisking the woe, if he came to my preach
<br><font color="green">{ms, 150}</font>
<br> preach, a proud purse-broken ranger, when the heavens were welling the spite of their spout to beg for a bite in my bark <u>Noisdanger</u>, would meself and MacJeffet, two to one, lock him out? &mdash; ay! &mdash; though were my own breast brother, were we bred</p> </p>  </main>
