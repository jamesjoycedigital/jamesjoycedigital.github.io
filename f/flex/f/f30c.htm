<p class="center">The Moose and the Grapes</p>
<p class="spfl">A moose he would a walking go so he drubbed his eyes, ascented his nose, packed up his ears put on his impermeable and stepped out of his immobile and set off to see how badness was badness in the waste of all parsable words. He had not made but a few <a name="n21026d" href="../../ff/fnbs/n21all.htm#n21026d">parsecs</a> when at the dirty of a wrong lane he came upon a stream. It
was little and it was brown and it was narrow and it was shallow. And as it ran it dribbled like any lively purl-it easy. My, my my! Me me me! Little brown dream don&apos;t I love me? And, I declare! Who was there on the yonder side of the stream, parched on a limb of the olum but the Grapes. no doubt he was fit to be dried for why had he not been having the juice of his time? His pips had been
nearly all drowned on him, his polps were charging odours every older minute, he was quickly for getting the dresser&apos;s designs on the flypage of his frons and he was quietly for giving the bailiff&apos;s distrain on to the balkside of his
<br><font color="green">{ms, 217v}</font>
<br> <u>cul de pompe</u>. In all his specious heavings, as he lived by Optimus Maximus, the moose had never seen his brooder so near a pickle. He stood before the Grapes in an outfit all of Aurignacian. &ldquo;Fie, sour!&rdquo; said he to the scapegrapes &ldquo;Have you not a shambleful Our Father <font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font>
<br><font color="green">{ms, 218v}</font> </p>
<p class="flush">He sor a stone and on that stone he sate his seat which it filled to the fullest justotoryum and whereupon with his unfallable upon his alloilable and the pederect he walked with <font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font> his fresherman&apos;s blague <u>Bellua Triumphans</u> he looked the last laical likenesses of of Quartus V Quintus the Sixth
giving allnight sittings to Leo the <a name="n26175g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n26all.htm#n26175g">Faultyfinth</a>.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Good appetite How do you do it, sir Mookse? cheeped the Gripes in a wherry whoggy woice and the jackasses laughed at his voice for they knew their <a name="n26084a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n26all.htm#n26084a">sly toad lowry</a> well I am blessed to see you, my dear mister. Will you not perhopes tell me everything, if you are pleased, sanity?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Rats! roared the Mookse and the mice quailed to hear him at all for you cannot wake a silken noise out of a hoarse oar. Blast yourself! No, hang you! I am superbly in my supreme <a name="n21017b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n21all.htm#n21017b">poncif</a>. Rot!</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I am till infinity obliged with you, said the Gripes. I am still always having a wish on all my extremities. By the watch, what is the time, pace?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ask my index! Quote awhore! replied the Mookse <a name="n08050g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08050g">in highest of humour</a> rapidly becoming clement urban &amp; celestinal. It is quite about what I came for. Let there be
<br><font color="green">{ms, 219}</font>
<br> orlog. Let here be Irene. Let you be Beeton. And let me be Los Angelos. Well, sour, do you give you up?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I can never give you up, replied the Gripes with his nethermost wanhope. My temple is my own. But I hear I can rarely tell you whose a&apos;cloak you are.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; My building space is always to let to men, concluded the Mookse. My side is as safe as houses and I see what it is to be seen. Parysis belongs to him who parises himself. I can prove it against you, my good enemy. I bet you this dozen of tomes.

<p class="flush">He proved it by Neuclid, by Inexagoras, by Mummsen, by Thumpson, by Orasmus, and by O. Hone and after that he reproved it altogether after the binomial dioram and the penic walls and inklespill legends and the rune of the hoop and the the lessons of expedience and the judycats of Puncher&apos;s Pylax.</p>
<p> There was a little Cloud in her lightdress looking down on them, listening all she could. She was alone. All her nuby compinions were asleeping like the squirrels. Their mivver, Mrs Moonan, was away scrubbing the back steps at no 28. And as for fur fuvver he was up in Norwood&apos;s sokaparlor eating oceans of ice. She listened as she reflected herself and she tried all she tried to make the
<br><font color="green">{ms, 221}</font>
<br> Mooks look up at her (but he was far too farseeing) and to make the Gripes hear how how quiet she was (though he was not much too auricular about himself) but it was all child&apos;s labour lost. Not even her reflection would they take their noses off. She tried all the wily ways the four winds had taught her She tossed her hair like the little princess de Bretagne and she rounded her arms
like <a name="n26277l" href="../../ff/fnbs/n26all.htm#n26277l">Mrs Cornwallis West</a> and she smiled over herself like the image of the daughter of the queen of the emperor of Ireland and she sighed after herself like the bride of Tristis Tristissimus. But she might just as well have carried a daisy&apos;s grace to Florida. For the Mooks was not amooksed and the Gripes was painfully obliviscent.
You see, my dears, they were menner.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 222}</font> </p>
<p class="flush">Dusk to dusk, the shades gathered along the brightening river banks and it was as gloomy as gloaming could be in the west of all peacable wolds. The Moose had eyes yet he would not all hear. The Grapes had ears yet he could but ill see. And he ceased. And he ceased. And it was ever so dusky of them both. But one thought of how mooch he would say on the morrow and the other of all
the scrapes he would be creeped out of. So that the tears of night began to fall for the tired ones were weeping as we weep, now, with them. Then there came down to the one bank a woman of no appearance (I believe she was a Black) and she gathered up moose where he was spread and carried him away to her invisible cottage for he was the holy sacred spit of a bushop&apos;s apron. And there came down
to the other bank another woman <font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font> (still we are told that she is comely) and, for he
<br><font color="green">{ms, 223v}</font>
<br> was as like it as blow it to a halpenny hank, she plucked down the grapes and carried him away with her to her unseen shieling. And it was never so thoughtful of either of them. And there were left by their banks an only elmtree and but one stone. Then a small cloud made up all her little minds. She reflected for the last time in her short life. She climbed over the banisters awd, poof! She
was gone. And there fell into the river the last tear &amp; the loveliest, for it was a a leap tear. 28 = 1 <font face="wake">+</font> (2 <font face="wake">+</font> 3 <font face="wake">+</font> 4 <font face="wake">+</font> 5) <font face="wake">+</font> 6 <font face="wake">+</font> 7 / 14 But the river tripped on her by and by, lapping as if her heart was brook. Why, why, why? Weh, O weh, I&apos;s
so silly to be flowing but I no canna stay!</p> </p>  </main>
