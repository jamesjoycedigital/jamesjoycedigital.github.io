<p class="center">The Moose and the Grapes</p>
<p class="spfl">A moose he would a walking go so he put on his impermeable and stepped out of his immobile and set off to see how badness was badness in the west of all possible words. He had not made but a few <a name="n21026d" href="../../ff/fnbs/n21all.htm#n21026d">parsecs</a> when at the dirty of a wrong lane he met the Grapes. The Grapes was fit to be dried for why had he not been having the
juice of his time? His pips had been nearly all drowned on him, his polps were charging odours every older minute, he was for getting the dresser&apos;s designs into the flypape of his frons and he was quietly forgiving the bailiff&apos;s distrain on to the balkside of his
<br><font color="green">{ms, 217v}</font>
<br> <u>cul de pompe</u>. In all his specious heavings, as he lived by Optimus Maximus, the moose had never seen his brooder so near a pickle. <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">&ldquo;Woe,</span></span> He stood before the Grapes and looked up aurignacian in his outfit. &ldquo;Fie, sour!&rdquo; said he to the scapegrapes &ldquo;Have you not a shambleful Our Father

<p class="flush">He saw a stone and on that stone he sate his seat and with his unfallable upon his <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">in</span></span> alloilable and his fresherman&apos;s <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">trop</span></span> blague he was the laical likenesses of Leo <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">of</span></span> the

<p class="pdi">&mdash; How do you do it, Mr the Mookse? cheeped the Gripes I am blessed to see you, my dear mister. Will you not perhaps tell me everything, if you are pleased, sir?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Blast yourself, roared the Mookse and the mice quailed to hear him at all for you cannot make a silken noise out of a hoarse oar. No, hang you! I am superbly in my health. Rot!</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I am till infinity obliged with you, said the Gripes. I am having a watch on all my extremities. By the watch, what is the time<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">?</span></span>, pace?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Quote awhore! replied the Mookse. It is just about what I came for. Let there be
<br><font color="green">{ms, 219}</font>
<br> orlog. Let here be Irene. Let you be Beeton. And let me be Los Angelos. Well, sour, do you give it up?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I will never give you up, replied the Gripes with the nethermost despair. My temple is my own. But I can never tell you <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">how</span></span> whose a&apos;cloak you are.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; My building space is always to let to men, <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">replied</span></span> concluded the Mookse. My side is safe as houses. I see what it is to be seen. Paris belongs to he who praises himself. I can prove it against you. I bet you <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">a</span></span> this dozen of tomes.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 220}</font> </p>
<p class="flush">He proved it by Neuclid, by Inexagoras, by Mummsen, by Thumpsun, by Orasmus, and by O. Hone and after that he reproved it altogether <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">by</span></span> after the binomial <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the</span></span> dioram and the penic <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">law</span></span> walls and
inklespill legends and the rune of the hoop and the the lesson of expedience and the judicats of Puncher&apos;s Pylax.</p>
<p> There was a little <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">c</span></span> Cloud in her lightdress looking down on them, listening all she could. She was alone. All her nuby compinions were sleeping like the squirrels. Their mother, Mrs Moonan, was away scrubbing the back steps at no 28. And as for <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the</span></span> fur fuvver he was
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">round</span></span> up in Norwood&apos;s sokaparlor eating oceans of ice. She listened as she listened and she tried all she tried to make the
<br><font color="green">{ms, 221}</font>
<br> Mooks look up at her (but he was far too farseeing) and to make the Gripes hear how how quiet she was (but he was not much too auricular about himself) but it was all child&apos;s labour lost. She tossed her hair like the little princess de Bretagne and she rounded her arms like <a name="n26277l" href="../../ff/fnbs/n26all.htm#n26277l">Mrs Cornwallis West</a> and she smiled over herself like
the daughter of the queen of the emperor of Ireland and she sighed after herself like the bride of Tristis Tristissimus. But she might just as well have carried a daisy&apos;s grace to Florida. For the Mooks was not amooksed and the Gripes was painfully oblivious.

<p class="flush"><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Night</span></span> Dusk to dusk, the shades gathered along the brightening <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">l</span></span> river banks and it was as gloomy as gloaming could be in the west of all peacable wolds. The Moose had eyes but he could not hear. The Grapes had ears but he would but ill see. And he ceased. And he
ceased. And it was ever so dark of both of them.. Then there came down to the one bank <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">a</span></span> a woman of no appearance and she gathered up moose where he was spread and bore him away to her invisible cottage for he was the holy sacred spit of a bishop&apos;s apron. And there came down to the other bank another woman
<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font> (still we are told that she is comely) and, for he
<br><font color="green">{ms, 223v}</font>
<br> was as like it as blow it to a halpenny hank, she plucked away the grapes and carried away with her to her <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">little grey home</span></span> unseen shieling. And it was never so thoughtful of either of them. And there were left by their banks an only elmtree and but a stone.]Then the little cloud made
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">her</span></span> up her minds. She climbed over the banisters <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">and</span></span> awd, poof! She was gone. And there fell into the river the last tear &amp; the loveliest, a leap tear. |x28 = 1 <font face="wake">+</font> (2 <font face="wake">+</font> 3 <font face="wake">+</font> 4 <font face="wake">+</font>
5) <font face="wake">+</font> 6 <font face="wake">+</font> 7 / 14|x*1* And the river slipped between them, lapping as if her heart was broke. Why, why, why? O weh, O weh, I am sorry to be flowing but I must not stay!</p> </p>  </main>
