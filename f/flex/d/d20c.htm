<a name="n01029c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01029c">one street town</a>. Vainly virulence, violence &amp; vituperation sought wellnigh utterly to end the reign of the great <a name="n01033e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01033e">shipping mogul</a> and linen lord; it was one more dearer than all who was to make him the nine days&apos; jeer for

<p> He had laid violent hands on himself, <a name="n05035a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05035a">lain down, fagged out, with equally melancholy death</a>. He had left the country <u>via</u> a subterranean tunnel <a name="n01103b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01103b">shored with bedboards</a>. An infamous private ailment (variolovenereal) had claimed him.
<a name="n04164d" href="../../ff/fnbs/n04all.htm#n04164d">He had walked into a pond while intoxicated</a> up to that point where braced skirts meet knickerbockers. The helping hands of five had <a name="n01082f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01082f">rescued him from seven feet of semifresh water</a>.

On his postern had been nailed the title: <a name="n01048h" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01048h">Move up, Dumpty. Make room for Humpty!</a> and this time no mistake
<a name="n01049e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01049e">the boys</a> had done him in. Indeed several wellwishers went so far as <a name="n01048g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01048g">to buy</a> <a name="n01048g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01048g">copies of the evening editions just to make sure whether he was genuinely quite dead</a>.

<p> Therefore let it be neither said nor thought that the inhabitant of that sacred edifice was a parable merely nor more strictly H.C.E a nonens. Not one of his many contemporaries seriously doubted or for long of his legitimate existence.</p>
