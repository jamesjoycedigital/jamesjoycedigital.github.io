<p> <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Though</span></span> The <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">hilarious</span></span> hilariohoot of Pegger&apos;s Windup contrasted so neatly with the tristitone of the the wet pinter&apos;s as were they opposites, evolved by the powers of nature &amp; spirit as the sole means &amp; condition of its manifestation, polarised for reunion by
the symphysis of their antipathies. Distinctly different were their destinies.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 3v}</font> </p>
<p> While the maidies of the bar <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">clustered</span></span> fluttered &amp; flattered around the willingly pressed, complimenting him on having all his senses about him, sticking hyacinths in his <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">h</span></span> curls, &amp; bringing busses to his cheeks, legando round his nice new neck for him &amp;
pizzicando at his willywags it was not unobserved by <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the co</span></span> their worships that for one among all with unmixed admiration he seemed blindly, mutely, <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">hands over ears</span></span> speechlessly fascinated when she shining aminglement, the shay of his shifting into the shimmering of hers till the
wishwish of her shashay melted musically mid the deepdeep of his shayshaun.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 2v}</font> </p>
<p> The four judges Unchus, Munchus, Punchus and Pylax could no more than pass the usual sentence of Nolans Brumans &amp; King left his court trailing his tunic. On the Swiss bobbyguard&apos;s curial but courtly: Commodore valley O hairy Arthere jennyrosy?: the firewaterloover replied with such a fortytudor ages rowdawnham tanyouhide that all the advocatesses within echo pulling up their briefs
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">sock</span></span> <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">pa</span></span> <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">jus</span></span> simply &amp; safely soccered him imprumptu <a name="n18108l" href="../../FF/fnbs/n18all.htm#n18108l">rightaway</a> like like the muddy goalbird who he was, conclaiming: Hon! Verg!
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Putor!</span></span> Nau! Putor! Sham! Shames!

<p> So there you are they were, the four of them, sitting around their old tables of the law to talk it all over &amp; over again. Festy and hyacinth and gentian and o&apos;darnel, that was four of them and thank Court now there were no more of them. So pass the push for port sake. Be it now. And I knew his father behind the war of the two roses, before he got his dispensation from the poke, old
Minster York, &amp; the smell of him like the vitriol works of a windy day &amp; the rossies chaffing his redface. How do you do, North Mister? Get into my way! till they had him fit to be tried. Ah, dearo me <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">forsale</span></span> forsailorshe! Yerra, why&apos;d
<br><font color="green">{ms, 7v}</font>
<br> she heed that old gasometer &amp; his hooping coffin? Sure, I well remember him <a name="n16025i" href="../../FF/fnbs/n16all.htm#n16025i">H<sub><small>2</small></sub>CE<sub><small>3</small></sub></a> that&apos;d take your breath away. Gob, I knew him well meself too. Coming up the east end with his limelooking bags, Old Whitehorse with his painted voice. Gomorro,
<a name="n01075n" href="../../FF/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01075n">says he</a>, Lankyshy! <a name="n12221j" href="../../FF/fnbs/n12all.htm#n12221j">Bugger</a> ye! ses I. O, breezes west!

<br><font color="green">{ms, 8v}</font> </p>
<p> And so they went on, unquam &amp; nunquam &amp; linseed &amp; colic, about the whosebefore and the wheresafter &amp; all the scandalmonkers that used to be at that time living &amp; lying &amp; riding round <a name="n13151d" href="../../FF/fnbs/n13all.htm#n13151d">Nunsbelly</a> Square. And contradrinking themselves. <a name="n19178b" href="../../FF/fnbs/n19all.htm#n19178b">I differ</a> with
ye! Are you sure of that now? You&apos;re a liar, excuse me! I will not &amp; you&apos;re another! And Lully holding the breach of the peace for them. To give &amp; to take.
