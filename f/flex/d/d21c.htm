<p class="flush">Even should not the framing up of such fictions in the evidential order bring any truth to light in good time as fortuitously as some false setting of a starchart might (heaven helping) reveal the presence of an unknown being in chaos of space the soundest opinion now holds that by so playing possum our highest common ancestor most effectually saved his brush for posterity. Dogs
of all breeds were speaking with inter pronounced provincial accents, hot to run him, on a scent breasthigh keen for <a name="n01005f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01005f">the worry</a>, but from the good Friday he last was viewed pointing for home in his sevenmile rolltop boots a deaf fox&apos;s wisdom kept him safe in covert miraculously ravenfed and sustained by the creamclotted sherriness
of cinnamon syllabub. Preservative perseverance in the reeducation of his intestines was thus the rebuttal whereby he sort of got the big bulge on the whole bunch of spasoakers in that sometime onestreet town. Vainly virulence, violence &amp; vituperation sought wellnigh utterly to end the interregnum of the great shipping mogul and linen overlord.</p>
<p> And men murmured.</p>
<p> He had laid violent hands on himself, lain down, fagged out, with equally melancholy death. He had left this country <u>via</u> a
<br><font color="green">{ms, 35}</font>
<br> subterranean tunnel shored with bedboards. Peacefully general astonishment assisted by sorrow had put a term to his existence: he saw the <a name="n03099d" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03099d">soggarth</a>, resigned himself &amp; then was taken &amp; comforted by his Maker. An infamous private ailment (variolovenereal) had claimed him. He had walked into a pond while intoxicated up to the
point where braced shirts meet knickerbockers when ten helping hands had rescued him from seven feet of semifresh water. Aerials buzzed of finding a bloody antichill cloak, its tailor&apos;s tab reading V.P.H, and several shivered to think what manner of beast had devoured him. On his postern had been nailed a title: Move up, dumpty. Make room for humpty! and this go no mistake
<a name="n04152k" href="../../ff/fnbs/n04all.htm#n04152k">there had been real murder</a>, the boys it was that done him in. Indeed not a few thick &amp; thin wellwishers even went so far as to buy or loan copies of the evening editions, so as to make sure of his being genuinely quite dead. But on the morrow morn of the suicidal murder of the unrescued expatriate a quarter to nine o&apos;clock saw
the infallible spike of smoke plume punctual from the 7th gable and ten thirsty p.m., the lamps of maintenance being lighted for the long night, a suffusion of leadlight panes. Wherefore, let it be by hardly any thinking being either said or thought that the inhabitant of that sacred edifice was at his
<br><font color="green">{ms, 36}</font>
<br> best a parable merely or, more strictly, HCE a nonens, for not one of his contemporaries cared seriously or for long to doubt of his legitimate existence as a tesseract.</p>
<p> And women wondered.</p>
<p> Who, but who, was then the scourge of Lucalizod, it was wont to be asked, as in long ages behind where is Peabody&apos;s money and in periods more to the front who struck Buckley though every schoolgirl by now has learnt to know how it was Buckley who struck and the Russian general in place of Buckley who was struck when by himself by him. What fullpay poison spy or which hatefilled woman? And
that such vitriol of venom a quiet stamp could cover<a target="foot" id="fdz0009">&ordm;</a> The lounge lizards of the pumproom had their nine nights&apos; jeer. Still believing that <a name="n03133d" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03133d">the upper part of her</a> her face was the best part of her one nearer, dearer than all stood forth to crush the slander&apos;s head.
<a name="n06050l" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06050l">Would we vision her</a> (<a name="n06109b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06109b">subconscious editor</a>) with <a name="n06125h" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06125h">stereoptican relief</a>
<br><font color="green">{ms, 30}</font>
