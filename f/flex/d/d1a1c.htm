<p> It may be that with his deepseeing insight (had not wishing been but good time wasted) H.C.E. prayed all that time in silence with <a name="n03005a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03005a">unfeigned charity</a> that his wordwounder might become the first of a distinguished dynasty, his most cherished of all ideas being the formation, as in more favoured climes, of a truly criminal stratum,
thereby at last eliminating much general delinquency from all classes and masses.</p>
<p> The coffin was to come in handy later. This is <a name="n06118n" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06118n">the how of that</a>. A number of public bodies before voting themselves out of existence in a <a name="n03148g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03148g">watertight will</a> made him a present of a grave <a name="n03026f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03026f">in a fair state of repair</a>
<br><font color="green">{ms, 23}</font>
<br> wherein the remains of an epileptic were to have been laid to rest but which nobody had ever been able to dig much less occupy. This grave he blasted with a landmine exploded from a <a name="n03135c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03135c">bombingpost</a> of 1400 feet in his <a name="n03135a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03135a">aerial torpedo contacted with the expectant</a>
<a name="n03135b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03135b">minefield</a> <a name="n03135a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03135a">by tins of ammonia lashed to her sides fused to trip wires playing down into the ground battery fuseboxes</a> and then carefully lined the result with bricks and mortar, encouraging the same and other public bodies to present him over and above that with a stone slab.
Coffins, windingsheets, cinerary urns and any kind of funeral bric &agrave; brac would naturally follow in the ordinary course.</p>
<p> The other spring offensive may have come about all quite by accident. From both camps (granted at once for the sake of argument that men on both sides had grand ideas) all conditions were drawn into the conflict, some for lack of proper feeding, others already caught in the act of carving honourable careers for self and family, and, if emaciated, the person garotted may have suggested
incarnate whiggery or even the grand old whig himself in the flesh, when falsesighted by the wouldbe burglar, a tory of the tories, for there then circulated pretty freely the feeling that in so hibernating Earwicker was secretly feeding on his own <a name="n03154d" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03154d">misplaced</a> fat.</p>
<p> Kate Strong, a widow, did all the scavenging from good King Charles golden days down
<br><font color="green">{ms, 24}</font>
<br> but she cleaned only sparingly and her statement was that, there being no macadamised sidewalks in those R.I.C. days barring a footpath which left off where the man was struck, she left, as scavengers will, a filth dump near the dogpond in the park, all over which fossil<a target="foot" id="fdz0002">&ordm;</a> bootmarks, fingerprints, elbowdints, kneecaves, breechbowls were all successively
found of a very involved description. It was on this resurfaced spot evidently that the attacker, though under medium, with truly native pluck tackled him whom he took to be somebody else to whom he bore some facial resemblance, making use of sacrilegious language to the effect that he would have his life and lay him out at the same time catching hold of a long bar he had and with which he usually
broke furniture. They struggled for some considerable time and in the course of it the masked man said to the other: Let me go, Pat. I hardly knew you. Later on the same man asked: Was six pounds fifteen in round figures taken off you, <a name="n03113e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03113e">tell us</a>, by anyone 3 or 4 months ago? There was some further severe mauling and then a wooden affair
in the shape of a revolver fell from the intruder who thereupon became friendly and wanted to know
<br><font color="green">{ms, 25}</font>
<br> whether his chance companion who still had the fender happened to have the loose change of a ten pound note about him at the moment as, if so, he would pay the six pounds odd out of that for what was taken on him on last July. To this the other then said: Would you be very surprised to learn that I honestly have not such a thing as the loose change of a ten pound note about me at the present
moment but I believe I can see my way to advance you about four and sevenpence between bopping<a target="foot" id="fdz0003">&ordm;</a> and trotting to buy whisky. At the mention of whisky the <a name="n01036h" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01036h">gunman</a> became calm said he would go good to him some day and remarking, apparently much more highly pleased than he could tell: You stunning
little Southdowner! Goalball I&apos;ve struck this day, <a name="n03052e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03052e">by golly</a>! You have some <a name="n03117d" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03117d">bully</a> German grit, Southdowner! he went off with the four and seven and the hurlbat, picked up, while the man left behind with the fender, who bore up wonderfully under all of it with a number of
plumsized bruises on him, reported the occurrence at the watch house in Vicar street, his face all covered with nonfatal mammalian blood as good proof of his serious character and that he was bleeding from the nose, mouth and two ears while some of his hair had been pulled off his head though otherwise his
<br><font color="green">{ms, 26}</font>
<br> allround health was middling enough. Now coming on to the question of unlawfully obtaining pierced fender and fireguard crops up like a shot the far more capital point of political bias of a person who, when mistakenly ambushed, was simply exercising one of the most primary liberties of the subject by walking along a public thoroughfare in broad daylight.</p>
<p> As if that was not enough for anybody but little headway was made when a countryman, Festy King, who gave an address in Joyce&apos;s country in the heart of a wellfamed poteen district, was subsequently brought up on an improperly framed indictment of both counts. It was attempted to show that King rubbed some dirt on his face as the best means of disguising himself and was at the fair of a
Monday <a name="n07a01l" href="../../ff/fnbs/n07all.htm#n07a01l">attended by large numbers</a> with a pig when the animal ate some of the doorpost, King selling it because she ate a lot of the woodwork of her sty in order to pay off arrears of rent. An eyewitness said he personally was <a name="n05010i" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05010i">pleased to</a> remember the fifth of November which was
going to go down in the annals of history and that one thing
<br><font color="green">{ms, 27}</font>
<br> which particularly struck a person of his observational powers was that he saw or heard Pat O&apos;Donnell beat and murder another two of the Kings, Simon &amp; Peter, between whom <a name="n07a01m" href="../../ff/fnbs/n07all.htm#n07a01m">bad blood</a> existed but it turned out in crossexamination that where the ambush was laid there was not as much light as would dim a child&apos;s altar and
to the perplexedly uncondemnatory bench the first King of all, Festy, as soon as the <a name="n03053b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03053b">outer layer of dirt was removed</a> at the request of the jury declared through his interpreter on his oath and before God and all their honours that he did not fire a stone either before or after he was born up to that day and this he had the neck to
supplement in the same language by postasserting that he would impart that he might never ask to see sight or light of this world or the next world or any other world if ever he up with a hand to take or throw the sign of a stone at man, sheep or salvation army either before or after being baptised down to that most holy and blessed hour.</p> </p>  </main>
