<p> The coffin was to come in handy later &amp; in this way.

<p> <a name="n06128h" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06128h">This he blasted and carefully
<br><font color="green">{ms, 8}</font>
<br> lined the result with bricks &amp; mortar, encouraging the public bodies to present him over &amp; above that with a stone slab.</a></p>

<a name="n06080c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06080c">men on both sides had grand ideas</a>.
