gunwale and fused into tripup cables, slipping through tholes and playing down from the conning tower into the ground battery fuseboxes, all differing as clocks from keys since nobody appeared to have the same time of beard, some saying it was Sygstrygg&apos;s to nine, more holding it was Dane to pfife. He afterwards carefully lined the ferroconcrete result with rotproof bricks and mortar, fassed

<p> The other spring offensive on the heights of Abraham may have come about all quite by accident.

<p> Yes, it was hard by the howe goes there, plainly on this disoluded spot, rupestric then, resurfaced that now is, in the saddle of Brennan&apos;s pass, versts and versts from true civilisation, where livland yontide meared with the wilde, saltlea with flood, that the attackler, though under medium, with truly native pluck engaged the Adversary whom, for plunder sake, he mistook in the heavy
rain to be Oglethorpe or somebody else to whom he bore some michelangiolesque resemblance, making use of sacrilegious languages to the effect that he would cannonise the b&mdash;y b&mdash;r&apos;s life out of him and lay him out contritely as soon as the b&mdash;r had his b&mdash;y nightprayers said, at the same time catching holst of an oblong bar he had and with which he usually broke furnitures

The gathering, convened by the Irish Angricultural and Prepostoral Ouraganisations to help the Irish muck to look his brother dane in the face, and attended by large numbers, tospite of the deluge, was distinctly of a scattery kind when the ballybricken ate some of the doorweg,
King later selling the gentleman ratepayer because she ate a whole side of her (the animal&apos;s) sty, <i>Qui Sta Troia</i>, in order to pay off six doubloons fifteen arrears of his, the villain&apos;s not the rumbler&apos;s, rent. Remarkable evidence was given, anon, by an eye, ear, nose and throat witness, W&mdash; P&mdash;, who, upon letting down his rice and peacegreen coverdisk, smiled and

was that he was patrified to see, hear, taste and smell on Struggle Street as his time of night how Hyacinth O&apos;Donnell, B.A., described in the calendar as a mixer and wordpainter, with part of a sivispacem (Gaeltact for dungfork) on the fair green at twentyfour o&apos;clock sought to sack, sock, stab and slaughter singlehanded another two of the old kings, Gash MacGale and Roaring

Whether he was practically sure too of his names in this king and blousyman business? That he was pediculously so. It was Morbus O&apos;Somebody? A&apos;quite. And how did he arrive at the

And with a stopper head, bottle shoulders, a barrel belly and tumblerous legs? The very man! Rooskayman? Sooner Gallwegian he would say. Not unintoxicated, fair witness? Drunk as a fishup.

<p> The hilariohoot of Pegger&apos;s Windup cumjostled as neatly with the tristitone of the Wet Pinter&apos;s as were they, <i>isce et ille</i>, equals of opposites, evolved by a onesame power of nature or of spirit, <i>iste</i>, as the sole condition and means of its himundher manifestation and polarised for reunion by the symphysis of their antipathies.

<br> their standing verdict of Nolans Brumans whereonafter King, having murdered all the English he knew, left the tribunal scotfree, trailing his tunic in his hurry, thereinunder proudly showing off the blink patch to his britgits to prove himself a real gentleman.

<p> And so it all ended. And so everybody heard their complaint and all listened to their plause. Wind broke it. Wave bore it. Reed wrote of it. Syce ran with it. Hand tore it and wild went war. Hen trieved it and plight pledged peace. It was folded with cunning, sealed with crime, uptied by a harlot, undone by a child. It was life but was it fair? It was free but was it art?

<p> Well, even should not the framing up of such figments in the evidential order bring the true truth to light as fortuitously as a dimseer&apos;s setting of a starchart might (heaven helping it!) uncover the nakedness of an unknown body in the fields of blue or as forehearingly as the sibspeeches of all mankind have foliated (earth seizing them!) from the root of somefunner&apos;s stotter, all

Ear canny hare for doubling, through Cheeverstown they raced him, through Loughlinstown and Nutstown to wind
him by the Boolies. But from the good turn when he last was lost, check, upon Ye Hill of Rut in full winter coat with ticker pads, pointing for his rooming house in his rolltoproyal hessians, a deaf fox&apos;s volponism hid him close in covert, miraculously ravenfed and buoyed up, in rumer, reticule, onasum and abomasum, upon (may Allbrewham have his mead!) the creamclotted sherriness of cinnamon
syllabub. Hence hounds hied home. Preservative perseverance in the reeducation of his intestines was thus the rebuttal by whilk he sort of git the big bulge on the whole bunch of spasoakers in that sometime prestreet protown. Vainly violence, virulence and vituperation sought wellnigh utterly to attax and abridge, to derail and depontify, to enrate and inroad, to ongoad and unhume the great
shipping mogul and underlinen overlord.</p>
<p> Assemblymen murmured. Reynard is slow!</p>
<p> One feared for his days. He had laid violent hands on himself, it was brought in Fugger&apos;s Newsletter, lain down, all in, fagged out, with equally melancholy death. Big went the bang: then wildewide was quiet: a report: silence: last Fama put it under ether. The noase or the loal had dreven him blem, blem, stun blem. Sparks flew. He had fled again (open shunshema!) this country of exile,
sloughed off home <i>via</i> the subterranean tunnel shored with bedboards, stowed away in a dutch bottom, <i>tunk</i> the Arsa, <i>hod</i> S.S. Finlandia, and was even now occupying, in his seventh generation, a physical body, Cornelius Magrath&apos;s, in Asia Major. Wires hummed. Peacefully general astonishment assisted by regrettitude had put a term till his existence: he saw the family
saggarth, resigned himself, put off his remainders, was recalled and scrapheaped by the Maker. Chirpings crossed. An infamous private ailment (vulgovariovenereal) had claimed endright, closed his vicious circle, snap. Jams jarred. He had walked towards the middle of an ornamental lilypond when innebriated up to the point where braced shirts meet knickerbockers when rodmen&apos;s firstaiding hands
had rescued un from very possibly several feet of demifrish water. Mush spread. On Umbrella Street a kind workman, Mr Whitlock, gave him a piece of his wood. Cracklings crickled. A human pest cycling (pist!) and recycling (past!) about the sledgy streets of the gardencity, here he was (pust!) again! He was loose at large and might be anywhere. Morse nuisance noised when a disguised nun of huge
build and masculine manners, Mother Gygasta, hattracted hattention in a hominibuzz. Aerials bizzed to coastal listeners of an eartax collector&apos;s budget and bloody antichill

<br> cloak, its tailor&apos;s (Baernfather&apos;s) tab reading V.P.H., found nigh Scaldbrothar&apos;s Hole, and divers shivered to think what manner of beast, wolves, croppies or fourpenny friars had devoured him. C.W. cast wide. On his postern, the boys had it, at Whitweekend had been nailed an inkedup title, inscribed in the national cursives, accelerated, regressive, filiform, turreted, and
envemoloped in piggotry: Move up, Mumpty! Mike room for Rumpty! By order, Nickellous Plugg! And this go, no pentecostal jest about it, there had been real murder: the MacMahon boys, it was, that had done him in. Indeed not a few thick and thin wellwishers even ventured so far as to loan or beg copies of the trilingual triweekly, <i>Scatterbrains&apos; Aftening Posht</i>, so as to make certain sure
onetime and be satisfied of his having become genuinely quite
<br><font color="green">{f39, 100}</font>

<p> But, their bright little contemporaries notwithstanding, on the morrowing morn of the suicidal murder of the unrescued expatriate a quarter of nine, imploring his resipiency, saw the infallible spike of smoke jutstiff punctual from the seventh gable of his buttertower and ten thirsty p.m., with oaths upon his lastingness, the lamps of maintenance, innerhalb the ziggurat, all brevetnamed, the
wasting wyvern, the tawny of his mane, the swinglowswaying bluepaw brors, the outstanding man, the lolllike lady, being litten for the long (O

<br> laud, how long!) lifesnight, a suffusion of transom and leadlight panes. Wherefore let it hardly by any being thinking be said either or thought that the prisoner of that sacred edifice, were he an Ivor the Boneless or an Olaf the Hvide, was at his best a onestone parable, a rude breathing on the void of to be, or, more strictly, but tristurned initials, the cluekey to a worldroom beyond the
roomwhorld; for scarce one, or pathetically few, of his contemporaries cared seriously or for long to doubt the canonicity of his existence as a tesseract.
