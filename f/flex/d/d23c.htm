<p class="flush">Even should not the framing up of such fiction in the evidential order bring any truth to light in good time as fortuitously as some false setting of a starchart might (heaven helping it) uncover the presence of an unknown body in chaos of space the soundest opinion now holds that by so playing possum our hagious curious ancestor most effectually saved his brush for posterity.
<a name="n01047j" href="../../FF/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01047j">Gun</a>dogs of all breeds were speaking with pronounced interprovincial accents, hot to run him on a scent breasthigh, keen for the worry. From Mullinahob &amp; Peacockstown, then bearing R upon Tankardstown, the <a name="n26023c" href="../../FF/fnbs/n26all.htm#n26023c">outlier</a>, which some had almost
<a name="n26023b" href="../../FF/fnbs/n26all.htm#n26023b">mistaken for a bear</a>, led them a chace &amp; thence thro Raystown &amp; Harlockstown to Tankardstown again. A very hare for doubling to Cheeverstown they raced him, through Loughlinstown and Nutstown to wind him by the Boolies. but from the good view when he last was lost in full coat and ticker pads upon ye hill of Rut pointing for his
<a name="n14208d" href="../../FF/fnbs/n14all.htm#n14208d">rooming house</a> in his sevenmile rolltop boots a deaf fox&apos;s volponism kept him safe in covert, miraculously ravenfed and buoyed up in <a name="n22a07g" href="../../FF/fnbs/n22all.htm#n22a07g">rumer</a>, <a name="n22a07h" href="../../FF/fnbs/n22all.htm#n22a07h">reticule</a>,

Hence <a name="n26023d" href="../../FF/fnbs/n26all.htm#n26023d">hounds hied home</a>. Preservative perseverance in the reeducation of his intestines was thus the rebuttal whereby he sort of got the
big bulge on the whole bunch of spasoakers in that sometime one<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps"><sub>unread</sub></span></font>street pretown. Vainly virulence, violence and vituperation sought wellnigh utterly to end the interregnum of the great shipping mogul and underlinen overlord.</p>
<p> And <a name="n22012f" href="../../FF/fnbs/n22all.htm#n22012f">assemblymen</a> murmured. Reynard, is slow!</p>
<p> One <a name="n09159d" href="../../FF/fnbs/n09all.htm#n09159d">feared for his days</a>. He had laid violent hands on himself, it was brought in <u>Fugger&apos;s Newsletter</u>, lain down, all in, fagged out,<a target="foot" id="fdz0016">&ordm;</a> with equally melancholy death. Big went the bang: then wildwide was quiet: his posteri followed his posteriors to all postremity all he missed! A
report: Silence: then Fama <a name="n22074f" href="../../FF/fnbs/n22all.htm#n22074f">put it</a> under ether. <a name="n11092b" href="../../FF/fnbs/n11all.htm#n11092b">The noise or the lull had driven him</a> blem blem, stone blem. <a name="n23110c" href="../../FF/fnbs/n23all.htm#n23110c">Sparks</a> flew. He had fled again (open shunshema!) this country of exile sloughed off home <u>via</u> a
subterranean tunnel shored with bedboards stowed in a Dutch bottom and was <a name="n23043i" href="../../FF/fnbs/n23all.htm#n23043i">now occupying a physical body in <font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font></a>. Peacefully general astonishment assisted by sorrow had put a term to his existence: he saw the soggarth, resigned himself,
<a name="n14214m" href="../../FF/fnbs/n14all.htm#n14214m">put off his body</a>, was taken and comforted by his Maker. <a name="n23109j" href="../../FF/fnbs/n23all.htm#n23109j">Chirpings</a> crossed. An infamous private ailment (vulgovariovenereal) had claimed him, closed his vicious circle, snap. He had walked into <a name="n23038b" href="../../FF/fnbs/n23all.htm#n23038b">the middle of an
ornamental</a> <a name="n22004n" href="../../FF/fnbs/n22all.htm#n22004n">lilypond</a> while intoxicated up to the point where braced shirts meet knickerbockers when <a name="n23042c" href="../../FF/fnbs/n23all.htm#n23042c">rodmen&apos;s</a> firstaiding hands had rescued him from very possibly seven feet of demifresh water. <a name="n23110e" href="../../FF/fnbs/n23all.htm#n23110e">Mush</a> spread.
On Umbrella Street a kind workman gave him a piece of wood. Cracklings crickled.

On his postern at Whitweekend had been nailed an inked up title, inscribed in the <a name="n12188l" href="../../FF/fnbs/n12all.htm#n12188l">national</a> <a name="n12188e" href="../../FF/fnbs/n12all.htm#n12188e">cursives</a>, accelerated regressive filiform &amp; turreted, and envemoned in piggotry:
Move up, Mumpty! Make room for Rumpty! By order, N: and this go, no pentecostal jest about it, there had been real murder, the boys it was that done him in. Indeed not a few thick and thin wellwishers even went so far as to buy or loan copies of the evening <a name="n08002j" href="../../FF/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08002j">triweeklies</a> so as to make sure of his having become genuinely quite dead by land
or by water. Transocean atalaclamoured him: The latter! The latter! He lay under <a name="n10036c" href="../../FF/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10036c">leagues</a> of it in <a name="n01038j" href="../../FF/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01038j">Bartholomew&apos;s Deep</a>. But on the morrow morn of the suicidal murder of the unrescued expatriate a quarter to nine o&apos;clock saw the infallible spike of smoke jutstiff

Wherefore let
it hardly by any thinking being be either said or thought that the prisoner of that sacred edifice was at his best a onestone parable merely like that <a name="n01034k" href="../../FF/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01034k">toucanbird which is shorter than &apos;s own beak</a>, a <a name="n23035k" href="../../FF/fnbs/n23all.htm#n23035k">rude breathing</a> on the deep of to be, or, more strictly, but tristurned
