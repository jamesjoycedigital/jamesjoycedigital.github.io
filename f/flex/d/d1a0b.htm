<p class="flush">With deepseeing insight he may have prayed in silence that his wordwounder might become the first of <a name="n06124f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06124f">a long dynasty</a>, his cherished idea being <a name="n06136b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06136b">the formation</a>, as in more favoured climes, <a name="n06136b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06136b">of a truly
criminal class</a>, thereby eliminating much general delinquency from all classes &amp; masses</p>
<p> The coffin was to come in handy later<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span> &amp; in this way. A number of <a name="n06120g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06120g">public bodies</a> <a name="n06128h" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06128h"><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">presented him</span></span> made him a present of a grave</a> which nobody had been
able to dig much less to occupy, <a name="n06128h" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06128h">it being all rock</a>.</p>
<p> <a name="n06128h" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06128h">This he blasted and <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">then</span></span> carefully
<br><font color="green">{ms, 8}</font>
<br> lined the result with bricks &amp; mortar, encouraging the public bodies to present him over &amp; above that with a stone slab.</a></p>
<p> The other <a name="n06117g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06117g">spring offensive</a> seems to have been <a name="n06100f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06100f">all quite by accident</a>,. All conditions were drawn into the conflict, some for <a name="n06099l" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06099l">lack of proper feeding</a>, others already

the wouldbe burglar, a tory of the tories<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span>, for there circulated
<br><font color="green">{ms, 17}</font>
<br> pretty <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">clearl</span></span> freely the feeling that in so <a name="n09042i" href="../../ff/fnbs/n09all.htm#n09042i">hibernating</a> Earwicker was <a name="n05176h" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05176h">feeding on his own fat</a>. <a name="n06145g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06145g">Kate Strong, a widow,</a> did all the
<a name="n06145h" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06145h">scavenging <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">in</span></span> from good King Charles&apos; days</a> <a name="n06145i" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06145i">but she cleaned sparingly</a> and her statement was that, there being <a name="n06145l" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06145l">no</a>
<a name="n06145l" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06145l">footpaths</a> at the time she left a <a name="n06164a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06164a">filth dump</a> near <a name="n07a01a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n07all.htm#n07a01a">the dogpond in the park</a> on which boot &amp; fingerprints were found <a name="n06144g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06144g">of a very involved description</a>.
There evidently the attacker, though under medium, with <a name="n06090c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06090c">truly native pluck</a> tackled him whom he took to be <font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font> <a name="n06166c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06166c">catching hold of a long bar he had &amp; with which he broke furniture</a>.
<a name="n06166a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06166a">The struggle went on for a considerable time and in the course of it the masked man said to the other:</a> <a name="n06167a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06167a">Let me go, Pat.</a> <a name="n06166a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06166a">Later on the same man asked: Was six pounds fifteen taken from you by anyone two or three months
ago?</a> There was severe mauling and then <a name="n06167b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06167b">a wooden affair</a> in the shape of a <a name="n01017g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01017g">revolver</a> <a name="n06166d" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06166d">fell from the intruder who thereupon became friendly &amp; wanted to know whether</a> his chance companion who had the fender
<a name="n06166d" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06166d">happened to have the change of a ten pound note because, if so, he would pay the six pounds odd out of that for what
<br><font color="green">{ms, 18}</font>
<br> lost last summer.</a> The other then said: <a name="n06168f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06168f">Would you be surprised to hear</a> that I have not such a thing but I am able to <a name="n06168l" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06168l">give you</a> <a name="n06168l" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06168l">four and 7 pence to buy whisky. At the mention of whisky the wouldbe burglar became
calm</a> and left the place while the fenderite reported the occurrence, <a name="n06166e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06166e">his face being all covered with</a> <a name="n06166e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06166e">blood as a</a> <a name="n06088c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06088c">proof</a> <a name="n06166e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06166e">that he was bleeding from the
nose, mouth &amp; ears while some of his hair had been pulled off his head though otherwise his health was good enough.</a> As regards the fender the question of <a name="n06168j" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06168j">unlawfully obtaining</a> is subsidiary to the far more capital point of the political bias of a person who, when mistakenly molested, was simply
<a name="n06066g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06066g">exercising one of the most primary liberties of the subject by walking along a public thoroughfare in broad daylight</a>.</p>
<p> As if that would not do a countryman <a name="n06049f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06049f">Festy King</a> who gave an address in Monaghan was subsequently brought up on <a name="n06048a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06048a">an improper indictment</a> of <a name="n06048b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06048b">both counts</a>. It was attempted to show that having come to

ate the woodwork</a> of <a name="n06048e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06048e">her sty</a>. An eyewitness said <a name="n06049c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06049c">he saw</a> or heard a man named <a name="n06049c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06049c">Pat O&apos;Donnell beat</a> <a name="n06049c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06049c">another of the Kings, Simon,</a> but where the
ambush was laid there was <a name="n06048h" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06048h">not as much light as wd light a child&apos;s altar</a> and to the perplexedly uncondemnatory bench, the first <a name="n06049f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06049f">King</a>, <a name="n06049f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06049f">Festy</a>, declared <a name="n06049a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06049a">on
his oath <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">&amp;</span></span> before God &amp; their honours that he did not fire a stone either before or after he was born up to that day</a> &amp; this he supplemented in the same language by postasserting that he might never see sight or light of this world or the next <a name="n06049b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06049b">if ever he took or
threw the sign of a stone either before or after being baptised up to that blessed hour</a>.</p> </p>  </main>
