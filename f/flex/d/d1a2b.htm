<p> It may be that with his deepseeing insight (had not wishing often been but good time wasted) H.C.E. prayed all through that three and a half hour&apos;s agony in silence with unfeigned charity that his wordwounder might unfold into the first of a distinguished dynasty, his most cherished of ideas being the formation, as in more favoured climes, of a truly criminal stratum, thereby at last
eliminating much general delinquency from all classes and masses.</p>
<p> The coffin was to turn in handy later. This is the how of that. A number of public bodies, before voting themselves once for all out of existence, made him a present of a grave in a fair state of repair wherein the remains of an epileptic were to have been laid to rest as soon as he was regarded as dead but which nobody living had ever been man enough to dig still less occupy.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 133}</font>
<br> This grave he openly blasted by means of a landmine exploded from a bombingpost of fourteen hundred feet in his aerial torpedo contacted with the expectant minefield by tins of ammonia lashed to her sides and fused into tripup wires playing down into the ground battery fuseboxes and afterwards carefully lined the result with bricks and mortar, so encouraging
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the</span></span> other useful public bodies to present him over and above that with a stone slab. Coffins, windingsheets, cinerary urns and for that matter any kind of funeral bric &agrave; brac would naturally follow in the ordinary course.</p>
<p> The other spring offensive may have come about all quite by accident. From both camps (granted at the outset for the sake of argument that men on both sides had grand ideas) all conditions were drawn into the conflict, some for lack of proper feeding, others already caught in the act of carving honourable careers for self and family, and, if emaciated enough, the person garotted may have
suggested incarnate whiggery, nay, even the grand old whig himself in the flesh<a target="foot" id="fdz0004">&ordm;</a> when falsesighted by the wouldbe burglar, a tory of the tories, <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">fore</span></span> for there circulated fairly freely the feeling that in so hibernating Earwicker was secretly feeding on his own misplaced fat.</p>
<p> Kate Strong, a widow, did all the scavenging
<br><font color="green">{ms, 134}</font>
<br> from good King Charles&apos; golden days onwards but she cleaned but sparingly and her bare statement reads that, there being no macadamised sidewalks in those old R.I.C. days barring a footpath which left off where the plaintiff was struck, she left, as scavengers who will be scavengers will, a filthdump near the dogpond in Phoenix park<a target="foot" id="fdz0005">&ordm;</a> all over which
fossil footprints, bootmarks, fingersigns, elbowdints, kneecaves, breechbowls were all successively traced of a very involved description. It was on this resurfaced spot plainly that the attacker, though under medium, with truly native pluck tackled him whom he mistook to be somebody else to whom he bore some facial resemblance, making use of sacrilegious language to the effect that he would have
his life and lay him out at the same time catching hold of a long bar he had and with which he usually broke furniture. They struggled for some considerable time and in the course of it the masked man said to the other: Let me go, Pat, I hardly knew you. Later on the same man asked: Was six pounds fifteen in round numbers taken off you, tell us, by anyone 3 or 4 months ago? There was some further
severe mauling and a wooden affair in the shape of a Wembley fell from the intruder who thereupon became friendly and wanted to know if
<br><font color="green">{ms, 135}</font>
<br> his chance companion,who still had the fender, happened to have the loose change of a ten pound note about him at the moment as, if so, he would pay the six pounds odd back out of that for what was taken on him on last July. To this the other replied: Would you be greatly surprised to learn that as it so happens I honestly have not such a thing as the loose change of a tenpound anywhere about
me for the present moment but I believe I can see my way to advance you something like four and sevenpence between hopping and trotting to buy whisky. At the mention of whisky the gunman became strangely calm and said he would go good to him some day yet and remarking, apparently much more highly pleased than tongue could tell: You stunning little Southdowner! Goalball I&apos;ve struck this day of
days, by golly! You have some bully German grit, Southdowner!: he went off with the four and seven and the hurlbat, picked up, while the man left behind along with the fender, who bore up wonderfully under all of it with a number of plumsized bruises all over him, reported the occurrence <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">to</span></span> at the watch house in Vicar street, his face all
covered with nonfatal mammalian blood as proof positive of the seriousness of his character and that he
<br><font color="green">{ms, 136}</font>
<br> was bleeding from the nose, mouth and two ears while some of his hair had been pulled off his head though otherwise his allround health appeared to be middling enough.</p>
<p> Now coming on gradually to the question of unlawfully obtaining a pierced fender and fireguard there crops up the far more salient point of the political leanings of a person who, when mistakenly ambushed, was solely exercising one of the most primary liberties of the subject by walking along one of our public thoroughfares in the broadest of daylight.</p>
<p> As if that were not to be enough for anybody but little headway, if any, was made when a countryman, Festy King, who gave an address in Joyce&apos;s country in the heart of a wellfamed poteen district, was subsequently brought up on an improperly framed indictment of both the counts. It was attempted to show that King rubbed some dirt on his face as the best means of disguising himself and was
at the fair of a Monday attended by large numbers with a pig when the animal ate some of the doorpost, King selling it because she ate a whole lot of the woodwork of her sty in order to pay off six pounds fifteen arrears of rent. an eyewitness stated that he<a target="foot" id="fdz0006">&ordm;</a> was pleased to remember the fifth
<br><font color="green">{ms, 137}</font>
<br> of November which was going to go down in the annals of history and that one thing which particularly struck a person of his trained observational powers was that he saw or heard Pat O&apos;Donnell beat and murder singlehanded <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Simon and</span></span> another two of the Kings, Simon and Peter, between whom bad blood existed but it oozed out in
crossexamination that where the ambush was laid there was not as much light as would dim a child&apos;s altar and to the perplexedly uncondemnatory bench, the first King of all, Festy, as soon as the outer layer of dirt had been removed at the request of the jury, declared through his interpreter on his oath and before God and all their honours that he did not fire a stone either before or after
he was born up to that day and this he had the neck to supplement by postasserting in the same language what he would impart that he might never ask to see sight or light of this world or the next world or any other world if ever he up with a hand to take or throw the sign of a mortal stone at man, ewe or salvation army either before or after being baptised down to that most holy and blessed
hour.</p> </p>  </main>
