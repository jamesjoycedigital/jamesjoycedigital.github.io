<p> of <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">his</span></span> Humphrey Coxon&apos;s <u>agnomen</u> the most authentic version has it that like Cincinnatus he was one day at his plough when <a name="sa0121ap" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0121ap">royalty</a> was announced on the highroad. Forgetful of all but his fealty he hastened out on to the road holding aloft a long
<a name="n04029f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n04all.htm#n04029f">perch atop of which a flowerpot was affixed</a>. On his majesty, who was rather longsighted from early youth, inquiring whether he had been engaged in <a name="n04029f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n04all.htm#n04029f">lobstertrapping</a> Humphrey bluntly answered: &apos;No, my liege, I was only a cotching of them bluggy earwigs&apos;. The king upon
this smiled heartily and, giving way to that none too genial humour which he had inherited from his great <a name="n03128e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03128e">aunt Sophy</a>, turned to two of his retinue the lord of Offaly |xhero in <font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">unread</span></font>|x* and the mayor of Waterford (the Syndic of Drogheda
<a name="n05142f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05142f">according to</a> a later version) remarking &apos; How our brother of Burgundy would fume did he know that he have this trusty vassal who is a turnpiker who is also an earwicker&apos;. <a name="n01029b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01029b">True facts</a> as this legend may be? it is certain that from that date all documents initialled by
Humphrey bear the sigla H.C.E. and while he was always Coxon for his cronies and good duke Humphrey for the ragged tiny folk of <a name="n01033f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01033f">Lucalizod</a> it was certainly a
<br><font color="green">{ms, 97v}</font>
<br> a pleasant turn of the populace which gave him as sense of these initials the nickname &apos;Here Comes Everything&apos;. Imposing enough indeed he looked and worthy of that title as he sat on gala nights in the royal booth with wardrobepanelled coat thrown back from a shirt wellnamed a swallowall far outstarching the laundered ladies and
<a name="sa0983ax" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0983ax">marbletopped highboys</a> of the pit. A baser meaning has been read into these letters, the literal sense of which decency <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">d<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps"><sub>unread</sub></span></font></span></span> can but touch. It has been suggested that he suffered from
<a name="sa0802l" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0802l">a vile disease</a>. To such a suggestion the only selfrespecting answer is to affirm that there are certain statements which ought not to be, and one would like to be able to add, ought not to be allowed to be made. Nor have his detractors mended their case by insinuating that he was at one time under the imputation of
<a name="sa0801cr" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0801cr">annoying soldiers</a> <a name="sa0801cs" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0801cs">in the park</a>. To anyone who knew and loved H- C- E- the suggestion is preposterous. Slander, let it do its worst, has never been able to convict that good and great man of any greater misdemeanour than that of an incautious exposure and partial at that
