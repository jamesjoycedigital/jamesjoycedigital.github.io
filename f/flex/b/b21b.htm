<p> Guiltless he was clearly for so once at least he clearly and with still a trace of his erstwhile burr declared himself to be and we know that it is true. They tell the story that one happy-go-gusty April morning long after the alleged misdemeanour when billowing across the wide expanse of our great park in his rubberised inverness he met a cad with a pipe. The latter hardily accosted him to
ask could he say how much o&apos;clock it was that the clock struck had he any idea. Earwicker, realising on fundamental principles the supreme importance of physical life and being unwishful of being sent into eternity <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">when</span></span> plugged by the sap&apos;s bullet, halted and, quick on the draw, produced from his gunpocket his shrapnel Waterbury
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">b</span></span> and, at the same instant hearing <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">old Fox Goodman</span></span> above the skirling of harsh Mother East old Fox Goodman working the tenor bell in the speckled church, told the cad it was twelve punctual, adding however, as he bent to give weight to the utterance that the accusation against
him had been made, as was well known in high quarters, by a creature in human form who was several degrees lower than a snake. In greater support of his words the flaxen giant tapped his chronometer and, now standing erect with one Berlin gauntlet pointed towards the duke&apos;s

<br> overgrown milestone solemnly averred: Credit me, my friend. I have won straight. Hence my nationwide business and I am prepared to take my stand upon the monument any hygienic day at this hour and to declare upon the open bible before the Great Taskmaster&apos;s eye and in the presence of the deity and my immediate neighbours and every living soul in every corner of the globe in general
acquainted with the British tongue that there is not one tittle of truth in that purest of fabrications. The cad, perceiving that he had to do with a plainly postpuberal hyperpituitary type, thanked for the time of day, not a little taken aback all the same that that was all the time it was, and repeated as many of the words as he could call to mind that same evening at his fireside where he spat
in museful thought after having eaten very excellent peas boiled with malt vinegar, a plateful he frankly relished in raw weather. The cad&apos;s wife (as the aftertale has it) spoke of the matter the next night but one after sodality meeting to the reverend, the director, a freshcomplexioned clergyman and it was he in all human probability who, when seized of the facts, was overheard by accident
&mdash; if indeed, it was an accident &mdash; repeating a slightly different version of the words to a layteacher of organic chemistry

<br> in the middle forties during a priestly flutter for safe and sane bets at the racecourse of Baldoyle on a date easily capable of remembrance by all good turfites when the Portmarnock Plate was captured by two lengths from Bold Boy Cromwell after a clever getaway by Captain Blount&apos;s fresh colt Drummer Coxon at short odds. It was two coves of the name of Treacle Tom and his own blood and
milk brother Frisky Shorty <a name="sa0983ap" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0983ap">come off</a> the hulks what was on the bum around for an oofbird game for a jimmyogoblin or a small thick as heard the reverend parson make use of the language which he was having a gurgle off his own along of the bloke in the specs. This Treacle Tom, to whom reference has just been made, had been absent from
his usual wild and woolly haunts for some time previous to that (he was, in fact, in the habit of frequenting common lodginghouses where he slept in a nude state in strange men&apos;s bunks) but revisiting on racenight his house of call he sought his wellwarmed bed at Block W, Pump square, The Liberties, he repeated the tale in parts more than once during uneasy slumber in the joint hearing of
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Peter</span></span> a discharged drapery executive Peter Cloran, O&apos;Donnell, a secretary of no fixed abode who had passed several nights in a doorway and Hosty, an illstarred busker who, feeling suicidal,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 7}</font>
<br> had been tossing on his shakedown devising ways and means of somehow getting a hold of some chap&apos;s parabellum in the hope of lighting upon a dive somewhere off the main tramline where he could go and blow the napper off himself in peace and quietness, he having been trying all he knew for over eighteen months to get into Jervis Street hospital without having been able to wangle it
anyway. O&apos;Donnell and Peter Cloran, as an understood thing, slept in the one bed with Hosty and the housewife dawn-of-all-work had not been very many hours furbishing potlids, <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">doorbar</span></span> doorbrasses, scholars&apos; applecheeks and livery metals when the rejuvenated busker and his bedroom suite were up and afoot crosstown to the
thrumming of a crewth fiddle and, after a visit to a publichouse not a thousand leagues from the site of Parnell&apos;s statue where, the tale runs on, the trio were joined by a further casual and a decent sort who had just pocketed the weekly insult and all had stimulants in the shape of five gee and gees stood by the decent sort after which all came out of the licensed premises wiping their
mouth on their sleeve <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">and</span></span>, the world was the richer for a new halfpenny ballad which was first sung under the shadow of the monument of the dead legislator to an overflow meeting fully filling the visional

<br> area and easily representative of all sections and <a name="n05078a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05078a">cross sections</a> of the Irish people ranging from slips of boys with pocketed hands and corporation bucket emergency men in search of an honest crust to busy professional gentlemen, massgoing ladies in their chairs and a few old souls obviously under the spell of liquor. Word
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">soon</span></span> went round and the ballad printed on a slip of blue paper headed by a rough woodcut soon fluttered on highway and byway to the rose of the winds from lane to lattice and from mouth to ear throughout the five corners of the land of Ireland. And around the land this rann it ran and this is the ran that Hosty made:</p> </p>  </main>
