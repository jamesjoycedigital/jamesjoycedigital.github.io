<p> Concerning the genesis of Harold or Humphrey Coxon&apos;s agnomen and discarding once &amp; for all those theories <a name="n03158g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03158g">from older sources</a> which would link him either with such <a name="n03092f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03092f">pivotal ancestors</a> as the Glues, Gravys &amp; Earwickers of Sidleham in the hundred of manhood or
proclaim him a descendant of vikings who had founded or settled in Herwick (?) or Erwick (?) the most authentic version has it that it was this way. We are told how it <a name="n05022b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05022b">came to pass</a> that like <a name="sa0982g" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0982g">cabbaging</a> Cincinnatus in

dogfox had cast. Forgetful of all but his vassal&apos;s <a name="sa0982ca" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0982ca">plain</a> fealty to the <a name="n03078d" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03078d">ethnarch</a>, Humphrey or Harold stayed not to yoke or saddle but stumbled out hotface as he was (his sweatful bandana loose from his pocketcoat) to the forecourts of his public in

<a name="n05025a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05025a">what had caused the causeway to be so potholed</a>, asking <a name="n03118e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03118e">to be put wise</a> whether <a name="n04031a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n04all.htm#n04031a">paternoster</a> were not now more fancied <a name="n04031a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n04all.htm#n04031a">bait</a> for lobstertrapping honest

question</a> Are these the facts as recorded in both or either of these andrewpomurphyc narratives? We shall perhaps not so soon see. <a name="n03124f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03124f">The great fact remains</a> that after that historic date all <a name="sa0851bv" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0851bv">holographs</a> initialled by Haromphrey bear the sigla H.C.E and while he was long and

highboys of the pit stalls and early gallery. A baser meaning has been read into these letters the literal sense of which decency can safely only hint. It has been <a name="sa0803ci" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0803ci">bruited</a> by certain <a name="sa0983bu" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0983bu">wisecracks</a> that he suffered from a vile disease. To such a suggestion the one
selfrespecting answer is to affirm that there are certain statements which ought not to be, and one would like to be able to add, ought not to be allowed to be made.
