<p> Concerning the genesis of Harold or Humphrey Coxon&apos;s agnomen and discarding finally those theories which would link him either with the Glues, Gravys &amp; Earwickers of Sidleham in the hundred of manhood or proclaim him a descendant of vikings who had founded or settled in Herwick (?) or Erwick (?) the most authentic version has it that it was this way. Like Cincinnatus the grand old
gardener was one sabbath afternoon following his plough for rootles in the rear garden of his royal marine hotel when royalty was announced by runner to have been pleased to halt on the highroad along which a dogfox had cast. Forgetful of all but <a name="sa0982ca" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0982ca">plain</a> fealty, Harold or Humphrey stayed not to yoke or saddle but stumbled out hotface as
he was (his sweatful bandana loose from his pocketcoat) to his forecourts in surcingle, plusfours and bulldog boots coated with red marl jingling his turnpike keys and holding aloft amid the fixed pikes of the hunting party a high perch atop of which a flowerpot was fixed wrongside up. On his majesty, who was noticeably longsighted from early youth inquiring whether he had not been engaged in
lobstertrapping honest blunt Harompheyld answered very similarly: No, majesty, I was just a cotchin of them bluggy earwigs. The king, who held a draught of obvious water in his hand, upon this smiled very heartily beneath his walrus moustaches and, giving way to that none too genial humour which William the Conk had inherited from his great aunt Sophy, turned towards two of his retinue, the lord
of Leix in Offaly and the mayor of Waterford (the second gun being the syndic of Drogheda according to a later version cited by the learned Kanavan) and remarked: Holybones, how our brother of Berengaria would fume did he know that we<a target="foot" id="fbz0003">&ordm;</a> have for trusty vassal a turnpiker who is also an earwicker. Are these the facts as recorded in both or either of these
versions? We shall perhaps not see. But it is certain that after that historic date all documents initialled by Haromphrey bear the sigla H.C.E and while he was long and always good duke Humphrey for the ragged spalpeens of Lucalizod and Cox to his cronies it was as certainly a pleasant turn of the populace which gave him as sense of those letters the nickname Here Comes Everybody. An imposing
everybody he always
<br><font color="green">{ms, 98v}</font>
<br> indeed looked every time he surveyed the entire playhouse on all gala nights from his <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">royal</span></span> viceregal booth where he sat with all his house about him with the invariable broadstretched kerchief cooling his neck and shoulders and in a wardrobepanelled tuxedo thrown back from a shirt wellnamed a swallowall in every way altogether
outstarching the laundered clawhammers and marbletopped highboys of the pit stalls and early gallery. A baser meaning has been read into these letters the literal sense of which decency can safely only hint. It has been <a name="sa0803ci" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0803ci">bruited</a> that he suffered from a vile disease. To such a suggestion the one selfrespecting answer is to affirm that
there are certain statements which ought not to be, and one would like to be able to add, ought not to be allowed to be made. Nor have his detractors, who, an imperfectly warmblooded race, apparently conceive him as capable of any and every enormity recorded to the discredit of the Juke and Kellikek families mended their case by insinuating that, if not, he was at one time under the ludicrous
imputation of annoying soldiers in the park. To anyone who knew and loved H.C. Earwicker the suggestion sounds preposterous. <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Slander, let it lie its</span></span> worst, There was some case of the kind, it is believed, implicating a man named Lyons who was posted at Mallon&apos;s and years afterwards dropped dead whilst waiting for a chop in Hawkins
street. But slander, let it lie its flattest, has never been able to convict that good and <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">man</span></span> Earwicker of any graver impropriety than that of having behaved in ungentlemanly manner opposite a pair of maidservants in the rushy hollow whither, nature, as they alleged, had spontaneously and at the same time sent them both but whose
combinations of testimonies are, if not dubiously pure, <a name="n03068d" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03068d">visibly</a> divergent on minor points touching what was admittedly an incautious but, at its most, a partial exposure with attenuating circumstances of an abnormal S. Martin&apos;s summer to provoke it.</p> </p>  </main>
