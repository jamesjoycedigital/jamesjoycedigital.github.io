<p> Guiltless he was clearly for so once at least he clearly and with still a trace of his erstwhile burr declared himself to be and we know that it is true. They tell the story that one happy-go-gusty April morning (the anniversary, as it so happened, of his first donning of long trousers) long after the alleged misdemeanour when the tried
<a name="sa0121c" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0121c">friend of nature</a> billowing across the wide expanse of our great park in his rubberised inverness he met a cad with a pipe. The latter hardily accosted him <a name="sa0803bo" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0803bo">with how do you do (a common phrase in Dublin at the time)</a> to ask could he say how much o&apos;clock it was that the
clock struck had he any idea. Earwicker, realising on fundamental principles the supreme importance of physical life and unwishful as he was of being sent into eternity plugged by a <a name="sa0984ax" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0984ax">softnosed</a> bullet from the sap, halted and, quick on the draw, produced from his gunpocket his shrapnel Waterbury land, at the same instant hearing above
the skirling of harsh Mother East old Fox Goodman working the tenor bell in the speckled church, told the cad it was twelve punctual, adding however, as he bent down to give weight to the utterance that the accusation against him had been made, as was well known in high quarters, by a creature in human form who was several degrees lower than a snake. In greater support of his words (they have been
reconstructed from successive accounts in the redaction known as the <a name="n06125e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06125e">Sayings of H.C. Earwicker</a>) the flaxen giant tapped his chronometer and, now standing erect with one Berlin gauntlet pointed towards the duke&apos;s

Hence my nationwide business and I am willing to take my stand upon the monument that <a name="n04164l" href="../../ff/fnbs/n04all.htm#n04164l">sign of our redemption</a> any hygienic day at this hour and to declare upon the open bible before the Great Taskmaster&apos;s eye and
in the presence of the deity <a name="n04167a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n04all.htm#n04167a">Itself</a> and my immediate neighbours and every living soul in every corner <a name="n06119b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06119b">wheresoever</a> of the globe in general acquainted with the British tongue and commutative justice that there is not one tittle of truth in that purest of fabrications. The cad,
diagnosing that he had to do with a plainly postpuberal hyperpituitary type, <a name="sa0802az" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0802az">like a sensible man</a> thanked for the time of day, not a little taken aback all the same that that was all the time it was, and repeated <a name="sa0802bq" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0802bq">verbatim</a> as many of the words as he could call to mind that

next night but one after sodality meeting to the reverend, the director, a freshcomplexioned clergyman whom she had been meaning to speak to <a name="n03074d" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03074d">trusting</a> it wd go no further than his cloth yet it was he in all human probability who, when seized of the facts, was overheard by accident &mdash; if indeed, it was an accident &mdash; repeating a

<br> in the middle forties <font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">missing</span></font> during a priestly flutter for safe and sane bets at the racecourse of Baldoyle on a date easily capable of remembrance by all good &amp; true turfites when the Encourage Selling Plate was captured by two lengths from Bold Boy Cromwell after a clever getaway by Captain Blount&apos;s fresh colt
Drummer Coxon at short odds. It was two coves of the name of Treacle Tom as was just <a name="n04150o" href="../../ff/fnbs/n04all.htm#n04150o">out of pawn</a> following the <a name="sa0803p" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0803p">theft of a leg of pork</a> and his own blood and milk brother professionally known as Frisky Shorty <a name="sa0983ap" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0983ap">come

This Treacle Tom, to whom reference has just been made, had
been absent from his usual wild and woolly haunts for some time previous to that (he was, in fact, in the habit of frequenting common lodginghouses where he slept in a nude state in strange men&apos;s bunks) but on racenight revisiting his house of call <a name="sa0981q" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0981q">blotto</a> after copious <a name="n06137g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06137g">tots

<a name="n06121e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06121e">locally known as Cruck</a> who had passed several nights in a doorway and Hosty, an illstarred <a name="n03106i" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03106i">beach</a> busker who, feeling suicidal,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 7}</font>
<br> had been tossing on his shakedown devising ways and means of somehow getting a hold of some chap&apos;s parabellum in the hope of lighting upon a dive somewhere off the main tramline where he could go and blow the napper off himself in peace and quietness, he having been trying all he knew for over eighteen months to get into Jervis Street hospital without having been able to wangle it
anysides. O&apos;Donnell and Peter Cloran, as an understood thing, slept in the one bed with Hosty and the nevertired <a name="n01069b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01069b">tweeny</a> dawn-of-all-work had not been very many hours furbishing potlids, doorbrasses, scholars&apos; applecheeks and linkboys&apos; metals when the rejuvenated busker and his bedroom suite were up and afoot crosstown to
the thrumming of a crewth fiddle and, after a visit to a publichouse not a thousand leagues from the site of Parnell&apos;s statue where, the tale runs on, the trio were joined by a further casual and a decent sort who had just pocketed the weekly insult and all had stimulants in the shape of five gee and gees stood by the decent sort after which all came out of the licensed premises wiping their
mouth on their sleeve, the world was the richer for a new halfpenny ballad. This was first sung under the shadow of the monument of the dead legislator to an overflow meeting fully filling the visional
<br><font color="green">{ms, 8}</font>
<br> area and easily representative of all sections and <a name="n05078a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05078a">cross sections</a> of the Irish people ranging from slips of <a name="n04151h" href="../../ff/fnbs/n04all.htm#n04151h">young Dublins</a> with pocketed hands and corporation bucket emergency men in search of an honest crust to busy professional gentlemen, a brace of palesmen in
dundrearies exchanging cold sneers, massgoing ladies in their chairs and a few old souls obviously under the spell of liquor. Word went round and the ballad printed on a slip of blue paper headed by a rough woodcut soon fluttered on highway and byway to the rose of the winds from lane to lattice and from mouth to ear throughout the five corners of the
<a name="n03073b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03073b">United States</a> of Ireland. And around the land this rann it ran and this is the ran that Hosty made:</p> </p>  </main>
