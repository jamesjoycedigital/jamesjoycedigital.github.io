<p> Now (to forebare for ever solittle of Iris Frees and Lili O&apos;Rangans), concerning the genesis of Harold or Humphrey Chimpden&apos;s occupational agnomen (we are back in the presurnames prodromarith period, of course, just when enos chalked halltraps) and discarding once for all those theories from older sources which would link him back with such pivotal ancestors as the Glues, the Gravys,
the Northeasts, the Ankers and the Earwickers of Sidlesham in the Hundred of Manhood or proclaim him offsprout of vikings who had founded wapentake and seddled hem in Herrick or Eric, the best authenticated version, the Dumlat, read the Reading of Hofed-ben-Edar, has it that it was this way. We are told how in the beginning it came to pass that, like cabbaging Cincinnatus, the grand old gardener
was saving daylight under his giant redwood one sultry sabbath afternoon, Hag Chivychas Eve, in prefall paradise peace by following his plough for rootles in the rere garden of mobhouse, ye olde marine hotel, when royalty was announced by runner to have been pleased to have halted itself on the highroad along which a leisureloving dogfox had cast followed, also at walking pace, by a lady pack of
cocker spaniels. Forgetful of all save his vassal&apos;s plain
<br><font color="green">{f10, 31}</font>
<br> fealty to the ethnarch, Humphrey or Harold stayed not to yoke or saddle but stumbled out hotface as he was (his sweatful bandanna loose from his pocketcoat), hasting to the forecourts of his public in topee, surcingle, solascarf and plaid, plus fours, puttees and bulldog boots ruddled cinnabar with
<br><font color="green">{f39, 31}</font>
<br> flagrant marl, jingling his turnpike keys and bearing aloft amid the fixed pikes of the hunting party a high perch atop of which a flowerpot was fixed earthside hoist with care. On his majesty, who was, or often feigned to be, noticeably longsighted from green youth and had been meaning to inquire what, in effect, had caused yon causeway to be thus potholed, asking, substitutionally, to be
put wise as to whether paternoster and silver doctors were not now more fancied bait for lobstertrapping, honest blunt Haromphreyld answered in no uncertain tones very similarly with a fearless
<br><font color="green">{f10, 25}</font>
<br> forehead: Naw, yer maggers, aw war jist a cotchin on thon bluggy earwuggers. Our sailor king, who was draining a gugglet of obvious adamale, gift both and gorban, upon this, ceasing to swallow, smiled most heartily beneath his walrus moustaches and, indulging that none too genial humour which William the Conk on the spindle side had inherited with the hereditary whitelock and some
shortfingeredness from his greataunt Sophy, turned towards two of his retinue of gallowglasses, Michael, etheling lord of Leix and Offaly, and the jubilee mayor of Drogheda, Elcock, the two scatterguns being Michael M. Manning, protosyndic of Waterford, and an Italian excellency named Giubilei according to a later version cited by the learned scholarch Canavan of Canmakenoise (in either case a
triptychal religious family symbolising puritas of doctrina, business per usuals and the purchypatch of hamlock where the paddish preties grow), and remarked dilsydulsily: Holybones of Saint Hubert, how our red brother of Pouringrainia would audibly fume did he know that we have for surtrusty bailiwick a turnpiker who is by turns a pikebailer no seldomer than an earwigger! For he kinned Jom Pill
with his court so gray and his haunts in his house in the mourning. (One still hears that pebblecrusted laughter, japijap cheerycherrily, among the roadside tree the lady Holmpatrick planted and still one feels the amossive silence of the cladstone allegibelling: Ive mies outs ide Bourn.)</p>

<br> And curled up like Lord Olofa Crumple
<br> By the butt of the Magazine Wall,</p>
<p class="spfl">(Chorus) Of the Magazine Wall,</p>
<p class="duup">Hump, helmet and all?</p>
<p class="spfl">He was one time our king of the castle

<br> And from Green Street he&apos;ll be sent by order of His Worship
<br> To the penal jail of Mountjoy,</p>
<p class="spfl">(Chorus) To the jail of Mountjoy.</p>
<p class="duup">Jail him and joy.</p>
<p class="spfl">He was fafafather of all schemes for to bother us
<br> Slow coaches and immaculate contraceptives for the populace,
<br> Mare&apos;s milk for the sick, seven dry Sundays a week,
<br> Openair love and religion&apos;s reform,</p>
<p class="spfl">(Chorus) And religious reform,</p>
<p class="duup">Hideous in form.</p>
<p class="spfl">Arrah, why, says you, couldn&apos;t he manage it?
<br> I&apos;ll go bail, my fine dairyman darling,
<br> Like the bumping bull of the Cassidys
<br> All your butter is in your horns.</p>
<p class="spfl">(Chorus) His butter is in his horns.</p>
<p class="duup">Butter his horns!</p>

<p class="flush">We had chaw chaw chops, chairs, chewing gum, the chickenpox and china chambers

<br> Small wonder He&apos;ll Cheat E&apos;erawan our local lads nicknamed him
<br> When Chimpden first took the floor</p>
<p class="spfl">(Chorus) With his bucketshop store</p>
<p class="duup">Down Bargainweg, Lower.
<br><font color="green">{f10, 37}</font> </p>
<p class="spfl">So snug he was in his hotel premises sumptuous
<br> But soon we&apos;ll bonfire all his trash, tricks and trumpery
<br> And &apos;tis short till Sheriff Clancy&apos;ll be winding up his unlimited company
<br> With the bailiff&apos;s bom at the door,</p>
<p class="spfl">(Chorus) Bimbam at the door.</p>
<p class="duup">Then he&apos;ll bum no more.</p>
<p class="spfl">Sweet bad luck on the waves washed to our island
<br> The hooker of that hammerfast viking
<br> And Gall&apos;s curse on the day when Eblana Bay
<br> Saw his black and tan man-o&apos;-war,</p>
<p class="spfl">(Chorus) Saw his man-o&apos;-war</p>

<p class="spfl">Lift it, Hosty, lift it, ye devil ye! Up with the rann, the rhyming rann!</p>
<p class="spfl">It was during some freshwater garden pumping
<br> Or, according to the <i>Nursing Mirror</i>, while admiring the monkeys
<br> That our heavyweight heathen Humpharey
<br> Made bold a maid to woo.</p>
<p class="spfl">(Chorus) Woohoo, what&apos;ll she doo!</p>
<p class="duup">The general lost her maidenloo!
<br><font color="green">{f39, 47}</font> </p>
<p class="spfl">He ought to blush for himself, the old hayheaded philosopher,
<br> For to go and shove himself that way on top of her.

<p class="spfl">(Chorus) Messrs Billing and Coo.</p>
<p class="duup">Noah&apos;s larks, good as noo.</p>

<br> When some bugger let down the backtrap of the omnibus
<br> And he caught his death of fusiliers,</p>
<p class="spfl">(Chorus) With his rent in his rears.</p>
<p class="duup">Give him six years.</p>
<p class="spfl">&apos;Tis sore pity for his innocent poor children
<br> But look out for his missus legitimate!
<br> When that frew gets a grip of old Earwicker
<br> Won&apos;t there be earwigs on the green?</p>
<p class="spfl">(Chorus) Big earwigs on the green,</p>
<p class="duup">The largest ever you seen.</p>
<p class="spfl">Suffoclose! Shikespower! Seudodanto! Anonymoses!</p>
<p class="spfl">Then we&apos;ll have a free trade Gaels&apos; band and mass meeting
<br> For to sod the brave son of Scandiknavery
<br> And we&apos;ll bury him down in Oxmanstown
<br> Along with the devil and Danes,</p>
<p class="spfl">(Chorus) With the deaf and dumb Danes,</p>
<p class="duup">And all their remains.</p>
<p class="spfl">And not all the king&apos;s men nor his horses
<br> Will resurrect his corpus
<br> For there&apos;s no true spell in Connacht or hell</p>
