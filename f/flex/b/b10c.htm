<p> Concerning the genesis of Harold or Humphrey Coxon&apos;s <u>agnomen</u> and discarding finally those theories which would link him either with the <a name="n04029d" href="../../ff/fnbs/n04all.htm#n04029d">Glues &amp; Gravys &amp; Earwickers</a> of Sidleham<a target="foot" id="fbz0001">&ordm;</a> in the <a name="n04029c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n04all.htm#n04029c">hundred of manhood</a> or
proclaim him a descendant of vikings who had settled in Herwick (?) or Erwick (?) the most authentic version has it that <a name="n01096g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01096g">it was this way</a>. Like Cincinnatus the G.O.G. (<a name="n05014e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05014e">grand old gardener</a>) was one sabbath day following his plough for
<a name="n01023k" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01023k">rootles</a> in the rear garden of his Royal <a name="n04029g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n04all.htm#n04029g">Marine Hotel</a> when <a name="sa0121ap" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0121ap">royalty</a> was announced <a name="n01058e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01058e">by runner</a> to have been pleased to halt on on the highroad
<a name="n01005c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01005c">along which a</a> <a name="n01005i" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01005i">dogfox</a> <a name="n01005c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01005c">had cast</a>. Forgetful of all but his fealty he stayed not to saddle or yoke but he stumbled <a name="n05013f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05013f">hotface</a> out of his forecourts in his

amid the <a name="n05004b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05004b">fixed</a> pikes of the royal hunting party a long <a name="n04029f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n04all.htm#n04029f">perch atop of which a flowerpot was affixed</a>. On his majesty, who was <a name="sa0801ce" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0801ce">noticeably</a> longsighted from his early youth, inquiring whether he had been engaged in
<a name="n04029f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n04all.htm#n04029f">lobstertrapping</a> honest Humphrey bluntly answered <a name="n01084i" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01084i">very similarly</a>: &apos;No, my liege, I was only a cotching of them bluggy earwigs&apos;. The king who held a <a name="n01012c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01012c">draught of obvious water</a> in his hand upon this smiled
heartily beneath his <a name="n01001p" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01001p">walrus</a> moustaches and, giving way to that none too genial humour which <a name="n01021i" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01021i">William the Conk</a> had inherited from his great <a name="n03128e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03128e">aunt Sophy</a>, turned towards two gunmen of his retinue the lord of Offaly hero
in <font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">unread</span></font> and the mayor of Waterford (the <a name="n01006i" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01006i">second gun</a> being Syndic of Drogheda <a name="n05142f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05142f">according to</a> a later version cited by <a name="n05010f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05010f">the learned Kouavan</a>)
remarking &apos;<a name="n01101i" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01101i">Holybones</a>, How our brother of Burgundy would fume did he know that he have for trusty vassal a turnpiker who is also an earwicker&apos;. <a name="n01039g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01039g">Are these</a> <a name="n01029b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01029b">True facts</a> are recorded in as this legend?
<a name="n01039h" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01039h">We shall perhaps see</a>. But it is certain that from that historic date all documents initialled by Humphrey bear the sigla H.C.E. and while he was always Coxon for his cronies and good duke Humphrey for the ragged tiny folk of <a name="n01033f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01033f">Lucalizod</a> it was certainly a
<br><font color="green">{ms, 97v}</font>
<br> a pleasant turn of the populace which gave him as sense of these initials the nickname &apos;Here Comes Everybody&apos;. An Imposing everybody indeed he looked and worthy of that title as he surveyed the playhouse on gala nights from the royal booth where he sat <a name="n05008f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05008f">with all his house</a> with broadstretched kerchief cooling neck &amp;
shoulders &amp; wardrobepanelled <a name="n01117g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01117g">tuxedo</a> thrown back from a shirt wellnamed a swallowall far outstarching the laundered clawhammers and <a name="sa0983ax" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0983ax">marbletopped highboys</a> of the pit. A baser meaning has been read into these letters, the literal sense of which decency can but touch. It
has been suggested that he suffered from <a name="sa0802l" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0802l">a vile disease</a>. To such a suggestion the only selfrespecting answer is to affirm that there are certain statements which ought not to be, and one would like to be able to add, ought not to be allowed to be made. There was a case of the kind implicating a man named Lyons who was
<a name="n01102h" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01102h">posted at Mallon&apos;s</a> &amp; years afterwards <a name="n01066c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01066c">dropped dead whilst waiting for a chop</a> in Hawkins street. Nor have his detractors who, an <a name="n01031j" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01031j">imperfectly warmblooded</a> race, apparently think him
<a name="n05003f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05003f">capable of any &amp; every enormity</a> recorded to the discredit of the <a name="n01108a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01108a">Juke &amp; Kellikek families</a>, mended their case by insinuating that he was at one time under the ludicrous imputation of <a name="sa0801cr" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0801cr">annoying soldiers</a>
<a name="sa0801cs" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0801cs">in the <font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font></a>. To anyone who knew and loved H- C- E- the suggestion is preposterous. Slander, let it do its worst, has never been able to convict that good and great man of any worse impropriety than that of having
<a name="n01091e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01091e">behaved in an ungentlemanly manner</a> <a name="n03153a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03153a">in the presence of certain a pair of maidservants</a> in the <a name="n01079r" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01079r">rushy hollow</a> whither <a name="n01077i" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01077i">nature</a> as they alleged had
spontaneously &amp; at the same time <a name="n01077i" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01077i">sent them both</a> whose testimonies are, if not dubious, at any rate slightly divergent on minor points touching what was certainly an incautious, but at the most, a partial exposure with attenuating circumstances, during an abnormal S Martin&apos;s summer.</p> </p>  </main>
