<p> As I have now successfully explained to you my own naturalborn rations which are even in excise of my vaultybrain insure me that I am a mouth&apos;s more deserving case by genius. I&apos;m Armory, so herald me, but he&apos;s merely the size of his shirt. The Jonases were juanisers<a target="foot" id="fff0622">&ordm;</a>  in Lyoness before the first Schmied started to forge. For see my
stitchwork! A boche beuglant<a target="foot" id="fff0623">&ordm;</a>  in a field flam. Motto: Twist im ann insulte!

the irony of the stars. And he wants my addition of meal, meat, bread, butter, dripping, eggs, tea and cabbage with a doorstep! I ought<a target="foot" id="fff0655">&ordm;</a> not to indulge on this stage still I will think he is so very<a target="foot" id="fff0656">&ordm;</a> allirish!<a target="foot" id="fff0657">&ordm;</a> You will say it is most unenglish and I shall hope to hear that you will
not be wrong about it. But I further<a target="foot" id="fff0658">&ordm;</a>, feeling a bit husky in my truths &hellip;<a target="foot" id="fff0659">&ordm;</a></p>
<p> Will you please come over and let us mooremoore murgessly to each&apos;s other down below our vices. i<a target="foot" id="fff0660">&ordm;</a> am being<a target="foot" id="fff0661">&ordm;</a> underheerd by old billfaust. wilsh<a target="foot" id="fff0662">&ordm;</a> is <a name="n12199f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n12all.htm#n12199f">full of curks</a>. the<a target="foot" id="fff0663">&ordm;</a>

dairy days of buy and buy.</p>
<p> Burrus, let us like to imagine, is a genuine prime, the real choice<a target="foot" id="fff0680">&ordm;</a>, full of natural greace, the mildest of milkstoffs yet unbeaten as a risicide and, of course, obsoletely unadulterous,<a target="foot" id="fff0681">&ordm;</a> whereat Caseous is obversely the revise of him and in fact not an ideal choose by any meals, though the betterman of the two is
meltingly addicted to the more casual side of the arrivalist&apos;s<a target="foot" id="fff0682">&ordm;</a> case and, let me say it at once, as zealous over him as is passably he.</p>
<p> The<a target="foot" id="fff0683">&ordm;</a> seemsame home and histry seeks and hidepence which we used to be reading for our prepurgatory (hot, Schott?)<a target="foot" id="fff0684">&ordm;</a> till Duddy shut the shopper op and Mutti (poor Mutti!)<a target="foot" id="fff0685">&ordm;</a> brought us our poor suppy<a target="foot" id="fff0686">&ordm;</a> (ah who! eh
how!!)<a target="foot" id="fff0687">&ordm;</a> in Acetius and Oleosus and Sellius Volatilis and Petrus Papricus! Our Old Party quite united round the Slatbowel at Commons: Pfarrer Salamoss himself and that sprog of a Pedersill and his Sprig of Thyme and a dozen of the Murphybuds and a score and more of the hot young Capels and Lettucia in her greensleeves and you too and me three, twinsome bibs
but hansome ates, like shakespill and eggs! But there&apos;s many a split pretext bowl and jowl; and (snob screwing that cork, Schott!) to understand this as well as you can, feeling how backward you are in your down-to-the-ground benches, I have completed the following arrangement for the coarse use of stools.<a target="foot" id="fff0688">&ordm;</a>

I could paint you to that butter
if<a target="foot" id="fff0701">&ordm;</a> you had some wash. Caseous<a target="foot" id="fff0705">&ordm;</a> may hethink<a target="foot" id="fff0706">&ordm;</a> himself a thought of a caviller but Burrus has the reachly roundered head that goes best with thoftthinking<a target="foot" id="fff0707">&ordm;</a> defensive

<br> my whole<a target="foot" id="fff0720">&ordm;</a> mouthful to ariman<a target="foot" id="fff0721">&ordm;</a> about it you should call me the <a name="n26207j" href="../../ff/fnbs/n26all.htm#n26207j">Ormuzd</a> aliment in your midst of faime. Eat ye up, heat ye up! sings the somun in the salm. <i>Butyrum et mel comedet ut sciat reprobare</i><a target="foot" id="fff0723">&ordm;</a> <i>malum et
eligere bonum</i>. This<a target="foot" id="fff0724">&ordm;</a>, of course, also explains why we were taught to play in the childhood: <i>Der Haensli ist ein Butterbrot,</i><a target="foot" id="fff0725">&ordm;</a> <i>fein Butterbrot,</i><a target="foot" id="fff0726">&ordm;</a> <i>mein Butterbrot! Und Koebi iss dein Schtinkenkot! Ja! Ja! Ja!</i></p>
<p> This,<a target="foot" id="fff0727">&ordm;</a> in fact, just to show you, is Caseous, the brutherscutch or puir tyron: a hole or two, the highstink<a target="foot" id="fff0728">&ordm;</a> aforefelt and anygo<a target="foot" id="fff0729">&ordm;</a> prigging wurms. Cheesugh! you complain. And Hi Hi High must say you are not Hoa Hoa Hoally in the wrong! </p>
<p> Thus we cannot escape our likes and mislikes, exiles or ambusheers, beggar and neighbour, and so<a target="foot" id="fff0730">&ordm;</a> &mdash; this is where the dimeshow advertisers advance the temporal relief plea &mdash; let us be tolerant of antipathies. <i>Nex quovis burro num fit</i><a target="foot" id="fff0731">&ordm;</a> <i>mercaseus?</i><a target="foot" id="fff0732">&ordm;</a> I am
not hereby giving my final endorsement to the learned ignorants of the <a name="n26020l" href="../../ff/fnbs/n26all.htm#n26020l">Cusanus</a> philosophism in which old <a name="n26020l" href="../../ff/fnbs/n26all.htm#n26020l">Nicholas</a> pegs it down that the smarter the spin of the top the sounder the span of the buttom. (What<a target="foot" id="fff0733">&ordm;</a> the worthy old auberginiste
ought to have meant was: the more stolidly immobile<a target="foot" id="fff0734">&ordm;</a> <i>in space</i> appears to me the bottom which is presented to use <i>in time</i><a target="foot" id="fff0735">&ordm;</a> by the top primomobilisk &amp;c.)<a target="foot" id="fff0736">&ordm;</a> And I shall be misunderstood if understood to give an unconditional sinequamnunc
to<a target="foot" id="fff0737">&ordm;</a> the heroicised furibouts of the Nolanus theory, or, at any rate, of that substrate<a target="foot" id="fff0738">&ordm;</a> of apart from hissheory where the Theophile<a target="foot" id="fff0739">&ordm;</a> swoors by his Father Familiaritas and his Mother Contumelia and by the soul in his suit and the animus in his soul and the mind in his animus and the
good in his mind<a target="foot" id="fff0740">&ordm;</a> that on principial he was the pointingstart<a target="foot" id="fff0741">&ordm;</a> of his odiose by comparison and that whiles eggs will fall cheapened all over the walled the Bure will be dear on the Brie.</p>
<p> Now, while I am not out now to be taken up as unintentionally recommending the Silkebjorg<a target="foot" id="fff0742">&ordm;</a> turondunamon machine<a target="foot" id="fff0743">&ordm;</a> for the more enocomical<a target="foot" id="fff0744">&ordm;</a> helixtrolysis of these amboadipates until I can find space to look into it myself a little more closely
first,<a target="foot" id="fff0745">&ordm;</a> I shall go on with my decisions after having shown to you in good time how both products of our social stomach are mutuearly polarised. Positing, as above, too<a target="foot" id="fff0748">&ordm;</a> male<a target="foot" id="fff0749">&ordm;</a> pooles, the one the pictor of the other and the omber the
<i>&sigma;&kappa;&omicron;&tau;&iota;&alpha;</i><a target="foot" id="fff0750">&ordm;</a> of the one, and looking wantingly around our undistributed middle between males,<a target="foot" id="fff0751">&ordm;</a> we feel we must waistfully woent a female to focus and on this stage there pleasantly appears the cowrymaid M<a target="foot" id="fff0752">&ordm;</a> (whom we shall often meet
below)<a target="foot" id="fff0753">&ordm;</a> who introduces herself upon us at some precise hour which we shall again agree to call absolute zero or the bubblingpoint of platinism. And so like that former son of a kish<a target="foot" id="fff0755">&ordm;</a> who went up and out to found his farmer&apos;s ashes<a target="foot" id="fff0756">&ordm;</a> we come down home gently on our own
turnedabout<a target="foot" id="fff0757">&ordm;</a> asses to meet Margareen.</p>
<p> We now romp through a period of pure lyricism of shamebred music evidenced by such words in distress as <i>I cream for thee,</i><a target="foot" id="fff0758">&ordm;</a> <i>sweet</i><a target="foot" id="fff0759">&ordm;</a> <i>Margareen!</i><a target="foot" id="fff0760">&ordm;</a> and the more hopeful <i>O Margareena! O Margareena!</i><a target="foot" id="fff0761">&ordm;</a>
<i>Still</i><a target="foot" id="fff0762">&ordm;</a> <i>in the bowl is left a lump of gold!</i> The pawnbreaking pathos of the first of these shoddy pieces reveals it as a Caseous effort. Burrus&apos;s bit is often used for a toast. Of course,<a target="foot" id="fff0767">&ordm;</a> the unskilled singer continues to pervert our<a target="foot" id="fff0768">&ordm;</a> wiser ears by subordinating
the space-element, that is to sing, the <i>aria</i>, to the time-factor, which ought to be killed, <i>ill tempor</i>. I should advise any unborn singer who may still be among my heeders to forget her temporal<a target="foot" id="fff0769">&ordm;</a> diaphragm at home
<br><font color="green">{f39, 165}</font>
<br> (the best thing that could happen to it!) and attack the roulade with a swift <i>colpo di glottide</i> to the lug (though Maace I will insist was reclined from overdoing this, his recovery often being slow) and then O! on the third dead beat<a target="foot" id="fff0770">&ordm;</a> O! to cluse her eyes and awpen<a target="foot" id="fff0771">&ordm;</a> her oath and see what spice I may
send<a target="foot" id="fff0772">&ordm;</a> her.</p>
<p></p>
<p> I shall have a word to say in a few yards about the acoustic and orchidectural management of the tonehall but it will be very convenient for me for the emolument to pursue Burrus and Caseous for a rung or two up their isocelating biangle. Every admirer of my &ldquo;blank manner&rdquo;<a target="foot" id="fff0775">&ordm;</a> has seen with eyes watered<a target="foot" id="fff0776">&ordm;</a> my
goulache of Marge which I titled <i>The Very Picture of a Needlesswoman</i><a target="foot" id="fff0777">&ordm;</a>. The hatboxes which compose<a target="foot" id="fff0782">&ordm;</a> Rhomba, Lady<a target="foot" id="fff0783">&ordm;</a> Trabezond (Marge <a name="n19196a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n19all.htm#n19196a">in her <i>excelsis</i></a>),<a target="foot" id="fff0784">&ordm;</a> also
comprise<a target="foot" id="fff0785">&ordm;</a> the climactogram up which B and C may fondly<a target="foot" id="fff0786">&ordm;</a> be imagined ascending and are suggestive of gentlemen&apos;s spring modes, these modes carrying us back to the superimposed claylayers of eocene and pleastoseen formation and the gradual morphological changes in our body politic which Professor Ebahi-Ahuri of
Philadespoinis (Ill) &mdash; whose bluebutterbust I have just given his coupe de grass to &mdash; neatly names a <i>bo&icirc;te &agrave; surprises</i>. The boxes, if I may break the subject gently, are worth about fourpence pourbox but I am inventing a  more patent process after which they can be reduced to a fragment of their
<br><font color="green">{f39, 166}</font>
<br> true crust by even the youngest of Margees,<a target="foot" id="fff0788">&ordm;</a> if she will take plase to be seated and smile if I please.</p>
<p> Now there can be no question about it either that I,<a target="foot" id="fff0789">&ordm;</a> having done as much, have quite got the size of that young woman whose types may be met with in any public garden ostentatiously hemming apologetically over the briefness of some &ldquo;sweet&rdquo;<a target="foot" id="fff0794">&ordm;</a> garment or at the movies swallowing sobs and blowing bixed
bixcuits over &ldquo;Childe&rdquo;<a target="foot" id="fff0797">&ordm;</a> chaplain&apos;s &ldquo;latest&rdquo; or on the verge of the gutter with some bobbedhair babyma&apos;s infant held hostage at armslength, teaching His Majesty how to make waters worse.</p>
