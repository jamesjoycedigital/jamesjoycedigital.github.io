meltingly addicted to the more casual side of the arrivalist&apos;s<a target="foot" id="fff0682">&ordm;</a> case and, let me say it at once, as zealous over him as is passably he.</p>

<p> I shall have a word to say in a few yards about the acoustic and orchidectural management of the tonehall but it will be very convenient for me for the emolument to pursue Burrus and Caseous for a rung or two up their isocelating biangle. Every admirer of my &ldquo;blank manner&rdquo;<a target="foot" id="fff0775">&ordm;</a> has seen with eyes watered<a target="foot" id="fff0776">&ordm;</a> my

be imagined ascending and are suggestive of gentlemen&apos;s spring modes, these modes carrying us back to the superimposed claylayers of eocene and pleastoseen formation and the gradual morphological changes in our body politic which Professor Ebahi-Ahuri of Philadespoinis (Ill) &mdash; whose bluebutterbust I have just given his coupe de grass to &mdash; neatly names a <i>bo&icirc;te &agrave;
