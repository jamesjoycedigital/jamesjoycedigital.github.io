<p class="pdi">&mdash; Now just permit me a moment<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">?</span></span>! Are you there? Hello! Sybil Head here. Yes. Very good now. Do you remember the night following the fair day?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; There were fires on every bald hill in holy Ireland that night.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You may say they were.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Were they bonfires?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No other name would at all befit them unless that. Bonafieries! With their blue beards streaming to the heavens.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Was it a high white night now?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Whitest night mortal ever saw.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Was there rain by any chance?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Plenty.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; There was a fall of snow as well, I gather.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The nicest at all.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Did not it blow some gales rather strongly to less?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Out of all jokes it did.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do you recollect whether the moon was shining at all?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Sure she was.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And was there frostwork about &amp; thick weather &amp; everything.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; There was. July at its worst.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I see. Now you know the kikkenmidden where the couple first met with each other?
<br><font color="green">{ms, 111}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Indeed &amp; I do.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is it a place fairly exposed to the 4 winds?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, I hope so, if what I hear is all true.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Is it Woful Dane Bottom?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It is woful whatever about anything else.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; There used to be a tree there stuck up.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; There used. And the crandest maypole tree in <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the</span></span> all the world. A giant is what he is.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; How grand is this giant? Tell us what you know about the plant.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; There&apos;s growing on her &amp; fenians in his bole &amp; young culprits of boys climbing to her crock &amp; the Kilmainham pensioners chucking farthings up into her to fall her and cock robins hatching out mistletoe eggs for him, the sun &amp; moon pegging honeysuckle &amp; white heather down, the creatures of the wild all approaching to claw and rub
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">and</span></span> <a name="n03146b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03146b">hermits</a> of the desert barking their shins over her infernal roots, and his acorns flying wild on all sides out of him after the birds of the air &amp; her leaves sinsinning
<br><font color="green">{ms, 112}</font>
<br> since the night of time and each &amp; all of their branches meeting &amp; shaking twisty hands once more in the new world.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I&apos;ve got that now. The form masculine, the gender feminine. I see. Now are you connected with it yourself in any way? The tree I mean.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Upfellbowm.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Let me recall. Are you acquainted with a pagany better known as Toucher Doyle who is? Consider yourself on the stand now &amp; watch yr words.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I consider I would be frightfully ashamed if I was.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He is a man of around 50 who does messages. Have you ever heard of this Doyle who belongs to Kimmage being most of his time down at the Green Man &amp; mixing with the public going for groceries always when he wd be finished his tea.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; As mad as the brambles he is. Touch him.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 113}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Now, <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">I&apos;m wondering</span></span> brush up yr memory a bit. I&apos;m wondering was he wearing false clothes for that occasion of the wedding.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I am sorry to have to tell you they were coming down from off him.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; How many were married on that morning? <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Was everybody</span></span> Everybody was drunk, I am told.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <a name="n03150c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03150c">The priest &amp; <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the</span></span> bride were sober.</a></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <a name="n03150c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03150c">Magrath was best man. You saw him, did you?</a></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I saw him <a name="n03150c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03150c">kicking the sexton.</a></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You are <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">quite</span></span> sure it was not a wake you were at?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Precisely</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Happily you were not quite so successful in sublimating yr suppressions?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Quite so.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Now cast your eyes around you. I want you to tell us as briefly as you can how these funeral games took place.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Faith then, first he wanted a match. Then counting as many as 30 seconds he kept cursing at him to know who burned the hay which the man knew nothing about.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; In other words was that how the angelic warfare started?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Truly.</p> </p>  </main>
