<p class="flush">2) And as the buzzer brings the light brigade, keeping the home fires burning, so did they come from all parts by the first quaint skreek of the gloaming, hopping it up the mountainy molehill, traversing climes of the days gone by, of the times not worth remembering, inventing some excuses, anyone, with a sevenply sweat of nightfears over them &mdash; phopho, foorchtha, aggala,

pair of puritan shoots and a posse of Aran chiefs. Phopho! The meteorflesh of him, the rainbow<a name="n10122j" href="../../FF/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10122j">skin</a>! Aggala! His bellyvoid of nebulose and his neverstop navel! Palloola! And his veins of melanite phosphor and his arrowroot knuckles, ribs &amp; members! Oorirididimininy! His electro lattiginous

<p class="flush">3) The four claymen clomb together to hold their sworn inquiry on him. Up to Esker ridge it was, to the mead that was near, the son&apos;s rest. The names on them were these. First clomb Matthew Gregory, through the deep field, Marcus Lyons, tailing the wavy line of his partition footsteps (his blisters told him how he had been there before): then His Recordership, Luke Tarpey,
after honourable sleep; and last from his prompt corner, old Johnny Mac, MacDougall, the hiker, in their rere and on the run, to make a quorum. Roping their ass <a name="n12094m" href="../../FF/fnbs/n12all.htm#n12094m">he was</a>, the skygrey globetrotting, by way of an afterthought, and <a name="n09012a" href="../../FF/fnbs/n09all.htm#n09012a">the legs on him they were that uneven</a> it was

The buckos on the lee then stood wherever they found their standings, and set the watch
about him, with their broadawake probers&apos; hats on their firrum heads, and a crack quatyouare of stenoggers they made together, with their <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">as</span></span> beast by them, the odd trick of the pack. And it was more similar to a satrap he lay there surrounded by satellites or the Lord Lumen, instructing his constellations in faith and doctrine for
old Matt Gregory, &apos;tis he had the <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">star menagerie</span></span> starmenagerie, Marcus Lyons and Lucas Metcalfe and the mack that never forgave the ass that lurked behind him, Johnny na Hossaleen.</p>
