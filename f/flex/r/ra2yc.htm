<p class="pdi">&mdash; I consider I would be frightfully ashamed if I was.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He is a man of around 50 who <a name="n12132e" href="../../FF/fnbs/n12all.htm#n12132e">does messages</a>.

<p class="pdi">&mdash; As mad as the brambles he is. Touch him.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Now, brush up your memory a bit. I&apos;m wondering Was he wearing false clothes for that occasion?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I am sorry to have to tell you they were <a name="n11114b" href="../../FF/fnbs/n11all.htm#n11114b">well over</a> 3 months coming down from off him.</p>
