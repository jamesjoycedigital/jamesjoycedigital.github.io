<p class="flush">Lowly, longly a wail went forth. Pure Yawn lay low. On the mead of the hillock he lay, brief wallet to his side, an arm loose by his staff of citron briar. Most distressfully (but, my dear, how successfully!) to wail he did, his locks of a Lucan tinge, quickrich, ripely rippling, unfilleted, those lashbetasselled lids on the verge of closing time, whiles out of his sidewiseopen
mouth the breath of him, evenso languishing as the princeliest treble treacle or lichoo chewchow purse could buy. Yawn in a semiswoon lay awailing and, (hooh!) what helpings of honeyfed sweethood, (phew!) wheech earpiercing dulcitude! As were you suppose to go and push with your bluntplank pin in hand upinto his fleshasplush cushionettes of some chubby boybold love of an angel. Hwoah!</p>
<p> When, as the buzzer brings the light brigade, keeping the homefires burning, so on the churring call themselves came at him from all their cardinal parts, along the amber way, where Brosna is furzy. <a name="n12209j" href="../../FF/fnbs/n12all.htm#n12209j">To lift them they did</a> by the first quaint skreek of the gloaming and they hopped it up the mountainy molehill, traversing climes of all
times

<br> gone by of the days not worth remembering, inventing some excusethems, any sort, having a sevenply sweat of nightfears moist upon them &mdash; phopho, foorchtha, aggala, jeeshee, paloola, ooridiminis. Afeard themselves were to wonder at the the class of coon he would likely be <a name="n10002i" href="../../FF/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10002i">length, breadth plus thickness,</a> ells upon ells of him,
making so many square yards of him, one half of him in Conn&apos;s half but the whole of him nevertheless in Owenmore&apos;s five quarters. There he would lay, spancelled down upon a blossomy bed, at one foul stretch amongst the daffydowndillies, the <a name="n10114b" href="../../FF/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10114b">flowers</a> of narcosis fettering his
<a name="n10114b" href="../../FF/fnbs/n10all.htm#n10114b">footlights</a>, a halohedge of wild spuds hovering over him, epicures waltzing with gardenfillers, puritan shoots advancing to Aran chiefs. Phopho! The meteorpulp of him, the seamless rainbowpeel! Aggala! His bellyvoid of nebulose with his neverstop navel! Paloola! And his veins shooting melanite phosphor, his
<a name="n12210n" href="../../FF/fnbs/n12all.htm#n12210n">creamtocustard</a> comethair and his arrowroot knuckles, ribs and members! Ooridimininis! His electrolatiginous <a name="n09119c" href="../../FF/fnbs/n09all.htm#n09119c">twisted entrails belt</a>!

<p class="flush">Those four claymen clomb together to hold their sworn inquiry on him. Up to the esker ridge it was, <a name="n08180c" href="../../FF/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08180c">Mullingar parish</a>, to a mead that was not far, the son&apos;s rest. First klettered Matthew Gregory, through the deep timefield, Marcus Lyons, tailing the wavy line of his partition footsteps (something in his blisters was
telling him all along how he had been in that place one time), then His Recordership, Dr Luke Tarpey, after honourable sleep, hot on to the aniseed, and last, up out of his prompt corner old Johnny Mac, Mac Dougal, the hiker, in the rere of them on the run to make a quorum. Roping their ass he was, their skygrey globetrotter, by way of an afterthought and such legs on him they were that much
uneven it was tumbling he was by four lengths to hear with his unaided ear the harp in the air, the bugle dianablowing, wild as wild, the mockingbird whose word is misfortune so &apos;tis said, the bulbul down the wind.</p>
<p> The proto was traipsing through the tangle then and
<br><font color="green">{ms, 75}</font>
<br> his station was a few perch to the weatherside of the knoll Usnach and it was from no other place <a name="n12209h" href="../../FF/fnbs/n12all.htm#n12209h">unless</a> there that he extended aloof the hand making silence. <a name="n12210c" href="../../FF/fnbs/n12all.htm#n12210c">The buckos beyond</a> on the lea then stopped wheresoever they found their standings and that way they set watch
about him, upholding their broadawake probers&apos; hats on their firrum heads. And a crack quatyouare of stenoggers they made of themselves, all told, not even to the exclusion of their beast by them and he was <u>odd trick</u> of the pack. And who should be laying there forenenst them only Yawn. All of asprawl he was laying too and, I can tell you something more than that, he was profoundly
asleep. And it was more similar to a satrap he lay there, by satellites all surrounded, or for all I know like the Lord Lumen, coaching his <a name="n06162c" href="../../FF/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06162c">preferred</a> constellations in faith and doctrine for old Matt Gregory &apos;tis he had the starmenagerie, Marcus Lyons and Lucas Metcalfe Tarpey and
<br><font color="green">{ms, 76}</font>
<br> the mack that never forgave the ass that lurked behind him, Johnny na Hossaleen.</p>
<p> More than their good share ensorcelled you would say themselves were the way <a name="n12208a" href="../../FF/fnbs/n12all.htm#n12208a">they could not rightly tell their heels from their stools as they cooched down</a> by his crib, curchycurchy, gawking on him, and softnoising one of them to another one, the boguaqueesthers. And it is what they began to say to him then, the masters, what way
was he.</p>

<p> And as they were spreading abroad their drifter nets, gleamy <a name="n12161j" href="../../FF/fnbs/n12all.htm#n12161j">seiners&apos;</a> nets and no lie, there was words being softspoken among those

<p class="pdi">&mdash; Very good now. Now I would like to raise a point of language touching this. There is the word maggers. I am advised that there are fully 606 words in your language for monarch but that there is not one term which signifies majesty. Is that the case?</p>
