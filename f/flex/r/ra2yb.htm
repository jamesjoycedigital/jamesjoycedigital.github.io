<p class="pdi">&mdash; Thot&apos;s never the postal cleric? Are yu Roman Cathrick 432?</p>
<p class="poem">&mdash; <u>Quadrigue my yoke:
<br> Triple my tryst:
<br> Tandem my sire.</u></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Tantris. I see now. Now I feel called upon to ask did it ever occur to you prior to this by a stretch of your imagination that you might be very largely substituted by a complementary character?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Once or twice. A few times as I chanced to be stretching myself in my imagination I felt feeling queer round my middle so that I&apos;m not myself at all. Bruno and Nolan, the lifepartners off Nassau street, were explaining it all round each other ere yesterday. When heuponNolan Bruno monopolises his egobruno
<br><font color="green">{ms, 92}</font>
<br> most unwillingly senses by the mortal powers alionolan equal and opposite brunoipso, ipso, id est, eternally provoking alio opposite equally as provoked as Bruno at being eternally opposed by Nolan.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Now will you just search through your memoirs for this impersonating medium. Would it be a fellow much about your own size with a buff whiskers?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Treble stouter is doing the dirty on me with his tantrums and all these kilowatts that I&apos;d be better off without.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Stouter and stouter. I see. Now you told us of this tryst. I wonder now without revealing secrets of the bedchamber have I heard the name anywhere.</p>
<p class="poem">&mdash; <u>Marik! Marik! Marik!
<br> Ha drappad has drariks a the parik
<br> And ha had ta barraw tha watercrass shartclathes off tha arkbishap af Yarik.</u></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; O cross of Cong &amp; water! And he said he was only taking the grass temperature! Ask him how he lost his bass&apos;s voice.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well, I beg to traverse above statement inasmuch as my revered was confined in barracks
<br><font color="green">{ms, 93}</font>
<br> by doctor Mannix entailing a laxative tendency especially with him being forbidden fruit when my reputed husband took a drink out of the <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">said</span></span> given bottle and he simply showed me a poker which was here produced with the remark: This is for <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">sneak</span></span> Sneak.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Creepin through the children of Mary&apos;s class disguised as a blancmange and marmalade! Three cheers for the name Dan Magrath!</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I would misdemean to rebuke to the libel of snots inasmuch as a sovereign was freely presented to all by that noblest of magistrates <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">mean</span></span> with admired engraving meaning complete manly parts during alleged act as required by statues.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Sure, that lad was boycotted as I&apos;m given now to understand. There was nobody would come next or near him after that.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Arrah weren&apos;t they arriving in their centuries for to pay their firstrate duties before him in his reunited magazine, the Grand Old MacGuinness Mor, boot kings and indiarubber umpires and shahs from Paisley &amp; sultana raisins and a row of jam sahibs &amp;

<br> an odd princess in her petticoat and the queen of Indian playing clubs and the Claddagh ringleaders and two Salames and the Halfa Ham with two fat Maharashers and the German silver geyser and he polished up gorgeous, tintinabulating to himself. And there was J. B. Dunlop, the tyrant of his time, French wine stuarts and Tudor keepsakes and the Cesarewitch for the currant counter riding up the
holy staircase on muleback hindquarters to the fore and he holding on to his national anthem <u>Horsey, Keep your tail up!</u> and as much as the vacant throne room could safely accomodate of the house of Orange &amp; Bitters, permeated by druids and brehons and flawhoolaghs and anti parnellites, all murdering Irish out of their boon companions, for to nobble or salvage their bit of him, the poor
old basiloose, Dodderick Ogonach Wreck, lying high as he lay with his buttend up for sale after inspection, most highly astounded, as it was, at thus being reduced to nothing.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; D&apos;yu mean to set there where
<br><font color="green">{ms, 95}</font>
<br> y&apos;are now, repeating yurself, Sorley boy, and tell me that?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I mean to sit here where you are now, surly guy, replete in myself, as long as I live. If I can&apos;t upset this pound of ollaves I can sit setup upon him.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Olivers. Was that a groan did I hear or the Dingle bagpipes? Is the mound moving or what is under this, tell me?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Lay yur lug to the groun, mon. They&apos;re playing thimbles and bodkins. Hep! Whu&apos;s within?<a target="foot" id="frz0002">&ordm;</a>
<br><font color="green">{ms, 97}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Now<a target="foot" id="frz0003">&ordm;</a> just permit me a moment. Are you there? Hello! Sybil Head, here. Yes. Very good now. Do you remember the night following the fair day?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Well.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; There were fires on every bald hill in holy Ireland that night?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You may say they were.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Were they bonfires?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; No other name would at all befit them <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">but</span></span> unless that. With their blue beards streaming to the heavens.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Was it a fine night now?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Finest night mortal ever saw.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Was there rain by any chance?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Plenty.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; There was a fall of snow as well, I gather.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; The nicest at all.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Did not it blow some wind rather strongly to less?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Out of all jokes it did.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Do you recollect whether the moon was shining at all?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Sure she was.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I see. Now you know the kikkenmidden where the couple first met with each other.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Indeed &amp; I do.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; There is a tree there stuck up.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; There is. The grandest tree in all the world.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 98}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; How grand is it? Are you connected with it yourself, maybe? I mean the tree. He or she?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Upfellbowm.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Are you acquainted with a pagany <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">w</span></span> better known as Toucher Doyle who is. Consider yourself on the stand now &amp; watch your words.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I consider I would be frightfully ashamed if I was.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; He is a man of around 50 who <a name="n12132e" href="../../FF/fnbs/n12all.htm#n12132e">does messages</a>. Have you ever heard of him being seen down at the Green Man beyond.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; As mad as the brambles he is.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Now, brush up your memory a bit. Was he wearing false clothes for the occasion?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I am sorry to have to tell you they were coming down from off him.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Now cast your eyes around and tell us as briefly as you can how the whole thing took place<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">?</span></span>.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; First he wanted a match. <a name="n12168b" href="../../FF/fnbs/n12all.htm#n12168b">Then counting 30 seconds he was cursing at him to know who burned the hay which the man</a> <a name="n12168b" href="../../FF/fnbs/n12all.htm#n12168b">knew nothing about</a>.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; In other words was this how the <a name="n12213l" href="../../FF/fnbs/n12all.htm#n12213l">funeral games</a> started?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Truly.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 99}</font> </p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Will you swear all the same you saw their shadows struggling and kicking up fallen leaves for the wind?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; I will. If so, it&apos;s the will of G&mdash;</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; And this pootsch went on night after night according to you. For years and years perhaps?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; That&apos;s right.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; D&apos;yu mean to tall us on yur oath, my lad, yer moon was shining <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">raw</span></span> rain wind &amp; snow night after night for years and years perhaps after yu swearing to it a while back the other way about that there was rain in plenty all the time?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Perhaps so. I never thought about it, faith.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Will yu swear to it now and recant that all you swore to then was false?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ay. I swear to it that it was.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Let me again. Now, this other point. Did you know that one of these two, the man with the fender or the man with the coffin, if you prefer that, was accused of a certain offence or of a choice of two offences, if you like it better that way? Did you now?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You hear things.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <a name="n12166e" href="../../FF/fnbs/n12all.htm#n12166e">Which would you select of the two</a>
<br><font color="green">{ms, 100}</font>
<br> <a name="n12166e" href="../../FF/fnbs/n12all.htm#n12166e">for choice</a> if you had your way. Are there any orangemen in your family tree?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; It all depends on what you mean by that family?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Have you ever reflected, witness, that the evil though it were chosen might nevertheless lead somehow unto good toward the generality?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Me and Frisky Shorty was just arguing friendly like over the old party. What me and Frisky wants to know is thisahere: Supposing him to have taken his epicene licence respectively as regards them male privates and or concomitantly with all common or neuter respects to them public females as was very properly detained by the metropolitan in connection with this regrettable
nuisance being in strict contravention of schedule in board of forests &amp; waters&apos; byelaw regulating amusements section of our beloved park in pursuance me &amp; Frisky have approached a reverend gentleman of the name of Mr Coppinger as was most obliging in this matter of his explanations given to me and Frisky touching the
<br><font color="green">{ms, 101}</font>
<br> merits of early bisexualism besides him citing example given by a valued friend of the Reverend Mr Coppinger of the name of Mr J.P. Cockshott as owns a pretty maisonette fronting on to the South Bluffs as was telling us how Mr Cockshott he tells him, the Reverend Mr Coppinger, as how he reckoned up to 7 mile of a school of herring passing Bloater Bay point from 12.a.m. on by the silent hour.
And, reverend, he says, gut me but them herring was as gladful as kippers could well be considering, flipping their little coppingers, pot em, the fresh little flirties, the dirty little gillybrighteners, pickle their spratties, the little smolty gallockers, and, reverend, says he, them little salty populators, says he, as sure as my eggs is on cockshot entre nous, all them little upanddowndippies
they was all of a wriggolo doodah in testimonial
<br><font color="green">{ms, 102}</font>
<br> to their early bisexualism.</p>

<p class="pdi">&mdash; Wait now, Leixlip. I don&apos;t follow you that far. You are taking us into the future or are you not with this fishery.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Gubbernathor! And he was nothing short of one! Spawning all over the seven parishes!</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Lift it now, <a name="n12208i" href="../../FF/fnbs/n12all.htm#n12208i">Hosty</a>. He&apos;s your mark!</p>

<p class="pdi">&mdash; Hep! Hold that lad! Play him!</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Whoop!</span></span> Pull you, sir! A moment now did he rise?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Never a fear but you&apos;ll land him yet, Slipperyscales on liffeybank. Do you think they will? I&apos;m sure they will. Among the shivering sedges so? Weedywaving. <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">The</span></span> Or tulipbeds of Rush below?</p>

<p class="poem">&mdash; <u>Three in one. One and three.
<br> Shem &amp; Shaun &amp; the shame that sunders them
<br> Wisdom&apos;s son. Folly&apos;s brother.</u></p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Ah, God, sure I thought it was larking with 2 fine young girls he was that time. I was given to understand there was a pair of girls that was mad gone on him. Sure she was near drowned in <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">her</span></span> admiration for herself, making faces at her likeness in the stream after, all tossed as she was.</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; Listen, meme dearest. Of course I know you are a very wicked girl. Still you do look lovely. My, you do! Listen, meme sweety. It&apos;s only us two. Of course it was downright wicked of him, really it was. Still, me and you will make it up. So as nobody of course need ever know. So meme mearest, be free to me and, listen, youyou beauty, we&apos;ll be true to you.

<p class="pdi">&mdash; How&apos;s this at all at all? One moment. This young lady what exactly is she doing with herself?</p>
<p class="pdi">&mdash; You&apos;re talking out of yer turn, man. Answer my queskions first. Did the food inspector fine more than 16% of water in his purity flower? We&apos;re here to know had the two generals who have been getting nosemoney cheap &amp; stirring up public opinion with their legs had they their service books in order &amp; duly signed when discharged from their last situations? How
did Magrath come into awful position of the barrel of wash? Where were the doughboys, 3 in number, directing their steps according to the liaison officer with trenchcoats open &amp; their hands in their pockets contrary to military rules when confronted with his obstruction? Is it a fact that this nordic is subowner of a hengster&apos;s circus &amp; has been complaining in the police barracks
&amp; applying for an order of certiorari &amp; crying that he has been molested by offers of vacancies from females in this city neighing after the man
