<p> Jaunty Jaun, as I was shortly before that made aware, next halted to fetch a breath, the first leg of his nightstride being pulled through, and to loosen (let God&apos;s son now be looking down on to the poor preambler!) both of his bruised brogues that were plainly made a good bit before his hosen were at the weir by Lazar&apos;s Walk (for far and wide, as
<font color="red"><sup><small>|s12</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">broad</span></span> <font color="black">large</font><font color="red"><sup><small>s12|</small></sup></font> as he was <font color="red"><sup><small>|s12</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">long</span></span>
<font color="black">lively</font><font color="red"><sup><small>s12|</small></sup></font>, was he noted for his humane treatment of any kind of abused footgear), a matter of maybe nine score or so barrelhours&apos; distance off, as truly he merited to do. He was there, I could planimetrically see, when I took a closer look at him, that was to say, greatly altered for the brighter though still the
graven image of his squarer self as he was used to be, perspiring but happy notwithstanding his foot was still asleep on him, the way he thought by the holy januarious he had a bullock&apos;s hoof in his buskin, with his halluxes so splendid, through Ireland untranscended, bigmouthed poesther, propped up, restant, against a butterblond warden of the peace, one comestabulish Sigurdsen, who, buried
upright like the Osbornes, had tumbled slumbersomely on sleep at night duty behind the curing station, equilebriated amid the embracings of a monopolised bottle.
<br><font color="green">{f39, 430}</font> </p>
<p> Now, there were as many as twentynine hedgedaughters out of Saint Brigid&apos;s national nightschool (for I seemed to remember how it was still a look before you leap year) learning their antemeridian lesson of life, beseated as they were upon the brinkspondy, attracted to the rare sight of the first human yellowstone landmark while they paddled away keeping time magnetically with their eight
and fifty pedalettes, playing foolyfool jouay allo misto posto,
<br><font color="green">{f10, 334}</font>
<br> all barely in their typtap teens, describing a charming dactylogram of nocturnes though repelled by the snores of the log who looked stuck to the sod as ever and oft, when liquefied, he murmoaned abasourdly in his Dutchener&apos;s native, visibly unmoved, over his treasure trove for the crown: <i>Dotter dead bedstead mean diggy smuggy flasky!</i></p>
<p> Jaun (after he had in the first place doffed a hat with a reinforced crown and bowed to all the others in that chorus of praise of goodwill girls on their best beehiviour who all they were girls all rushing sowarmly for the post as buzzy as sie could bie to read his kisshands, kittering all about, rushing and making a tremendous girlsfuss over him pellmale and his rosyposy smile, mussing his
frizzy hair and the gollywog curls of him all done in loveletters like a trayful of cloudberry tartlets and smilingly smelling, pair and pair about, broad by bread and slender to slimmer, the nice perfumios that came peeling off him (nice!) which was angelic simply, savouring of wild thyme and parsley jumbled with breadcrumbs (O nice!) asinging to his stamen and apetting of his pistil and feeling
his full fat pouch for him so tactily and jingaling his jellybags, for he was just the killingest ladykiller all by kindness now you, Jaun, asking kindlily (hillo, missies!) after their howareyous at all with those of their dollybegs, and where&apos;s Agatha&apos;s lamb? and how are the two columbillas?) next went on (finefeelingfit!) to drop a few stray remarks anent their personal appearances
and the contrary tastes displayed in their tight kittycasques and their smart frickyfrockies, asking coy one after sloy one had she read Irish legginds and gently reproving one that the ham of her hom could be seen below her hem and whispering another aside that the hook of her hum was open a bittock at her back, to have a side-eye to that, hom, and all of course just to fill up a form out of pure
human kindness and in a sprite of fun, for Jaun, by the way, was by way of becoming (I think, I hope he was) the most purely human being that ever was called man. Jaun, after those few prelimbs, made out through his horoscope the apparition of his fond sister Izzy, for he knowed his love by her waves of splabashing and she showed him proof by her way of blubushing, nor could he forget her so
tarnelly easy as all that since he was brotherbesides her benedict godfather and heaven knows he thought the world and his life of her sweet heart <font color="red"><sup><small>|s12</small></sup></font><font color="black">could buy </font><font color="red"><sup><small>s12|</small></sup></font>, poor, good, true, Jaun.
<br><font color="green">{f10, 335}</font> </p>
<p class="di">&mdash; Sister dearest, Jaun delivered himself with express cordiality, marked by clearance of diction and general delivery, as he began to take leave of his scholastica at once so as to gain time with deep affection, we honestly believe you soeurly will miss us the moment we exit yet we feel as a martyr to the dischurch of all duty that it is about time, by Great Harry, we would
shove off to stray on our long last journey and not be the load on ye. This is the gross proceeds of your teachings in which we were raised, you, Sis, that used to write to us the exceeding nice letters for presentation and would be telling us anon (full well do we wont to recall to mind) thy oldworld tales of homespinning and derringdo and dieobscure and daddyho, those tales which reliterately
whisked oft our heart so narrated by thou, gesweest, to perfection, our pet pupil of the whole rhythmetic class and the mainsay of our erigenal house, the time we younkers twain were fairly tossing ourselves (O Phoebus! O Pollux!) in bed, having
<br><font color="green">{f39, 432}</font>
<br> been laid up with Castor&apos;s oil on the Parrish&apos;s syrup (the night we well remember) for to share our hard suite of affections with thee.</p>

saying sermon in an offrand way and confidences petween pees like ourselves in so and so many nuncupiscent words about how he had just been confarreating teat-&agrave;-teat with two viragos intactas and what an awful life he led, poorish priced, and what a lawful day it was, there and then, for a consommation with an effusion and how, by all the manny larries ate pignatties, how he&apos;d marry me
