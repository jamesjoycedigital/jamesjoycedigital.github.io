He is believed to have committed simple infidelities with Felicia, a virgin, and to be practising for unnatural coits with
<a name="n20022c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20022c">Eugenius</a> and <a name="n20022h" href="../../ff/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20022h">Jeremias</a>, two <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">adelph</span></span> philadelphians. <a name="n20022g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20022g">Honuphrius</a>, Felicia, <a name="n20022c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20022c">Eugenius</a> and
<a name="n20022h" href="../../ff/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20022h">Jeremias</a> are consanguineous to the last degree. Anita, the wife of <a name="n20022g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20022g">Honuphrius</a>, believes <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">that her</span></span> has been told by her maidservant Fortissa that her man has confessed
<br><font color="green">{ms, 44v}</font>
<br> under chastisement that he has <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">encouraged Magravius</span></span> instructed his slave Mauritius to facilitate Magravius, a <a name="n19046f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n19all.htm#n19046f">commercial</a> rival of <a name="n20022g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20022g">Honuphrius</a>, to solicit the chastity of Anita. Anita is informed by
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">her</span></span> some children that Gillia, the wife of Magravius, is visited clandestinely by the advocate of <a name="n20022g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20022g">Honuphrius</a>, an immoral person. Gillia has been early debauched by <a name="n20022g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20022g">Honuphrius</a>
<br><font color="green">{ms, 45v}</font>
<br> and Magravius knows that Anita has formerly committed double sacrilege with Michael, a <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">subd</span></span> perpetual curate. Magravius threatens to have Anita molested by Sulla, a bandit, if he will not yield to him and also deceive <a name="n20022g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20022g">Honuphrius</a> by rendering duty when demanded. Anita, who
has incestuous temptations from <a name="n20022h" href="../../ff/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20022h">Jeremias</a> &amp; <a name="n20022c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20022c">Eugenius</a>, would yield to the lewdness

<br> of <a name="n20022g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20022g">Honuphrius</a> in order to save the virginity of Felicia for Magravius, when converted by Michael after the death of Gillia, though she fears that by doing so she will encourage reprehensible conduct between <a name="n20022c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20022c">Eugenius</a> &amp;
<a name="n20022h" href="../../ff/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20022h">Jeremias</a>. Michael, who has formerly debauched Anita, warns her particularly against yielding to <a name="n20022g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20022g">Honuphrius</a> who pretends to possess her in all manners for his
<br><font color="green">{ms, 47v}</font>
<br> carnal pleasure whenever he has rendered himself impotent by subdolence. Fortissa encourages Anita by describing the chastisements of <a name="n20022g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20022g">Honuphrius</a> and the <a name="n11100e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n11all.htm#n11100e">depravities</a> of Canicula, the deceased wife of Mauritius.

Owens holds that while there is a

He cites <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Humphreys &amp;</span></span> Brerfuchs &amp; Warren, a firm registered as Tango Limited. The action was at the suit of the trustee of the Irish Church Emergency for payment of tithes due, was heard by Judge Doyle &amp; a common
jury. For the defence it was stated that <a name="n20023e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20023e">payment had been made</a>. The fund trustee counterclaimed that this was by <a name="n20022f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20022f">crossed cheque</a> drawn by the

<br> senior partner, by whom the lodgment had been made but in their joint name. The bank particularised, the National declined to pay |xthe trustee negotiated it to a client from whom he received legal relief on consideration|x* and the cheque, a washable one, had been circulating in the country for over 20 years among holders of Tango Stock (a rival concern) though not a farthing had ever
crossed the counter in the

<br> form of coin. <a name="n20012c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20012c">The jury, all of whom were Doyles</a>, naturally disagreed whereupon the judge ordered the attachment of the firm. Only the junior partner could be found &amp; this turned out to be a woman. She stated that payment would be made to her by the senior in the form of unwashable blank cheques, her various

<br><font color="green">{ms, 55v}</font>
<br> satisfaction with the trustee, Monsignore Pepigi, but this was ruled out on appeal by <a name="n20031h" href="../../ff/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20031h">Jeremy</a> who held that as the woman was born without <a name="n14239b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n14all.htm#n14239b">mancipium</a> no property could exist in a corpse Pepigi&apos;s pact was piffle &amp; she cd
