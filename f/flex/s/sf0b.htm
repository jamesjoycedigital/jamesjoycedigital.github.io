<p> Where are we at all?</p>
<p> Interior of home on <a name="n18198f" href="../../FF/fnbs/n18all.htm#n18198f">outskirts</a> of city. Ordinary bedroom set. Right, empty grate. Bed for two. Chair for one. Woman&apos;s clothes on chair. Man&apos;s <a name="sa0901cj" href="../../FF/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0901cj">trousers, collar <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">with tie</span></span> on bedknob</a>.
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Sm</span></span> Man&apos;s coat on nail, wall right. Woman&apos;s gown on ditto, ditto left. Small table near bed, front. <a name="n19054h" href="../../FF/fnbs/n19all.htm#n19054h">lamp</a> without globe, newspaper, Saint Andrew&apos;s tie, glass etc on table. Time: about four a.m.</p>
<p> Man with nightcap in bed, fore<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span>. Woman with curlpins, discovered. First position. Man looking round, beastly expression, exhibits rage. <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Woman looking up</span></span> ruddy blond, large
<br><font color="green">{ms, 31v}</font>
<br> build, any age. Woman, sitting <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">up</span></span>, looks at ceiling: haggish expression, beaky nose, exhibits fear: sallow tint, undersized, any age.</p>
<p> <a name="n18225b" href="../../FF/fnbs/n18all.htm#n18225b">Cry<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">. So</span></span>, off.</a></p>
<p> <a name="n19226b" href="../../FF/fnbs/n19all.htm#n19226b">By the sinewy forequarters of the mare</a> Pocahontas, you should have seen how that little sallowlass hopped out of bed and in one, five <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">and</span></span>, nine, she was gone and the <a name="n19054h" href="../../FF/fnbs/n19all.htm#n19054h">lamp</a> with her and biglimbs in the gloom of her
wake.</p>
<p> The house looks a thing incomplete <a name="n19212a" href="../../FF/fnbs/n19all.htm#n19212a">but it will be fine</a> <a name="n19212a" href="../../FF/fnbs/n19all.htm#n19212a">when it is finished</a>. The <a name="n19193f" href="../../FF/fnbs/n19all.htm#n19193f">arkwright</a> put in a staircase, certainly: it has only one step to take but all the more they are going upstairs. Tell me something.
<a name="n19029b" href="../../FF/fnbs/n19all.htm#n19029b">The Porters are very nice people, are they not? Very.</a> Mr Porter<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span> (behind, in mackerel shirt) is an
<br><font color="green">{ms, 32v}</font>
<br> excellent father and <a name="n19218d" href="../../FF/fnbs/n19all.htm#n19218d">Mrs Porter</a><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span> (leading, in saffron bun nightdress) is a most kindhearted mother. They care for nothing except what is porter. One can see they <a name="n19214a" href="../../FF/fnbs/n19all.htm#n19214a">come of a very old family by their costumes</a>. I
think I begin to divine your point somehow.</p>
<p> Here are two rooms on the upstairs, on the fork side and the knife side. Whom are they for? Why, for little porters, to be saved. <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Who</span></span> Ah, so? Who sleeps in <a name="n19168g" href="../../FF/fnbs/n19all.htm#n19168g">number one</a>? A pussy. How sweet of her! Has your pussy a name? Yes, indeed, and she is named Buttercup. How very sweet
of her! <a name="n19221d" href="../../FF/fnbs/n19all.htm#n19221d">And what an excessively charming name</a> <a name="n19221d" href="../../FF/fnbs/n19all.htm#n19221d">now that I come to drink of it</a>, a cups fulled with butter. Alone? Alone what? I mean does
<br><font color="green">{ms, 33v}</font>
<br> sleep with herself? <a name="n19219a" href="../../FF/fnbs/n19all.htm#n19219a">She is never lonely for she can always look</a> <a name="n19219c" href="../../FF/fnbs/n19all.htm#n19219c">and talk</a> to her little <a name="n19224d" href="../../FF/fnbs/n19all.htm#n19224d">playfilly</a>. O she talks, does she? Ah Biddles es ma plikplak ah plek wat Biddles. A nice light baritone she has but
<a name="n19220c" href="../../FF/fnbs/n19all.htm#n19220c">I much prefer the name of Buttercups. So do I, much.</a> She strikes the onlooker as a beautiful promise, more so than Selina or Teasy or Fauna or Flora.</p>
<p> <a name="n19218b" href="../../FF/fnbs/n19all.htm#n19218b">And who sleeps in room</a> <a name="n19168g" href="../../FF/fnbs/n19all.htm#n19168g">number two</a>? <a name="n19214c" href="../../FF/fnbs/n19all.htm#n19214c">The two birds.</a> O, I see. Of what age are they? They are twins, you see, and they seem to be <a name="n19218c" href="../../FF/fnbs/n19all.htm#n19218c">greatly attached</a> to
each other, I think I notice, do I not? You do. Kevin is the farther away. Do not you waken him. He is happily asleep, <a name="n19218e" href="../../FF/fnbs/n19all.htm#n19218e">the little angel he
<br><font color="green">{ms, 34v}</font>
<br> looks like</a>, and his mouth is semiope as if he were <a name="n19216a" href="../../FF/fnbs/n19all.htm#n19216a">blowdelling a bugicle</a>. O, <a name="n19222a" href="../../FF/fnbs/n19all.htm#n19222a">I ador</a>e the music. <a name="n19222b" href="../../FF/fnbs/n19all.htm#n19222b">He is too adorable really.</a> I guess I have seen someone like him in my times, guess I met someone who must
have been like what he will probably be. But hush! I beg your pardon, sincerely I do. The other twin, you see, has been crying in his sleep, <a name="n19218f" href="../../FF/fnbs/n19all.htm#n19218f">the little devil</a>. That is Jerry but you cannot see what he has in his hand because I have not told you. He is quite one
<br><font color="green">{ms, 35v}</font>
<br> of the <a name="n19202d" href="../../FF/fnbs/n19all.htm#n19202d">blake</a> tribe by already. <a name="n19202d" href="../../FF/fnbs/n19all.htm#n19202d">Blake?</a> Whatever do you mean with <a name="n19202d" href="../../FF/fnbs/n19all.htm#n19202d">blake</a>? With <a name="n19202d" href="../../FF/fnbs/n19all.htm#n19202d">blake</a> I mean ink. O, I see. They are two nice little porters, in my
opinion, indeed. Adieu, for the present, kerryjevin!</p>
<p> What is the view which now takes up second position, tell it, please? You notice that way because the male imposition masks the female. It is called <a name="n20002d" href="../../FF/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20002d">meseedi</a>. <a name="n19216e" href="../../FF/fnbs/n19all.htm#n19216e">Do you ever hear the story</a> of Helyus <a name="n18231b" href="../../FF/fnbs/n18all.htm#n18231b">Croesus</a>,
<a name="n19220b" href="../../FF/fnbs/n19all.htm#n19220b">only gold and white Elephant in our zoo</a>? You astonish me by it. Is it not that we have here from back a <a name="n19226c" href="../../FF/fnbs/n19all.htm#n19226c">profusely</a> fine <a name="n19214b" href="../../FF/fnbs/n19all.htm#n19214b">birdseye</a> from this park? It has been much the
<br><font color="green">{ms, 36v}</font>
<br> admiration of many of the strangers here. The road in the centre bisects the park which is said to be the largest of its kind in the world. Towards the right you see the viceregal lodge while exactly opposite is the equally handsome chief secreatory residence. The black &amp; blue markings indicate the presence of sylvan <a name="n19208a" href="../../FF/fnbs/n19all.htm#n19208a">belts</a>.
Some pretty deers are to be caught. At the lowest end a depression, called the <a name="n19213h" href="../../FF/fnbs/n19all.htm#n19213h">Hollow</a>. It is often quite gloomy and gives bad thoughts to the head but the band of the
<br><font color="green">{ms, 37v}</font>
<br> Metropolitan Police plays in it on Satursday afternoons their wellsounding tones. Why do you begin to tremble at this moment when <a name="n19015h" href="../../FF/fnbs/n19all.htm#n19015h">I am to place my hand on your knee</a> to mark well what <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">you</span></span> I say. You Say? In Amsterdam he met... But how? You are trembletting like a jerry! O,
keep silence! I have heard her voice somewhere else in <a name="n20139e" href="../../FF/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20139e">these ears</a> that are mine.</p> </p>  </main>
