<p> The old humburgh looks a thing incomplete, so. It is so. On its dead. But it will pawn up a fine head of porter when it is finished. In the quicktime.

<p> Tell me something. The Porters, so to speak, after their shadowstealers in the newsbaggers, are very nice people, are they not? Very, all fourlike tellt. And on this wise. Mr Porter (Bartholomew, heavy man, astern, mackerel shirt, hayamatt peruke) is an excellent forefather and Mrs Porter (leading lady, apoopahead, gaffneysaffron nightdress, iszoppy chepelure) is a most kindhearted messmother.
A so united family pateramater is not more existing on papel or off of it. As keymaster fits the lock it weds so this bally builder to his streamline secret. They care for nothing except everything that is allporterous. <i>Porto da Brozzo!</i> Isn&apos;t that terribly nice of them? You can ken that they come of a rarely old family by their costumance and one must togive that one supped of it in

Yes, indeed,
you will hear it passim in all the noveletta and she is named Buttercup. Her bare name will tellt it, a monitress. How very sweet of her and what an excessively lovecharming missyname to forsake, now that I come to drink of it filtred, a gracecup fulled of bitterness.

little doth she realise, as morning fresheth, it hath happened her, you know what, as they too what I dare not utter. Silvoo plush, if scolded she draws a face. Petticoat&apos;s asleep but in the gentlenest of her thoughts apoo is a nursepin. To be presented, Babs for Bimbushi? Of courts and with enticers. Up, girls, and at him! Alone? Alone what?

A nice jezebel barytinette she will gift, this strifestirrer, but I much prefer her missnomer in maidenly golden lasslike gladsome wenchful flowery
girlish beautycapes. Dulcidelicatissima! So do I, much. Allaliefest, she who pities very pebbles, dare we not wish on her our thrice onsk? A lovely fear! That she seventip toe her chrysming, that she spin blaa to scarlach till her templar veil, that the Mount of Whoam it open it her to shelterer! She will blow ever so much more promisefuller, blee me, than all the other common marygales that romp

<p> And, since we are talking amnessly of bunkasloop and crazdledaze, who doez in sleeproom number twobis? The twobirds. Holy policeman, O, I see! Of what age are your birdies? They are to come of twinning age so soon as they may be born to be eldering like those olders while they are living under chairs. They are? And they seem to be so tightly tattached as two maggots to touch other, I think I
notice, do I not? You do. Our bright bull babe, Frank Kevin, is on heartsleeveside. Do not you waken him! Our farheard bode. He is happily to sleep, limb of the Lord, with his lifted in blessing, his bachal Iosa, like the blissed angel he looks so like and his mou is semiope as though he were blowdelling on a bugigle.

But they are two very blizky little portereens after their bredscrums, Jerkoff and Eatsup, as for my part opinion indeed. They would be born so, costarred, puck and prig, the maryboy at the Donnybrook Fair, the godolphinglad in the Hoey&apos;s Court. How frilled one shall be as at taledold of Formio and Cigalette!

<p> Jeminy! What is the view which now takes up a second position of discordance, tell it, please? Mark! You notice it in that rereway because the male entail partially eclipses the femecovert. It is so called for its discord the meseedo. Do you ever heard the story about Helius Croesus, that white and gold Elephant in our zoopark? You astonish me by it. Is it not that we are commanding from
fullback, woman permitting, a profusely fine birdseye view from beauhind this park? Finn his park has been much the admiration of all the stranger ones, greekish and romanos, who arrive to here. The straight road down the centre (see relief map) bisexes the park which is said to be the largest of his kind in the world. On the right prominence confronts you the handsome vinesregent&apos;s lodge
while, turning to the other supreme piece of cheeks, exactly opposite, you are confounded by the equally handsome chief sacristary&apos;s residence. Around is a little amiably tufted and man is cheered when he bewonders through the boskage how the nature in all frisko is enlivened by gentlemen&apos;s seats. Here are heavysupperdaddies&apos; housings for hundredaires of our super thin thousand. By
gum, but you have resin! Of these tallworts are yielded out juices for jointoils and pappasses for paynims. Listeneth! &apos;Tis a tree story. How olave, that firile, was aplantad in her liveside. How tannoboom held tonobloom. How rood in norlandes. The black and blue marks athwart the weald, which now barely is so stripped, indicate the prepresence of sylvious beltings. Therewithal shady rides
lend themselves out to rustic cavalries. In yonder valley, too, stays mountain sprite. Any pretty dears are to be caught inside but it is a bad pities of the plain. A scarlet pimparnell now mules the mound where anciently first murders were wanted to take root. By feud fionghalian. Talking tree and sinning stone stay on either hand.

<p> Let us consider.</p>
<p> The procurator Interrogarius Mealterum persends us this proposer.</p>
<p> Honuphrius is a concupiscent exservicemajor who makes dishonest propositions to all. He is considered to have committed, invoking <i>droit d&apos;oreiller</i>, simple infidelities with Felicia, a virgin, and to be practising for unnatural coits with Eugenius and Jeremias, two or three philadelphians. Honuphrius, Felicia, Eugenius and Jeremias are consanguineous to the lowest degree. Anita, the
wife of Honuphrius, has been told by her tirewoman, Fortissa, that Honuphrius has blasphemously confessed under voluntary chastisement that he has instructed his slave Mauritius, a widower, to facilitate their neighbour Magravius, a commercial emulous of Honuphrius, to solicit the chastity of Anita. Anita is informed by some illegitimate children
<br><font color="green">{f10, 446}</font>
<br> of Fortissa with Mauritius (the supposition is Ware&apos;s) that Gillia, the schismatical wife of Magravius, is visited clandestinely by Barnabas, the advocate of Honuphrius, an immoral person who has been corrupted by Jeremias. Gillia (a cooler blend, D&apos;Alton insists), <i>ex equo</i> with Poppea, Arancita, Clara,
<br><font color="green">{f39, 573}</font>
<br> Marinuzza, Indra and Iodina, has been tenderly debauched (in Halliday&apos;s view) by Honuphrius, and Magravius knows from spies that Anita has formerly committed double sacrilege with Michael, <i>vulgo</i> Cerularius, a perpetual curate who wishes to seduce Eugenius. Magravius threatens to have Anita molested by Sulla, an orthodox savage (and leader of a band of twelve mercenaries, the
Sullivani) who desires to procure Felicia for Gregorius, Leo, Vitellius and Macdugalius, four excavators, if she will not yield to him and also deceive Honuphrius by rendering conjugal duty when demanded. Anita, who claims to have discovered incestuous temptations from Jeremias and Eugenius, would yield to the lewdness of Honuphrius to appease the savagery of Sulla and the mercernariness of the
twelve Sullivani and (as Gilbert at first suggested) to save the virginity of Felicia for Magravius, when converted by Michael after the death of Gillia, but she fears that by allowing his marital rights she may cause reprehensible conduct between Eugenius and Jeremias. Michael, who has formerly debauched Anita, dispenses her from yielding to Honuphrius who pretends publicly to possess his
conjunct in thirtynine several manners (<i>turpiter!</i> affirm <i>ex cathedris</i> Gerontes Cambronses) for carnal hygiene whenever he has rendered himself impotent to consummate by subdolence. Anita is disturbed, but Michael comminates that he will reserve her case tomorrow for the ordinary Guglielmus even if she should practise a pious fraud during affrication which, from experience, she knows
(according to Wadding) to be leading to nullity. Fortissa, however, is encouraged by Gregorius, Leo, Vitellius and Magdugalius, reunitedly, to warn Anita by describing the strong chastisements of Honuphrius and the depravities (<i>turpissimas!</i>) of Canicula, the deceased wife of Mauritius, with Sulla, the simoniac, who is abnegand and repents. Has he hegemony and shall she submit?</p>

<p> This, layreaders and gentilemen, is perhaps the commonest of all cases arising out of umbrella history in connection with
<br><font color="green">{f39, 574}</font>
<br> the wood industries in our courts of litigation. D&apos;Oyly Owens holds (though Finn Magnusson of himself holds also) that so long as there is a joint deposit account in the two names a mutual obligation is posited. Owens cites Brerfuchs and Warren, a foreign firm, since disseized, registered as Tangos, Limited, for the sale of certain proprietary articles. The action, which was at the
instance of the
<br><font color="green">{f10, 447}</font>
<br> trustee of the Heathen Church Emergency fund, suing by its trustee, a resigned civil servant, for the payment of tithes due, was heard by Judge Doyle and also by a common jury. No question arose as to the debt for which vouchers spoke volumes. The defence alleged that payment had been made effective. The fund trustee, one Jucundus Fecundus Xero Pecundus Coppercheap, counterclaimed that
payment was invalid, having been tendered to creditor under cover of a crossed cheque, signed in the ordinary course, in the name of Wieldhelm, hurls cross, voucher copy provided, and drawn by the senior partner only by whom the lodgment of the species had been effected but in their joint names. The bank particularised, the National Misery (now almost entirely in the hands of the four chief
bondholders for value in Tangos, Limited), declined to pay the draft, though there were ample reserves to meet the liability, whereupon the trusty Coppercheap negotiated it for and on behalf of the fund of the thing to a client of his, a notary, from whom, on consideration, he received in exchange legal relief as between trusthee and bethrust, with thanks. Since then the cheque, a good washable
pink, embossed D you D no 11 hundred and thirty 2, good for the figure and face, had been circulating in the country for over thirtynine years among holders of Pango stock, a rival concern, though not one demonetised farthing had ever spun or fluctuated across the counter in the semblance of hard coin or liquid cash. The jury (a sour dozen of stout fellows all of whom were curiously named after
Doyles) naturally disagreed, jointly and severally, and the belligerent judge, disagreeing with the allied jurors&apos; disagreement, went outside his jurisfiction altogether and ordered a garnishee attachment to the neutral firm. No <i>mandamus</i> could locate the depleted Whilom Breyfawkes as he had entered into an
<br><font color="green">{f39, 575}</font>
<br> ancient moratorium, dating back to the times of the early barters, and only the junior partner Barren could be found, who entered an appearance and turned up, add woman in, among the male jurors, an obsolete turfwoman originally from the proletarian class with still a good title to her sexname of Ann Doyle, 2 Coppinger&apos;s Cottages, the Doyle Country. Doyle (Ann), upon a notice of motion
and after service of the motion by interlocutory injunction, having regretfully left the juryboxers, protested cheerfully on the stand in a long jurymiad <i>in re</i> corset checks, delivered in Doylish, that she had often, in supply to brusk demands rising almost to bollion point, discounted Mr Brakeforth&apos;s first of all in exchange at nine months from date without issue and, to be strictly
literal, unbottled in corrubberation a current account of how she had been made at sight for services rendered the payee-drawee of unwashable blank assignations, sometimes pinkwilliams (laughter) but more often of the <i>cr&egrave;me-de-citron</i>, <i>vair &eacute;mail paoncoque</i> or marshmallow
<br><font color="green">{f10, 448}</font>
<br> series, which she, as bearer, used to endorse, adhesively, to her various payers-drawers who in most cases were identified by the timber papers as wellknown tetigists of the city and suburban. The witness, at her own request, asked if she might and wrought something between the sheets of music paper which she had accompanied herself with for the occasion and, this having been handed up for
the bench to look at <i>in camera</i>, Coppinger&apos;s doll, as she was called (<i>annias</i>, MackErse&apos;s Dar, the adopted child), then proposed to jerrykin and jureens and every jim, jock and jarry in that little green courtinghousie for her satisfaction and as a whole act of settlement to reamalgamate herself, tomorrow perforce, in pardonership with the permanent suing fond trustee,
Monsignore Pepigi, under the new style of Will Breakfast and Sparrem, as, when all his cognisances had been estreated, he seemed to proffer the steadiest interest towards her, but this prepoposal was ruled out on appeal by Judge Jeremy Doyler who, reserving judgment in a matter of courts and reversing the findings of the lower correctional, found, beyond doubt of treason, fending the dissassents
of the pickpackpanel, twelve as upright judaces as ever let down their thoms, and, <i>occupante extremum</i>
<br><font color="green">{f39, 576}</font>
<br> <i>scabie</i>, handed down to the jury of the Liffey that, as a matter of tact, the woman they gave as free was born into contractual incapacity (the Calif of Man <i>v</i> the Eaudelusk Company) when, how and where Mamy&apos;s Mancipium Act did not apply and therefore held supremely that, as no property in law can exist in a corpse (Hal Kilbride <i>v</i> Una Bellina), Pepigi&apos;s pact was
pure piffle (loud laughter) and Wharrem could whistle for the rhino. Will you, won&apos;t you, pango with Pepigi? Not for, Nancy, how dare you do! And whew whewwhew whew. </p>

<p> Following idly up to seepoint, neath kingmount shadow, the ilk for eke of us, whose nathem&apos;s banned, whose hofd a-hooded, welkim warsail, how did you dew?

Or did wolken hang o&apos;er earth in umber hue his fulmenbomb? Number two coming! Full inside!
Was glimpsed the mean amount of cloud? Or did pitter rain fall in a sprinkling? If the waters could speak as they flow! Tingle Tom, pull the bell! Izzy&apos;s busy down the dell! Mizpah low, youyou, number one, in deep humidity! Listen, misled peerless, please! You are, of course. You miss him so, to listleto! Of course, my pledge between us, there&apos;s no-one noel like him here to hear. Esch so
eschess, douls a doulse! Since Allan Rogue loved Arrah Pogue it&apos;s all Killdroughall fair. Triss! Only trees such as these, such were those, waving there, the Barketree, the O&apos;Briertree, the Rowantree, the O&apos;Corneltree, the Behanshrub near Windy Arbour, the Magill O&apos;Dendron More. Trem! All the trees in the wood they trembold, humbild, when they heard the stoppress from

<br> under hoods, made lasses like lads love maypoleriding, dotting Harold&apos;s cross green with tricksome couples, fiftyfifty, their childern&apos;s hundred. So childish pence took care of parents&apos; pounds and many made money the way in the world where rushroads to riches crossed slums of lice and, the cause of it all, he forged himself ahead like a blazing urbanorb, brewing treble to drown
grief, giving and taking mayom and tuam, playing milliards with his three golden balls, making party capital out of landed selfinterest, light on a slavey but weighty on the bourse, our hugest commercial emporialist, with his sons booing home from afar and his daughters bridling up at his side. Finner! </p>
<p> How did he bank it up, swank it up, the whaler in the punt, a guinea by a groat, his index on the balance and such wealth into the bargain, with the bogey which he snatched in the baggage coach ahead? Going forth on the prowl, master jackill, under night and creeping back, dog to hide, over morning. Humbly to fall and cheaply to rise, exposition of failures. Through Duffy&apos;s blunders and
MacKenna&apos;s insurance for upper ten and lower five the band played on. As one generation tells another. Ofter the

<br> fall. First, for a change of a seven days&apos; licence he wandered out of his farmer&apos;s health and so lost his early parishlife. Then (&apos;twas in fenland), occidentally of a suddom, six junelooking flamefaces straggled wild out of their turns through his parsonfired wicket, showing all shapes of striplings in sleepless tights. Promptly whomafter in undated times, very properly a dozen
generations anterior to themselves, a main chanced to burst and misflooded his fortunes, wrothing foulplay over his fives&apos; court and his fine poultryyard wherein were spared a just two of a feather in wading room only. Next, upon due reflotation, up started four hurrigan gales to smithereen his plateglass housewalls and the slate for accounts his keeper was cooking. Then came three boy
buglehorners who counterbezzled and crossburgled him. Later on in the same evening two hussyites absconded through a breach in his bylaws and left him, the infidels, to pay himself off in kind remembrances. Till, ultimatehim, fell the crowning barleystraw when an explosium of his distilleries
<br><font color="green">{f39, 590}</font>
<br> deafandumped all his dry goods down to his most favoured sinflute and dropped him, what remains of a heptark, leareyed and lotterish, weeping worrybound on his bankrump.</p>
<p> Pepep. Pay bearer, sure and sorry, at foot of ohoho honest policiest. O never again, by Phoenix, swore on him Lloyd&apos;s, not for beaten wheat, not after Sir Joe Meade&apos;s father, thanks! They know him, the covenanter, by rote at least, for a chameleon at last, in his true falseheaven colours from ultraviolent to subred tissues. That&apos;s his last tryon to march through the grand
tryomphal arch. His reignbolt&apos;s shot. Never again! How you do that like, Mista Chimepiece? You got nice yum premyums?

<p> Agreed, Wu Welsher, he was chogfulled to beacsate on earn as in hiving of foxold conningnesses but who, hey honey, for all values of his latters, was, integer integerrimost, the formast of the firm? By folkmood hailed, at part farwailed. Accwmwladed concloud, Nuah-Nuah, Nebob of Nephilim! After all, what followed for apprentice&apos; sake? Since the now nighs nearing as the yetst hies hin.
Jeebies, ugh, kek, ptah, that was an ill man! Jawboose, puddigood, this is for true one sweetish mand! But Jumbluffer, bagdad, sir, yond would be for a once over our all honoured christmastype easteredmanx.</p>
