<p class="flush"><a name="n20022g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20022g">Honuphrius</a> is a concupiscent exserviceman who makes dishonest propositions to render duty. He is believed to have committed simple infidelities with Felicia, a virgin, and to be practising for unnatural coits with <a name="n20022c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20022c">Eugenius</a> and
<a name="n20022h" href="../../ff/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20022h">Jeremias</a>, two philadelphians. <a name="n20022g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20022g">Honuphrius</a>, Felicia, <a name="n20022c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20022c">Eugenius</a> and <a name="n20022h" href="../../ff/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20022h">Jeremias</a> are consanguineous to the last degree. Anita, the wife of
<a name="n20022g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20022g">Honuphrius</a>, believes has been told by her maidservant Fortissa that <a name="n20022g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20022g">Honuphrius</a> has confessed
<br><font color="green">{ms, 44v}</font>
<br> under voluntary chastisement that he has instructed his slave Mauritius, a widower, for a financial advantage to facilitate their neighbour Magravius, a <a name="n19046f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n19all.htm#n19046f">commercial</a> rival of <a name="n20022g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20022g">Honuphrius</a>, to solicit the chastity of Anita. Anita is informed by some illegitimate children of
Mauritius &amp; Fortissa that Gillia, the wife of Magravius, is visited clandestinely by the advocate of <a name="n20022g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20022g">Honuphrius</a>, an immoral person who has been corrupted by <a name="n20022h" href="../../ff/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20022h">Jeremias</a>. Gillia has been early debauched by
<a name="n20022g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20022g">Honuphrius</a>
<br><font color="green">{ms, 45v}</font>
<br> and Magravius knows that Anita has formerly committed double sacrilege with Michael, a perpetual curate who wishes to seduce <a name="n20022c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20022c">Eugenius</a>. Magravius threatens to have Anita molested by Sulla, a bandit, who desires to procure Felicia if he will not yield to him and also deceive
<a name="n20022g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20022g">Honuphrius</a> by rendering duty when demanded. Anita, who claims to have discovered incestuous temptations from <a name="n20022h" href="../../ff/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20022h">Jeremias</a> &amp; <a name="n20022c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20022c">Eugenius</a>, would yield to the lewdness
<br><font color="green">{ms, 46v}</font>
<br> of <a name="n20022g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20022g">Honuphrius</a> in order to save the virginity of Felicia for Magravius, when converted by Michael after the death of Gillia, though she fears that by continuing to allow him marital rights she will provoke reprehensible conduct between <a name="n20022c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20022c">Eugenius</a> &amp;
<a name="n20022h" href="../../ff/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20022h">Jeremias</a>. Michael, who has formerly debauched Anita, dispenses her yielding to <a name="n20022g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20022g">Honuphrius</a> who pretends publicly to possess her in all manners for his
<br><font color="green">{ms, 47v}</font>
<br> carnal hygiene whenever he has rendered himself impotent for consummation by subdolence &amp; comminates her with reserving her case for the ordinary even should she practise pious fraud during affrication which, from experience she knows to be a nullity. Fortissa, however, encourages Anita by describing the chastisements of
<a name="n20022g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20022g">Honuphrius</a> and the <a name="n11100e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n11all.htm#n11100e">depravities</a> of Canicula, the deceased wife of Mauritius with Sulla, who repents. Has he hegemony &amp; shall she submit?

<p class="flush">This case is perhaps the commonest in our courts of litigation. Owens holds that so long as there is a <a name="n20018b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20018b">joint deposit</a> account in the 2 names there is a mutual obligation. He cites Brerfuchs &amp; Warren, a firm registered as Tango Limited for the sale of certain articles. The action which was at the suit of the trustee
of the Irish Church Emergency fund for payment of tithes due, was tried by Judge Doyle &amp; a common jury. There was no question to the <a name="n20023e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20023e">debt</a>. For the defence it was stated that <a name="n20023e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20023e">payment had been made</a>. The fund trustee counterclaimed that this was by
<a name="n20022f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20022f">crossed cheque</a> drawn by the
<br><font color="green">{ms, 53v}</font>
<br> senior partner, by whom the lodgment had been made but in their joint name. The bank particularised, the National now almost entirely in the hands of Tango Ltd declined to pay the trustee negotiated it to a client from whom he received legal relief as consideration since the the cheque, a washable one, had been circulating in the country for over 20 years among holders of Pango Stock (a rival
concern) though not a farthing had ever crossed the counter in the
<br><font color="green">{ms, 54v}</font>
<br> form of coin. <a name="n20012c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20012c">The jury, all of whom were Doyles</a>, naturally disagreed whereupon the judge ordered the attachment of the firm. Only the junior partner could be found &amp; this turned out to be a woman. She stated that she had frequently been made the drawee of unwashable blank cheques, which she used to
<a name="n20024a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20024a">endorse</a> her various <a name="n20023d" href="../../ff/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20023d">drawers who were wellknown</a> tetigists of the city &amp; county. She proposed to reamalgamate herself in whole settlement &amp; for
<br><font color="green">{ms, 55v}</font>
<br> satisfaction with the trustee, Monsignore Pepigi, but this was ruled out on appeal by <a name="n20031h" href="../../ff/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20031h">Jeremy</a> who held that as a matter of tact the woman was born without <a name="n14239b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n14all.htm#n14239b">mancipium</a> &amp; as no property could exist in a corpse Pepigi&apos;s pact was piffle &amp; she cd just
<a name="n20023f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20023f">whistle for her rhino</a>. Will you, won&apos;t you, tango with pegigi? Not for, Nancy, <a name="n20023g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20023g">how dare you do</a>? And whew whewwhew whew.</p> </p>  </main>
