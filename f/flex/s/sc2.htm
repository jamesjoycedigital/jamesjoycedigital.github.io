Anita,<a target="foot" id="fss0549">&ordm;</a> the wife of <a name="n20022g" href="../../FF/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20022g">Honuphrius</a><a target="foot" id="fss0550">&ordm;</a>, has been told by her tirewoman, Fortissa, that <a name="n20022g" href="../../FF/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20022g">Honuphrius</a> has confessed under voluntary chastisement that he has
<a name="n53132f" href="../../FF/fnbs/n53all.htm#n53132f">instructed</a> his slave Mauritius, a widower,<a target="foot" id="fss0551">&ordm;</a> to facilitate their neighbour Magravius,<a target="foot" id="fss0552">&ordm;</a> a commercial<a target="foot" id="fss0553">&ordm;</a> emulous of <a name="n20022g" href="../../FF/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20022g">Honuphrius</a>, to solicit the chastity of Anita.
Anita<a target="foot" id="fss0554">&ordm;</a> is<a target="foot" id="fss0555">&ordm;</a> informed by some illegitimate children  of Fortissa with Mauritius that Gillia, the wife of Magravius, is visited clandestinely by Barnabas, the advocate of <a name="n20022g" href="../../FF/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20022g">Honuphrius</a>, an immoral person who has been corrupted by
<a name="n20022h" href="../../FF/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20022h">Jeremias</a>. Gillia has been tenderly debauched by <a name="n20022g" href="../../FF/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20022g">Honuphrius</a>,<a target="foot" id="fss0562">&ordm;</a> and Magravius knows from spies that Anita has formerly committed double sacrilege with Michael, a perpetual curate<a target="foot" id="fss0563">&ordm;</a> who wishes to seduce
<a name="n20022c" href="../../FF/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20022c">Eugenius</a>. Magravius threatens to have Anita molested by Sulla, a bandit who desires to procure Felicia for Gregorius, Leo, Vitellius and Macdugalius, four excavators, if she will not yield to him and also deceive <a name="n20022g" href="../../FF/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20022g">Honuphrius</a> by rendering marital duty when demanded.
Anita,<a target="foot" id="fss0565">&ordm;</a> who claims to have discovered incestuous temptations from <a name="n20022h" href="../../FF/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20022h">Jeremias</a> and <a name="n20022c" href="../../FF/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20022c">Eugenius</a>,<a target="foot" id="fss0566">&ordm;</a> would yield to the lewdness of <a name="n20022g" href="../../FF/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20022g">Honuphrius</a> to
appease Magravius and to save the virginity of Felicia for Magravius,<a target="foot" id="fss0570">&ordm;</a> when converted by Michael after the death of Gillia,<a target="foot" id="fss0571">&ordm;</a> but she fears that<a target="foot" id="fss0572">&ordm;</a> by allowing his marital rights she may cause reprehensible conduct between
<a name="n20022c" href="../../FF/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20022c">Eugenius</a> and <a name="n20022h" href="../../FF/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20022h">Jeremias</a>. Michael, who has formerly debauched Anita, dispenses her from yielding to <a name="n20022g" href="../../FF/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20022g">Honuphrius</a> who pretends publicly to possess his woman in several manners for carnal hygiene whenever he has rendered
himself impotent to consummate by subdolence. Anita is disturbed,<a target="foot" id="fss0573">&ordm;</a> but Michael comminates that he will reserve her case for the ordinary even if she should practise a pious fraud during affrication which, from experience, she knows to be nullity. Fortissa, however, encourages Anita by describing the chastisements of
<a name="n20022g" href="../../FF/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20022g">Honuphrius</a> and the <a name="n11100e" href="../../FF/fnbs/n11all.htm#n11100e">depravities</a> of Canicula, the deceased wife of Mauritius, with Sulla who repents. Has he hegemony and shall she submit?</p>
<p></p>
<p> This is perhaps the commonest of all cases<a target="foot" id="fss0584">&ordm;</a> in our courts of litigation. <a name="n20031g" href="../../FF/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20031g">Owens</a> holds that so long as there is a <a name="n20018b" href="../../FF/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20018b">joint deposit</a> account in the two names a mutual obligation is posited. He cites Brerfuchs and Warren, a firm registered
as Tangos, Limited,<a target="foot" id="fss0585">&ordm;</a> for the sale of certain proprietary articles. The action,<a target="foot" id="fss0586">&ordm;</a> which was at the suit of the  <a name="n20039k" href="../../FF/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20039k">trustee</a> of the Heathen Church Emergency<a target="foot" id="fss0587">&ordm;</a> fund for payment of tithes
due,<a target="foot" id="fss0588">&ordm;</a> was heard by Judge <a name="n20031g" href="../../FF/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20031g">Doyle</a> and a common jury. No question arose as to the <a name="n20023e" href="../../FF/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20023e">debt</a>. The defence stated that <a name="n20023e" href="../../FF/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20023e">payment had been made</a>. The fund trustee counterclaimed that this
was invalid,<a target="foot" id="fss0589">&ordm;</a> being by means of <a name="n20022f" href="../../FF/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20022f">crossed cheque</a> drawn by the senior partner by whom the lodgment of money had been made but in their joint names. The bank particularised, the National (now almost entirely in the hands of Tangos, Limited),<a target="foot" id="fss0593">&ordm;</a> declined to pay the
draft, though there were ample funds to meet it, whereupon the trustee negotiated<a target="foot" id="fss0594">&ordm;</a> it to a client from whom he received in exchange legal relief. Since then<a target="foot" id="fss0597">&ordm;</a> the cheque, a washable one, had been circulating in the country for over thirty years among holders of Pango stock, a rival
concern,<a target="foot" id="fss0600">&ordm;</a> though not one farthing had ever crossed the counter in the semblance of coin. <a name="n20012c" href="../../FF/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20012c">The jury</a> (<a name="n20012c" href="../../FF/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20012c">all</a> <a name="n20012c" href="../../FF/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20012c">of whom were</a>

No <i>mandamus</i><a target="foot" id="fss0604">&ordm;</a> could locate Brerfuchs and only the junior
partner Warren could be found, who turned out to be a of the proletarian class. She stated that she had cheerfully often been made the drawee of unwashable blank cheques which she used to <a name="n20024a" href="../../FF/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20024a">endorse</a> to her various <a name="n20023d" href="../../FF/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20023d">drawers</a> who were in most cases wellknown tetigists of the city
and country. She proposed for satisfaction and as a whole settlement to reamalgamate herself with the suing <a name="n20039k" href="../../FF/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20039k">trustee</a>, Monsignore Pepigi, but this was ruled out on appeal by Judge Jeremy who held that, as a matter of tact, the woman was born when and where Mary&apos;s <a name="n14239b" href="../../FF/fnbs/n14all.htm#n14239b">Mancipium</a>
Act<a target="foot" id="fss0632">&ordm;</a> did not apply and that, as no property exists in a corpse,<a target="foot" id="fss0634">&ordm;</a> Pepigi&apos;s pact was piffle and Warren could<a target="foot" id="fss0635">&ordm;</a> <a name="n20023f" href="../../FF/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20023f">whistle for the rhino</a>.
