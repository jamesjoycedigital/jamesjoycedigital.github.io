<p> Honuphrius is a concupiscent exserviceman who makes dishonest propositions to all. He is considered to have committed simple infidelities with Felicia, a virgin, and to be practising for unnatural coits with Eugenius and Jeremias, two philadelphians. Honuphrius, Felicia, Eugenius and Jeremias are consanguineous to the lowest degree. Anita, the wife of Honuphrius, has been told by her
tirewoman, Fortissa, that Honuphrius has confessed under voluntary chastisement that he has instructed his slave Mauritius, a widower, to facilitate their neighbour Magravius, a commercial emulous of Honuphrius, to solicit the chastity of Anita. Anita is informed by some illegitimate children
<br><font color="green">{f10, 446}</font>

when demanded. Anita, who claims to have discovered incestuous temptations from Jeremias and Eugenius, would yield to the lewdness of Honuphrius to appease the savagery of Sulla and the mercernariness of the twelve Sullivani and to save the virginity of Felicia for Magravius, when converted by Michael after the death of Gillia, but she fears that by allowing his marital rights she may cause
reprehensible conduct between Eugenius and Jeremias. Michael, who has formerly debauched Anita, dispenses her from yielding to Honuphrius who pretends publicly to possess his conjunct in thirtynine several manners (<i>turpiter!</i>) for carnal hygiene whenever he has rendered himself impotent to consummate by subdolence. Anita is disturbed, but Michael comminates that he will reserve her case
tomorrow for the ordinary Guglielmus even if she should practise a pious fraud during affrication which, from experience, she knows to be leading to nullity.

<p> This is perhaps the commonest of all cases in our courts of litigation. D&apos;Oyly Owens holds that so long as there is a joint deposit account in the two names a mutual obligation is posited. Owens cites Brerfuchs and Warren, a foreign firm registered as Tangos, Limited, for the sale of certain proprietary articles. The action, which was at the instance of the
<br><font color="green">{f10, 447}</font>
<br> trustee of the Heathen Church Emergency fund<font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><font color="black">, suing by its <a name="n20039k" href="../../FF/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20039k">trustee</a>, a resigned civil servant,</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font> for the payment of tithes due, was heard by Judge Doyle and also by a common jury. No question arose as to
the debt for which vouchers spoke volumes. The defence alleged that payment had been made effective. The fund trustee, one Jucundus Fecundus Xero Pecundus <font color="red"><sup><small>(3</small></sup></font><span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Copperchap</span></span> <font color="black">Coppercap</font><font color="red"><sup><small>3)</small></sup></font>, counterclaimed that payment
was invalid, having been tendered to creditor under cover of a crossed cheque, signed in the ordinary course, in the name of Wieldhelm, hurls cross, and drawn by the senior partner only by whom the lodgment of the species had been effected but in their joint names. The bank particularised, the National Misery (now almost entirely in the hands of the four chief bondholders for value in Tangos,
Limited), declined to pay the draft, though there were ample reserves to meet the liability, whereupon the trusty Coppercheap negotiated it for and on behalf of the fund of the thing to a client of his, a notary, from whom, on consideration, he received in exchange legal relief as between trusthee and bethrust, with thanks. Since then the cheque, a good washable pink, embossed D you D no 11
hundred and thirty 2, good for the figure and face, had been circulating in the country for over thirtynine years among holders of Pango stock, a rival concern, though not one demonetised farthing had ever spun or fluctuated across the counter in the semblance of hard coin or liquid cash. The jury (a sour dozen of stout fellows all of whom were curiously named after Doyles) naturally disagreed,
jointly and severally, and the belligerent judge, disagreeing with the allied jurors&apos; disagreement, went outside his jurisfiction altogether and ordered a garnishee attachment to the neutral firm. No <i>mandamus</i> could locate the depleted Whilom Breyfawkes as he had entered into an

Doyle (Ann), having regretfully left the jurybox, protested cheerfully on the

Coppinger&apos;s doll, as she was called, then proposed for her satisfaction and as a whole act of settlement to reamalgamate herself, tomorrow perforce, in pardonership with the permanent suing fond
trustee, Monsignore Pepigi, under the new style of Will Breakfast and Sparrem, as he seemed to proffer the steadiest interest towards her, but this prepoposal was ruled out on appeal by Judge Jeremy Doyler who, reversing the findings of the lower court, found that, as a matter of tact, the woman they gave as free was born into contractual incapacity when, how and where Mamy&apos;s Mancipium Act
did not apply and therefore held supremely that, as no property in law can exist in a corpse, Pepigi&apos;s pact was pure piffle (loud laughter) and Wharrem could whistle for the rhino. Will you, won&apos;t you, tango with Pepigi? Not for, Nancy, how dare you do! And whew whewwhew whew. </p>

Then came three boy buglehorners who counterbezzled and crossburgled him.
