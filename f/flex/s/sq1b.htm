Oyes! oyes! Withdraw your member. Closure. This chamber is adjourned. Such precedent is largely a cause to lack of
collective continence among Donnelly&apos;s orchard as lifelong the shadyside to Fairboothers&apos; field. Humbo, lock your kekkle up! Anny, blow your wickle out! Tuck away the scramblecloth!! You never wet the tea. And you may go rightoway back to your Aunty Dilluvia, Humphrey, after that.
