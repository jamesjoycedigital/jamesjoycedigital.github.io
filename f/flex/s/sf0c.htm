<p> Here are two rooms on the upstairs, on the fork side and the knife side. Whom are they for? Why, for little porters, to be saved. Ah, so? Who sleeps in <a name="n19168g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n19all.htm#n19168g">number one</a>? A pussy. How sweet of her! Has your pussy a name? Yes, indeed, and she is named Buttercup. How very sweet of her!

A nice light baritone she will have but <a name="n19220c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n19all.htm#n19220c">I much prefer her name in buttercups.

I beg your pardon, sincerely I do. The other twin, you see, has been crying in his sleep, what a <a name="n20008a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20008a">wretch</a>. There are
