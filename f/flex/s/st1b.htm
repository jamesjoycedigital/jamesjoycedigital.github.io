<p> How did he bank it up, a guinea by a groat, his index on the balance and such wealth into the bargain? Humbly to fall and cheaply to rise, exposition of failures. First for a change of a seven days&apos; licence he wandered out of his farmer&apos;s health and lost his early parishlife. Then, occidentally six junelooking flamers straggled wild out of their turns through his
<br><font color="green">{ms, 56}</font>
<br> parsonfired wicket, showing all shapes of striplings in sleepless tights. Promptly whomafter in undated times, very properly a dozen generations anterior to themselves, a main chanced to burst and misflooded his fortunes, wrothing foulplay over his fives&apos; court and his fine poultryyard wherein were spared a just two of a feather in wading room only. Next, upon due reflotation, up started
4 hurricane gales to smithereen his plateglass walls &amp;

<br> the slate accounts his keeper was cooking. Then came three boy buglers who counterswindled and crossburgled him. Later on in the same evening two hussyites absconded through a breach in his bylaws and left him, the infidels, to pay himself off in kind remembrances. Till, ultimatelim, fell the crowning barleystraw, when an explosium of his distilleries deafandumped all his dry goods down to

They know him, the covenanter, by rote at least for a chameleon at least, in his true falseheaven colours, from ultraviolent to subred tissues. That&apos;s his last tryon to march through his grand tryomphal arch. His reignbolt&apos;s shot. Never again! How do you like that, Mista Chimepiece? You got nice
yum premyums. Praypaid my promishles.</p>
<p> Agreed he was chogfulled of foxholed cunningmesses but who was the firmest of the firm? After all, what followed for apprentice&apos;sake? Jeebies,

<br> ugh, kek, ptah, that was an ill man. Jawboose, puddigood, that is for true one sweetish mand. But, Jumbluffer, bagdad, sir, <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">that</span></span> yond would be for a once over our all hallowed christmastype easteredmanx. Who now breathes down. The nape of his nameshielder&apos;s neck. After having done all he dared. Worked out to the pinch of an
inch. While the <a name="n19191d" href="../../ff/fnbs/n19all.htm#n19191d">queanby</a> he <a name="n19191e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n19all.htm#n19191e">staggerhorned</a> blesses her bliss for to feel her funnyman&apos;s functions rumbling.</p> </p>  </main>
