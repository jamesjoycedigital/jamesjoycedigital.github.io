<p class="flush">In the bedchamber. The dowager to stay kneeled down how she is. The princes of the blood royal to lie how they are without to see. The dowager&apos;s gerent to <a name="n19214d" href="../../ff/fnbs/n19all.htm#n19214d">present arms</a> right about without to be seen of them. Herein fail not.</p>
<p> Hummels! What have you, therefore? I fear lest we have lost ours respecting these wild parts. All now appears quite shaggy and beastful. He, he, he! <a name="n19212f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n19all.htm#n19212f">At what do you show on?</a> I show because I must see before my fortune so a great fingerpost. Can You now read the legend on it? I could read: to the point, 1 yard to Sara&apos;s Bridge,
600 yds to the Wellington Memorial, 800 yards, <a name="n19213d" href="../../ff/fnbs/n19all.htm#n19213d">to the General Posting Office 2 miles</a>, to Dunleary Obelisk, via the Rock, 8 miles. <a name="n19212f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n19all.htm#n19212f">At what do you leer?</a> I leer because I must see <a name="n20016a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20016a">a buntingcap so pinky on the ponkt</a>.

<br> It is for a nice greeting and many burgesses uses to pink it in this way. <a name="n19224b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n19all.htm#n19224b">Do you not have heard that the King shall come tomorrow?</a> He shall come for hunting on our illcome fuxes. <a name="n19224b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n19all.htm#n19224b">I have heard anyone tell yesterday that some should come on morrow</a> here but it is never here

<br> Is Mr Porter always in his such <a name="n20016e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20016e">strong</a> health? I thank you bestly, he is exceedingly well. One sees how he is stoutlier
<br><font color="green">{ms, 39v}</font>
<br> than of formerly. One would say him to have whole <a name="n20008c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n20all.htm#n20008c">a litteringture of piglets under his aproham</a>. Has Mr Porter been always so long married? O yes he has been marrying since ever so long. She, she, she! But at what do you again leer? I am not leering, I pink your pardons. I am highly she she sherious.</p>
<p> Do you not must want to go somewhere on the present? Yes, O pity. Now we shall do a far walk so far as number one of Sara&apos;s place. We can admire her sceneries. These brilling streamlings please trill me how they sing them? They arise from a clear springwell of our park which makes the blind to see all blind. How it is clear? Yes, we
