her teens, nurse Saintette Isabelle, with stiffstarched cuffs, but on holiday, christmas, easter mornings, when she wore a wreath, the wonderful widow of eighteen springs, Madame Isa Veuve La Belle, so sad but lucksome in her boyblue's long black with orange blossoming weeper's veil), for she was the only girl they loved, as she is the queenly pearl you prize, because of the way the night that

when schooling them in amown, mid grass, she sat, when man was, amazingly frank, for their first conjugation, whose colours at standing up from the above were of a pretty carnation but, if really 'twere not so, of some deretane denudation with intent to excitation, caused by his retrogradation, among firearmed forces proper to this nation but apart from all titillation which, he said, was under
heat pressure and a good mitigation without which in any case he insists upon being worthy of continued alimentation for him having displayed, he says, such grand toleration, reprobate so noted and all as he was, with his washleather sweeds and his smokingstump, for denying transubstantiation nevertheless in respect of his highpowered station, whereof more especially as probably he was meantime
suffering genteel tortures from the best medical attestation, as he oftentimes did, having only strength enough, by way of festination, to implore or (I believe you might have said better) to complore with complete obsecration on everybody connected with him the curse of coagulation for, he tells me outside Sammon's in King Street after  <font color="red">{fw, 558}</font>  two or three hours of
close confabulation, by this pewterpint of Gilbey's goatswhey which is his prime consolation, albeit involving upon the same no uncertain amount of esophagous regurgitation, he being personally unpreoccupied to the extent of a flea's gizzard anent eructation, if he was still extremely offensive to a score and four nostrils' dilatation still he was likewise, on the other side of him, for some
nepmen's eyes a delectation, as he asserts without the least alienation, so prays of his fault you would make obliteration but as for our friend behind the bars, though like Adam Findlater a man of high estimation, summing him up to be done, be what will of excess his exaltation, still we think with Sully there can be no right extinuation for contravention of common and statute legislation for
which the fit remedy resides, for Mr Sully, in corporal amputation: so three months for Gubbs Jeroboam, the frothwhiskered pest of the park, as per act one, section two, schedule three, clause four of the fifth of King Jark, this sentence to be carried out tomorrowmorn by Nolans Volans at six o'clock shark, and may the yeastwind and the hoppinghail malt mercy on his seven honeymeads and his

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  What scenic artist! It is ideal residence for realtar. By hims ingang tilt tinkt a tunning bell that Limen, Mr that Boggey Godde, be airwaked. Lingling, lingling. Be their magics in all. Chump, do your ephort. Shop! Please shop! Shop ado O please shop. How hominous his house, haunt it? Yesses, indead it be! Nogen, of imperial measure, is begraved beneather. Here
are his naggins poured, his alladim lamps. Around the bloombiered, booty with the bedst. For them whom he have fordone make we newly thankful!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Tell me something. The Porters, so to speak, after their shadowstealers in the newsbaggers, are very nice people, are they not? Very, all fourlike tellt. And on this wise. Mr Porter (Bartholomew, heavy man, astern, mackerel shirt, hayamatt peruke) is an excellent forefather and Mrs Porter (leading lady, apoopahead, gaffneysaffron nightdress, iszoppy chepelure)
is a most kindhearted messmother. A so united family pateramater is not more existing on papel or off of it. As keymaster fits the lock it weds so this bally builder to his streamline secret. They care for nothing except everything that is allporterous. <I>Porto da Brozzo!</I> Isn't that terribly nice of them? You can ken that they come of a rarely old family by their costumance and one must
togive that one supped of it in all tonearts from awe to zest. I think I begin to divine so much. Only snakkest me truesome! I stone us I'm hable.  <font color="red">{fw, 561}</font>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  To reachy a skeer do! Still hoyhra, till venstra! Here are two rooms on the upstairs, at forkflank and at knifekanter. Whom in the wood are they for? Why, for little porter babes, to be saved! The coeds, boytom thwackers and timbuy teaser. Here is onething you owed two noe. This one once upon awhile was the other but this is the other one nighadays. Ah so? The
Corsicos? They are numerable. Guest them! Major bed, minor beddies. Halosobuth, sov us! Who sleeps in now number one, for example? A pussy, purr esimple. Cunina, Statulina and Edulia, but how sweet of her! Has your pussy a pessname? Yes, indeed, you will hear it passim in all the noveletta and she is named Buttercup. Her bare name will tellt it, a monitress. How very sweet of her and what an
excessively lovecharming missyname to forsake, now that I come to drink of it filtred, a gracecup fulled of bitterness. She is dadad's lottiest daughterpearl and brooder's cissiest auntybride. A more intriguant bambolina could one not colour up out of Boccuccia's <I>Enameron</I>. Her shellback thimblecasket mirror only can show her dearest friendeen. To speak well her grace it would ask of Grecian
language; of her goodness, that legend golden. Biryina Saindua! Loreas with lillias flocaflake arrosas! Here's newyearspray, the posquiflor, a windaborne and heliotrope; there miriamsweet and amaranth and marygold to crown. Add lightest knot unto tiptition. O Charis! O Charissima! Would one but to do apart a lilybit her virginelles and, so, to breath, so, therebetween, behold, she had instantt
with her hand made as to graps the myth inmid the air. Mother of moth! I will to show herword in flesh. Approach not, for ghost sake! It is dormition! She may think, what though little doth she realise, as morning fresheth, it hath happened her, you know what, as they too what I dare not utter. Silvoo plush, if scolded she draws a face. Petticoat's asleep but in the gentlenest of her thoughts apoo
is a nursepin. To be presented, Babs for Bimbushi? Of courts and with enticers. Up, girls, and at him! Alone? Alone what? I mean does she do fleurty winkies with herself? Pussy is never alone, as records her chambrette, for she can always look at Biddles and talk petnames with her little  <font color="red">{fw, 562}</font>  playfilly when she is sitting downy on the ploshmat. Doth Dolly weeps she
is hasting. Will Dally bumpsetty 'tis for tubtime. O, she talks, does she? Marry, how? Rosepetalletted sounds. Ah Biddles es ma plikplak. Ah plikplak wed ma Biddles. A nice jezebel barytinette she will gift, this strifestirrer, but I much prefer her missnomer in maidenly golden lasslike gladsome wenchful flowery girlish beautycapes. Dulcidelicatissima! So do I, much. Allaliefest, she who pities
very pebbles, dare we not wish on her our thrice onsk? A lovely fear! That she seventip toe her chrysming, that she spin blaa to scarlach till her templar veil, that the Mount of Whoam it open it her to shelterer! She promises beautifully if Wilfred comes, her Trinity boy, while he wears his black satin neptunes. Have no fear for our ladykin! She will blow ever so much more promisefuller, blee me,
than all the other common marygales that romp round brigidschool, charming Carry Whambers or saucy Susy Maucepan or merry Anna Patchbox or silly Polly Flinders. Platsch! A plikaplak.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  And, since we are talking amnessly of bunkasloop and crazdledaze, who doez in sleeproom number twobis? The twobirds. Holy policeman, O, I see! Of what age are your birdies? They are to come of twinning age so soon as they may be born to be eldering like those olders while they are living under chairs. They are? And they seem to be so tightly tattached as two
maggots to touch other, I think I notice, do I not? You do. Our bright bull babe, Frank Kevin, is on heartsleeveside. Do not you waken him! Our farheard bode. He is happily to sleep, limb of the Lord, with his lifted in blessing, his bachal Iosa, like the blissed angel he looks so like and his mou is semiope as though he were blowdelling on a bugigle. Whene'er I see those smiles in eyes 'tis
Father Quinn again. Very shortly he will smell sweetly when he will hear a weird to wean. By gorgeous, that boy will blare some knight when he will take his dane's pledges and quit our ingletears, spite of undesirable parents, to wend him to Amorica to quest a cushy job. That keen dean with his veen nonsolance! O, I adore the profeen music! Dollarmighty! He is too audorable really, eunique! I
guess to have seen somekid like him in the storybook, guess I met somewhere somelamb to whom he will be becoming liker. But hush! How unpardonable of me! I beg you for your venials, sincerely I do.  <font color="red">{fw, 563}</font>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Hush! The other, twined on codliverside, has been crying in his sleep, making sharpshape his inscissors on some first choice sweets fished out of the muck. A stake in our mead. What a teething wretch! How his book of craven images! Here are posthumious tears on his intimelle. And he has pipettishly bespilled himself from his foundingpen, as ill spent from
inkinghorn. He is jem job joy pip paa pat (jot um for a sobrat!) Jerry Jehu. You will know him by names in the capers as an exhibitioner in the preparatory, but you cannot see whose heel he sheepfolds in his wrought hand because I have not told it to you. O foetal sleep! Ah, fatal slip! The one loved, the other left, the bride of pride leased to the stranger! He will be quite within the pale when
with lordbeeron brow he vows him so tosset to be of the sir blake tribes while through life's unblest he rodes by backs of bannars. Bleak! Are you not somewhat bulgar with your bowels? Whatever do you mean with sour bleak? With pale blake I write tintingface. O, you do? And with steelwhite and blackmail I scent for my sweet an anemone's letter with a gold of my bridest hair betied. Donatus his
mark, address as follows. So you did? From the Cat and Cage. O, I see and see! In the ink of his sweat he will find it yet. What Gipsy Devereux vowed to Lylian and why the elm and how the stone. You never may know in the preterite all perhaps that you would not believe that you ever even saw to be about to. Perhaps. But they are two very blizky little portereens after their bredscrums, Jerkoff and
Eatsup, as for my part opinion indeed. They would be born so, costarred, puck and prig, the maryboy at the Donnybrook Fair, the godolphinglad in the Hoey's Court. How frilled one shall be as at taledold of Formio and Cigalette! What folly innocents! Theirs what pep of puppyhood! Both barmhearts shall become yeastcake by their brackfest. I will to leave my copperwise blessing between the pair of
them, for rosengorge, for greenafang. Blech and tin soldies, weals in a sniffbox. Som's wholed, all's parted. Weeping shouldst not thou be when man falls but that divine scheming ever adoring be. So you be either man or mouse and you be neither fish nor flesh. Take. And take. Vellicate nijche! Be ones as wes for gives for gets now the hour of passings sembles quick with quelled. Adieu, soft adieu,
for these nice presents, kerryjevin! Still tosorrow!  <font color="red">{fw, 564}</font>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Jeminy! What is the view which now takes up a second position of discordance, tell it, please? Mark! You notice it in that rereway because the male entail partially eclipses the femecovert. It is so called for its discord the meseedo. Do you ever heard the story about Helius Croesus, that white and gold Elephant in our zoopark? You astonish me by it. Is it not
that we are commanding from fullback, woman permitting, a profusely fine birdseye view from beauhind this park? Finn his park has been much the admiration of all the stranger ones, greekish and romanos, who arrive to here. The straight road down the centre (see relief map) bisexes the park which is said to be the largest of his kind in the world. On the right prominence confronts you the handsome
vinesregent's lodge while, turning to the other supreme piece of cheeks, exactly opposite, you are confounded by the equally handsome chief sacristary's residence. Around is a little amiably tufted and man is cheered when he bewonders through the boskage how the nature in all frisko is enlivened by gentlemen's seats. Here are heavysuppers &mdash; 'tis for daddies' housings for hundredaires of our
super thin thousand. By gum, but you have resin! Of these tallworts are yielded out juices for jointoils and pappasses for paynims. Listeneth! 'Tis a tree story. How olave, that firile, was aplantad in her liveside. How tannoboom held tonobloom. How rood in norlandes. The black and blue marks athwart the weald, which now barely is so stripped, indicate the prepresence of sylvious beltings.
Therewithal shady rides lend themselves out to rustic cavalries. In yonder valley, too, stays mountain sprite. Any pretty dears are to be caught inside but it is a bad pities of the plain. A scarlet pimparnell now mules the mound where anciently first murders were wanted to take root. By feud fionghalian. Talking tree and sinning stone stay on either hand. Hystorical leavesdroppings may also be
garnered up with Sir Shamus Swiftpatrick, archfieldchaplain of Saint Lucan's. How familiar it is to see all those interesting advenements with one anaked's eyes! Is all? Yet not. At the bodom fundus of this royal park, which, with tvigate shyasian gardeenen, is open to the public till night at late, so well the sissastrides so will  <font color="red">{fw, 565}</font> the pederestians, do not fail

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Let us consider.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The procurator Interrogarius Mealterum persends us this proposer.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Honuphrius is a concupiscent exservicemajor who makes dishonest propositions to all. He is considered to have committed, invoking <I>droit d'oreiller</I>, simple infidelities with Felicia, a virgin, and to be practising for unnatural coits with Eugenius and Jeremias, two or three philadelphians. Honuphrius, Felicia, Eugenius and Jeremias are consanguineous to
the lowest degree. Anita, the wife of Honuphrius, has been told by her tirewoman, Fortissa, that Honuphrius has blasphemously confessed under voluntary chastisement that he has instructed his slave Mauritius, a widower, to facilitate their neighbour Magravius, a commercial emulous of Honuphrius, to solicit the chastity of Anita. Anita is informed by some illegitimate children of Fortissa with
Mauritius (the supposition is Ware's) that Gillia, the schismatical wife of Magravius, is visited clandestinely by Barnabas, the advocate of Honuphrius, an immoral person who has been corrupted by Jeremias. Gillia (a cooler blend, D'Alton insists), <I>ex equo</I> with Poppea, Arancita, Clara,  <font color="red">{fw, 573}</font>  Marinuzza, Indra and Iodina, has been tenderly debauched (in
Halliday's view) by Honuphrius, and Magravius knows from spies that Anita has formerly committed double sacrilege with Michael, <I>vulgo</I> Cerularius, a perpetual curate who wishes to seduce Eugenius. Magravius threatens to have Anita molested by Sulla, an orthodox savage (and leader of a band of twelve mercenaries, the Sullivani) who desires to procure Felicia for Gregorius, Leo, Vitellius and
Macdugalius, four excavators, if she will not yield to him and also deceive Honuphrius by rendering conjugal duty when demanded. Anita, who claims to have discovered incestuous temptations from Jeremias and Eugenius, would yield to the lewdness of Honuphrius to appease the savagery of Sulla and the mercernariness of the twelve Sullivani and (as Gilbert at first suggested) to save the virginity of
Felicia for Magravius, when converted by Michael after the death of Gillia, but she fears that by allowing his marital rights she may cause reprehensible conduct between Eugenius and Jeremias. Michael, who has formerly debauched Anita, dispenses her from yielding to Honuphrius who pretends publicly to possess his conjunct in thirtynine several manners (<I>turpiter!</I> affirm <I>ex cathedris</I>
Gerontes Cambronses) for carnal hygiene whenever he has rendered himself impotent to consummate by subdolence. Anita is disturbed, but Michael comminates that he will reserve her case tomorrow for the ordinary Guglielmus even if she should practise a pious fraud during affrication which, from experience, she knows (according to Wadding) to be leading to nullity. Fortissa, however, is encouraged by
Gregorius, Leo, Vitellius and Magdugalius, reunitedly, to warn Anita by describing the strong chastisements of Honuphrius and the depravities (<I>turpissimas!</I>) of Canicula, the deceased wife of Mauritius, with Sulla, the simoniac, who is abnegand and repents. Has he hegemony and shall she submit?

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  This, layreaders and gentilemen, is perhaps the commonest of all cases arising out of umbrella history in connection with  <font color="red">{fw, 574}</font>  the wood industries in our courts of litigation. D'Oyly Owens holds (though Finn Magnusson of himself holds also) that so long as there is a joint deposit account in the two names a mutual obligation is
posited. Owens cites Brerfuchs and Warren, a foreign firm, since disseized, registered as Tangos, Limited, for the sale of certain proprietary articles. The action, which was at the instance of the trustee of the Heathen Church Emergency fund, suing by its trustee, a resigned civil servant, for the payment of tithes due, was heard by Judge Doyle and also by a common jury. No question arose as to
the debt for which vouchers spoke volumes. The defence alleged that payment had been made effective. The fund trustee, one Jucundus Fecundus Xero Pecundus Coppercheap, counterclaimed that payment was invalid, having been tendered to creditor under cover of a crossed cheque, signed in the ordinary course, in the name of Wieldhelm, hurls cross, voucher copy provided, and drawn by the senior partner
only by whom the lodgment of the species had been effected but in their joint names. The bank particularised, the National Misery (now almost entirely in the hands of the four chief bondholders for value in Tangos, Limited), declined to pay the draft, though there were ample reserves to meet the liability, whereupon the trusty Coppercheap negotiated it for and on behalf of the fund of the thing to
a client of his, a notary, from whom, on consideration, he received in exchange legal relief as between trusthee and bethrust, with thanks. Since then the cheque, a good washable pink, embossed D you D no 11 hundred and thirty 2, good for the figure and face, had been circulating in the country for over thirtynine years among holders of Pango stock, a rival concern, though not one demonetised
farthing had ever spun or fluctuated across the counter in the semblance of hard coin or liquid cash. The jury (a sour dozen of stout fellows all of whom were curiously named after Doyles) naturally disagreed, jointly and severally, and the belligerent judge, disagreeing with the allied jurors' disagreement, went outside his jurisfiction altogether and ordered a garnishee attachment to the neutral
firm. No <I>mandamus</I> could locate the depleted Whilom Breyfawkes as he had entered into an  <font color="red">{fw, 575}</font>  ancient moratorium, dating back to the times of the early barters, and only the junior partner Barren could be found, who entered an appearance and turned up, add woman in, among the male jurors, an obsolete turfwoman originally from the proletarian class with still a
good title to her sexname of Ann Doyle, 2 Coppinger's Cottages, the Doyle Country. Doyle (Ann), upon a notice of motion and after service of the motion by interlocutory injunction, having regretfully left the juryboxers, protested cheerfully on the stand in a long jurymiad <I>in re</I> corset checks, delivered in Doylish, that she had often, in supply to brusk demands rising almost to bollion
point, discounted Mr Brakeforth's first of all in exchange at nine months from date without issue and, to be strictly literal, unbottled in corrubberation a current account of how she had been made at sight for services rendered the payee-drawee of unwashable blank assignations, sometimes pinkwilliams (laughter) but more often of the <I>cr&egrave;me-de-citron</I>, <I>vair</I> <I>&eacute;mail
paoncoque</I> or marshmallow series, which she, as bearer, used to endorse, adhesively, to her various payers-drawers who in most cases were identified by the timber papers as wellknown tetigists of the city and suburban. The witness, at her own request, asked if she might and wrought something between the sheets of music paper which she had accompanied herself with for the occasion and, this
having been handed up for the bench to look at <I>in camera</I>, Coppinger's doll, as she was called (<I>annias</I>, MackErse's Dar, the adopted child), then proposed to jerrykin and jureens and every jim, jock and jarry in that little green courtinghousie for her satisfaction and as a whole act of settlement to reamalgamate herself, tomorrow perforce, in pardonership with the permanent suing fond
trustee, Monsignore Pepigi, under the new style of Will Breakfast and Sparrem, as, when all his cognisances had been estreated, he seemed to proffer the steadiest interest towards her, but this prepoposal was ruled out on appeal by Judge Jeremy Doyler who, reserving judgment in a matter of courts and reversing the findings of the lower correctional, found, beyond doubt of treason, fending the
dissassents of the pickpackpanel, twelve as upright judaces as ever let down their thoms, and, <I>occupante extremum</I>  <font color="red">{fw, 576}</font> <I>scabie</I>, handed down to the jury of the Liffey that, as a matter of tact, the woman they gave as free was born into contractual incapacity (the Calif of Man <I>v</I> the Eaudelusk Company) when, how and where Mamy's Mancipium Act did not
apply and therefore held supremely that, as no property in law can exist in a corpse (Hal Kilbride <I>v</I> Una Bellina), Pepigi's pact was pure piffle (loud laughter) and Wharrem could whistle for the rhino.
