<p> Revered</p>
<p class="diip">Majesty well Ive heard all these <a name="n03099c" href="../../FF/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03099c">muckbirds</a> what theyre bringing up about him and they will come to no good. The Honourable Mr Earwicker, my devout husband, and he is a true gentleman which is what none of the sneakers ever will be because as sings the royal poet
<br><font color="green">{ms, 37}</font>
<br> their likes must be born which he was, my devout, and it was between Williamstown and the Ailesbury road I first saw the lovelight in his eyes on top of the longcar when he told me his true opinion to pardon him but that I had got a lovely face and I felt I was back again in paradise.</p>
<p> Well, revered majesty, I hereafter swear never once he sent out the swags with a drop in them but milk as it came from the cow and that is all a <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">m</span></span> pure makeup by a snake in the grass and his name is McGrath Bros against that dear man, my honorary husband. If I was to tell your revered all that caffler said to me was it this time last
year as I told Mrs Tom for his accomodation McGrath Bros I&apos;m saying and his bacon not fit to look at never mind butter which is forbidden by the 10 commandments thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour&apos;s wife. Aha, McGrath, the lies is out on him like freckles. But I could read him. When I think what he had the shame to suggest about my dearly respected husband can I ever
forget that? Never. So may the Lord forgive McGrath Brothers all his trespasses against the Honorary
<br><font color="green">{ms, 38}</font>
<br> Mr Earwicker. For 2 straws I could tell someone I know and they would make a corpse of him with the greatest of pleasure and not leave enough of McGrath for the peelers to pick up.</p>
<p> Lies. There never was any girl in my house expecting trouble of my husband, never. The hussies neither of them were virtuous pursuant to declaration of the public doctor out of the lock whereas above Honble Earwicker possesses a chest very hairy for it to be able to be seen from a child which I am the privileged to see and pursuant to same very affectionate after salesladies&apos; company. I
will not have a dirty reptile the like of the McGraths to be spreading his lies all round where we live if he thinks he&apos;s the big noise here as I simply agree to it. Now, you worm! I exgust sneak McGrath. I wouldn&apos;t dream of a sausage belonging to him for meat for the cat. The obnoxious liar! He was fired out of Cloon&apos;s where he was only one of your common floorwalkers for giving
guff.</p>
<p> Moreover I&apos;ve heard it stated about the military but did space permit it is my belief I could
<br><font color="green">{ms, 39}</font>
<br> show it was the wish of his mind to mitigate the King&apos;s evil and I hereinafter swear by your revered majesty that it was him gave me the price of my new bulletproof dress with the angel sleeves and he said to my presence in these words: Just as there is a God of all things my mind is a complete blank.</p>
<p> Well, revered majesty, I tender you heartbroken thanks with regrets for lettering you and will now close hoping you are in the best. I don&apos;t care a fig for him and lies about an experience of mine as girl with a clerical friend. Ask him what about his wife with Mr John Brophy &amp; Son, the kissing solicitor, at present engaging attention of private detectives. I only wish he would look
in through his letterbox one day and he would not say that was a solicitor&apos;s business.<a target="foot" id="fez0006">&ordm;</a> What ho, she bumps! My, he would be surprised to see the old girl with Mr Brophy quite affectionate together, kissing and looking into a mirror.</p>
<p> So much for his sneakery
<br><font color="green">{ms, 40}</font>
<br> that I was treated not very grand by the thicks in Bully&apos;s acre. If any of Sully&apos;s thicks was to pull a gun on me he&apos;ll know better manners. I will complain on them to P.S. Laracy at the corner of Buttermilk lane and he will have his head well &amp; lawfully broken by a Norwegian who has been expelled out of Christianity.</p>
<p> I am perfectly proud of this great man, Mr Earwicker, my once handsome husband who is as gentle as a woman and very attractable when he always sits fornenst me to make our conversation about business &amp; pleasure when he is after his 3rd or 4th mug and he never chained me to a chair since this island was born. Earwicker is <a name="n06149c" href="../../FF/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06149c">white</a>,
I tell Sneakers and Master McGrath, back and streaky, ninepence. I can show whoever likes the bag of cakes &amp; figrolls which was given to me <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">by Mr Ear</span></span> on last wedding day by Mr Earwicker. Thank you, beloved, for your beautiful parcel. Always the born gentleman can be plainly seen by all from such behaviour. Then them to go &amp; say
about him being bothered I must beg to contradict as he is certified to be very agreeably deef.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 41}</font>
<br> <a name="n03055b" href="../../FF/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03055b">I&apos;d give him his answer</a> if he was to dare to say my honoured husband was never a widower in consideration of the late <a name="n03078e" href="../../FF/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03078e">diseased</a> inasmuch as the present Mr Earwicker has often given said deponent all particulars

Don&apos;t argue with a stinker like the McGraths. Cannonballs is the only argument with a low sneak. Ping! Ping! Hit him again. Ping!
<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font> That ought to make him hop it. Ha! Ha! I must laugh <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">at such a sneak</span></span>. Sneaky McGrath has <a name="n06002h" href="../../FF/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06002h">stuffed his last white pudding.</a> 3 p.m. Wednesday grand funeral of McGrath Brothers.

<p> Well, revered majesty, I take the liberty of cherishing the expectation that the clouds will soon dissipate and will now conclude the above epistle with best thanks of all <a name="n06020i" href="../../FF/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06020i">the trouble to took to</a> regards for H &amp; self to <a name="n06022l" href="../../FF/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06022l">dear

<br> hoping you to enjoy its perusal most completely</p>
<p> So help me witness this day to this my hand and mark from revered majesty&apos;s most duteous I am</p>
