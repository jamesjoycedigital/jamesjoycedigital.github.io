<p> Revered</p>
<p class="diip">Majesty well Ive heard all these <a name="n03099c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03099c">muckbirds</a> what theyre bringing up about him and they will come to no good. The Honourable Mr Earwicker, my devout husband, and he is a true gentleman which is what none of the sneakers ever will be because as sings the royal poet
<br><font color="green">{ms, 37}</font>
<br> their likes must be born like he was, my devout, and it was between Williamstown and the Ailesbury road I first saw the lovelight in his eyes on top of the longcar <a name="n06058g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06058g">I think he is looking at me yet</a> as if he&apos;d <a name="n06122d" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06122d">pass away in the clouds</a> when he told me his true opinion to
pardon him, <a name="n01079q" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01079q">golden one</a>, but that I had got a lovely face and I felt I was back again in paradise lost when all the world was June.</p>
<p> Well, revered majesty, I hereafter swear never once he sent out the swags with a drop in them but milk as it came from the cow and that is all a pure makeup by a snake in the grass and his name is McGrath Bros against that dear man, my honorary husband. If I was to tell your revered all that caffler said to me was it this time last year as I told Mrs Tom for his accomodation McGrath Bros
I&apos;m saying and his bacon not fit to look at never mind butter which is forbidden by the 10 commandments thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour&apos;s wife. Aha, McGrath, the lies is out on him like freckles. But I could read him. When I think what he had the shame to suggest about my dearly respected husband can I ever forget that? Never. So may the Lord forgive McGrath
Brothers all his trespasses against the Honorary
<br><font color="green">{ms, 38}</font>
<br> Mr Earwicker. For 2 straws <a name="n03062j" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03062j">yes and less</a> I could tell someone I know and they would make a corpse of him by <a name="n06130f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06130f">private shooting</a> with the greatest of pleasure and not leave enough of McGrath for the peelers to pick up.</p>
<p> Lies. There never was any girl in my house expecting trouble of my husband, never. The pair of whores that <a name="n06166b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06166b">committed all the nuisance</a> neither of them were virtuous pursuant to declaration of the public doctor out of the lock whereas I shall bring under revered notice<a target="foot" id="fez0005">&ordm;</a> above Honble Earwicker to
possess a chest very hairy <a name="n06020e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06020e">second to none</a> for it to be able to be seen from a child which I am the privileged to see and pursuant to same very affectionate after salesladies&apos; company. I will not have a dirty reptile the like of the McGraths to be spreading his lies all round where we live if he thinks he&apos;s the big noise here
as I simply agree to it. There, you worm! I know you now I would hate to say what I think about him. I exgust sneak McGrath Bros wanting to live on me &amp; my name like dirty parachutes. I wouldn&apos;t dream of a sausage belonging to him for meat for the cat &amp; it was in all the papers about Earwicker&apos;s <a name="n01068h" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01068h">fatspitters</a> that they
were <a name="n06160k" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06160k">eaten by more than 15,000 persons in Dublin this weekend alone</a>. The obnoxious liar! He was fired out of Cloon&apos;s where he was only one of your common floorwalkers for giving guff.</p>
<p> Moreover I&apos;ve heard it stated about the military but did space permit it is my belief I could
<br><font color="green">{ms, 39}</font>
<br> show it was the wish of his mind to mitigate the King&apos;s evil and I hereinafter swear by your revered majesty that it was him gave me the price of my new bulletproof dress with the angel sleeves and he said to my presence in these words: Just as there is a God of all things my mind is a complete blank.</p>
<p> Well, revered majesty, I tender you heartbroken thanks with regrets for lettering you and will now close hoping you are in the best. I don&apos;t care a fig for him and erronymous letter about an experience <a name="n06041l" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06041l">on the part of</a> me as girl with a alleged unpleasant clerical friend.
<a name="n06105i" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06105i">How about it?</a> <a name="n06153e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06153e">I was young &amp; easy then</a>. <a name="n06160j" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06160j">to feast his eyes</a> on my <a name="n06102a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06102a">sweet auburn</a> <a name="n06050e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06050e">hair falling

well for him When <a name="n06119g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06119g">next you see</a> M.G. Ask him what about his wife Lily Kinsella who <a name="n06087j" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06087j">became the wife of McGrath,</a> with Mr John Brophy &amp; Son, the kissing solicitor, at present engaging attention of private detectives
<a name="n06087c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06087c">being hidden under the grand piano</a> to see whether <a name="n06089h" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06089h">nothing beyond</a> <a name="n06134j" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06134j">handholding</a> went on. Lily is a lady and she had <a name="n06034c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06034c">medicine brought her in a licensed
victualler&apos;s bottle. Shame!</a> <a name="n06056e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06056e">Thrice shame!</a> I only wish he would look in through his letterbox one day and he would not say that was a solicitor&apos;s business.<a target="foot" id="fez0006">&ordm;</a> What ho, she bumps! My, he would be surprised to see his old girl with Mr Brophy solicitor quite affectionate together, kissing
and looking into a mirror.</p>
<p> So much for his sneakery
<br><font color="green">{ms, 40}</font>
<br> that I was treated not very grand by the thicks in Bully&apos;s acre. If any of Sully&apos;s thicks was to pull a gun on me he&apos;ll know better manners. <a name="n06126g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06126g">I&apos;ll sully him.</a> I will complain on them to P.S. Laracy at the corner of Buttermilk lane and he will have his head well &amp; lawfully broken by a Norwegian who has been
expelled out of Christianity.</p>
