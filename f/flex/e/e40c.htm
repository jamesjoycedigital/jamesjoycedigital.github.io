<p class="flush">Let us now draw nearer to it since it has after all met with misfortune &amp; see all there is to be seen. One cannot help noticing that about half of the lines run from E to W, others from N to S. These ruled lines along which the traced words can run, march, walk, stumble in comparative safety seem to have been first of all drawn in a pretty checker by using lampblack &amp; a
blackthorn. Such crossing is antechristian though the explanation may be geodetic quite as easily as <a name="n06068e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06068e">domestic economic</a>. Then, in addition to the original sand, pounce powder or soft rag, it has acquired accretions of terricious matter while loitering in the past. The teastain is a study in itself and its importance in establishing the
identity of the writer complex (for if the hand was one the minds were more than so) will be appreciated by remembering that in the time before &amp; after the battle of the Boyne it was the custom not to sign letters always. For why sign when every word, letter, penstroke, space, is a perfect signature in its own way. A person is known more by his personality, habits of dress, movements, response
to appeals for charity rather than by his or her boots.

<br> While we may have our irremovable doubts as to the whole sense of the text, the meaning of any phrase in it, the meaning of every word deciphered and interpreted we must not have any doubts as to its authorship and authoritativeness.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 38v}</font>
<br> Though apparently &amp; to a rough mind this document is a thing once for all done &amp; there you are somewhere and finished in a certain time be it a day or a year or even supposing it should turn out to be a long stretch of <a name="n05056j" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05056j">goodness only knows</a> how many days or years. But anyhow somebody some where some time wrote it, wrote it
all, wrote it all down and there it is, full stop. Ah yes but one <a name="n08f01j" href="../../ff/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08f01j">who deeply thinks</a> will always bear in his mind that this downright there you are &amp; there it is is only all in his eye. Every single person place &amp; thing was moving, changing every part of the time: the travelling inkpot, the hare &amp; turtle pen &amp; paper, the
continually more &amp; less intermisunderstanding minds of the anticollaborators, the variously inflected, differently pronounced, otherwise spelled, changeably meaning vocable scriptsigns. No it is not a riot of blots &amp; blurs &amp; bars &amp; balls &amp; hoops &amp; wriggles, it only looks as like it as damn it We ought to be deeply thankful that we have even a written on with now dried ink
piece of paper after it all &amp; cling to it as with drowning hands.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 41v}</font>
<br> Who that in scrutinising marvels at the indignant whiplashloops, the so prudently bolted or blocked rounds, the touching reminiscence of an incomplete trail or dropped final, the gossipy threadreels, the whirligig glorioles which ambiembellish the majuscule
<br><font color="green">{ms, 42v}</font>
<br> of Earwicker, the monology of the interiors, the pardonable confusion owing to which <a name="n08033m" href="../../ff/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08033m">the</a> pees with their caps awry are quite often <a name="n08033m" href="../../ff/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08033m">as not</a> kews with their tails in their mouths, the sudden petulance of a capitalised middle, the curt witty darts never quite at the truth
letter. Then a sudden sinistrogyric return to some sore point in the past a word here so cunningly hidden a nest of maze like a fieldmouse in a nest of coloured ribbons, the innocent exhibitionism of those capricious underlinings, those exotic serpentines since properly banished from our scriptures which ever longer and more headstrong seems to grow &amp; swell before one&apos;s eyes under the
writer&apos;s hand, the toomuchness and toomanyness of its fourlegged ems, the penelopean patience of the paraphe tailed by a leaping lasso &mdash; who thus at this marvelling will not press on to see the feminine vaulting <a name="n03123e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03123e">libido</a> of those interbranching sex up &amp; in sweeps sternly controlled and easily repersuaded by the uniform
matter of factness of a meandering male fist.</p>
<p> Duff-Moeggli called this kind of partnership the Odyssean or heterochiric complex after the wellinformed observation that in the case of the littleknown periplic poem popularly associated with that name a Punic admiralty report had been cleverly capsized &amp; then saucily reissued as a dodecanesian baedeker of an every-tale-a-treat-itself variety which could hope to satisfy the gander as well
as the goose. The identity of the persons in the complex came to light in a curious way. The original document was what is known as unbreakable tracery, that is to say, it had no signs of punctuation of any kind. On holding it to the light it was seen to be pierced or punctuated (in the university sense of the word) by
<br><font color="green">{ms, 43v}</font>
<br> numerous cuts and gashes made by a pronged instrument. These paper wounds, four in type, were gradually understand to mean stop, please stop, do please stop and O do please stop respectively and investigation showed that they were provoked by the fork of a professor at the breakfast table <a name="n04152l" href="../../ff/fnbs/n04all.htm#n04152l">professionally</a> piqued to introduce tempo
into a plane surface by making <a name="n08063k" href="../../ff/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08063k">holes in space</a>. Deeply religious by nature it was correctly suspected that such anger could not have been directed against the ancestral spirit of one openly respected by him once a week as our first boys&apos; best friend and when it was at last detected that the fourth or heaviest gash was more frequent
wherever the script was clear and the term terse and that these were the exact places carefully selected for her perforations by <a name="sa0982au" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0982au">Dame Partlet</a> on the dunghill reluctantly the theory of the jabbering ape was hotly dropped and its place usurped by that odious &amp; even today insufficiently despised notetaker, Jim the Penman.</p> </p>
