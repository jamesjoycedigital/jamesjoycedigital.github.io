<p> The proteiform graph itself is a polyexegetical piece of scripture. There was a time when alphabetters would have written it down the tracing of a pure deliquescent recidivist, snubnosed, probably, and having a profound rainbowl in his (or her) occiput. Closer inspection of the bordereau would however reveal a multiplicity of personalities inflicted on the provoking document and a prevision of
crime or crimes unwarily be made before any suitable occasion for it or them had <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">presented</span></span> arisen. But under the very eyes of inspection the traits which feature the sympathetic page coalesce, their contrarieties eliminated in a stable somebody, as by the warring of housebreaker on heartbreaker, of dramdrinker with freethinker, society
bowls along bumpily through generations, more generations &amp; still more generations. Who in hell wrote the durn thing anyway? Standing, seated, on horseback, against a <a name="sa0982bu" href="../../FF/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0982bu">partywall</a>, below zero, by the use of quill or style, with perturbed or pellucid mind, accompanied or the reverse by mastication, interrupted by visit of person to
scriptor or of scriptor to place, rained upon or blown around, by a regular racer from the soil or a whittlewit laden with the loot of learning?
<br><font color="green">{ms, 29v}</font> </p>
<p class="flush">Now, patience. And remember patience is the great thing. And above all things we must neither be nor become impatient. Think of all the patience possessed by Bruce &amp; the spider. If after years and years of research a sage solemnly tells us that the great one is less than a name, that the ear of Earwicker was the trademark of a
<a name="n05042b" href="../../FF/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05042b">broadcaster</a> and his wicker the local cant for an aeronaut then as to this oscillating epistle what is he who is the man <a name="n04157m" href="../../FF/fnbs/n04all.htm#n04157m">to give us the dinkum oil</a>?</p>
<p> To conclude from the absence of political allusions and its <font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font> that it cannot ever have been the work of a man or woman of that period &amp; those parts is as unjust as it would be to conclude from the nonpresence of inverted commas on any page that its compiler was constitutionally incapable of misappropriating the
actual words of others.</p>
<p> Has anyone, it might with profit some evening be asked, ever looked sufficiently longly upon <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">an env</span></span> a stamped addressed envelope. Admittedly it is but a covering; it bears an economic classification: its character is the civic clothing of whatever purepassionpallid <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">or</span></span> nudity
or plaguepurple nakedness it may or may not contain.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 30}</font> </p>
<p class="flush">Yet to concentrate solely on the psychological content or even the mental configuration of any document to the neglect of the facts which circumstance it is as hurtful to good sense (and let us add, <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">goo</span></span> the best taste) as were the vision when presented by a friend to a lady of the latter&apos;s acquaintance straightaway
to vision her in unapparelled naturalness deliberately closing his eyes to the fact that she was after all wearing some definite articles of clothing, inharmonious, a captious one might, not strictly necessary, a little irritating suddenly full of local personal colour, suggestive of much more, capable of being stretched if need were, their parts capable, even, of being separated for closer
comparison by the careful hand of the expert. Who in his heart doubts either that the facts of clothing are there and that the feminine fiction, stranger than the facts, is there at the same time
<br><font color="green">{ms, 29}</font>
<br> and that one may be separated from the other, that both may be contemplated &amp; that each may be considered in turn apart from the other successively?</p>
<p> Let then the facts speak in their own favour. It was wont to be wittily wagged by the chuckler <a name="n05013k" href="../../FF/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05013k">Mahappy Mahapnot</a> that Lucalizod was the only place in the world where the possible was always improbable, and the improbable the inevitable. This implies a sequentiality of impossible probables but nobody
<br><font color="green">{ms, 28v}</font>
<br> who has read up his subject <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">probab</span></span> probably in Aristotle will applaud the sentiment or sentence for utterly impossible as are all these events they are probably as like those which <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">happened</span></span> took place as any other which never took place at all are ever likely to be.</p>
<p> About the hen<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">.</span></span>, first. Midwinter was in the offing when a poorly clad shiverer, a mere bantling, observed a cold fowl behaving strangely on the fatal dump at the spot called the orangery when in the course of its deeper demolition it threw up certain fragments of orange peel, the remnant of an outdoor meal of some unknown sunseeker
<u>illico</u> in
<br><font color="green">{ms, 26v}</font>
<br> in a mistridden past. What child but little Kevin would ever in such a scene have found a motive for future <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">sainthood</span></span> saintity by euchring <a name="n03011c" href="../../FF/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03011c">the discovery</a> of the <a name="n03011a" href="../../FF/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03011a">Ardagh chalice</a>
<a name="n03011c" href="../../FF/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03011c">by another innocent</a> on the seasands near the scene of the massacre of most of the jacobiters. <a name="sa0271c" href="../../FF/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0271c">The bird of promise in the case was the hen of the Dorans and what she was scratching looked uncommonly like a sheet of letterpaper of the eleventh of the fifth to dear</a> which
proceeded to mention Maggy well and everybody&apos;s general health <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">and</span></span> well and lovely face of some gentleman and
<br><font color="green">{ms, 27}</font>
<br> a parcel of cookycakes well and it was grand funeral Maggy and hopes to hear from with love from a large stain of tea. The stain, &amp; that of tea, marks it off at once as a genuine old Irish MS.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 25v}</font> </p>
<p class="flush">Any photoist worth his chemicals will tell you that if a negative melts while drying the resultant postive will be a grotesque distortion of values, tones &amp; masses. This freely is what must have happened to that missive unfilthed by the sagacity of a hen. <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">The heat</span></span> Heated residence for who knows when in the
orangeflavoured mound had <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">gro</span></span> dissolved the first impression and caused some features palpably near us to be swollen up grossly while the farther back we get the more we need the loan of a lens to see as much as the hen saw.</p>
<p> Wonderfully well this explains the double nature of this gryphonic script and while its ingredients stand out with <a name="n06125h" href="../../FF/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06125h">stereoptican relief</a> we can see beyond the figure of the scriptor into the <a name="n06109b" href="../../FF/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06109b">subconscious editor&apos;s</a> mind.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 35v}</font>
<br> |xWould we vision her with <a name="n06125h" href="../../FF/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06125h">stereoptican relief</a> (<a name="n06109b" href="../../FF/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06109b">subconscious editor</a>)|x*</p> </p>  </main>
