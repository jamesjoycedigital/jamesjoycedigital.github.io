<p> Her<a target="foot" id="fee0003">&ordm;</a> untitled memorial to the allhighest has gone by many names at disjointed times. Thus we hear of<a target="foot" id="fee0004">&ordm;</a> <i>Pro Honofrio</i>, <i>The Crazier Letters</i>, <i>Groans of a Britoness</i>, <i>An Apology for a Husband</i>, <i>Ought We To Visit Him?</i>,<a target="foot" id="fee0020">&ordm;</a>
<i>Cock</i><a target="foot" id="fee0022">&ordm;</a> <i>in the Pot for Father</i>, <i>First and Last Only True Account all about Mr Earwicker and the Snake by a Woman of the World who only can Tell Naked Truths about a Dear Man and all his Conspirators how they all Tried to Fall him by</i><a target="foot" id="fee0100">&ordm;</a> <i>Putting it all around Lucalizod about Earwicker and a Pair of
Sloppy Sluts plainly Showing all the Unmentionability falsely Accusing about the Redcoats</i>.</p>
<p> The proteiform graph itself is a polyhedron of scripture. There was a time when naif alphabetters would have written it down the tracing of a purely deliquescent recidivist, possibly ambidexterous, snubnosed probably and presenting a strangely profound rainbowl in his (or her) occiput. Closer inspection of the <i>bordereau</i><a target="foot" id="fee0108">&ordm;</a> would reveal a multiplicity
of personalities inflicted on the document and some prevision of virtual crime or crimes might be made by anyone unwary enough before any suitable occasion for it or them had so far managed <a name="n03127a" href="../../FF/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03127a">to happen along</a>. In fact, under the close<a target="foot" id="fee0110">&ordm;</a> eyes of the inspector<a target="foot" id="fee0111">&ordm;</a> the
traits featuring the <i>chiaroscuro</i><a target="foot" id="fee0112">&ordm;</a> coalesce, their contrarieties eliminated, in one stable somebody similarly as by the providential warring of heartbreaker with housebreaker and of dramdrinker against freethinker our social something bowls along bumpily down the long lane of generations, more generations and still more generations.</p>
<p> Say, who in hell wrote the durn thing
<br><font color="green">{f39, 108}</font>
<br> anyhow?  Erect, beseated, ahorseback, against a <a name="sa0982bu" href="../../FF/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0982bu">partywall</a>, below zero, by the use of quill or style, with turbid or pellucid mind, accompanied or the reverse by mastication, interrupted by visit of person to <a name="n03010b" href="../../FF/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03010b">scribe</a> or of
<a name="n03010b" href="../../FF/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03010b">scribe</a> to place, rained upon or blown around, by a rightdown regular racer from the soil or by a too pained whittlewit laden with the loot of learning?</p>
<p> Now,<a target="foot" id="fee0115">&ordm;</a> patience. And<a target="foot" id="fee0116">&ordm;</a> remember patience is the great thing. And<a target="foot" id="fee0117">&ordm;</a> above all things else we must avoid anything like being or becoming out of patience. A good plan used by worried business folk is just to think of all the sinking fund of patience possessed in their conjoint names
by both brothers Bruce <a name="n06006o" href="../../FF/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06006o">with whom is incorporated</a> their Scotch spider. If after years upon years of delving in ditches dark one tubthumper more than others has got up for the purpose of reassuring us that our great ascendant was properly speaking three syllables less than his own surname
(<a name="n03062j" href="../../FF/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03062j">yes, less!</a>), that<a target="foot" id="fee0120">&ordm;</a> the ear of Earwicker aforetime was the trademark of a <a name="n05042b" href="../../FF/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05042b">broadcaster</a> with wicker local cant for an ace&apos;s patent, then<a target="foot" id="fee0123">&ordm;</a> as to this radiooscillating epiepistle to which we must
ceaselessly return,<a target="foot" id="fee0124">&ordm;</a> whereabouts exactly at present is that bright soandso to <a name="n04157m" href="../../FF/fnbs/n04all.htm#n04157m">give</a> <a name="n04157m" href="../../FF/fnbs/n04all.htm#n04157m">us the dinkum oil</a>?</p>
<p> Naysayers<a target="foot" id="fee0126">&ordm;</a> we know. To conclude purely negatively from the positive absence of political odia and monetary requests that its page cannot ever have been a penproduct of a man or woman of that period or those parts is only one more unlookedfor conclusion leaped at,<a target="foot" id="fee0127">&ordm;</a> being tantamount to inferring from the nonpresence of
inverted commas (sometimes called quotation marks) on any page that its author was always constitutionally incapable of misappropriating the spoken words of others.
<br><font color="green">{f39, 109}</font> </p>
<p> Has any fellow, it might with some profit some dull evening quietly be hinted &mdash;<a target="foot" id="fee0129">&ordm;</a> has any usual sort of ordinary fellow ever looked sufficiently longly at a quite everydaylooking stamped addressed envelope?<a target="foot" id="fee0135">&ordm;</a> Admittedly it is an outer husk: its face is its fortune: it exhibits only the
<a name="n03153c" href="../../FF/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03153c">civil</a> or military clothing of whatever passionpallid nudity or plaguepurple  nakedness may happen to tuck itself under its flap. Yet to concentrate solely on the literal sense or even the psychological content of any document to the sore neglect of the enveloping facts themselves circumstantiating it is just as hurtful to sound sense
(and, let it be added,<a target="foot" id="fee0137">&ordm;</a> to the truest taste) as were some fellow in the act of perhaps getting <a name="n06092e" href="../../FF/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06092e">an intro</a> from another fellow turning out to be a friend of his, say,<a target="foot" id="fee0138">&ordm;</a> to a lady of the latter&apos;s acquaintance straightway<a target="foot" id="fee0139">&ordm;</a>
to run off and vision her plump and plain in her natural altogether, preferring to close his eyes to the fact that she was, after all,<a target="foot" id="fee0140">&ordm;</a> wearing for the time being some definite articles of clothing, inharmonious, a captious critic might describe them as, or not strictly necessary or a trifle irritating here and there<a target="foot" id="fee0141">&ordm;</a>
but for all that<a target="foot" id="fee0142">&ordm;</a> suddenly full of local colour and personal perfume and suggestive, too,<a target="foot" id="fee0143">&ordm;</a> of so much more and capable of being stretched, filled out, if need or wish were, of having their surprisingly like coincidental parts separated for better survey by the deft hand of an expert. Who in his heart doubts either that
the facts of feminine clothing are there all the time or that the feminine fiction, stranger than the facts, is there also at the same time,<a target="foot" id="fee0146">&ordm;</a> only a little to the rere? Or that one may be separated from the other? Or that both may then be contemplated simultaneously? Or that each may be taken up and considered in turn apart from the other?
<br><font color="green">{f39, 110}</font> </p>
<p> Here let a few facts speak in their own favour. That stern chuckler, <a name="n05013k" href="../../FF/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05013k">Mahappy Mahapnot</a>, once<a target="foot" id="fee0150">&ordm;</a> said and repeated that Lucalizod was the one place in the world where the possible was the improbable and the improbable the inevitable. If he hit his two
<a name="n06123a" href="../../FF/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06123a">nails on the head</a> we are in for a sequentiality of improbable possibles though possibly nobody after having read up<a target="foot" id="fee0153">&ordm;</a> his subject probably in Aristotle will go out of his way to applaud him on the back of his remark for, utterly impossible as are all these
here<a target="foot" id="fee0154">&ordm;</a> events,<a target="foot" id="fee0155">&ordm;</a> they are probably as like those which may have taken place as any others which never took place at all are ever likely to be. </p>
<p> About that original hen. Midwinter was in the onning when an iceclad shiverer, merest of bantlings,<a target="foot" id="fee0156">&ordm;</a> observed a cold fowl behaviourising strangely on that fatal midden (dump for short) afterwards changed into the orangery when in the course of deeper demolition unexpectedly it threw up a few fragments of orangepeel, the last remains of an outdoor meal by
some unknown sunseeker <i>illico</i> way back in his mistridden past. What child but chippy little Kevin in the despondful surrounding of such sneezing cold would ever have picked up a motive for future saintity by euchring <a name="n03011c" href="../../FF/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03011c">the finding</a> of the <a name="n03011a" href="../../FF/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03011a">Ardagh chalice</a>
<a name="n03011c" href="../../FF/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03011c">by another</a> holy <a name="n03011c" href="../../FF/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03011c">innocent</a> on the seasand in sight of the scene of the massacre of most of the Jacobiters<a target="foot" id="fee0162">&ordm;</a>. The bird in the case was the hen of the Dorans and<a target="foot" id="fee0164">&ordm;</a>
<a name="sa0271c" href="../../FF/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0271c">what she was scratching at</a> looked for all the world like a goodishsized <a name="sa0271c" href="../../FF/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0271c">sheet of letterpaper originating</a> <a name="sa0271c" href="../../FF/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0271c">from Boston (Mass.)</a><a target="foot" id="fee0166">&ordm;</a>
<a name="sa0271c" href="../../FF/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0271c">of the eleventh of the fifth to Dear</a> and it proceeded<a target="foot" id="fee0167">&ordm;</a> to mention Maggy well and allathome&apos;s health well and a lovely face of some born gentleman with a beautiful present of cakes for dear thank you<a target="foot" id="fee0171">&ordm;</a> with grand funeral of poor
Father<a target="foot" id="fee0172">&ordm;</a> don&apos;t forget unto life&apos;s end Muggy well how are you<a target="foot" id="fee0173">&ordm;</a> Maggy and hopes soon to hear well and must now close with fondest <a name="sa0271c" href="../../FF/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0271c">with four crosskisses</a> pee ess from affectionate largelooking stain of tea. The stain, and that a teastain of tea, marked it
off on the spur of the moment as a genuine relique of ancient Irish poetry of that pleasingly sad class known as a hurry-me-off-from-Queenstown.</p>
<p> Why then how?</p>
<p> Well,<a target="foot" id="fee0175">&ordm;</a> almost any photoist worth his chemicals will tell anyone asking him at home that if a negative of a horse happens to melt enough<a target="foot" id="fee0178">&ordm;</a> during drying, well,<a target="foot" id="fee0179">&ordm;</a> what you do get is, well,<a target="foot" id="fee0180">&ordm;</a> a positively grotesque distortion of all sorts of
horse values and masses of horse. Well,<a target="foot" id="fee0181">&ordm;</a> this freely is what must have occurred to our missive unfilthed  by the sagacity of a <a name="sa0271c" href="../../FF/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0271c">slanteyed</a> hen. Heated residence<a target="foot" id="fee0182">&ordm;</a> in the heart of the orangeflavoured mudmound had partly obliterated the negative to start with,
causing some features palpably nearer the reader to be swollen up most grossly while
<br><font color="green">{f39, 112}</font>
<br> the farther back we manage to wiggle the more we need the loan of a lens to see as much as the hen saw.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p> Let us now, if perfectly convenient, <a name="n07a01g" href="../../FF/fnbs/n07all.htm#n07a01g">talk straight turkey</a> as<a target="foot" id="fee0216">&ordm;</a> man to man for while the ear may sometimes be inclined to believe others the eye<a target="foot" id="fee0218">&ordm;</a> finds<a target="foot" id="fee0219">&ordm;</a> it devilish hard now and again even to believe itself. Drawing
nearer to <a name="n08035n" href="../../FF/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08035n">take our slant at</a> it (since after all it has met with misfortune while <a name="n06036i" href="../../FF/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06036i">all underground</a>), let<a target="foot" id="fee0222">&ordm;</a> us see all there may remain to be seen. One cannot help noticing that rather more than half of the lines run
north-south<a target="foot" id="fee0224">&ordm;</a> while the others go west-east<a target="foot" id="fee0225">&ordm;</a> for, tiny tot though it looks alongside other incunabula,<a target="foot" id="fee0226">&ordm;</a> it has its cardinal points for all that. These ruled barriers along which the traced words<a target="foot" id="fee0227">&ordm;</a> run, march, halt, walk, stumble at
<a name="n08053o" href="../../FF/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08053o">doubtful points</a>, stumble up again in comparative safety seem to have been drawn first of all in a pretty checker with lampblack and blackthorn. Such crossing is antechristian,<a target="foot" id="fee0228">&ordm;</a> of course, but the use of the <a name="n08098j" href="../../FF/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08098j">homeborn</a> shillelagh as an aid
to <a name="n05118j" href="../../FF/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05118j">calligraphy</a> shows a distinct advance from savagery to barbarism. It is seriously believed by some that the intention may have been geodetic<a target="foot" id="fee0229">&ordm;</a> or, in the view of the cannier, <a name="n06068e" href="../../FF/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06068e">domestic economical</a>. Another point.
In<a target="foot" id="fee0232">&ordm;</a> addition to the original sand, pounce powder, <a name="n08055h" href="../../FF/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08055h">drunkard</a><a target="foot" id="fee0233">&ordm;</a> <a name="n08055h" href="../../FF/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08055h">paper</a> or soft rag used it has acquired accretions of terricious matter whilst loitering in the past. The terminal teastain is a cosy
little study all to itself and its importance in establishing the identities in the writer complex (for if the hand was one<a target="foot" id="fee0236">&ordm;</a> the minds of <a name="n08055a" href="../../FF/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08055a">active and agitated</a> were more than so) will be best appreciated by never forgetting that both before and after the battle of the Boyne it was a habit not to sign
letters
<br><font color="green">{f39, 115}</font>
<br> always. Why, pray, sign anything as long as every word, letter, penstroke, space is a perfect signature of its own? A true friend is known much more easily, and better into the bargain,<a target="foot" id="fee0240">&ordm;</a> by his personal touch, habits of full<a target="foot" id="fee0241">&ordm;</a> <a name="sa0982cq" href="../../FF/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0982cq">or undress</a>,
movements,<a target="foot" id="fee0242">&ordm;</a> response to appeals for charity than by his footwear, say.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p> Now while we in our wee free state may have our irremovable doubts as to the whole sense of the lot, the interpretation of any phrase in
<br><font color="green">{f39, 118}</font>
<br> the whole, the meaning of every word of a phrase so far deciphered out of it, however unfettered our Irish daily independence,<a target="foot" id="fee0284">&ordm;</a> we must vaunt no idle dubiosity as to its genuine authorship and <a name="n03081f" href="../../FF/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03081f">holusbolus</a> authoritativeness. On the face of it and to your rough mind the affair is a thing once for
all done and there you are somewhere and finished in a certain time, be it a day or a year or even supposing<a target="foot" id="fee0285">&ordm;</a> it should eventually turn out to be a serial number of <a name="n05056j" href="../../FF/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05056j">goodness</a> <a name="n03138a" href="../../FF/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03138a">gracious</a>
<a name="n05056j" href="../../FF/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05056j">alone knows</a><a target="foot" id="fee0286">&ordm;</a> how many days or years. Anyhow,<a target="foot" id="fee0287">&ordm;</a> somehow and somewhere somebody mentioned by name in his telephone directory wrote it, wrote it all, wrote it all down,<a target="foot" id="fee0288">&ordm;</a> and there you
are,<a target="foot" id="fee0289">&ordm;</a>  full stop. O, undoubtedly yes,<a target="foot" id="fee0290">&ordm;</a> but one <a name="n08f01j" href="../../FF/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08f01j">who deeper thinks</a> will always bear in his mind that this downright there you are and there it is is only all in his eye. Why?</p>
<p> Because, if it goes to that, every<a target="foot" id="fee0293">&ordm;</a> person, place and thing anyway connected with it was moving and changing every part of the time: the travelling inkhorn (possibly pot), the hare and turtle pen and paper, the continually more and less intermisunderstanding minds of the anticollaborators, the as time went on as it will variously
inflected,<a target="foot" id="fee0294">&ordm;</a> differently pronounced, otherwise spelled, changeably meaning vocable scriptsigns. No, it is not a <a name="n06032f" href="../../FF/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06032f">miseffectual</a> riot of blots and blurs and bars and balls and hoops and wriggles and <a name="n08055b" href="../../FF/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08055b">juxtaposed jottings linked by spurts of
speed</a>: it only looks as like it as damn it:<a target="foot" id="fee0295">&ordm;</a> and, sure, we ought really to rest thankful that we have even a written on with now<a target="foot" id="fee0296">&ordm;</a> dried ink scrap of paper at all to show for ourselves after all it has gone through and by all means cling to it as with drowning hands, hoping against hope all the while that
<a name="n08037k" href="../../FF/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08037k">things will begin to clear up</a> a bit <a name="n06075d" href="../../FF/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06075d">one way or another</a> <a name="n08037k" href="../../FF/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08037k">within the next quarter of an hour</a> and <a name="n05150a" href="../../FF/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05150a">be hanged to them</a> as ten to one

<p> Duff-Muggli, who now may be quoted by arrangement,<a target="foot" id="fee0394">&ordm;</a> first called this kind of paddygoeasy partnership the odyssean or heterochiric complex after the wellinformed observation, made<a target="foot" id="fee0400">&ordm;</a> quite apart from him by Tung-Toyd, that<a target="foot" id="fee0403">&ordm;</a> in the case of the littleknown periplic poem popularly
associated with the name of the wretched mariner a Punic admiralty report had<a target="foot" id="fee0405">&ordm;</a> been cleverly capsized and saucily republished as a dodecanesian baedeker of the every-tale-a-treat-in-itself variety which could hope satisfactorily to tickle the gander as well as the goose.</p>
<p> The unmistaken identity of the persons in the complex came to light in the most curious of ways. The original document was what is known as unbreakable script, that is to say<a target="foot" id="fee0406">&ordm;</a> it showed no signs of punctuation of any sort. Yet on holding <a name="n08057c" href="../../FF/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08057c">the verso</a> against

<br><font color="green">{f39, 124}</font>
<br> fact that it was pierced or punctured (in the university sense of the term) by numerous stabs and foliated gashes made by a pronged instrument. These paper wounds, four in type, were gradually and correctly understood to mean stop, please stop, do please stop,<a target="foot" id="fee0407">&ordm;</a> and O do please stop respectively and police investigation showed that they had been provoked
by<a target="foot" id="fee0413">&ordm;</a> the fork of a professor at the breakfast table <a name="n04152l" href="../../FF/fnbs/n04all.htm#n04152l">professionally</a> piqued to introduce a notion of time upon a plane surface by punching <a name="n08063k" href="../../FF/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08063k">holes in space</a>. Deeply<a target="foot" id="fee0428">&ordm;</a> religious by nature and
position,<a target="foot" id="fee0429">&ordm;</a> it was rightly suspected that such ire could not have been visited by him upon the ancestral spirit of one whom he openly worshipped at least once a week as our first boy&apos;s<a target="foot" id="fee0433">&ordm;</a> best friend and when some peerer or peeress detected that the fourleaved shamrock or
