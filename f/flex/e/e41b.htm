<p class="flush">Let us draw draw nearer <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">to</span></span> since <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">if</span></span> it after all has met with misfortune &amp; see all there may remain to be seen. One cannot help noticing how about &frac12; of the lines run from N to S and the rest of them from E to W. These ruled barriers along which the
traced words run, march, walk, collide, stumble, stumble up again in comparative safety seem to have been drawn first of all in a pretty checker with lampblack &amp; <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">a</span></span> blackthorn. Such crossing is antechristian, of course. Some think the intention may have been geodetic, others domestic economy. Another thing, in addition to the original
sand, pounce powder, or soft rag used it has acquired accretions of terricious matter whilst loitering in the past. The teastain is a little study all to itself and its importance in establishing the identity of the writer complex (for if the hand was one the minds were more than so) will be best appreciated by remembering that both before &amp; after the battle of the Boyne it was the custom not
to sign letters always. Why sign anything as long as every word, letter, penstroke, space is a perfect signature in its own way. A true friend is known infinitely more easily &amp; better into the bargain by his <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">personalit</span></span> personal touch, habits of dress <a name="sa0982cq" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0982cq">or undress</a>,
<br><font color="green">{ms, 45v}</font>
<br> movements, response to appeals to charity than by his boots, say.</p>
<p> Now while we may have our irremovable doubts as to the whole sense of the, the interpretation of any phrase in it, the meaning of every word so far deciphered out of it we must have no idle dubiosity <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">as</span></span> about its authorship and authoritativeness. On the face of it &amp; to a rough mind the document is a thing once for all done &amp;
there you are somewhere &amp; finished in a certain time be it a day or a year or even supposing it should eventually turn out to be a long stretch of goodness alone knows how many days or years. But anyhow somebody somehow somewhere wrote it, wrote it all, wrote it all down &amp; there you are full stop. Ah yes but one who deeply thinks will always bear in his mind that this downright there you
are &amp; there it is is only all in his eye. Why?</p>
<p> Because every person, place &amp; thing in it <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">and</span></span> was moving and changing every part of the time: the travelling inkpot, the hare &amp; turtle pen &amp; paper, the continually more &amp; less intermisunderstanding minds of the anticollaborators, the variously inflected, differently pronounced, otherwise spelled, changeably meaning
vocable scriptsigns. No it is not a
<br><font color="green">{ms, 46v}</font>
<br> riot of blots &amp; blurs &amp; bars &amp; balls &amp; hoops &amp; wriggles: it only looks as like it as damn it, &amp; we ought to rest thankful that we have even a written on with<a target="foot" id="fez0031">&ordm;</a> dried ink <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">paper</span></span> piece of paper to show for ourselves after all it has gone through &amp; cling to it as with
drowning hands, hoping all the while that <a name="n08037k" href="../../ff/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08037k">things will begin to clear up</a> a bit <a name="n08037k" href="../../ff/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08037k">within the next quarter of an hour</a> as ten to one they will as they ought to.</p>
<p> For who that<a target="foot" id="fez0032">&ordm;</a> scrutinising marvels at those indignant whiplashloops, those so prudently bolted or blocked rounds, the touching reminiscence of an incomplete trail<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">,</span></span> or dropped final, the gossipy threadreels, <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the</span></span>
<a name="n08041k" href="../../ff/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08041k">a round thousand</a> whirligig glorioles ambiembellishing the majuscule of Earwicker, the monology of the interiors, the pardonable confusion to which <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the</span></span> pees with their caps awry are quite as often as not taken to be kews with their tails in their mouths,
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the toomuchness</span></span> the sudden petulance of some capitalised middle, the curt witty darts never quite just at the truth letter, a word as cunningly hidden in its maze of traceries as a fieldmouse in a nest of coloured ribbons, then an utterly unexpected
<br><font color="green">{ms, 47v}</font>
<br> sinistrogyric return to a particular sore point in the past, the innocent exhibitionism of those frank yet capricious underlinings, that strange exotic serpentine since properly banished from our scripture which ever longer and more headstrong seems to grow &amp; swell before our eyes under the writer&apos;s hand, the toomuchness and fartoomanyness of all those fourlegged ems, the penelopean
patience of its last paraphe tailed by a leaping lasso &mdash; who thus at this marvelling will not press on to see <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">a</span></span> the feminine vaulting libido of those interbranching sex upandinsweeps sternly controlled and easily repersuaded by the uniform matteroffactness of a meandering male fist.</p>
<p> Duff-Moeggli called this kind of a partnership the odyssean or heterochiric complex after the wellinformed observation that in the case of the littleknown periplous poem popularly associated with that name a Punic admiralty report has been cleverly capsized &amp; then saucily reissued as a dodecanesian baedeker of an
<br><font color="green">{ms, 48v}</font>
<br> every-tale-a-treat-in-itself variety which could hope satisfactorily to tickle the gander as well as the goose.</p>
<p> The true identity of the two persons in the complex came to light in a curious way. The original document was what is known as unbreakable script, that is to say, it had no signs of punctuation of any sort. On holding it against <a name="n06027i" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06027i">a lit rush</a>, however, it was seen to be pierced or punctuated (in the university sense of the term) by
numerous stabs &amp; gashes made by a pronged instrument. These paper wounds, four in type, were gradually but correctly understood to mean stop, please stop, do please stop &amp; O do please stop respectively, and investigation showed that they were provoked by the fork of a professor at the breakfast table, professionally piqued to introduce a notion of time upon a plane surface by puncturing
holes in space. Deeply religious by nature it was rightly suspected that such ire could not have been directed against the ancestral spirit of one openly worshipped by him
<br><font color="green">{ms, 49v}</font>
<br> regularly once a week as our first boy&apos;s best friend and when it was at last detected that the fourth or most drastic jab was more recurrent wherever the script was clear and the term terse &amp; that these two were the exact spots carefully selected for her perforations by Dame Partlet on the dungheap reluctantly the theory of the jabbering ape was hotly dropped and its place usurped by
that odious and even today insufficiently despised notetaker Shem the Penman.</p> </p>  </main>
