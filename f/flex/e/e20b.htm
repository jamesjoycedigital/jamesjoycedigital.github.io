<p class="spfl">Revered</p>
<p> Majesty well Ive heard all those birds what theyre saying about him <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">bu</span></span> and welcome. The Honourable Mr Earwicker, my devout husband, is a true gentleman which is what none of the sneakers ever was or will be because in the words of a royal poet such are born and not made and that he was and it was
<a name="n05035f" href="../../FF/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05035f">between Williamstown and Ailesbury road on the long car I first saw the lovelight in his eyes</a>. Well, revered Majesty, I hereafter swear he never once sent out the <a name="n04157g" href="../../FF/fnbs/n04all.htm#n04157g">swags</a> with a drop in any but <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the</span></span>
<a name="n05055i" href="../../FF/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05055i">milk as it came from the cow</a> and all that is invented by McGrath Bros against that dear man, my <a name="n05151k" href="../../FF/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05151k">honorary husband</a>. If I were only to tell your revered all he said to me <a name="n05101h" href="../../FF/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05101h">was it this time last year</a> as I told
<a name="n05101i" href="../../FF/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05101i">Mrs</a> <a name="n05101i" href="../../FF/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05101i">Joe</a> for his accomodation, <a name="n05104h" href="../../FF/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05104h">McGrath Bros, I&apos;m saying</a> and his <a name="n05104j" href="../../FF/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05104j">bacon</a> not fit to look at
<a name="n05104j" href="../../FF/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05104j">never mind butter</a> which is forbidden by the eight commandment <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">y</span></span> thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour. Aha, McGrath, the lies are out on him like freckles. <a name="n05113b" href="../../FF/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05113b">When I think</a> of what he had the face to
say about my dearly respected husband, can I ever forget that. <a name="n05113b" href="../../FF/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05113b">Never</a>, so may God forgive McGrath
<br><font color="green">{ms, 32}</font>
<br> Bros all his trespasses against the Hon Mr Earwicker. If I was only to tell someone I know &amp; <a name="n05135i" href="../../FF/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05135i">they would make a corpse of him</a> with the greatest of pleasure <a name="n05135j" href="../../FF/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05135j">&amp; not leave enough for the peelers to pick up</a>.</p>
<p> There never was any girl in my house <a name="n05146j" href="../../FF/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05146j">expecting trouble</a> out of my husband, never, and those two hussies neither was virtuous after the Doctor&apos;s declaration and whereas the Honourable Mr Earwicker has a very <a name="n05140b" href="../../FF/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05140b">hairy chest</a> which I am the privileged one to see and whereas
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">he is</span></span> pursuant to that very affectionate for ladies&apos; society I will not have a reptile the like of McGrath Bros to be spreading his lies all round <a name="n03147c" href="../../FF/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03147c">where we live</a> <a name="n04150h" href="../../FF/fnbs/n04all.htm#n04150h">as I simply agree to it</a>, the
<a name="n05152j" href="../../FF/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05152j">obnoxious</a> liar, he was <a name="n05154g" href="../../FF/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05154g">fired</a> out of Clune&apos;s for giving guff.</p>
<p> <a name="n05157i" href="../../FF/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05157i">I&apos;ve heard it stated</a> about the military but, <a name="n05157f" href="../../FF/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05157f">did space permit</a>, it is my belief I could show it was to cure the <a name="n05158i" href="../../FF/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05158i">King&apos;s evil</a> and I hereinafter swear by your revered majesty that he said in my presence:
As there is a God of all things <a name="n05158f" href="../../FF/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05158f">my mind is a complete blank</a>.</p>
<p> Well, revered Majesty, I tender
<br><font color="green">{ms, 33}</font>
<br> you <a name="n06151j" href="../../FF/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06151j">heartest thanks</a> &amp; regrets for <a name="n05178a" href="../../FF/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05178a">lettering you</a> and <a name="n05178b" href="../../FF/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05178b">I shall close</a> hoping you are <a name="n05178c" href="../../FF/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05178c">in the best of health</a>. I don&apos;t care that for him and lies
about <a name="n05bcri" href="../../FF/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05bcri">an experience of mine</a> <a name="n05bcrj" href="../../FF/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05bcrj">with a clerical friend</a>. Ask him what about his wife and Mr John Brophy, <a name="sa0801di" href="../../FF/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0801di">the kissing solicitor</a>. <a name="n05178d" href="../../FF/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05178d">I only wish</a> he wd look in
through the letterbox some day. <a name="n05095a" href="../../FF/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05095a">What ho, she bumps.</a> He wd be surprised to see her &amp; Mr Brophy <a name="sa0802ak" href="../../FF/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0802ak">quite affectionate together</a> <a name="n06088d" href="../../FF/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06088d">kissing &amp; looking into a mirror</a>.</p>
<p> So much for the lies that I was <a name="n04145a" href="../../FF/fnbs/n04all.htm#n04145a">treated not very grand</a> by the <a name="sa0121aa" href="../../FF/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0121aa">thicks</a>. If any thick goes to <a name="n04139a" href="../../FF/fnbs/n04all.htm#n04139a">pull a gun</a> on me, <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">worse for him</span></span> he&apos;ll know better
manners. I will have his head broken by a Norwegian who has been expelled from christianity. <a name="n04129a" href="../../FF/fnbs/n04all.htm#n04129a">I am perfectly proud of</a> Mr Earwicker. I tell Sneakers and Mr Sausage McGrath, <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">creeping Christy.</span></span> <a name="n01035h" href="../../FF/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01035h">back &amp; streaky,
