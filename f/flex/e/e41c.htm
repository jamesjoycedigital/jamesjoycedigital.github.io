One cannot help noticing how rather more than &frac12; of the lines run from N to S and the rest of them from E to W for tiny tot beside other incunabula as it is it has its cardinal points for all that. These ruled barriers along which the traced words run, march, walk, collide, stumble, stumble up again in comparative safety seem to have been drawn first of all in a
pretty checker with lampblack &amp; blackthorn. Such crossing is antechristian, of course. The use of the <a name="n08098j" href="../../ff/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08098j">homeborn</a> cudgel in <a name="n05118j" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05118j">caligraphy</a>, it is seriously believed, shows a a<a target="foot" id="fez0030">&ordm;</a> clear advance from savagery to barbarism. Some think the
intention may have been geodetic, cannier ones domestic economy. Another thing, in addition to the original sand, pounce powder, or soft rag used it has acquired accretions of terricious matter whilst loitering in the past. The teastain is a little study all to itself and its importance in establishing the identity of the writer complex (for if the hand was one the minds were more than so) will be
best appreciated by remembering that both before &amp; after the battle of the Boyne it was the custom not to sign letters always. Why, pray, sign anything as long as every word, letter, penstroke, space is a perfect signature in its own way. A true friend is known infinitely more easily &amp; better into the bargain by his personal touch, habits of full dress

<p> Now while in our wee free state we may have our irremovable doubts as to the whole sense of the lot, the interpretation of any phrase in the whole, the meaning of every word of a phrase so far deciphered out of it however unfettered our Irish Daily independence we must vaunt no idle dubiosity about its authorship and authoritativeness. On the face of it &amp; to a rough mind the document is a
thing once for all done &amp; there you are somewhere &amp; finished in a certain time be it a day or a year or even supposing it should eventually turn out to be a long stretch of goodness alone knows how many days or years. But anyhow somebody somehow somewhere wrote it, wrote it all, wrote it all down &amp; there you are full stop. O undoubtedly yes but one who deeply thinks will always bear in
his mind that this downright there you are &amp; there it is is only all in his eye. Why?</p>
<p> Because, if it goes to that, every person, place &amp; thing mentioned by name in the telephone directory was moving and changing every part of the time: the travelling inkpot, the hare &amp; turtle pen &amp; paper, the continually more &amp; less intermisunderstanding minds of the anticollaborators, the as time went on as it will variously inflected, differently pronounced, otherwise spelled,

paces jerkily to &amp; fro flinging phrases here, there, &amp; returns with a suggestion, dragging its shoestring, the innocent exhibitionism of those frank yet capricious underlinings, that strange exotic serpentine since properly banished from our scripture which ever longer and more headstrong seems to grow &amp; swell before our eyes under the writer&apos;s hand,

penelopean patience of its last paraphe tailed by a leaping lasso &mdash; who thus at this marvelling will not press on to see the feminine vaulting libido of those interbranching sex upandinsweeps sternly controlled and easily repersuaded by the uniform matteroffactness of a meandering male fist.</p>
<p> Duff-Muggli (who may be quoted by arrangement) first called this kind of a paddygoeasy partnership the odyssean or heterochiric complex after the wellinformed observation made quite apart from him, by Tung-Toyd that in the case of the littleknown periplous poem popularly associated with that name a Punic admiralty report has been cleverly capsized &amp; then saucily reissued as a dodecanesian
baedeker of an
<br><font color="green">{ms, 48v}</font>
<br> every-tale-a-treat-in-itself variety which could hope satisfactorily to tickle the gander as well as the goose.</p>
<p> The true identity of the two persons in the complex came to light in a curious way. The original document was what is known as unbreakable script, that is to say, it had no signs of punctuation of any sort. On holding it against <a name="n06027i" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06027i">a lit rush</a>, however, it responded most remarkably to the silent query of our world&apos;s oldest light
&amp; showed itself to be pierced or punctuated (in the university sense of the term) by numerous stabs &amp; gashes made by a pronged instrument. These paper wounds, four in type, were gradually but correctly understood to mean stop, please stop, do please stop &amp; O do please stop respectively, and investigation showed that they were provoked by the fork of a professor at the breakfast table,
professionally piqued to introduce a notion of time upon a plane surface by puncturing holes in space. Deeply religious by nature it was rightly suspected that such ire could not have been invoked upon the ancestral spirit of one openly worshipped by him
<br><font color="green">{ms, 49v}</font>
<br> regularly once a week as our first boy&apos;s best friend and when it was at last detected that the fourth or most drastic jab was more recurrent wherever the script was clear and the term terse &amp; that these two were the exact spots carefully selected for her perforations by Dame Partlet on the dungheap reluctantly the theory of the jabbering ape from Oxford was hotly dropped and his
place usurped by that odious and even today insufficiently despised notetaker Shem the Penman.</p> </p>  </main>
