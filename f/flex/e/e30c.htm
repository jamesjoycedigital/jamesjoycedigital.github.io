<p class="flush">And congruously enough the confusion of its composition was fitly capped by the zigzaggery of its delivery.<a target="foot" id="fez0022">&ordm;</a> and not for the 1st time in history just as, it has been more than once pointed out, the demise of one parish priest or curate is sure to be followed sooner or later by other parochial demises of an allied nature. Though, coming now to
the postman hastily left on p 80, though his qualifications for that particular postal, or office, were known only to a limited circle of friends<a target="foot" id="fez0023">&ordm;</a> the spectacle of the Lucalizod lettercarrier, a most capable official of very superior appearance in his emptybottlegreen jerkin, at once gave doubtersful a vouch for his bilateralist zeal. His movements showed
that North &amp; South sides of the roadway were visited by him in turn in the discharge of his important duty during which he got a no of stumbles which appeared to startle him very much
<br><font color="green">{ms, 34v}</font>
<br> and, while he allowed simple &amp; unfranked correspondence to escape automatically from the mailbag issued to him, the unerring zeal with which, amid a blizzard with low visibility and on uneven ground, sorted<a target="foot" id="fez0024">&ordm;</a> &amp; secured for immediate home delivery all packages containing bullion or eatables,<a target="foot" id="fez0025">&ordm;</a> in a manner made
of Shawn the Post a man,<a target="foot" id="fez0026">&ordm;</a> seen, felt for, envied &amp; looked up to.</p>
<p> Thus was a woman&apos;s petition, maid, wife &amp; mother, brought by two sons of wild earth, since sainted scholasts, Iacopus Pennifera,<a target="foot" id="fez0027">&ordm;</a> and Johannes Epistolophorus, to their and of all the Lord, offering to him from whom all things had come to them their gift of her knowledge, thereby giving him of his own (the lion&apos;s mouth).

<p class="flush">It was this last alone that at last <a name="n01083m" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01083m">gave HCE the raspberry</a>. Groaning of spirit, he lifted his hands &amp; many who did not dare it, heard him say: <a name="n01106e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01106e">I will give &pound;10 tomorrow gladly to the 1st fellow who will put that W in the royal canal</a>.</p> </p>
