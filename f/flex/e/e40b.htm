<p class="flush">One cannot help noticing that some of the lines run from E to W, others from N to S. Such crossing is antechristian though the explanation may be geographical quite as easily as <a name="n06068e" href="../../FF/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06068e">domestic economic</a>. Then, in addition to the original sand, pounce or soft rag, it has acquired accretions of terricious matter while loitering
in the past. The teastain is a study in itself and its importance in establishing the identity of the writer complex (for if the hand was one the minds were more than so) will be appreciated by remembering that <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">after</span></span> before &amp; after the battle of the Boyne it was the custom not to sign letters always. For why sign when every word,
letter, penstroke, space, is a perfect signature in its own way. A person is known more by his personality, habits of dress, movements, response to appeals for charity rather than by his or her boots.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 40v}</font>
<br> |xWhile we may doubt as to the whole sense of the text, the meaning of any phrase in it, the meaning of every word deciphered and interpreted we <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">c</span></span> must not have any doubts as to its authorship and authoritativeness.|x*
<br><font color="green">{ms, 38v}</font>
<br> |xThough apparently &amp; to a rough mind this document is a thing once for all done &amp; there you are somewhere and finished in a certain time be it a day or a year or even supposing it should turn out to be a long stretch of <a name="n05056j" href="../../FF/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05056j">goodness only knows</a> how many days or years. But anyhow somebody wrote it, wrote it down, wrote it all
down and there it is, full stop. Ah yes but one <a name="n08f01j" href="../../FF/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08f01j">who deeply thinks</a> will always bear in his mind that this downright there you are &amp; there it is is only all in his eye. All was moving, changing: the travelling inkpot, the hare &amp; turtle pen &amp; paper, the continually more &amp; less intermisunderstanding minds of the
anticollaborators, the variously inflected, differently pronounced, otherwise spelled, changeably meaning <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">words themselves</span></span> vocable scriptsigns. We ought to be deeply thankful that we have even a piece of paper after it all &amp; cling to it as with drowning hands.|x*
<br><font color="green">{ms, 41v}</font>
<br> Who that in scrutinising marvels at the indignant whiplashloops, the bolted and blocked rounds, the touching reminiscence of an incomplete trail or dropped final, the gossipy threadreels, the whirligig glorioles which ambiembellish the majuscule
<br><font color="green">{ms, 42v}</font>
<br> of Earwicker, the pardonable confusion which <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">at times</span></span> pees are often kews. &mdash; who thus marvelling will not go on to see the vaulting ambition of those interbranching upsweeps continually controlled and led by the uniform undeviating course of a cold male fist.</p>
<p> Duff-Moeggli called this partnership the Odyssean or heterochiric complex from the wellinformed observation that in the case of the periplic poem popularly associated with that name a Punic admiralty report had been capsized &amp; <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">refloated by</span></span> reissued as dodecanesian baedeker of an
every-<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">place-</span></span>tale-a-treat-itself variety which should amply satisfy the gander as well as the goose. The identity of the persons in the complex came to light in a curious way. The original document was what is known as unbreakable script, that is to say, it had no signs of punctuation of any kind. On holding it to the light it was seen to
be pierced or punctuated (in the university sense of the word) by
<br><font color="green">{ms, 43v}</font>
<br> numerous dots and gashes <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">inflicted</span></span> made by a pronged instrument. These paper wounds, four in type, were gradually understand to mean stop, please stop, do please stop and O do please stop respectively and investigation showed that they were provoked by the fork of a professor at the breakfast table. Deeply religious by nature it was
correctly suspected that such anger could not <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">openly</span></span> have been directed against the ancestral spirit of her who openly respected by him as our boys&apos; best friend and when it was at last noticed that the fourth or heaviest gash was most frequent where the script was clear and the term terse and that these were the exact places
carefully selected for her perforations by <a name="sa0982au" href="../../FF/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0982au">Dame Partland</a> on the dunghill reluctantly the theory of the jabbering ape was abandoned and its place usurped by that odious &amp; even now insufficiently despised person, Jim the Penman.</p> </p>  </main>
