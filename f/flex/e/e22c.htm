<br> (&hellip;) Mr Earwicker. For two straws yes and less I could tell someone I know and they would make a corpse of him by private shooting with the greatest of pleasure and not leave enough of McGrath Bros for the peelers to pick up.</p>
<p> Lies. There never was any girl in my house expecting trouble off my esteemed husband, never. Those pair of whores that committed all the nuisance neither of them were virtuous pursuant to said declaration of the public doctor out of the Lock whereas I shall bring under revered notice the above Honourable Earwicker to possess second to none from a child a chest very hairy &amp; eyebrows for it
to be able to be seen which I am the privileged to behold and pursuant to same very affectionate after salesladies&apos; company. I will not have a dirty reptile the like of the McGraths to be spreading his lies all around where we live if he thinks he is the big noise here as I simply agree to all. There, you worm! I know you now. I would hate to say what I think about him. I exgust sneak McGrath
wanting to live on me and my noble husband like a dirty pair of parachutes. I wouldn&apos;t dream of a sausage belonging to him for meat for the cat and it was in all the Sunday papers about Earwicker&apos;s farfamed fatspitters
<br><font color="green">{ms, 15v}</font>
<br> that<a target="foot" id="fez0008">&ordm;</a> were eaten and appreciated by over fifteen thousands of persons in Dublin this weekend. The obnoxious liar.<a target="foot" id="fez0009">&ordm;</a> He was one time a Scotchman &amp; fired out of Cloon&apos;s where he was only a common floorwalker for giving guff.</p>
<p> Moreover I have heard it stated about the military but did space permit it is my belief I could show it was always the wish of his mind to mitigate the King&apos;s evil and I hereinafter swear by your revered majesty that it was him gave me the price of my new bulletproof dress with the angel sleeves and he said to my presences in these words: Just as there is a God of all things my mind is a
complete blank.</p>
<p> Well, revered, I tender your heartbroken thanks with regrets for lettering you and will now close hoping you are in the best. I don&apos;t care a fig for him and erronymous letter about an experience on the part of me as girl alleged unpleasant with a clerical friend. How about it? I was young &amp; easy then to feast his eyes on with my sweet auburn hair hanging to
my<a target="foot" id="fez0010">&ordm;</a> knees and I can do just as I please with it because now
<br><font color="green">{ms, 16v}</font>
<br> it&apos;s my own by married women&apos;s improperty act. Never mind poor Father Michael but chat me instead. If McGrath Bros cd handle him he would jump out of his dirty skin. When next you see M.G. ask him what about his wife, Lily Kinsella who became the wife of Mr Sneak, with the kissing solicitor at present engaging attention by private detectives being hidden under the grand piano to
find out whether nothing beyond kissing went on. Lily is a lady liliburlero bullenalaw and she had medicine brought her in a licensed victualler&apos;s bottle. Shame! Thrice shame! I only wish he would look in through his letterbox one day and he would not say that was a solicitor&apos;s business. What ho, she bumps! My, he would be surprised to see his old girl with Mr Brophy, solicitor, quite
affectionate together, kissing &amp; looking into a mirror.</p>
<p> So much for sneakery that I was treated not very grand by the thicks off Bully&apos;s acre. If any of Sully&apos;s thicks was to pull a gun on me he&apos;ll know better manners the way I&apos;ll sully him. I will herewith lodge my
<br><font color="green">{ms, 18v}</font>
<br> complaint on him to police sergeant Laracy who does be on the corner of Buttermilk lane and he will taken such steps to have his head well &amp; lawfully broken by a Norwegian who has been expelled out of christianity.</p>
<p> Dear Majesty I hope you are now well. How are you? To speak the truth I was rather put out in my health latterly about the thugs got up for McGrath by Sully. I am advised waxy is at the present in hospital with palpitations from all he drunk and it&apos;s seldom I saw him any other way. That he may never come out but he is a rattling fine bootmaker by profession. Whereas I will let all to know
that I am perfectly proud of this great civilian, A.P. Earwicker, long life to him, my once handsome husband, who is as gentle as a mushroom to be
<br><font color="green">{ms, 19v}</font>
<br> seen from my improved looks and a greatly attractable when he always sits fornenst me, poor ass, to make our polite conversations over lawful business and pleasure when he is after his 3rd mug of 4 ale &amp; shag and he never chained me to a chair or followed me about with a fork on an Easter Monday ever since this native island was born and this is why all the police &amp; everybody is all
bowing to me when I go out in all directions Earwicker is 100% human I tell Slysneakers and you Master McGrath, pale bellies our mild cure, back &amp; streaky, ninepence I can hereby show whoever likes original bag of one apiece cakes &amp; Adam Findlater&apos;s best figrolls which was given to me on occasion of our last golden wedding day by dear Mr Earwicker. Thank you, beloved, for your
beautiful parcel. Always the born gentleman can be plainly seen by all from such behaviour.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 20v}</font> </p>
<p> Well, <a name="n03130g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03130g">I like their</a> damn <a name="n03130g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03130g">cheek</a> for them to go and say around about he<a target="foot" id="fez0011">&ordm;</a> as bothered as he possible<a target="foot" id="fez0012">&ordm;</a> could. I must beg to contradict in the strongest as indeed I may say in the matter of hearing
that he is after his manner certified to be very agreeable deef. I&apos;d give him his answer if he was to dare to say my revered husband was never a true widower in the eyes of the law on consideration of his diseased inasmuch as the present Mr Earwicker Esquire has often given said deponent full particulars answering of<a target="foot" id="fez0013">&ordm;</a> the late diseased in dear delightful
firelit hours when this truly timehonoured man is a great warrant to play slapsam and population peg and Sally Shorthclothes where he can easily hold his own whilst we frankly enjoyed more than anything the secret workings of nature thank heaven for it I humbly pray and was really delighted of the nice time. Who would argue with a stinker like McGrath Bros. If I am credibly
informed<a target="foot" id="fez0014">&ordm;</a> cannonballs is the true argument with a low sneak.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 22v}</font>
<br> Ping! Ping! Hit him again. Ping! That ought to make him hop it. Ha! Ha! I must laugh. Sneaker McGrath has stuffed his last black pudding. 3pm Wednesday. Grand funeral of McGrath Brothers. Don&apos;t forget. His funeral will now shortly take place. Remains must be removed by 3 sharp. R.I.P.</p>
<p> Well, revered majesty, I take the liberty of cherishing expectation that the clouds will soon dissipate and will now conclude above epistle with best thanks for your great kindest and all the trouble to took self and dearest of husbands, Papa Earwicker, who I&apos;ll be true to you unto<a target="foot" id="fez0015">&ordm;</a> life&apos;s end as long as he has a barrel full of Bass with love to
Maj and all at home
<br><font color="green">{ms, 23v}</font>
<br> in the earnest hope you will enjoy perusal of same most completely.</p>
<p> So help me witness to this day to my hand &amp; marks from your revered majesty&apos;s most duteous I am</p>
<p class="diip">Your affectionate</p>
<p> Dame Anna Plurabelle Earwicker</p>
<p class="duup">(only lawful wife of Mr Earwicker)</p>
