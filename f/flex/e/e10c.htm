<p class="flush">Untitled as her memorial is it has gone by many names in many times: <u>Pro Honafrio</u>, The Groans of a Briton, An Apology for a Husband, Can you excuse him, The only true a/c all about Mr Earwicker &amp; the Snake by an honest Woman of the world who can only tell the naked truth
<br><font color="green">{ms, 34}</font>
<br> about a dear man and all his conspirators how they tried to fall him by putting it all around Lucalizod by a mean Sneak About E- and a dirty pair of sluts, showing to all the unmentionablenesss falsely accused about the redcoats
<br><font color="green">{ms, 33v}</font> </p>
<p> The proteiform graph itself is a polyexegetical piece of scripture. There was a time when naif alphabetters would have written it down the tracing of a pure deliquescent recidivist, possibly, ambidexterous, snubnosed, probably, and having a fairly profound rainbowl in his (or her) occiput. Closer inspection of the bordereau would however reveal a multiplicity of personalities inflicted on the
provoking document and a prevision of virtual crime or crimes unwarily be made before any suitable occasion for it or them had arisen. But under the very eyes of the inspector the traits which feature the sympathetic chiaroscuro coalesce, their contrarieties eliminated in a stable somebody, as by the providential warring of housebreaker with heartbreaker, &amp; of dramdrinker with freethinker, our
social something bowls along bumpily through generations, more generations &amp; still more generations. Who in hell wrote the durn thing anyway? Standing, seated, on horseback, against a <a name="sa0982bu" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0982bu">partywall</a>, below zero, by the use of quill or style, with perturbed or pellucid mind, accompanied or the reverse by mastication, interrupted by
visit of person to scriptor or of scriptor to place, rained upon or blown around, by a regular racer from the soil or a whittlewit laden with the loot of learning?
<br><font color="green">{ms, 29v}</font> </p>
<p class="flush">Now, patience. And remember patience is the great thing. And above all things we must neither be nor become impatient. Think of all the patience possessed by both Bruce Brothers &amp; their Scotch spider. If after years and years of research a sage solemnly tells us that the great one is 3 syllables less than his own surname, that the ear of Earwicker was the trademark of a
<a name="n05042b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05042b">broadcaster</a> and his wicker the local cant for an aeronaut patent then as to this radio-oscillating epiepistle to which we must ceaselessly return where exactly at present is the bright soandso who is able <a name="n04157m" href="../../ff/fnbs/n04all.htm#n04157m">to give us the dinkum oil</a>?</p>
<p> To conclude purely negatively from the positive absence of political hatred and its <font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font> that it cannot ever have been the pen product of a man or woman of that period &amp; those parts is as unjust as it would be to conclude from the nonpresence of inverted commas on any page that its compiler was constitutionally
incapable of misappropriating the actual words of others.</p>
<p> Has anyone, it might with profit some cloudy evening be quietly suggested, ever looked sufficiently longly upon a stamped addressed envelope. Admittedly it is but a covering; it bears an economic classification: its character is the civic clothing of whatever purepassionpallid nudity or plaguepurple nakedness it may or may not contain.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 30}</font> </p>
<p class="flush">Yet to concentrate solely on the psychological content or even the mental configuration of any document to the neglect of the facts which circumstance it is as hurtful to good sense (and let us add, the best taste) as were someone or other when perhaps presented by a friend of his to a lady of the latter&apos;s acquaintance straightaway to vision her in unapparelled naturalness
deliberately closing his eyes to the fact that she was after all wearing some definite articles of clothing, inharmonious, a captious one might, or not strictly necessary, or a little irritating but still suddenly full of local colour &amp; personal perfume, suggestive of much more, capable of being stretched if need were, their parts capable, even, of being separated for closer comparison by the
careful hand of the expert. Who in his heart doubts either that the facts of feminine clothing are there and that the feminine fiction, stranger than the facts, is there at the same time
<br><font color="green">{ms, 29}</font>
<br> and that one may be separated from the other, that both may then be contemplated simultaneously &amp; that each may be considered in turn apart from the other successively?</p>
<p> Let then the facts speak in their own favour. It was wont to be wittily wagged by the stern chuckler <a name="n05013k" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05013k">Mahappy Mahapnot</a> that Lucalizod was the only place in the world where the possible was always the improbable, and the improbable the inevitable. This implies a sequentiality of improbable possibles though possibly nobody
<br><font color="green">{ms, 28v}</font>
<br> who has read up his subject probably in Aristotle will applaud the sentiment or sentence for utterly impossible as are all these events they are probably as like those which took place as any others which never took place at all are ever likely to be.</p>
<p> About the hen, first. Midwinter was in the offing when a poorly clad shiverer, the merest bantling, observed a cold fowl behaving strangely on the fatal dump at the spot called the orangery when in the course of its deeper demolition it unexpectedly threw up certain fragments of orange peel, the remnant of an outdoor meal of some unknown sunseeker <u>illico</u> in
<br><font color="green">{ms, 26v}</font>
<br> in a mistridden past. What child but little Kevin would ever in the desponful<a target="foot" id="fez0001">&ordm;</a> atmosphere of such biting cold have found a motive for future saintity by euchring <a name="n03011c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03011c">the discovery</a> of the <a name="n03011a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03011a">Ardagh chalice</a>
<a name="n03011c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03011c">by another innocent</a> on the seasands near the scene of the massacre of most of the jacobiters. <a name="sa0271c" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0271c">The bird of promise in the case was the hen of the Dorans and what she was scratching looked uncommonly like a goodishsized sheet of letterpaper originating from Boston (Mass) of the
eleventh of the fifth to dear</a> which proceeded to mention Maggy well and everybody athome&apos;s general health well and a lovely face of some born gentleman with
<br><font color="green">{ms, 27}</font>
<br> a parcel of cookycakes for dear well and must now close a grand funeral Maggy and hopes to hear from with love <a name="sa0271c" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0271c">&amp; four crosses from loving</a> from a largelooking stain of tea. The stain, &amp; that of tea, marks it off at once as a genuine relique of old Irish poetry.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 25v}</font> </p>
<p class="flush">Any photoist worth his chemicals will tell you that if a negative melts while drying the resultant postive will be a grotesque distortion of values, tones &amp; masses. This freely is what must have happened to that missive unfilthed by the sagacity of a <a name="sa0271c" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0271c">slant eyed</a> hen. Heated residence since nobody knows when in the
orangeflavoured mound had partly dissolved the first impression and caused some features palpably nearer us to be swollen up most grossly while the farther back we seem to get the more we need the loan of a lens to see as much as the hen saw.</p>
<p> Wonderfully well this explains the double nature of this gryphonic script and while its ingredients stand out with <a name="n06125h" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06125h">stereoptican relief</a> we can tour beyond the figure of the scriptor into the <a name="n06109b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06109b">subconscious editor&apos;s</a> mind.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 35v}</font>
<br> Would we vision her with <a name="n06125h" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06125h">stereoptican relief</a> (<a name="n06109b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06109b">subconscious editor</a>)</p> </p>  </main>
