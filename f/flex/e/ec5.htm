<p> Her<a target="foot" id="fee0003">&ordm;</a> untitled memorial to the allhighest has gone by many names at disjointed times.

<p> The proteiform graph itself is a polyhedron of scripture. There was a time when naif alphabetters would have written it down the tracing of a purely deliquescent recidivist, possibly ambidexterous, snubnosed probably and presenting a strangely profound rainbowl in his (or her) occiput. Closer inspection of the <i>bordereau</i><a target="foot" id="fee0108">&ordm;</a> would reveal a multiplicity
of personalities inflicted on the document and some prevision of virtual crime or crimes might be made by anyone unwary enough before any suitable occasion for it or them had so far managed <a name="n03127a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03127a">to happen along</a>. In fact, under the close<a target="foot" id="fee0110">&ordm;</a> eyes of the inspector<a target="foot" id="fee0111">&ordm;</a> the
traits featuring the <i>chiaroscuro</i><a target="foot" id="fee0112">&ordm;</a> coalesce, their contrarieties eliminated, in one stable somebody similarly as by the providential warring of heartbreaker with housebreaker and of dramdrinker against freethinker our social something bowls along bumpily, <a name="n11019j" href="../../ff/fnbs/n11all.htm#n11019j">experiencing a jolting</a>

<p> Say, who in hell wrote the durn thing
<br><font color="green">{f39, 108}</font>
<br> anyhow?  Erect, beseated, ahorseback, against a <a name="sa0982bu" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0982bu">partywall</a>, below zero, by the use of quill or style, with turbid or pellucid mind, accompanied or the reverse by mastication, interrupted by visit of person to <a name="n03010b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03010b">scribe</a> or of

<p> Now,<a target="foot" id="fee0115">&ordm;</a> patience. And<a target="foot" id="fee0116">&ordm;</a> remember patience is the great thing. And<a target="foot" id="fee0117">&ordm;</a> above all things else we must avoid anything like being or becoming out of patience. A good plan used by worried business folk is just to think of all the sinking fund of patience possessed in their conjoint names
by both brothers Bruce <a name="n06006o" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06006o">with whom is incorporated</a> their Scotch spider. If after years upon years of delving in ditches dark one tubthumper more than others has got up for the purpose of reassuring us that our great ascendant was properly speaking three syllables less than his own surname
(<a name="n03062j" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03062j">yes, less!</a>), that<a target="foot" id="fee0120">&ordm;</a> the ear of Earwicker aforetime was the trademark of a <a name="n05042b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05042b">broadcaster</a> with wicker local cant for an ace&apos;s patent, then<a target="foot" id="fee0123">&ordm;</a> as to this radiooscillating epiepistle to which we must
ceaselessly return,<a target="foot" id="fee0124">&ordm;</a> whereabouts exactly at present is that bright <a name="n14108e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n14all.htm#n14108e">soandsuch</a> to slip <a name="n04157m" href="../../ff/fnbs/n04all.htm#n04157m">us the dinkum oil</a>?</p>
<p> Naysayers<a target="foot" id="fee0126">&ordm;</a> we know. To conclude purely negatively from the positive absence of political odia and monetary requests that its page cannot ever have been a penproduct of a man or woman of that period or those parts is only one more unlookedfor conclusion leaped at,<a target="foot" id="fee0127">&ordm;</a> being tantamount to inferring from the nonpresence of
inverted commas (sometimes called quotation marks) on any page that its author was always constitutionally incapable of misappropriating the spoken words of others.
<br><font color="green">{f39, 109}</font> </p>
<p> Has any fellow, it might with some profit some dull evening quietly be hinted &mdash;<a target="foot" id="fee0129">&ordm;</a> has any usual sort of ordinary fellow ever looked sufficiently longly at a quite everydaylooking stamped addressed envelope?<a target="foot" id="fee0135">&ordm;</a> Admittedly it is an outer husk: its face is its fortune: it exhibits only the
<a name="n03153c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03153c">civil</a> or military clothing of whatever passionpallid nudity or plaguepurple  nakedness may happen to tuck itself under its flap. Yet to concentrate solely on the literal sense or even the psychological content of any document to the sore neglect of the enveloping facts themselves circumstantiating it is just as hurtful to sound sense
(and, let it be added,<a target="foot" id="fee0137">&ordm;</a> to the truest taste) as were some fellow in the act of perhaps getting <a name="n06092e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06092e">an intro</a> from another fellow turning out to be a friend <a name="n14093c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n14all.htm#n14093c">in need</a> of his, say,<a target="foot" id="fee0138">&ordm;</a> to a lady of the
latter&apos;s acquaintance straightway<a target="foot" id="fee0139">&ordm;</a> to run off and vision her plump and plain in her natural altogether, preferring to close his eyes to the fact that she was, after all,<a target="foot" id="fee0140">&ordm;</a> wearing for the time being some definite articles of clothing, inharmonious, a captious critic might describe them as, or not strictly necessary
or a trifle irritating here and there<a target="foot" id="fee0141">&ordm;</a> but for all that<a target="foot" id="fee0142">&ordm;</a> suddenly full of local colour and personal perfume and suggestive, too,<a target="foot" id="fee0143">&ordm;</a> of so much more and capable of being stretched, filled out, if need or wish were, of having their surprisingly like coincidental parts separated for
better survey by the deft hand of an expert. Who in his heart doubts either that the facts of feminine clothing are there all the time or that the feminine fiction, stranger than the facts, is there also at the same time,<a target="foot" id="fee0146">&ordm;</a> only a little to the rere? Or that one may be separated from the other? Or that both may then be contemplated simultaneously? Or that each
may be taken up and considered in turn apart from the other?
<br><font color="green">{f39, 110}</font> </p>
<p> Here let a few facts speak in their own favour. That stern chuckler, <a name="n05013k" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05013k">Mayhappy Mayhapnot</a>, once<a target="foot" id="fee0150">&ordm;</a> said and repeated that Lucalizod was the one place in the world where the possible was the improbable and the improbable the inevitable. If the proverbial bishop of our
<a name="n05022i" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05022i">holy and undivided</a> hit his two <a name="n06123a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06123a">nails on the head</a> we are in for a sequentiality of improbable possibles though possibly nobody after having grubbed up<a target="foot" id="fee0153">&ordm;</a> his subject probably in Aristotle will go out of his way to applaud him on the back of
his remark for, utterly impossible as are all these here<a target="foot" id="fee0154">&ordm;</a> events,<a target="foot" id="fee0155">&ordm;</a> they are probably as like those which may have taken place as any others which never took place at all are ever likely to be. </p>
<p> About that original hen. Midwinter was in the onning when an iceclad shiverer, merest of bantlings,<a target="foot" id="fee0156">&ordm;</a> observed a cold fowl behaviourising strangely on that fatal midden (dump for short) afterwards changed into the orangery when in the course of deeper demolition unexpectedly it threw up a few spontaneous fragments of orangepeel, the last remains of an
outdoor meal by some unknown sunseeker <i>illico</i> way back in his mistridden past. What child but chippy little Kevin in the despondful surrounding of such sneezing cold would ever have picked up a motive for future saintity by euchring <a name="n03011c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03011c">the finding</a> of the <a name="n03011a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03011a">Ardagh chalice</a>

known as a hurry-me-off-from-Queenstown.</p>
<p> Why then how?</p>
<p> Well,<a target="foot" id="fee0175">&ordm;</a> almost any photoist worth his chemicals will tell anyone asking him at home that if a negative of a horse happens to melt enough<a target="foot" id="fee0178">&ordm;</a> during drying, well,<a target="foot" id="fee0179">&ordm;</a> what you do get is, well,<a target="foot" id="fee0180">&ordm;</a> a positively grotesque distortion of all sorts of
horse values and masses of horse. Well,<a target="foot" id="fee0181">&ordm;</a> this freely is what must have occurred to our missive unfilthed  by the sagacity of a <a name="sa0271c" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0271c">slanteyed</a> hen. Heated residence<a target="foot" id="fee0182">&ordm;</a> in the heart of the orangeflavoured mudmound had partly obliterated the negative to start with,
causing some features palpably nearer the reader to be swollen up most grossly while
<br><font color="green">{f39, 112}</font>
<br> the farther back we manage to wiggle the more we need the loan of a lens to see as much as the hen saw.</p>

What bird has done yesterday man may do next year, be it fly, be it moult, be it hatch, be it agreement in the nest. For her socioscientific sense is sound as a bell, sir:<a target="foot" id="fee0185">&ordm;</a> her volucrine automutativeness right on

Let us <a name="n14216h" href="../../ff/fnbs/n14all.htm#n14216h">auspice</a> it! Yes, before all this has time to end the golden age must return with its vengeance. Man will become dirigible, age will be rejuvenated, woman with her ridiculous white burden will
reach by one step sublime incubation, the manewanting<a target="foot" id="fee0192">&ordm;</a> human lioness with her <a name="n08065c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08065c">dishorned</a> discipular manram will lie down together publicly flank upon fleece.

<p></p>
<p> Let us now, if perfectly convenient, <a name="n07a01g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n07all.htm#n07a01g">talk straight turkey</a> as<a target="foot" id="fee0216">&ordm;</a> man to man for while the ear may sometimes be inclined to believe others the eye<a target="foot" id="fee0218">&ordm;</a> finds<a target="foot" id="fee0219">&ordm;</a> it devilish hard now and again even to believe itself. Drawing
nearer to <a name="n08035n" href="../../ff/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08035n">take our slant at</a> it (since after all it has met with misfortune while <a name="n06036i" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06036i">all underground</a>), let<a target="foot" id="fee0222">&ordm;</a> us see all there may remain to be seen. One cannot help noticing that rather more than half of the lines run
north-south<a target="foot" id="fee0224">&ordm;</a> while the others go west-east<a target="foot" id="fee0225">&ordm;</a> for, tiny tot though it looks alongside other incunabula,<a target="foot" id="fee0226">&ordm;</a> it has its cardinal points for all that. These ruled barriers along which the traced words<a target="foot" id="fee0227">&ordm;</a> run, march, halt, walk, stumble at
<a name="n08053o" href="../../ff/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08053o">doubtful points</a>, stumble up again in comparative safety seem to have been drawn first of all in a pretty checker with lampblack and blackthorn. Such crossing is antechristian,<a target="foot" id="fee0228">&ordm;</a> of course, but the use of the <a name="n08098j" href="../../ff/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08098j">homeborn</a> shillelagh as an aid
to <a name="n05118j" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05118j">calligraphy</a> shows a distinct advance from savagery to barbarism. It is seriously believed by some that the intention may have been geodetic<a target="foot" id="fee0229">&ordm;</a> or, in the view of the cannier, <a name="n06068e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06068e">domestic economical</a>. Another point.

The teatimestained terminal is a cosy
little study all to itself and its importance in establishing the identities in the writer complexus (for if the hand was one<a target="foot" id="fee0236">&ordm;</a> the minds of <a name="n08055a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08055a">active and agitated</a> were more than so) will be best appreciated by never forgetting that both before and after the battle of the Boyne it was a habit not to
sign letters
<br><font color="green">{f39, 115}</font>
<br> always. The end? <a name="n14072c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n14all.htm#n14072c">Say it with missiles</a> then and thus <a name="n14072d" href="../../ff/fnbs/n14all.htm#n14072d">arabesque</a> the page.

<p> Now while we in our wee free state may have our irremovable doubts as to the whole sense of the lot, the interpretation of any phrase in

<br> the whole, the meaning of every word of a phrase so far deciphered out of it, however unfettered our Irish daily independence,<a target="foot" id="fee0284">&ordm;</a> we must vaunt no idle dubiosity as to its genuine authorship and <a name="n03081f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03081f">holusbolus</a> authoritativeness. On the face of it and to your rough mind the affair is a thing once for
all done and there you are somewhere and finished in a certain time, be it a day or a year or even supposing<a target="foot" id="fee0285">&ordm;</a> it should eventually turn out to be a serial number of <a name="n05056j" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05056j">goodness</a> <a name="n03138a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03138a">gracious</a>

<p> Because, if it goes to that, every<a target="foot" id="fee0293">&ordm;</a> person, place and thing anyway connected with it was moving and changing every part of the time: the travelling inkhorn (possibly pot), the hare and turtle pen and paper, the continually more and less intermisunderstanding minds of the anticollaborators, the as time went on as it will variously
