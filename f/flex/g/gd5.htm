<p> Shem was a sham and a low sham and his lowness creeped out first via foodstuffs. So low was he that he preferred Gibsen&apos;s teatime salmon tinned, as inexpensive as pleasing, to the plumpest roeheavy lax or the friskiest parr or smolt troutlet that ever was gaffed between Leixlip and Island Bridge and many was the time he repeated in his botulism that no junglegrown pineapple ever smacked

<br> swamp of bogoak gravy for him! He even seceded away by himself and became a farsoonerite, saying he would far sooner muddle through the hash of lentils in Europe than meddle with Ireland&apos;s split little pea. Once when in a state of hopelessly helpless intoxication he strove to lift a citron peel to either nostril, hiccupping apparently impromptued by his glottal stop, that he could live
for ever by the smell, as the citr, as the cedron, like a cedar, of the founts, on mountains, with lemon on, of Lebanon. O, the lowness of him was beneath all up to that sunk to! No likedbylike firewater or firstserved firstshot or gutburn gin or honest liberal unionist beer either. O dear no! Instead the tragic jester sobbed himself sick of life on some sort of a wheywhinging rhubarbarous
yellagreen applejack squeezed from sour grapefruice and, to hear him twixt his sedimental cupslips when he had absorbed too many gourds of it retching off to his almost as low withswillers, who always knew notwithstanding when they had had enough and were rightly indignant at the wretch&apos;s hospitality when they
<br><font color="green">{f10, 136}</font>

Ain&apos;t that swell, hey? Talk about lowness! Any
dog&apos;s quantity of it visibly oozed out thickly from this dirty little blacking beetle, for the very first instant the Tulloch-Turnbull girl with her kodak spotted the as yet unremuneranded national apostate, who was cowardly gun and camera shy, taking what he fondly thought was a short cut to Ameriga, after having buried a friend not so long before, by the wrong goods exeunt into
Patatapapaveri&apos;s, fruiterers and musical florists, she knew he was a bad fast man by his walk on the spot.</p>
<p> Around that time one generally hoped or at any rate suspected he would early turn out badly, develop hereditary pulmonary T.B. and do for himself one good time. Nay, one pelting night blanketed folk, hearing a coarse song and splash off Eden Quay, sighed and rolled over, sure all was up, but, though he fell heavily and locally into debt, not even then could such an antinomian be true to type.

lifelong story of his entire low existence, abusing his deceased ancestors wherever the sods were and one moment blowing great blunderguns about his farfamed fine Poppamore, Mr Humhum, and another moment crowing three jeers for his rotten little ghost of a Peppybeg, Mr Himmyshimmy, giving unsolicited testimony on behalf of the absent as glib as eaveswater, to those present (who meanwhile with
increasing lack of interest in his semantics, allowed various subconscious smiles to drivel slowly across their faces), unconsciously explaining, for inkstands, with a meticulosity bordering on the insane, the various meanings of all the different foreign parts of speech he misused and cuttlefishing every lie unshrinkable about all the
