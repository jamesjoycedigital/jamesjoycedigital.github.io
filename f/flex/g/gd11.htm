<p> Shem is as short for Shemus as Jem is joky for Jacob. A few toughnecks are still getatable who pretend that aboriginally he was of respectable stemming (he was an outlex between the lines of Ragonar Blaubarb and Horrild Hairwire, and an inlaw to Capt. the Hon. and Rev. Mr Bbyrdwood de Trop Bloggg was among his most distant connections) but every honest to goodness man in the land of the space
of today knows that his back life will not stand being written about in black and white. Putting truth and untruth together a shot may be made at what this hybrid actually was like to look at.</p>
<p> Shem&apos;s bodily getup, it seems, included: an adze of a skull, an eighth of a larkseye, the whole of a nose, one numb arm up a sleeve, fortytwo hairs off his uncrown, eighteen to his mock lip, a trio of barbels from his megageg chin (sowman&apos;s son!), the wrong shoulder higher than the right, all ears, an artificial tongue with a natural curl, not a foot to stand on, a handful of thumbs,
a blind stomach, a deaf heart, a loose liver, two fifths of two buttocks, one glad stone avoirdupoider for him, a manroot of all evil, a salmonkelt&apos;s thinskin, eelsblood in his cold toes, a bladder Tristended &mdash; so much so that young Master Shemmy on his very first debouch at the very dawn of protohistory seeing himself such and such, when playing with thistlewords in their nursery
garden, Griefotrofio, at Phig Streat 111, Shuvlin, Old Hoeland (would we go back there now for sounds, pillings and

Would we for fullscore eight and a liretta? for twelve blocks one bob? for four testers one groat? not for a dinar! not for jo!), dictited to all his little brothron and sweestureens the first riddle of the universe: asking, <i>When is a man not a man?</i> telling them take their time, yungfries, and wait till the tide stops (for from the first his day
was a fortnight) and offering the prize of a bittersweet crab, a little present from the past (for their copper age was as yet unminted), to the winner. One said when the heavens are quakers, a second said when Bohemeand lips, a third said when he, no, when, hold hard a jiffy, when he is a gnawstick

<p> Sniffer of carrion, premature gravedigger, resurrecter of lazars, seeker of the nest of evil in the bosom of a good word, you, who sleep at our vigil and fast for our feast, you with your dislocated reason have cutely foretold, a jophet in your own absence, by blind poring upon your many scalds and burns and blisters, impetiginous sores and pustules, by the auspice of that raven cloud, your
shade, and by the augury of rooks in parlament, death with every disaster, the dynamitisation of colleagues, the reducing of records to ashes, the levelling of all customs by blazes, the return of a lot

<br> obtundity (O hell, here comes our funeral! O pest, I&apos;ll miss the post!) that the more carrots you chop, the more turnips you slit, the more murphies you peel, the more onions you cry over, the more bullbeef you butch, the more mutton you crackerhack, the more potherbs you pound, the fiercer the fire and the longer your spoon and the harder you gruel with more grease to your elbow the
merrier fumes your new Irish stew.</p>
<p> O, by the way, yes! Another thing recurs to me. You, let me tell you with the utmost politeness, were very ordinarily designed, your birthwrong was, to fall in with Plan, as our nationals should, as all nationists must, and do a certain office (what, I will not tell you) in a certain holy office (nor will I say where) during certain agonising office hours (a clerical party all to yourself)
from such a year to such an hour on such and such a date at so and so much a week <i>pro anno</i> (Guinness&apos;s, may I remind, were just agulp for you, failing in which you might have taken the scales off boilers like any boskop of Yorek) and do your little thruppenny bit and thus earn from the nation true thanks, right here in our place of burden, your bourne of travail and ville of tares,
where after a divine&apos;s prodigence you drew the first watergasp in your lifeterm, from the crib where you once was bit to the crypt you&apos;ll be twice as shy of, same as we, long of us, alone with the colt in the curner, where you were as popular as an armenial with the faithful, and you set fire to my tailcoat when I held the paraffin smoker under yours (I hope that chimney&apos;s clear)
but, slackly shirking both your bullet and your billet, you beat it backwards like Boulanger from Galway (but he combed the grass against his stride) to sing us a song of alibi <font color="red"><sup><small>|11</small></sup></font><font color="black">(the <a name="n54111j" href="../../FF/fnbs/n54all.htm#n54111j">cuthone</a> call over the

<br> you squandered among underlings the overload of your extravagance and made a hottentot of dulpeners crawsick with your crumbs? Am I not right? Yes? Yes? Yes? Holy wax and holifier! Don&apos;t tell me, Leon of the fold, that you are not a loanshark! Look up, old sooty, be advised by mux and take your medicine! The Good Doctor mulled it. Mix it twice before repastures and powder three times a
day. It does marvels for your gripings and it&apos;s fine for the solitary worm.</p>
<p> Let me finish! Just a little judas tonic, my ghem of all jokes, to make you go green in the gazer. Do you hear what I&apos;m seeing, hammet? And remember that golden silence gives consent, Mr Anklegazer! Cease to be civil, learn to say nay! Whisht! Come here till I tell you a wig in your ear. Iggri, I say, the booseleers! Look! Do you see your dial in the rockingglass, Herr Studiosus? Look
well! Bend down a stigmy till I! It&apos;s secret! We&apos;ll do a whisper drive, for if the barishnyas got a twitter of it they&apos;d tell the housetops and then all Cadbury would go crackers. I had it from Lamppost Shawe. And he had it from the Mullah. And Mull took it from a Bluecoat schooler. And Gay Socks jot it from Potaupheu&apos;s wife. And Rantipoll tipped the wink from old Mrs
Tinbullet. And as for her, she was confussed by pro-Brother Thacolicus. And the good brother feels he would need to defecate you. And the Flimsy Follettes are simply beside each other. And Kelly, Kenny and Keogh are up up and in arms. That a cross may crush me if I refuse to believe in it. That I may rock anchor through the ages if I hope it&apos;s not true. That the host may choke me if I
beneighbour you without my charity! In your ear. Sh! Shem, you are. Sh! You are mad!</p>
