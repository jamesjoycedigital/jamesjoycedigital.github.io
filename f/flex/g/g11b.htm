<p> Shem is as short for Shemus as Jim is joky for Jacob. A few are still found who say that originally he was of respectable connections (&mdash; was among his cousins) but every <a name="n06102l" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06102l">honest to goodness</a> man in the land knows that his back life will not stand being written about. Putting truth and lies together some shot may be made at how
this hybrid actually looked. His bodily makeup, it seems, included 1 halfopen eye, 1 arm, 42 hairs on his crown, 18 on his upper lip, 5 on his chin, all ears, no feet, 5 thumbs, 2 fifths of <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">a</span></span> 2 buttocks, a testicle &amp; a half, &mdash; so that even Shem himself, when playing with words in his garden nursery, asked his brothers &amp;
sisters the first riddle of the universe: When is a man not a man?: offering a prize of a crabapple to the winner. One said <a name="n06069f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06069f">when the heavens are rocking</a>, another said when other lips, a third said when the fair land of Poland, the next one said when those angel faces smile, still another said when the wine is in, one of the youngest
said when father papered the parlour, still one said when you are old &amp; grey &amp; full of tears, and still another when we were boys, &amp; another when you come down the vale, another <u>et enim imposuit manus episcopas fecit illum altissimo</u>
<br><font color="green">{ms, 55}</font>
<br> <u>sacerdotem</u> &amp; one when pigs begin to &mdash;. All were wrong, he said. So Shem took the cake, the <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">ca</span></span> correct solution being: when he is a sham.</p>
<p> Shem was a sham and a low sham &amp; his lowness was plain from the first in foodstuffs. So low was he that he preferred Lazenby&apos;s teatime salmon tinned, as inexpensive as pleasing, to the plumpest roeheavy lax or friskiest troutlet that ever was gaffed between Leixlip &amp; Island Bridge &amp; many was the time he said no fresh pineapple ever tasted like the chunks in Heinz&apos;s cans.
None of your inchthick blueblooded beefsteaks, juicejelly legs of molten mutton or greasily gristly frogs&apos; feet or slice upon slab of luscious goose bosom with lump after load of plumpudding stuffing in a swamp of bogbrown gravy for him. Once when in a state of helplessly hopeless intoxication he tried to lift the peel of a citron to either nostril and hiccupped, apparently impromptu, that he
could live all his days by the smell, as the citr, as the cedron, as the cedar, of the founts, on the mountains, with lemon on, of Lebanon. O, the lowness of him was beyond all that was ever sunk to. No firewater of firstshot usquebagh
<br><font color="green">{ms, 56}</font>
<br> or gutburning gin or honest ruddy beer either. No. O no. Instead he sobbed himself sick on some sort of a wheywhinging rhubarbarous yellagreen applejack squeezed out of his sour grapes and, to <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">lis</span></span> hear him in his sentimentalising cups retching off to his almost as low withswillers, who were rightly indignant at the wretch&apos;s
hospitality when they found they could not carry another drop,<a target="foot" id="fgz0001">&ordm;</a> it came straight from the noble white fat, the openwide sat, her white hide that, from the winevat of the serene exquisite archduchess fancy you&apos;re in her, you&apos;re in her, Fanny Urinia. Talk of lowness! It visibly oozed out thickly from this dirty black beetle for the very first instant
the Kenny girl with her kodak the as yet unremunerated national apostate who was cowardly gun &amp; camera <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">shu</span></span> shy taking what he thought was a short cut into Patatapapaveri&apos;s fruiterer&apos;s &amp; musical florist&apos;s, she knew he was a bad fast man by his walk on the spot.</p>
<p> About that time it was generally hoped or suspected he would develop hereditary pulmonary T.B. but of course
<br><font color="green">{ms, 57}</font>
<br> not even then was he true to type. You see he was low. All the time he kept on treasuring with condign satisfaction to himself all unkind words and if ever, during a conversazione in the nation&apos;s interest, delicate hints were put to him about it, such as: What is the meaning of that foreign word we think it is <u>canaille</u>?: or: Did you anywhere, captain, in your tales of travel
happen to meet a gentleman by the name of Low Bugger who lives on loans and is 35 years of age?: without one sign of haste like the supreme prig he was he would pull on a vacant landlubber&apos;s face &amp; then begin to tell all the persons in the conversazione the whole lifelong story of his entire low existence, explaining the various senses of all the foreign
<a name="n05075b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05075b">words he misused</a> and telling every lie imaginable about all the other people in the story except the simple word &amp; person they had cornered him about until they were completely undeceived about him.</p>
<p> It went without
<br><font color="green">{ms, 58}</font>
<br> saying that he disliked a plain <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">comm</span></span> straightforward standup or knockdown row &amp; <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">once</span></span> when he was called in to umpire an octagonal argument among the low washout always <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">agreed</span></span> rubbed shoulders with the last
speaker and agreed to every word as soon as uttered with all his heart and then at once turned his whole attention to the next octagonist who managed to catch a listener&apos;s eye, imploring him out of his piteous one blinker to overflow his tumbler for him. One holiday night as recently as 20 yrs ago he was kicked alternately through the deserted village from 82 Dublin square as far as the
lefthand corner of Europa Parade by rival teams of argumentalists who finally thought they had better be going home disgustedly one and all, reconciled to a friendship, fast &amp; furious, which only arose out of his perfect lowness. Again there was a hope that people might, after first giving him a roll in the dust, pity &amp; forgive him but he was born low and sank lower till he sank out of
sight.</p>
<p> No force could tug him out <a name="n06132l" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06132l">to play</a> flesh &amp; blood
<br><font color="green">{ms, 59}</font>
<br> children of nature&apos;s rational games like hat in the ring, Shiela Harnett &amp; her cow, here&apos;s the fat to grease the priest&apos;s boots, and it is now notoriously known how on bloody Unity Sunday when the grand germogall all star bout was gaily the rage between our fighting men extraordinary &amp; eyes of Irish blue were smiling up their sleeves the scut fled for his bare life
&amp; corked himself up tight in his inkbottle house badly the worse for drink &amp; hid under a bedtick with his face enveloped in an overcoat hemiparalysed by all the shemozzle, his face &amp; trousers changing colour every time a gat croaked. <a name="n05044e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05044e">How is that low</a>, ladies and gentlemen? Why, whole continents rang with his lowness!</p>
<p> But would anyone believe it out of a madhouse? Nero or Nabuchodonosor himself never nursed such a spoiled opinion of his marvellosity as did this mental defective who bragged on one occasion to an interlocutor in a gipsy&apos;s bar that he was aware of no other person either exactly unlike or precisely the same as what he fancied or
<br><font color="green">{ms, 60}</font>
<br> guessed he was himself. After <a name="n03160e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03160e">the thorough fright</a> he got that bloody Sunday, though every doorpost in muchtried Lucalizod was smeared with generous gore &amp; every cobbleway slippery with the blood of heroes, the low waster never had the common pluck to stir out &amp; about while everyone else of the city throng, slashers &amp;
sliced alike, waded around on their daily avocations for the only once he took a tompeep through his <a name="sa0061n" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0061n">westernmost</a> keyhole to find out whether conciliation was forging ahead or falling back &amp; why he found himself at point blank range blinking into the barrel of an irregular revolver of the true bulldog pattern handled by an unknown
quarreler who supposedly had been told off to shade Shem should the shit show his nose out awhile before he got creased.</p>
<p> What was this extremely low human type really engaged on? The answer is: a drug addict megalomane at a loose end. This explains the litany of letters, honorific, highplaced, erudite, neoclassical which he loved to place after his name. It would have diverted much if ever seen
<br><font color="green">{ms, 61}</font>
<br> the spectacle of this zany in the grime of his den making believe to read his tattered chapbook turning over 3 pages at a time for what with the murky light, the botchy print, the jigjagged page, the scum in his eye, the drink in his pottle, the rats in his garret, the hullabaloo in his ears he was hardly fit to memorise <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">t</span></span> more than
a word a minute. Was there ever heard of such lowdown blackguardism? Yet he used to boast aloud to himself how he had been put out of all the best families of the Klondykers who had settled in the capital city after its metropoliarchialisation in nine cases out of ten on account of his smell which all the cookmaids objected to as resembling sinkwater. Instead of tutoring those best families plain
wholesome handwriting (a thing he never possessed of his own) what do you think he did but study with stolen fruit how best to copy all their various styles of signature so as one day to utter a colossal forged cheque in public for his own private profit until, as just related, the Dublin United Scullerymaids&apos; &amp; Housekeeps&apos; Sorority kicked the source of annoyance
<br><font color="green">{ms, 62}</font>
<br> out of the place altogether in the heat of the moment, making some pointed remark as they did so about the way he stunk.</p>
<p> Who knows how many unsigned first copies of original masterpieces, how many pseudostylous shamiana, how few of the most venerated public impostures, how very many palimpsests slipped from that plagiarist pen?</p>
<p> But for his nose&apos;s glow as it slid so close to the parchment he would never have penned a word to paper. By that <a name="sa0051al" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0051al">rosy</a> lamp&apos;s effluvious burning he scribbled &amp; scratched nameless shamelessness about everybody ever he met, even sheltering for 5 minutes from a shower under
<a name="n03051e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03051e">the dogs&apos; umbrella</a> of a public wall, all over the margins of his foul text he used to draw endless portraits of himself as a strikingly handsome young man with love lyrics in his eyes &amp; a lovely pair of inky Italian moustaches. How unwhisperably low!</p>
<p> The house of Shem, known as the haunted inkbottle, in which he groped through life at the expense of the taxpayers, injected into day &amp; night by 40
<br><font color="green">{ms, 63}</font>
<br> quacks, <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">grown</span></span> day by day increasing in violent abuse of self &amp; others, was the worst, it is believed, in our western world for pure filth. The floor was persianly carpeted with burst letters, throwaways, cockroaches, dated eggshells, you owe mes, fluefallen smut, <a name="n05124f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05124f">fallen
lucifers</a>, vestas which had served, twisted <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">goose</span></span> quills, <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">ejaculated</span></span> seedy ejaculations, crocodiles&apos; tears, spilt ink, blasphematory spits, stale chestnuts, girls&apos; ladies&apos; maidens&apos; wives&apos; widows&apos; nuns&apos; womens&apos; abbess&apos;s virgins&apos;
wedable whores&apos; sisters&apos; aunts&apos; grandmothers&apos; mothers-in-laws&apos; fostermothers&apos; godmothers&apos; garters, <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">snotworms,</span></span> worms of snot, princess promises, lees of wine, broken wafers, unloosed shoe latchets, deoxidised carbons, crushed straight waistcoats, globules of mercury, undeleted glete, toothsome pickings,
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">dam</span></span> fireproof fireworks, ohs ouis sees gras jas neys thaws ahs yeses and yeses and yeses, tress clippings. Of course the low creature was a selfvaleter so he got up what is meant by a kitchenette &amp; fowlhouse for the sake of eggs in what was meant
<br><font color="green">{ms, 64}</font>
<br> for a closet. Naturally he never needed such an alcove for his purpose and when George D Robber, the paper king, boycotted him of stationary for any purpose he went away &amp; made it himself with his wits&apos;ends. <u>Primum flens et gemens in manum suam evacuavit</u> (sh-t<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">)</span></span> in his hand, sorry) <u>postea stercus proprium, quod
appellaviat dejectiones meas, in poculum tristitiae posuit, eodem lentiter ac melliflue minxit psalmum qui incipit: Lingua mea calamus scribae velociter scribentis: magna voce cantitans</u> (did a p-ss, says he was dejected, asks to be exonerated) <u>denique ex stercore turpi cum divi Orionis jucunditate mixto, cocto, frigorique exposito encaustum sibi fecit indelibilem</u> (made O&apos;Ryans, the
devil&apos;s own ink).</p>
<p> With this dye he wrote minutely, appropriately over every part of the only foolscap available, his own body, till <a name="n01020d" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01020d">integument</a> slowly unfolded universal history &amp; that self which he hid from the world grew darker &amp; darker in outlook. So perhaps <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">when he las</span></span> at his last
disappearance the blond cop, who thought it was ink, was out. Petty constable
<br><font color="green">{ms, 65}</font>
<br> Sigurdsen, it was, who had been detailed to save him from the effects of lynch law &amp; mob mauling that greeted him just as he was butting in with a hideful through his door, saying as usual: Where ladies have they that a dogmean herring? Search me, the other said. The peace officer was literally astounded at the capacity of his wineskin &amp; even more so when informed by that human
outcome of dirt plus drink that he was merely bringing home 2 gallons of porter to his mother. What mother? Whose porter? Why merely? But we cannot stay here the rest of the day discussing Mr Ham of Tenman&apos;s thirst.</p> </p>  </main>
