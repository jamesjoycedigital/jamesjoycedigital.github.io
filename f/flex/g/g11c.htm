<p> Shem is as short for Shemus as Jim is joky for Jacob. A few toughnecks are still found scattered who say that originally very originally he was of respectable connections (&mdash; was among his cousins) but every <a name="n06102l" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06102l">honest to goodness</a> man in the land of today knows that his back life will not stand being written about. Putting truth
and lies together some shot may be made at how this hybrid actually looked. His bodily getup, it seems, included an 1&frasl;8 of an eye, 1 arm, 42 hairs to his crown, 18 from his upper lip, 5 from his chin, the wrong shoulder higher than the right all ears, no feet, a handful of thumbs, 2 fifths of 2 buttocks, a stone &amp; a half, &mdash; so
<a name="n06028j" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06028j">much so</a> that in the very <a name="n05105d" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05105d">dawn of history</a> even Shem himself seeing himself, when playing with words in the nursery garden, asked of his brethren &amp; sisters the first riddle of the universe: When is a man not a man?: offering a prize of a crabapple to the winner. One said
<a name="n06069f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06069f">when the heavens are rocking</a>, a second said when other lips, a third said when the fair land of Poland, the next one said when those angel faces smile, still another said when the wine is in, one of the youngest said when father papered the parlour, still one said when you are old &amp; grey &amp; full of sleep, and still another when
we were boys, &amp; another when you come down the vale, another <u>et enim imposuit manus episcopas fecit illum altissimo</u>
<br><font color="green">{ms, 55}</font>
<br> <u>sacerdotem</u> &amp; one when pigs begin to fly. All were wrong, he said. So Shem took the cake himself, the correct solution being: when he is a sham.</p>
<p> Shem was a sham and a low sham &amp; his lowness came out first in foodstuffs. So low was he that he preferred Lazenby&apos;s teatime salmon tinned, as inexpensive as pleasing, to the plumpest roeheavy lax or friskiest troutlet that ever was gaffed between Leixlip &amp; Island Bridge &amp; many was the time he said no fresh pineapple ever tasted like the chunks in Heinz&apos;s cans. None of
your inchthick blueblooded beefsteaks or juicejelly legs of molten mutton or greasily gristly frogs&apos; feet or slice upon slab of luscious goose bosom with lump after load of plumpudding stuffing in a swamp of bogbrown gravy for him. He preferred the hash of lentils in Europe to Ireland&apos;s tight little pea. Once when in a state of helplessly hopeless intoxication he tried to lift the peel
of a citron to either nostril and hiccupped, apparently impromptu, that he could live all his days by the smell, as the citr, as the cedron, as the cedar, of the founts, on the mountains, with lemon on, of Lebanon. O, the lowness of him was beyond all that was ever sunk to. No firewater of firstshot usquebagh
<br><font color="green">{ms, 56}</font>
<br> or gutburning gin or honest ruddy beer either. No. O no. Instead he sobbed himself sick on some sort of a wheywhinging rhubarbarous yellagreen applejack squeezed out of his sour grapes and, to hear him in his sentimentalising cups when he had absorbed enough &amp; too much of a feast of it, retching off to his almost as low withswillers, who always knew when they had enough &amp; were rightly
indignant at the wretch&apos;s hospitality when they found they could not carry another drop,<a target="foot" id="fgz0001">&ordm;</a> it came straight from the noble white fat, the openwide sat, her white hide that, from the winevat of the serene exquisite archduchess fancy you ringing at, fanny you&apos;re in her yet, Fanny Urinia. Talk of lowness!
<a name="n03062a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03062a">Any dog&apos;s quantity</a> of It visibly oozed out thickly from this dirty black beetle for the very first instant the Kenny Turnbull girl with her kodak saw the as yet unremunerated national apostate who was cowardly gun &amp; camera shy taking what he fondly thought was a short cut after having buried a friend not long before by the
wrong goods entrance into Patatapapaveri&apos;s fruiterer&apos;s &amp; musical florists&apos;, she knew he was a bad fast man by his walk on the spot.</p>
<p> About that time it was generally hoped or suspected he would develop hereditary pulmonary T.B. and one pelting night blanketed folk hearing a coarse song and splash off Eden Quay thought all was safely over but, though he fell heavily &amp; locally into debt, of course
<br><font color="green">{ms, 57}</font>
<br> not even then could he be true to type but <a name="n05134m" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05134m">cheated even death</a>. You see he was low. All the time he kept on treasuring with condign satisfaction to himself all unkind words and if ever, during a conversazione in the nation&apos;s interest, delicate hints were thrown out to him about it, by some wellwisher in vain pleading with him
to be a man such as: What is the meaning of that foreign word if you ever came across it we think it is something like <u>canaille</u>?: or: Did you anywhere, captain, in your tales of travel happen to stumble upon a gentleman <a name="n05041f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05041f">answering to</a> the the name of Low Bugger who lives on loans and is 35 years of age?: without one sign of haste
like the supreme prig he was he would pull on a vacant landlubber&apos;s face &amp; then, lisping to kill time, begin to tell all the <a name="n03039e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03039e">intelligentsia</a> at the conversazione consciously the whole lifelong story of his entire low existence giving unsolicited testimony on behalf of others as glib as eaves&apos; water, explaining the various
senses of all the foreign <a name="n05075b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05075b">words he misused</a> and telling every lie unthinkable about all the other people in the story except the simple word &amp; person they had cornered him about until they were completely undeceived about him.</p>
<p> It went without
<br><font color="green">{ms, 58}</font>
<br> saying that he disliked <a name="n03034c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03034c">anything anyway approaching</a> a plain straightforward standup or knockdown row &amp; when he was called in to umpire an octagonal argument among <a name="n06033d" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06033d">slangwhangers</a> the accomplished washout always rubbed shoulders with the last speaker and agreed to every
word as soon as half uttered with all his heart and then at once <a name="n06062k" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06062k">focussed</a> his whole unbalanced attention on the next octagonist who managed to catch a listener&apos;s eye, asking &amp; imploring him out of his piteous one winker whether there was anything in the wide world he cd do to please him &amp; to overflow his tumbler for him yet
once more. One <a name="n06159j" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06159j">kailkannon</a> night as recently as 20 yrs ago he was therefore treated with <a name="n05140h" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05140h">what closely approached personal violence</a>, being kicked alternately through the deserted village from 82 Dublin square as far as the lefthand corner of Europa Parade by rival teams of
argumentalists who finally as they had been <a name="n05135f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05135f">detained out rather late</a> thought they had better be <a name="n06019k" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06019k">streaking for</a> home disgustedly one and all, reconciled to a friendship, fast &amp; furious, which merely arose out of his perfect lowness. Again there was a hope that people
<a name="n05150m" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05150m">treating him with comparative contempt</a> might, after first giving him a roll in the dust, pity &amp; forgive him but he was born low and sank lower till he sank out of sight.</p>
<p> <a name="n06132n" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06132n">Darkies</a> <a name="n06132f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06132f">never done tug</a> that fellow out <a name="n06132l" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06132l">to play</a> flesh &amp; blood
<br><font color="green">{ms, 59}</font>
<br> children of nature&apos;s rational games like pickanninny hat in the ring, Shiela Harnett &amp; her cow, put the wind up the other fellow, Healy Baba &amp; the 40 Thieves, here&apos;s the fat to grease the priest&apos;s boots, and it is now notoriously known how on that surprisingly bloody Unity Sunday when the grand germogall all star bout was gaily the rage between our fighting men
extraordinary &amp; eyes of Irish blue were smiling up their sleeves rank funk <a name="n04160h" href="../../ff/fnbs/n04all.htm#n04160h">getting the better of him</a>, the scut fled for his bare life, without having struck one blow, &amp; corked himself up tight in his inkbottle house badly the worse for drink where he hid under a bedtick with his face enveloped in a dead warrior&apos;s overcoat
moaning feebly that his punishment was more than a nigger man could bear, and hemiparalysed by all the shemozzle, his cheeks &amp; trousers changing colour every time a gat croaked. <a name="n05044e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05044e">How is that for low</a>, ladies and <a name="n06009p" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06009p">laymen</a>? Why, whole continents rang with his lowness!</p>
<p> But would anyone short of <a name="n06018g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06018g">a madhouse</a> believe it? Nero or Nabuchodonosor himself never nursed such a spoiled opinion of his monster marvellosity as did this mental defective who <a name="n06001b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06001b">was known to brag</a> on one occasion to an interlocutor he used to
<a name="n06115e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06115e">pal around with</a> in a gipsy&apos;s bar that he was aware of no other person either exactly unlike or precisely the same as what he fancied or
<br><font color="green">{ms, 60}</font>
<br> guessed he himself was. After <a name="n03160e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03160e">the thorough fright</a> he got that bloody Sunday, though every doorpost in muchtried Lucalizod was smeared with generous gore &amp; every cobbleway <a name="n05164g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05164g">free for all</a> slippery with the blood of heroes, the low waster never had the common
<a name="n06026e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06026e">baa lamb&apos;s</a> pluck to stir out &amp; about while everyone else of the city throng, slashers &amp; sliced alike, waded around on their bonafide avocations some others stonestepping on their usual quest after higher things, across the <a name="n06009q" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06009q">human bridge</a>, set up over the slop by
<a name="n01029g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01029g">Messrs</a> <a name="n06022k" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06022k">the charitable government</a>, for the only once he took a tompeep through a <a name="n03035d" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03035d">3draw telescope</a> through his <a name="sa0061n" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0061n">westernmost</a> keyhole with an eachway hope in
his shivering soul to find out whether conciliation was forging ahead or falling back &amp; why he found himself at point blank range blinking into the barrel of an irregular revolver of the true bulldog pattern handled by an unknown quarreler who supposedly had been told off to shade &amp; shoot shy Shem should the shit show his shiny nose out awhile
<a name="n03137d" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03137d">to look facts in the face</a> before he got hosed &amp; creased by 1 or 2 of the playboys.</p>
<p> What was this extremely low human type really engaged on? The answer is: a drug &amp; <a name="n04157d" href="../../ff/fnbs/n04all.htm#n04157d">drunkery</a> addict megalomane at a loose end. This explains the litany of letters, honorific, highplaced, erudite, neoclassical which he loved to place after his name. It would have diverted much if ever seen
<br><font color="green">{ms, 61}</font>
<br> the shuddersome spectacle of this zany in the grime of his den making believe to read his <a name="n06043f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06043f">eminently unreadable</a> chapbook turning over 3 sheets in the wind for what with the murky light, the botchy print, the tattered jacket the jigjagged page, the fumbling fingers, the itch in his palm, the tickle of his tail, the dig in his ribs,
the gush in his fundament, the scum in his eye, the drink in his pottle, the rats in his garret, the hullabaloo and the dust in his ears he was hardly fit to memorise more than a word a minute. Was there ever heard of such lowdown blackguardism? Yet the <a name="n04159g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n04all.htm#n04159g">bumpersprinkler</a> used to boast aloud to himself how he had been put out of all the
best families of the Klondykers who had settled in the capital city after its metropoliarchialisation ordered off the premises in nine cases out of ten on account of his smell which all the cookmaids objected to as resembling <a name="n06059i" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06059i">the smell that came out of the sink</a>. Instead of tutoring those best families plain wholesome handwriting (a
thing he never possessed of his own) what do you think he did but study with stolen fruit how best to copy all their various styles of signature so as one day to utter a colossal forged cheque in public for his own private profit until, as just related, the Dublin United Scullerymaids&apos; &amp; Housekeeps&apos; Sorority kicked the source of annoyance
<br><font color="green">{ms, 62}</font>
<br> out of the place altogether in the heat of the moment, making some pointed remarks as they did so about the low way he stunk.</p>
<p> <a name="n05154h" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05154h">One cannot even begin to imagine</a> how really low such a creature really was. Who knows how many unsigned first copies of original masterpieces, how many pseudostylous shamiana, how few of the most venerated public impostures, how very many palimpsests slipped from that plagiarist pen?</p>
<p> <a name="n05078i" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05078i">Be that as it may</a> But for his nose&apos;s glow as it slid so close to the parchment he would never have penned a word to paper. By that <a name="sa0051al" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0051al">rosy</a> lamp&apos;s effluvious burning he scribbled &amp; scratched nameless shamelessness about everybody ever he met, even sheltering
for 5 minutes from a spring shower under <a name="n03051e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03051e">the dogs&apos; umbrella</a> of a public wall, while all over <a name="n05104l" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05104l">&amp; up &amp; down</a> the two margins of his foul text the evilsmeller used to draw endlessly inartistic portraits of himself as a strikingly handsome young man with love lyrics in
his eyes a tiptop tenor voice, a ducal income of &pound;20,000 a year derived from landed property, Oxford manners, morals and <font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font>, a brandnew 3 guinea evening suit for a party, &amp; a lovely pair of inky Italian&apos;s moustaches. How unwhisperably low!</p>
<p> The house of Shame, infested with the raps &amp; known as the haunted inkbottle, in which he groped through life at the expense of the taxpayers, injected into day &amp; night by 40
<br><font color="green">{ms, 63}</font>
<br> quacks, day by day exceeding in violent abuse of self &amp; others, was the worst, it is <a name="n05102b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05102b">practically</a> believed, even in our playboyish western world for pure filth. The warped flooring of his lair was persianly literatured with burst love letters, citizens&apos; throwaways, telltale stories, stickyback snapshots bull cockroaches,
eggshells, you owe mes, fluefoul smut, <a name="n05124f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05124f">fallen lucifers</a>, vestas <font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font>, borrowed brogues, cutthroat ties, reversible jackets, blackeye glasses, neverworn breeches, Godforsaken scapulars, falsehair shirts, twisted quills, seedy ejaculations, crocodiles&apos; tears,

<a name="n05017a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05017a">stands a fair chance</a> of actually seeing the whirling dervish, exiled in upon his ego, noonday terrorised by an <a name="n08053c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08053c">ineluctable</a> shadow <a name="n05067f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05067f">writing the history of himself in furniture</a> Of course our low hero was &amp;
<a name="n09111d" href="../../ff/fnbs/n09all.htm#n09111d">had to be</a> a selfvaleter so he got up whatever is meant by a kitchenette &amp; fowlhouse for the sake of eggs in what was meant
<br><font color="green">{ms, 64}</font>
<br> for a closet. Naturally he never needed such an alcohove for his purpose and when George D Robber, the paper king, boycotted him of all stationary &amp; muttonsuet candles for any purpose he went away &amp; made synthetic ink &amp; unruled parchment for himself out of his wits&apos;ends. How? Let the manner &amp; the matter of it for these our sporting times be cloaked up
<a name="sa0401w" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0401w">in the language of blushfed cardinals</a> that the Anglican ordinal, not reading his own rude speech, may always behold the scarlet brand on the brown of her of Babylon yet feel not the pink one in his own damned cheek. <u>Primum ad terram viviparam et cunctipotentem nec ullo pudori nec venea natibus nudis uti nudi fuissant sese
adpropinquans flens et gemens in manum suam evacuavit</u> (sh-t in his hand, sorry) <u>postea stercus proprium, quod appellaviat dejectiones meas, in vasum olim honorabilem tristitiae posuit, eodem lente ac melliflue minxit psalmum qui incipit: Lingua mea calamus scribae velociter scribentis: magna voce cantitans</u> (did a p-ss, says he was dejected, asks to be exonerated) <u>denique ex stercore

<p> With this double dye he wrote minutely, appropriately over every part of the only foolscap available, his own body, till one <a name="n01020d" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01020d">integument</a> slowly unfolded universal history the progressive reflection from his individual person of life unlivable <a name="n05124l" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05124l">transaccidentated</a> in the slow
fire of consciousness into a <a name="n05006g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05006g">dividual</a> <a name="n05010g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05010g">chaos</a>, perilous, potent, common to all flesh, mortal only, &amp; that self which he hid from the world grew darker &amp; darker in its outlook. So perhaps at his last public disappearance the blond cop, who thought it was ink, was out.

<br> Sigurdsen, it was, who had been detailed to save him from the effects of lynch law &amp; mob mauling that greeted the <a name="n05166b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05166b">tenderfoot</a> just as he was butting in with a hideful through his door, saying as usual: Where ladies have they that a dogmean sort herring?

The peace officer was literally astounded at the capacity of his wineskin &amp; even more so when informed by that human outcome of dirt plus drink that he was merely bringing home 2 gallons of porter to his mother. What mother? Whose porter? Why merely? But enough of such black lowness too base for words! We cannot stay here
for the rest of the day discussing Mr Ham of Tenman&apos;s thirst.</p> </p>  </main>
