<p> Stand forth (for no longer will I employ the inspired form of the third person singular but address myself to you direct) stand forth, come boldly move me to laughter in your true colours<a target="foot" id="fgz0002">&ordm;</a> ere you be put back for ever till I give you your talkingto! How have you been all this while, my tooralladdy? You were bred, fed, fostered and fattened in this 2
easter island on a rollicking heaven and a roaring hell<a target="foot" id="fgz0003">&ordm;</a> and now, <a name="n08099i" href="../../ff/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08099i">forsooth</a>, you have become a doubter in all known gods, nay, condemned fool, anarch, egoarch, heresiarch, you have reared your disunited kingdom on the void of your far more than dubious soul. While yet an adolescent (what do I say?),
while still puerile you received a gift of syringe &amp; feeders<a target="foot" id="fgz0004">&ordm;</a> (you know, my friend, to your cost as I do the mechanism I now allude to) that you might repopulate the land of your birth &amp; count up your progeny by the hundred and the hundred thousand but you have thwarted the pious wish of your godmother and have added the morosity of your delectations
to Lubbock&apos;s pleasures of life and this too with cantreds of overplussing sisters congested around &amp; about you for acres
<br><font color="green">{ms, 70}</font>
<br> and roods and poles or perches mutely braying for what would not cost you the price of a pang, just a lilt, let us say, of the oldest song in the wide wide world accompanied by a plain gold band. Sniffer of carrion, you have well foretold death and disaster,<a target="foot" id="fgz0005">&ordm;</a> the dynamitisation of colleagues, the reducing of records to ashes, the levelling of all customs
by heat, the return of much gunpowdered dust unto dust but it never struck your mudhead&apos;s obtundity that the more carrots you chop, the more turnips you slit, the more spuds you peel, the more onions you weep over, the more mutton you crackerhash, the more potherbs you pound, the hotter the fire and the longer your spoon and the harder you gruel it more &amp; more the merrier smokes your new
Irish stew. You, <a name="n06031l" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06031l">let me tell you</a>, were designed to do a certain office<a target="foot" id="fgz0006">&ordm;</a> (what I will not tell you) in a certain office (nor will I tell you where) during certain office hours from such a year to such a date at so and so much a week <u>per annum</u> &amp; do
<br><font color="green">{ms, 71}</font>
<br> your little threepenny bit right here, same as we, long of us, where you set fire to my tailcoat and I&apos;ll hold the paraffin lamp under yours but, slackly shirking both your bullet &amp; your billet, you beat it to sing us a song of alibi, emigrant the wrong way sitting on your crooked sixpenny stile, you (will you just help me with the epithet?) unfrillfrocked quackfriar
(<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">yes,</span></span> thanks, I think that describes you), Europasianised Afferyank! There grew up beside you, oaf, outofwork,<a target="foot" id="fgz0007">&ordm;</a> that other, that pure one, he who was well known in heavenly circles above before he went aloft, a chum of the angels, a youth they particularly wanted as
playmate,<a target="foot" id="fgz0008">&ordm;</a> a model without a flaw whose spiritual toilettes were the talk of half the town, and him you laid low with one hand one fine May morning to find out how his innards worked. Ever hear of that monkey and the virgin heir of the Morrisons, eh, blethering ape? Malingerer, what have you done with all the babyprams of cooked vegetables, the hatfuls of
stewed fruit, the suitcases of coddled eggs<a target="foot" id="fgz0009">&ordm;</a>
<br><font color="green">{ms, 72}</font>
<br> that you cozened out of charitable kitchens by piping your eye &amp; howling heavy as how you was bad no end with the chicken&apos;s gape and <u>pas mal de si&egrave;cle</u>. Where are the little apples we lock up in the little saltbox? Where is that little alimony nestegg against our predictable rainy day? Is it not the fact (gainsay me, cakeeater!) that you squandered among underlings the
overload of extravagance &amp; made a multitude hungry with crumbs? Am I not right? Look up, old son, &amp; take your medicine! And remember golden silence means consent, Mr Anklegazer! Pariah, cannibal Cain, you who oathily forswore the womb that bore you and the paps you sometime sucked,<a target="foot" id="fgz0010">&ordm;</a> you who ever since have been one black mass of jigs &amp; jimjams,
haunted by a sense of not having been or being all that you might be or meant to have been, lo<a target="foot" id="fgz0011">&ordm;</a> you, and thank God from the innermost depths of your heart, it is to you, branded sheep, to you, pick of the wastepaper basket, ay, to you, unseen
<br><font color="green">{ms, 73}</font>
<br> blusher in an obscene coalhole that your turfbrown mummy is acoming, running with her tidings, all the news of the great big world, little oldfashioned mummy, little wonderful mummy, ducking under bridges, bellhopping the weirs, rapidshooting round the corners, by Tallaght&apos;s green hills and the pool of the phooka and a place they call it Blessington and slipping sly by Sallynoggin
babbling, bubbling, chattering to herself, giddygaddy graunyma gossipaceous Anna Livia.</p> </p>  </main>
