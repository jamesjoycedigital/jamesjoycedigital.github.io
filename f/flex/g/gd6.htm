<p> Stand forth, come boldly in your true colours (for no longer will I follow you through the inspired form of the third person singular but address myself to you direct), stand forth, jolly me, move me to laughter ere you be put back for ever till I give you your talkingto! Shem Macadamson, you know me and I know you and all your shemeries! Where have you been this hell of a time, my tooraladdy?
How have you been enjoying yourself
<br><font color="green">{f39, 188}</font>
<br> all the morning since your last wetbed confession? I thought so! Let me see. It is looking pretty black against you, Sheem avick. You were bred, fed, fostered and fattened from holy childhood up in this two-easter island on the piejaw of hilarious heaven and roaring the other place and now, forsooth, a nogger among the blankards of this dastard century, you have become of twosome twiminds
forenenst gods hidden and discovered, nay, condemned fool, anarch, egoarch, heresiarch, you have reared your disunited kingdom on the vacuum of your own most intensely doubtful soul. Do you hold yourself then for some god in the manger, Shehohem, that you will neither serve nor let serve, pray nor let pray? While yet an adolescent (what do I say?), while still puerile in your tubsuit with
buttonlegs, you got a handsome present of a selfraising syringe and twin feeders (you know, my friend, to your cost as well as I do, and don&apos;t try to hide it, the penal laws I am now poking at) and the wheeze sort of was you should (if you were as bould a stroke now as the curate that christened you, sonny

<br><font color="green">{f39, 189}</font>
<br> the wious pish of your cogodparents, soph, on countless occasions of failing and have added the morosity of your delectations &mdash; a philtred love, trysting by tantrums, small peace in ppenmark &mdash; to Lubbock&apos;s other pleasures of life, even extruding your strabismal apologia, when legibly depressed, upon defenceless paper and thereby adding to the already unhappiness of this our
popeyed world, scribblative! &mdash; all that too with cantreds of countless catchaleens, the many as many as the chosen, congested around and about you for acres and roods and poles or perches, mutely braying for what would not have cost you ten cents of collarwork or the price of one pang, just a lilt, let us sing, of the oldest song in the wide wide world (two-we! to-one!), accompanied by a
plain gold band!</p>
<p> Sniffer of carrion, premature gravedigger, resurrecter of lazars, seeker of the nest of evil in the bosom of a good word, you, who sleep at our vigil and fast for our feast, you with your dislocated reason have cutely foretold, a jophet in your own absence, by blind poring upon your many scalds and burns and blisters, impetiginous sores and pustules, by the auspice of that raven cloud, your
shade, and by the augury of rooks in parlament, death with every disaster, the dynamitisation of colleagues, the reducing of records to ashes, the levelling of all customs by blazes, the return of a lot

<p> Another thing recurs to me. You, let me tell you, were very ordinarily designed, your birthwrong was, to do a certain office (what, I will not tell you) in a certain holy office (nor will I say where) during certain agonising office hours from such a year to such an hour on such and such a date at so and so much a week <i>pro anno</i> and do your little thruppenny bit right here where you drew
the first gasp in your lifesentence, same as we, long of us, where you set fire to my tailcoat and I&apos;ll held the paraffin lamp under yours (I hope that at least is clear) but, slackly shirking both your bullet and your billet, you beat it backwards like the baker from Galway (but he combed the grass against his stride) to sing us a song of alibi, nomad, mooner by lamplight, antinos, shemming
amid everyone&apos;s repressed laughter to conceal your coprophily by mating, like a thoroughpaste prosodite, masculine monosyllables of the same numerical mus, an Irish emigrant the wrong way out, sitting on your crooked

little clay brother to let him tome to Tindertarten, pease, and bing his scooter &apos;long and &apos;tend they were all real brothers in the big justright home where Dod lives, that mothersmothered model, that goodlooker with not a flaw whose spiritual toilettes were the talk of half the town, and him you laid low with one hand one fine May morning, your bosom foe, to find out how his innards
worked! Ever hear of that monkey and the virgin heir of the Morrisons, eh, blethering ape?</p>
