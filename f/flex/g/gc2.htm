<p> Shem is as short for Shemus as Jim is joky for Jacob. A few toughnecks are still getatable who pretend that aboriginally he was of respectable connections (<font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font> was among his cousins) but every <a name="n06102l" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06102l">honest to goodness</a> man in the land of today knows that
<a name="n07001f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n07all.htm#n07001f">his back life</a> will not stand being written about in black and white. Putting truth and untruth together a shot may be made at what this hybrid actually looked like. Shem&apos;s bodily getup, it seems, included:<a target="foot" id="fgg0003">&ordm;</a> an eighth<a target="foot" id="fgg0004">&ordm;</a> of an eye, the
whole<a target="foot" id="fgg0005">&ordm;</a> of a nose, one arm, fortytwo hairs off his crown, eighteen to his mock lip, a quintet from his chin, <a name="sa0511au" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0511au">the wrong shoulder higher than the right</a>, all ears, not a foot to stand on, a handful of thumbs, two fifths of two buttocks, a stone and a half

the first riddle of the universe: <a name="n03030b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03030b"><i>When</i></a><a target="foot" id="fgg0014">&ordm;</a> <a name="n03030b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03030b"><i>is a man not a man?</i></a><a target="foot" id="fgg0015">&ordm;</a> offering a prize of a juicy crab to the winner.

<p> Shem<a target="foot" id="fgg0028">&ordm;</a> was a sham and a low sham and his lowness came out first in foodstuffs.

He even went away by himself and became a soonerite, saying he would sooner muddle with the hash of lentils in Europe than play with Ireland&apos;s split<a target="foot" id="fgg0036">&ordm;</a> little pea. Once when in a state of <a name="n05158a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05158a">hopelessly

either. O dear no!
