<p> Shem is a short for Shemus as Jim is for Jacob. Originally of respectable connections <a name="n07001f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n07all.htm#n07001f">his back life</a> simply won&apos;t stand being written about.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 50}</font> </p>
<p class="flush">Cain &mdash; Ham (Shem) &mdash; Esau &mdash; Jim the Penman</p>
<p class="flush">wellknown for violent abuse of self &amp; others</p>
<p class="flush">lives in inkbottlehouse.</p>
<p class="flush">boycotted, local publican refuse to supply books, paper, ink, foolscap, makes his own from dried dung sweetened with spittle (ink) writes universal history on his own body (parchment)</p>
<p class="flush">hospitality, all drunk &amp; rightly <a name="n01067g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01067g">indignant</a></p>
<p class="flush">1 eye halfopen, 1 arm, 42 hairs on his head, 17 on upper lip, 5 on chin,, 3 teeth, no feet, 10 thumbs, &frac12; a buttock, &frac12; &amp; &frac12; a testicle, &mdash; &mdash; <a name="n03030b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n03all.htm#n03030b">When is a man not a man?</a></p>
<p class="flush">A forger, can imitate all styles, none of his own.</p>
<p class="flush">1st copies of most original masterpieces slipped from his pen</p>
<p class="flush">Sings hymn: lingua mea calamus scribae, veliciter scribentis.</p>
<p class="flush">So low was he that he preferred Lazenby&apos;s tinned salmon to the plumpest <a name="n01069a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01069a">roeheavy lax</a> or frisky troutlet to be gaffed between Leixlip &amp; Island bridge &amp; he said no fresh pineapple ever tasted like the chunks in Heinzs cans.</p>
<p class="flush">He was able to write in the gloom of his bottle only because his <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">noseglow</span></span> nose&apos;s glow as it slid over the paper and while he scribbled &amp; scratched nameless shamelessnesses about others over &amp; over his foul text he used to draw endless portraits of himself up and down the two margins as a strikingly handsome
young man with lyrics in his eyes and a lovely pair of Italian moustaches. How <a name="n08072k" href="../../ff/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08072k">unwhisperably</a> low!
<br><font color="green">{ms, 50v}</font> </p>
<p class="flush">None of your nice bloody beefsteaks or juicy legs of melting mutton or fat belly bacon or greasy gristly pigs&apos; feet or slice upon slice of luscious goose bosom with lump upon lump of rich stuffing swamping grand brown gravy for him. Once when in a state of <a name="n05158a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n05all.htm#n05158a">helplessly hopeless</a> inebriation the peel of a citron to his
nostrils &amp; hiccupped that he could <a name="n01010b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01010b">live all his days on the smell of it</a>, as the citr, as the cedron, as the cedar on the founts on the mountains, lemon on, of Lebanon. <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">T</span></span> O, the lowness of him was beyond all that was ever
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">known</span></span> sunk to. No firewater or first shot or gutburning gin or honest red or brown beer. No. O no. But he botched up some kind of a wheywhinging <a name="n01093l" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01093l">rhubarbarous</a> <a name="sa0191b" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0191b">yallagreen</a> decoction of sour grapes according to him
<span class="strike"><span class="striketext">it</span></span> in his cups it came straight from the noble white fat, the most noble wide her white hide that, from the winevat of the archduchess, Fanny Urinia. Talk about lowness! Low wretch that he was he used to boast that he had been <a name="n08035a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08035a">put out of</a> all the best families who had settled in
the capital <a name="n08035a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08035a">city</a> generally <a name="n08035a" href="../../ff/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08035a">on account of his smell</a> which all <a name="sa0982ac" href="../../ff/fnbs/ssaall.htm#sa0982ac">cookmaids</a> objected to. In place of tutoring the outlander families plain
<br><font color="green">{ms, 51}</font>
<br> wholesome handwriting (a thing he never possessed of his own) what do you think he did but copy all their <a name="n08034b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08034b">various styles</a> of <a name="n08037i" href="../../ff/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08037i">signature</a> they had so as to utter <a name="n08065d" href="../../ff/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08065d">forged</a> cheques in public for his own profit until,
as just related, the Dublin United Scullerymaids kicked him out of the place altogether on account of his stink? It was generally hoped he wd develop <a name="n08f02g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08f02g">hereditary pulmonary T.B.</a> but of course not even there was he true to type. Low! He <a name="n08002b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08002b">treasured all unkind words</a>. If ever in the
public interest delicate hints were put to him such as: <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">Do</span></span> What is the meaning of that foreign word, we think it is <a name="n08041f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08041f"><u>canaille</u></a>?: or: do you ever in your travels happen to meet a gentleman named Bugger?: he would begin to tell the persons the whole lifelong story of his low
existence explaining the meanings of all the other foreign words he used and telling every lie imaginable about all the other people he met except the simple word and person they had asked him about until they were completely <a name="n08035f" href="../../ff/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08035f">undeceived</a>.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 52}</font> </p>
<p class="flush">Of course he disliked a good sensible row and once when he was called in as umpire in an octagonal argument among <font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font> the low <a name="n08074g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08074g">mean wretch agreed</a> always with <a name="n08048b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08048b">the last speaker</a> while he
nudged the one who was speaking to fill his glass for him. One night he was alternately kicked from 82 Dublin Square as far as the lefthand corner of Europe Parade by two groups of argumentalists who finally went home <a name="n01059e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01059e">disgustedly</a>, reconciled to a friendship, fast &amp; furious, solely on account of his lowness.
<br><font color="green">{ms, 51v}</font> </p>
<p class="flush">He never could be got to play rational national games such as <a name="n08047m" href="../../ff/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08047m">hat in the ring</a>, <a name="n01097m" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01097m">Shiela</a> &amp; the cow, <a name="n08059e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08059e">here&apos;s the fat to grease the priest&apos;s boots</a>, &amp; it is now notoriously known that

<p class="flush"><a name="n01036g" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01036g">A drug addict</a>, too, his manner was to write strings of honourable, learned, highplaced initials after his name while, if you could only have seen into his den, whenever he made believe to read one of his tattered chapbooks he did nothing but <a name="n01043e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01043e">turn over three or 4
pages at a time</a> growling because what with the bad light, the dirty print, the torn page, the scum in his eyes, the drink in his stomach, <a name="n08085d" href="../../ff/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08085d">the rats in his garret</a> and the hullabaloo in his ears <font color="green"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">blank</span></font> <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">D</span></span>

<p class="flush">Nabuchodonosor himself had not such a high &amp; mighty opinion of himself as had this <a name="n04165b" href="../../ff/fnbs/n04all.htm#n04165b">mental defective</a> who bragged in a bar that he was aware of no other person <a name="n08091h" href="../../ff/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08091h">either exactly unlike or precisely the same as what I know or imagine I am myself</a>. After bloody
Sunday, though every door in Lucalizod was smeared with generous gore and <span class="strike"><span class="striketext">the</span></span> every <a name="n08f01e" href="../../ff/fnbs/n08all.htm#n08f01e">cobbleway slippery with the blood of heroes</a>, the low waster never had the pluck to venture out while everyone else <a name="n06158l" href="../../ff/fnbs/n06all.htm#n06158l">waded abou</a>t their
usual avocations for the only once he took a peep through his keyhole <a name="n01057c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01057c">found himself looking into the barrel</a> <a name="n01057c" href="../../ff/fnbs/n01all.htm#n01057c">of an irregular revolver at point blank range</a>.
