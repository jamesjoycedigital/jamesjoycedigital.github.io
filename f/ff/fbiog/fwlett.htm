<p class="spbr"><h4>1904</h4> </p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="3Dec1904"><font color="red">3 December 1904</font> <i>Letters II</i> (to Stanislaus Joyce): Nora's father is a baker. There are seven in the family. Papa had a shop but drank all the buns and loaves like a man. The mother's family are &lsquo;toney&rsquo; and &hellip; intervened. Sequestration of Papa. Uncle Michael supports Mrs and the children, while Papa bakes and drinks in a distant part of Connacht. Uncle M is very rich. Papa is treated very contemptuously by the family. Nora says her mother would not lie with him. Nora has not lived at home but with her grandmother who has left her some money. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; She has told me something of her youth, and admits the gente art of self-satisfaction. She has had many love-affairs, one when quite young with a boy who died. She was laid up at news of his death. Her uncles are worthy men as you shall hear. When she was sixteen a curate in Galway took a liking to her: tea at the presbytery, little chats, familiarity. He was a nice young man with black curly hairs on his head. One night at tea he took her on his lap and said he liked her, she was a nice little girl. Then he put his hand up under her dress which was shortish. She however, I understand, broke away.</div></p>

<p class="spbr"><h4>1907</h4> </p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="11Feb1907"><font color="red">11 February 1907</font> <i>Letters II</i> (to Stanislaus Joyce): It is strange where you get ideas for stories. Stupid Woodman gave me <cite>The Boarding-House</cite>, Ferrero <cite>The Two Gallants</cite>. Others I though of myself or heard of. (See <a name="n03073c" href="../../ff/fnbs.n03all.htm#n03073c">N03 (VI.B.3).073(c)</a></div></p>

<p class="spbr"><h4>1909</h4> </p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="11dec1909"><font color="red">11 December 1909</font> <i>Selected Letters</i> (to Nora Joyce): The four Italians have left Finn&apos;s Hotel and live now over the show [the Volta cinema in Mary steet]. I paid about &pound;20 to your late mistress, returning good for evil. Before I left I told the waitress who I was and asked her to let me see the room you slept in. She brought me upstairs and took me to it. You can imagine my excited appearance and manner. I saw my love&apos;s room, her bed, the four little walls within which she dreamed of my eyes and voice, the little curtains she pulled aside in the morning to look out at the grey sky of Dublin, the poor modest silly things on the walls over which her glance travelled while she undressed her fair young body at night. </div></p>

<p class="spbr"><h4>1922</h4> </p>

<p class="spbr"><b> SOUTH OF FRANCE 11/12 October to *14 November 1922</b></p>

<p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="30Oct1922"><font color="red">30 October 1922</font>, <cite>Beach Letters</cite> (JJ to Sylvia Beach, dictated): I was able to correct the first half of <cite>Ulysses</cite> for the third edition and to read the first two volumes recommendes by Mr. Schiff of A la Recherche des Ombrelles Perdues par Plussiers Jeunes Filles en Pleurs du C&ocirc;t&eacute; de chez Swann et Gomorrhee et Co, par Marcelle Proyce et James Joust &hellip; Please send me any good news there is as it will remind me that I was once a writer dans le temps. </div></p>

<p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="a6Nov1922"><font color="red">6 November 1922</font>, <cite>BLHW</cite> (JJ to Harriet Weaver, dictated): Miss Beach sent me Criterion so will you please send the copy you meant for me to Mrs M??? (Group A). Mr Larbaud's article reads very well. It is a relief after recent criticisms to meet a man who knows what he wants to say, knows how to say it and says it. The touch (of) at the end of the second last paragraph is very neat. It will flatter English crtics too as coming from a Frenchman. </div></p>

<p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="8Nov1922"><font color="red">8 November 1922</font>, <cite>Letters I</cite> (JJ to Harriet Weaver, dictated): That solitary detective is an interesting figure. Is he what the English call a King Beaver, that is an Irish constabularyman with red whiskers, riding a red bicycle? </div></p>

<p class="spbr"><b>  26 Avenue Charles Floquet, Paris</b> </p>

<p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="25Nov1922"><font color="red">25 November 1922</font>, <cite>Letters III</cite> (JJ to Harriet Weaver): My eyes have not been and are not well &hellip; Everything else sent me to Nice was forwarded. Strange to say the writer whom I mentioned in my letter asking for them &mdash; Mr Marcel Proust &mdash; died this day week. His name has often been coupled with mine &hellip; I am sure you are anxious to be away in Cheshire. King Beaver will never find you there. </div></p>

<p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="8Dec1922"><font color="red">8 December 1922</font>, <cite>BLHW</cite> (JJ to Harriet Weaver): I am wondering whether your odyssey round London has been undertaken in the hope of surprising detective-sergeant King Beaver curled up asleep round a lamppost </div></p>

<p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="21Dec1922"><font color="red">21 December 1922</font>, <cite>Letters I</cite> (JJ to Mrs William Murray): Dear Aunt Josephine [&hellip;] I have been trying to collect my notes as well as my poor sight will allow and I find several names of people connected with the family who were of the older generation when I was a booy. I wonder if I sent you an exercise book with the names of those persons at the tops of the pages would you be kind enough (whenever you have a spare moment and anything occurs to your mind) to scribble down in pencil or ink anything noteworthy, details of dress, defects, hobbies, appearance, manner of death, voice, where they lived, etc just as you did for the questions I sent you about Major Powell&mdash;in my book Mayor Tweedy, Mrs Bloom's father? They all belong to a vanished world and most of them seem to have been very curious types. I am in no hurry. You could send me back the book in six months if you like but I would feel greatly obliged if you could fill in any details as you are the only one who is likely to know about them. </div></p>

<p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="30Dec1922"><font color="red">30 December 1922</font>, <cite>BLHW</cite> (JJ to Harriet Weaver): I hope you got my book. [gift copy of Edward Sullivan&apos;s edition of <cite>The Book of Kells</cite>]. You will need a large magnifying glass for it. I used to pore over the pages (when not poring over the advertisement columns of Irish newspapers of before the flood) in the days when the shaker of the earth had not yet bereft me of vision. </div></p>

<p class="spbr"><h4>1923</h4> </p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="6Feb1923"><font color="red">6 February 1923</font> <i>Letters I</i> (to Harriet Weaver): Then it had to be arranged about my being admitted to the American hospital as a bogus American (this Dr Borsch is arranging) &hellip; in a way I was glad of all these obstacles for I detest the operations. But next week they must begin &mdash; alas! I have been able to do some reading and note taking with my back to the light but of course it cannot go on like that. All I hope now is that they will be successful &hellip; I am very glad that you like the <i>Book of Kells</i>. What can I say about the <i>Odyssey</i>? I made heaps of notes about it (supposedly) which I could not fit in. I was trying lately to sort these out according to a brandnew system I have invented for the greater complication and torment of myself. But I need eyes for that. </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="a6Feb1923"><font color="red">6 February 1923</font> <i>BLHW</i> (to Harriet Weaver): I did not get the copy from Mr Rodker. When it comes I shall try to push on with the corrections. </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="16Feb1923"><font color="red">16 February 1923</font> <i>BLHW</i> (to Harriet Weaver from Lucia Joyce): the dionine treatment was begun on Thursday (15 February 1923) and continued yesterday. He is to go again today &hellip; My father was not able to continue the corrections as you wish because the copy from Mr Rodker arrived only to-day but as soon as this experiment is over he will continue them here and in the hospital. </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="26Feb1923"><font color="red">26 February 1923</font> <i>Letters III</i> (to Harriet Weaver): &hellip; my power to read or write &hellip; I had before 1/10 of normal vision in that eye. Now I have 1/7 or 1/6 but this is only good for longrange vision. </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="a26Feb1923"><font color="red">26 February 1923</font> <i>BLHW</i> (to Harriet Weaver): Dr Borsch has just tested my sight &hellip; the vision of my eye has nearly trebled since the start of the dionine treatment </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="11Mar1923"><font color="red">11 March 1923</font> <i>Letters I</i> (to Harriet Weaver): I continue the dionine treatment with Dr Borsch. I am sure you are blaming me for my cowardice and procrastination &hellip; my sight has slowly improved &hellip; Yesterday I wrote two pages &mdash; the first I have written since the final <i>Yes</i> of Ulysses.

I hope your work will allow you time to do them if you are not overfatigued (as I am) with this miserable weather. </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="a5Feb1924"><font color="red">5 February 1924</font> <i>STA</i> (to Lily Bollach): In my usual hasty fashion I left over some MS for you last night. I fear some of the pages are really dreadful but do not know what to do with them. I do hope they are not too difficult and that the so-called Latin is at least legible. I have one favour to ask. My sight is not the best and I find it hard to read type at night. The ink on the last sheets were to me rather faint. Can this be remedied in the future I mean? If not, it does not matter. I hope the MS will not give you too much trouble and that you may have time to do it when (and if) your work is lighter than it was. </div></p>

The fault is of course in my own eyesight as the other sheets are quite legible to anyone else but if I am not troubling you too much I should prefer to have the MS typed heavy like the last sheets you were kind enough to do. P.S. Will you please retype from the word &lsquo;gallons&rsquo; to avoid a break and also could you let me have two blank sheets to serve as title and end page. </div></p>

I am afraid I cannot confine this person to private circulation. It is out of my power since you yourself put him in currency. Perhaps I ought to explain that Shemus is the Irish for James, that Anna Livia (Eve) means mother of all the living, that Dublin is built on the river Anna Liffey, (a stream only 50 miles long but with great windings, shallow, and darkred brown in colour (her hair)) and that what the Norwegian constable says is: Hvorledes hav De det idag, min sort Herre? (How are you today, my black gentleman) just as in the piece I am now doing Madam Earwicker&apos;s poetical composition which begins touchingly: High Hellsker gone ladies hen smake a lily pigger is in old Danish form Jeg elske jaalades en smukke lille Pige (I love so much a pretty little girl)  </div></p>

And I was promised a proof a fortnight ago and told I could revise it twice and tomorrow will be the 1 March &hellip; P.S.

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="7Mar1924"><font color="red">7 March 1924</font> <i>Letters I</i> (to Harriet Weaver): I have finished the Anna Livia piece. Here it is. After it I have hardly energy enough to hold the pen and as result of work, worry, bad light, general circumstances and the rest. It is a chattering dialogue across the river by two washerwomen who as night falls become a tree and a stone. The river is named Anna Liffey. Some of the words at the beginning are hybrid Danish-English. Dublin is a city founded by Vikings. The Irish name is Baile &Aacute;tha-Cliat (Irish script) (Ballyclee) = Town of Ford of Hurdles. Her Pandora&apos;s box contains the ills flesh is heir to. The stream is quite brown, rich in salmon, very devious, shallow. The splitting up towards the end (seven dams) is the city abuilding. Izzy will later be Isolde (cf. Chapelizod). </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="14Mar1924"><font color="red">14 March 1924</font> LUND (to Richard Wallace): May I trouble you to return this book to Mrs Wallace and thank her.

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="a14Mar1924"><font color="red">14 March 1924</font> <i>Letters III</i> (to Ford Madox Ford): Thanks for you note and for the trouble Mrs Ford and yourself took to check my proof. However, as it seemed to me almost impossible that you could revise such a tricky proof I went to Clarke&apos;s. The foreman had gone and the clerk could not find my proof. He thought it might be on the machine. I asked him to telephone to me tomorrow morning and then drove to Quai d&apos;Anjou but, not finding you, left my name. My checking of the proof would mean a delay of about an hour and much relief to myself. I hope it is still possible. I explained in a letter to Mrs Ashworth that I could not go to the printer&apos;s on Thursday but would go on Friday. (13 and 14 March 1924) </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="15Mar1924"><font color="red">15 March 1924</font> <i>Letters III</i> (to Harriet Weaver): I hope none of the MS was lost. It is eleven pages [actually, 12]. The first words are &lsquo;O tell me&rsquo; the last &lsquo;waters of. Night!&rsquo; I shall send you two pages which have been written again to replace. But they do not change the piece. It should be read in successive runs.  </div></p>

This would make the second part of my book fairly complete with the letter. The first part is not written yet. You did not say if you liked the piece? I read it to Mr Larbaud who was  enthusiastic about it. I think I shall fall all of a heap after the Shaun piece. It has been such a struggle. </div></p>

I glanced over it. Not only has it not been read but many of the most glaring blunders are still in it. I gave the typescript to you, as you remember, under pressure and on the distinct understanding that I could write in notes to which I had not then access.

I was to have gone on with the writing a little longer but the nine months&apos; labour was quite enough for me. I found my vision, power of attention all gradually getting worse yet I knew that if the books or even the MSS were left here I would go on. So I stopped. Hence this fountain pen which I bought when I had left off writing. I am sorry I could not face the writing out of Shawn which is  a description of a postman travelling backwards in the night through the events already narrated. It is written in the form of a <i>via crucis</i> of 14 stations but in reality it is only a barrel rolling down the river Liffey. To write a book like this I should have a study of my own where I could quickly get at my books and papers. Otherwise it is impossible. </div></p>

I mentioned to you a Dublin nabob who fed his guests when Lord Mayor off golden plates, sir Benjamin Guinness of the brewery, Dublin&apos;s Noah. He restored S.Patrick&apos;s cathedral too. He had two sons, lord Ardilaun afterwards and lord Iveagh. My father unseated the former for Dublin city. No conservative was ever returned after. The elder brother had some form of leprosy (see <i>Ulysses</i>), Arthur was his name. He was morose and charitable. The younger brother Cecil &lsquo;jockeyed&rsquo; him out of his birthright in a perfectly legal way. He married another Guinness as his father did before him. I suppose you see the map as I do. I cannot find anything at present about Noah&apos;s wife (the medieval figure of the mystery plays is one of the models for Anna Livia) Elizabeth, afterwards Lady Guinness, but thinking of the subject I wondered what the Irish word for Guinness&apos;s vineyard&apos;s beverage would be. It is <i>lin dub</i> or <i>dub lin</i> &hellip; I will soon send you the rest of Shaun &mdash; if the post accepts his bulk. </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="27Jan1925"><font color="red">27 January 1925</font> <i>Selected Letters</i>(to Harriet Weaver):  I ought to tell you a few things. The Irish alpahbet (ailm, beith, coll, dair etc) is all made up of the names of trees. nath (Irish script) (orah) is H. oyin O. Bruno Nolano (of Nola) another great southern Italian was quoted in my first pamphlet <i>The Day of the Rabblement</i>. His philosophy is a kind of duallism &mdash; every power in nature must evolve an equal and opposite in order to realise itself and opposition brings reunion etc etc. Tristan on his first visit to Ireland turned his name inside out. The Norwegian-Danish language has neither masculine nor feminine: the two genders are common and neuter. The article follows the noun Mand<i>en</i>, hence Land<i>en</i>. Man siger at jeg er blevet Konservativ (they say I am still a Tory) is the first line of a poem by Ibsen. The words expressing nightmares are from Greek, German, Irish, Japanese, Italian (my niece&apos;s childish pronounciation) and Assyrian (the stargroup called the &lsquo;gruesome hound&rsquo;). I speak the latter language very fluently and have several nice volumes of it printed on jampots. Most coastal towns in Ireland (E) are Danish. The poor old fellows were often wreckers. In ancient Dublin there was a ceremony similar to that of the Doge wedding the Adriatic sea. I hope this may help you. You would probably find it out if the piece were in print. It is hard to believe in typescript. </div></p>

It was sent in, dishonoured at first but later on (2 or 3 days) paid. He is printing <font face="wake">A</font> in March and <font face="wake">C</font> in June and says he will pay something. He offers $300 for <b><font face="wake">D</font></b>abcd which took me twelve months hard labour. Hemingway saw him in New York and says he made a very bad impression on him. He admitted that the edition was not confined to 450 copies, that he had 5000 or 10,000 subscribers, that he had successfully used my name as a draw and that he did not think he needed me any more now as my book was too difficult for his public and that he did not believe in paying his contributors much though he admired my work personally &hellip; many thanks for Dowland&apos;s songs &hellip; I hope something I have written may bear comparison with <i>Come silent night</i> for instance. I used the rhythm of William Bird&apos;s <i>Woods so Wild</i> in describing Isolde in the last piece. This, completed and revised, I read a week ago to a small audience, Miss Beach. Morel, the Wallaces and Nuttings. It produced stupefaction, I think. That evening I was exhausted to the point of idiocy and since then, though I wanted to revise <b><font face="wake">D</font></b>abc for Mr Roth, could not do so. Instead I read a few books and plays, the Life of Sims Reeves, Juno and the Paycock, Figgis&apos;s book on Blake ((VI.B.13 216f, 229)) </div></p>

Tomorrow and Monday (18 and 19 April 1926) I shall do, I hope, the same for <b><font face="wake">D</font></b>b. Then <b><font face="wake">D</font></b>c will take three or four days. Then the typing of these and the &lsquo;man of four watches&rsquo; is complete. I am not sure for the moment how much I have done. I shall know when I read it. I am to read <b><font face="wake">D</font></b>ab, interval, and <b><font face="wake">D</font></b>c to a small group, this time including Antheil and a young American [Lewis] Galanti&egrave;re who is preparing a course of lectures on <i>U</i>. I think I have done a great deal. My brother says that having done the longest day in literature I am now conjuring up the darkest night.

You will notice a grotesque version of it in <b><font face="wake">D</font></b>b when I send it. &hellip;  Have you read <i>Le Culte des H&eacute;ros</i> yet? What do you think of it? Every time I read a piece I go round with the hat after begging those  present to remember it and help me by finding things for me.

On Good Friday the body of Jesus is unscrewed from the cross, placed in a sheet and carried to the sepulchre while girls dressed in white throw flowers at it and a great deal of incense is used. The Maronite ritual is used in Mount Lebanon. <font face="wake">D</font>b departs like Osiris the body of the young god being pelted and incensed. He is seen as already a Yesterday (Gestern, turning back his glance amid wails of &lsquo;Today!&rsquo; from To Morrow (to-maronite&apos;s wail etc). The apostrophe balances the hyphen Guesturn&apos;s, Tomaronites.) </p><p>This censing scene is led up by <br>licet ut lebanos (p.12) = this may be used as incense (libanos is Greek for incense) <br>The words &lsquo;at my frank incentive&rsquo;. &lsquo;Idos be&rsquo; (idos is also Greek for incense and the name of an &lsquo;artificial tongue&rsquo; &lsquo;thurily&rsquo; (for thoroughly)&mdash;t(h)us&mdash;t(h)uris is Latin for incense &lsquo;Weih?&mdash;Up the Shameeroaugh!&rsquo; Weihrauch is German for incense. Here it sounds also shamrock but means a cloudscreen or shamescreen &lsquo;licensed and censered&rsquo; p.13 etc, also &lsquo;sedro&rsquo; Syriac for [prayer]. </p><p>The choir of girls splits in two: those who pronounce Oahsis and those who pronounce Oeyesis (cf Our Father who/which art etc). The Latin is &lsquo;Quasi cedrus exaltata sum in Lebanon etc&rsquo; see A.P.T.A.A.A.Y.M. Belvedere College chapter. There are in all 29 words in the threnody 6 &times; 4 = 24 and the final 5 = 29 (Tu autem, Domine, misereree nobis!). </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="b8Aug1928"><font color="red">8 August 1928</font> <i>Selected Letters</i> (to Harriet Weaver):  This leapyear chorus is repeated lower down in imitation of the Maronite and Latin &lsquo;pax&rsquo; given by embrace of arms. The girls do nothing really but turn to one another, exclaiming one another&apos;s name joyfully (Frida! Freda! etc). These are 29 words for &ldquo;Peace&rsquo; taken from or modelled on the following tongues and variations (German, Dano-Norwegian, Proven&ccedil;al, French, Greek, French variations, Malay, Echo, Gipsy, Magyar, childrens, Armenian, Senegalese, Latin variation, Irish, Diminutive, N.

The Angels, girls, are grouped behind the Angel, Shawn, and the Devil has to come over three times and ask for a colour, if the colour he asks for has been chosen by any girl she has to run and he tries to catch her. As far as I have written he has come twice and been twice baffled. The pice [sic] is full of rythms [sic] taken from English singing games. When first baffled vindictively he thinks of publishing blackmail stuff about his father, mother etc etc etc. The second time he maunders off into sentimental poetry of what I actually wrote at the age of none: &ldquo;My cot alas that dear old shady home where oft in youthful sport I played, upon thy verdant grassy fields all day or lingered for a moment in thy bosom shade etc etc etc etc.&rdquo; [47477:15] This is interrupted by a violent pang of tooth acke after which he throws a fit. When he is baffled a second time the girl angels sing a hymn of liberation round Shawn. The page enclosed [47477:21] is still another version of a beautiful sentence from Edgar Quinet which I already refashioned in Transition part one beginning since the days of Hiber and Hairyman etc. E.Q. says that the wild flowers on the ruins of Carthage Numancia etc. have survived the political rises and downfall of Empires. In this case the wild flowers are the lilts of children. Note especially the treatment of the double rainbow in which the iritic colours are first normal and then reversed. </div></p>

The old catholics Augustiner Kirche are a good example of a Mooks gone Gripes. They separated from Rome in 71 when the infallibility of the pope was proclaimed a Dogma but they have since gone much more apart. They have abolished auricular confession they have the eucarist under two species but the faithful received the cup only at Whitsun. I see no prayers to the B V M or the saints in their prayer book and no image of her or them around the church. But most important of all they have abolished the Filioque clause in the creed concerning which there has been a schism between western and eastern christendom for over a thousand years, Rome saying the Holy Ghost proceeds from the father and the son. Greece and Russia and the East Orthodox churches that the procession is from the father alone, ex patre without Filioque. Of course the dogmas proclaimed by Rome after the split are not recognised by the east such as the Immaculate conception. See the Mooks and the Gripes that is West and east, paragraph beginning when that Mooksius and ending Phioquus. All the grotesque words in this are russian or greek for the three principal dogmas which separate Shem from Shaun.

Gregory XV in 1622 extended it to all Franciscans between Vespers and sunset on August 2nd. Innocent XI in 1678 extended it in favour of the same church to the souls in Purgatory. Finally the Indulgence of Portjuncula can be gained in all churches in which the order of Franciscans is canonically established. The question of the origin is still doubtful. Early biographers are silent about it.  <br> Fjaell means board &mdash; but in the little norwegian-english dictionary it does not give the com. or any other indication.  <br> Porkbarrel.

I have made a rather harsh review of it and hope to have it published in the next Law Quarterly or the POLITICA (the organ of the London University where the lecture was delivered). But as this will hardly carry any weight I am trying to have a question put in the H.o.C. arguing that a civil servant cannot publish his views on a question de lege ferenda. But this is much harder and the ground much less secure, than an academic review. &hellip; Please keep this information confidential as though both editors are personal friends of mine I doubt very much whether they will have the courage to publish the review. </div></p>

I gave her a receipt for it &hellip; I showed the manuscript to our Director of Production, Richard de la Mare, and he felt confident that MacLehose, who are quite at the top of their profession as printers, would be able to handle it as it is. Should there be any difficulty they have expert typists of their own to set it right. But I think the simplest thing will be to have them set up a difficult specimen page.

Also that Joyce has in mind the idea of publication this year. I wrote to Fabers more than a month ago suggesting that we discuss the manner and place in which the book should be manufactured, proposing that we produce it on this side in order to safeguard the author&apos;s copyright, and sell sheets or electrotypes to them. Thus far there has been no reply. It would be to Mr Joyce&apos;s advantage in every way if production were to take place in America, for he would thus not only protect his rights here, but he would avoid the need of examining or having examined two sets of proofs. The reading of a single set in itself is sufficiently formidable. </div></p>

The eventual alterations and additions which will be made on the revise will be final and not numerous. But if the book is actually not to appear before Autumn it seems useless to work at such top speed at the expense of his health &hellip; get into communication with the Viking Press &hellip; find out whether it would not be still possible to bring out the book late in spring and if so what earliest date should the final revise be in your possession &hellip; Mr Joyce does not intend to give the title of the book, which he has withheld for so long, until the last moment. As to the question of a photographic reproduction of his book in America, barring the question of safeguarding his copyright, he takes no interest whatsoever in it &hellip; request &hellip; the date when the proofs of the first section of Part II are likely to be back for correction in Paris.

They will go back to the London publishers within the next few days, after which the proofs in page will come and be revised quickly. Whatever additions and corrections there might be will neither be numerous nor important in size.

By half-titles I mean a blank page with the title of the following section of the book upon it  </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="a6Jan1938"><font color="red">6 January 1938</font> <i>NLFF</i> (from T.S.

There were no side notes to any of the previous sections of the book, and we had not been warned that side notes might be required in later sections. We had therefore not allowed for this possibility in arranging the format of the page.

He asked me to point out for the third time that Viscount Carlow never had anything whatever to do with the version in question which was printed in The Hague and distributed by Faber and Faber in England &hellip; Mr H considered publication in July unreasonable &hellip; Mr Joyce is perfectly well aware that 4th July is the American National holiday (five members of his family owe their Christian names to this fact, including his son) and it is precisely for this reason, among others, that he wishes his book to be published in England on that day and in the U.S.A. on the eve of that day, his father&apos;s birthday. If no intelligent effort will be made to comply with his wishes he sees no use in continuing to work night and day as he has done and plans to leave for Switzerland after his own birthday (2 February) for a holiday of several months, resuming work on his book in the autumn. </div></p>

The doctor found a retinal congestion and advised breaking off immediately all work and go and see Vogt in Z&uuml;rich &hellip; I hope I will be able to persuade him to accompany me to Lausanne from where I will put him on a train to Z&uuml;rich which is only two hours away &hellip; The state of exhaustion which has overwhelmed him is terrible &hellip; need &hellip; a couple of days complete rest. Part of it is due to the state of exasperation he was in all during last week on account both of his publishers in England and in the U.S.A. They cannot and wish not to accept the date of the 4th of July for the publication of the book. We had sent them the typescript of the greater part of Part II before the New Year and we have just got the proof galleys back. Thus it took them five weeks to do half of what they had received and what was in an absolutely clear typescript without many corrections. They have not done yet a part of some 6000 words also in absolute complete form without corrections and additions and the completion of which must have cost Mr Joyce surely more than he has received as advance payment &hellip; They also demand the communication of the title &hellip; for the approval of Messrs Boots the Chemist. Mr Joyce is decided to give them the title just before the book is sent to the binder. I sent the other day under Mr Joyce&apos;s dictation an extremely curt and frank letter to Mr Eliot. Of course Mr Eliot diplomatically retired from the scene and handed the pen to &hellip; Mr Geoffrey Faber who sent a reply couched in very Baldwinian complicatedness. Mr Joyce attaches so little importance to this letter that he has not even answered it yet but in point of fact it may involve an entire change of plans which he had communicated to me in the beginning of the year. For the moment he has spent yesterday and today in his bed where I found him this morning but his does not prejudice his state tonight as from my observations the Irish temperament has some infinite resources which escape my comprehension. I gave Mr Joyce the O&apos;Reilly clan paper which he was glad to have &hellip; object was to avoid any application to the Irish Times Office in Dublin &hellip; he is reluctant to ask Mr Curran in Dublin to do this kind of thing for him in connection with his book as he is to ask yourself &hellip; Nevertheless both your cable and Mr Curran&apos;s were on the table beside his bed together with the usual six or seven others, prominent among them being that from a friend an obscure Greek bankclerk without which the feast would not be complete. I have seen these now year after year and in view of the way in which his reputation as a great poet increases in the world it is surprising to find what a minute circle of friends surrounds him &hellip; two absentees &hellip; his daughter &hellip; his son who had to leave suddenly for America a fortnight ago accompanying his wife. Mr Joyce was also sorry as the little volume brought out by Viscount Carlow was not ready for the appointed date &hellip; The English binders. </div></p>

The only possible alteration is to suggest that the notes on the right-hand side should be set in italics instead of capitals. Will you let us know which you prefer? The point is that if we had known at the beginning that one section of the book would present these features, we could have adopted a format which would have made its lay-out easier to arrange &hellip; let me know &hellip; how much more is to come before the book will be complete? I hope you have been making further progress in Zurich. </div></p>

Transition, of course, is not yet out. I send you a copy of <i>Verve</i> [Paris I.2 March-June 1938, p.26]. There are several mistakes in my text &mdash; misprints. But I am so tired I can&apos;t correct them. It&apos;s a pity you didn&apos;t quote the sentences about Sihl amd Limmat in your article on me? They are in <i>Anna Livia Plurabelle</i> &hellip; my son intends to return now as planned on the  20 April </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="23May1938"><font color="red">23 May 1938</font> <i>NLFF</i> (from T.S. Eliot to Paul L&eacute;on): I thank you for your letter of May the 18th &hellip; the proofs which you mention in your letter have already arrived &hellip; certain points &hellip; clear up before he dares to instruct the printers to revise the galleys into page. &ldquo;It is not clear what is intended by those red pencilled lines that have been put in at various places right across the page. Is it intended that blank lines should be left at those points, or are new pages intended? And if new pages, are those divisions to have separate headings? &hellip; good plan if Mr Joyce were to mark clearly on the rest of the galleys as he sends them back to us, exactly where headings are to go in, where new pages to begin, and where half-titles if any are to be inserted, for the different parts. It is of course absolutely essential that I should know about this before the galley proofs are made into pages. Then, does Mr Joyce wish to see revised galley proofs, or can we now safely go into pages on the assumption that the corrections in the revised proofs will only be of literals and will not consist of additions and omissions of any kind? It would of course be disastrous to make heavy corrections in the page proofs of a long book such as this, as any over-running might prove to be extravagantly expensive.&rdquo; As soon as these points are cleared up the galleys can be paged rapidly and without difficulty. </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="ff24May1938"><font color="red">24 May 1938</font> <i>NLFF</i> (from Richard de la Mere to Paul L&eacute;on):  I think it would be a good plan &hellip; to let me have a typewritten copy of those parts of galleys 15 and 16 that you point out as being especially heavily corrected, and I will then send that on to the printers as a further check. </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="bff24May1938"><font color="red">24 May 1938</font> <i>NLFF</i> (from Richard de la Mere to Paul L&eacute;on): Mr Eliot&apos;s letter to you of May 23rd, which was written, I think, before your letter of May 18th arrived &hellip; two further points &hellip; The first is with regard to the musical quotation which has to go on galley 25. Then my second question is: does Mr Joyce intend to give each part of the book a separate title? I think it would be a good plan &hellip; to let me have a typewritten copy of those parts of galleys 15 and 16 that you point out as being especially heavily corrected, and I will then send that on to the printers as a further check. </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="hw24May1938"><font color="red">24 May 1938</font> <i>NLHW</i> (from Harriet Weaver to Paul L&eacute;on): Not knowing of anyone to whom I could entrust the corrections of the new fragment of <i>W.i.P.</i> in <i>Transition</i> I have been through it myself as carefully as I could, letter by letter, comparing it with the latest corrected typescript sent to me, together with the only three pages of corrected proofs sent. I have made in the two copies of <i>transition</i> sent by Mrs Jolas what corrections I found and am posting one of these to Mr Joyce today. In several cases insertions had been made in the wrong places, upsetting the sequence of the sentences. These were the worst errors I found, though there were also several &ldquo;literals&rdquo;, as the printers say. </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="bhw24May1938"><font color="red">24 May 1938</font> <i>NLHW</i> (from Harriet Weaver to Paul L&eacute;on): Please give my thanks to Mr Joyce for the further manuscript pages enclosed in your letter.

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="27May1938"><font color="red">27 May 1938</font> <i>NLFF</i> (from Richard de la Mere to Paul L&eacute;on): &hellip; your letter to [T.S.

You have now made it quite clear to me about the division of the parts into separate sections, and I must apologise for bothering you with the other two queries, as I see that they are answered by the dummy that Viscount Carlow left with us some months ago &hellip; I had already returned the galley proofs to our printers for the corrections to be made, when your letter arrived, so I have now asked them to return them to me once more, so that I can make a final check of these section divisions before the pagination is begun. </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="ff16Jun1938"><font color="red">16 June 1938</font> <i>NLFF</i> (from Richard de la Mere to Paul L&eacute;on): Our printers have written to us in some uncertainty about the corrections that have to be made in galleys 14 to 17 &hellip; They write &hellip; &ldquo;&hellip; the corrections on slips 15, 16 and 17 were so complicated that we were sent a typescript in addition to the corrected proof for final checking purposes. We have finished the correction of these slips and on checking them up with the typescript we were surprised to find that there are a considerable number of differences. We enclose herewith slips 15A, 16A and 17A. The letterpress shows the galleys with all the corrections carried out on the type. The manuscript corrections in black ink show the discrepancies between these corrected galleys and the typescript. Would you very kindly settle which of these corrections are to be carried out as it would obviously be dangerous for us to continue with the paging beyond this point if the missing sentences are to be inserted. The paragraphs are so terribly long that the amount of over-running which is caused by each addition is simply appalling.&rdquo; I am sending you the original corrected galleys, also that new typescript of them that you sent me later, and thirdly, the revised galleys showing the queries that the printers raise in consequence of inconsistencies between the two sets of corrections &hellip; consult Mr Joyce about this. </div></p>

I will ask them to return the duplicate copy that they have already, when I send them the new copy &hellip; With regard to the corrections that Mr Joyce wants to make on page 1 of the book: perhaps you would be kind enough to note this on those final revised proofs that I sent you yesterday before you return them to me for press. I very much hope that Mr Joyce won&apos;t want to make any other corrections of this nature in the final proofs &hellip; since the book is now completely made up into its final pages up to page 350 approximately. </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="caDec1938"><font color="red">ca. December 1938</font> <i>NLPL</i> (to Paul L&eacute;on): [draft of letter to be sent to Harriet Weaver] Say that the flat is given up &hellip; The book was finished in its structure on the 13th November but there are about 1000 pp of proofs to be carefully read &hellip; As regards the book itself it is now for all practical purposes finished. Thousands, hundreds of thousands of its words have passed through my typewriter and I can easily understand how any person who is concerned with the very grave social, political and economic problems of this oppressive period will be painfully affected by its colossal triviality, its colossal accumulations of words meaningless, I suppose, for the ordinary intelligent reader of today. For I cannot see anywhere the slightest attempt in it to focus or still less to solve these pressing problems.  <br> But it is impossible to deny that he has acted according to his conscience and that he has actually consumed almost all his substance, physical and spiritual, moral and material, in the writing of a work &hellip; likely to be received with derision by his illwishers and with pained displeasure by his true friends.  <br><center>Ha! Ha!</center></p>

<p class="spbr"> P.S. I have seen Mrs Joyce. She suspected, it seems, that something was wrong but I did not tell h[er] or his son the facts as they were. She told me that he was in a state of exhaustion over the closing pages of the book which he had written in a state of the greatest tension. It deals with the mixing of the fresh water of the Liffey and the salt water of the Irish Sea at the Dublin estuary!!!  <br><center>Ha! Ha! Ha!</center></p>

<p class="spbr"> During the recent crisis in this country &mdash; a crisis which I suppose you followed with the closest attention &mdash; he seemed to be much more excited by the gramophone record of a Greek song he used to sing which he had unexpectedly discovered than by the seething conflicts which were raging around him, so fascinating to students of constitutional development but so trying, as we all know, in actual fact. </div></p>>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="22Dec1938"><font color="red">22 December 1938</font> <i>NLFF</i> (from Paul L&eacute;on to Richard de la Mere): Further to my letter of today: I have now spoken with Mr Joyce regarding the title. His desire for secrecy is mainly meant for America and has a particular American Irish element in view. We have received information concerning the powerful pressure which was brought to bear &hellip; in America by these elements during &hellip; Ulysses case &hellip; this influence &hellip; was not favourable. This confirmed Mr Joyce in his original reluctance to make known the title of his new book. The title itself is a form somewhat changed of the title of a song of the comic Irishman musichall type, popular some sixty years ago. The changed form is meant to cover the Nordic Celtic sagas continually suggested in the book. It offers however a very good opportunity for advance attacks at the present time when so much hectic national spirit is abroad. It is not easy for me not knowing English equivalents to suggest a parallel in English but perhaps some song lampooning the present English Royal Family might serve the case. If you know the French music-hall song made so popular by Georgius called &ldquo;Les Noces &agrave; Rebecca&rdquo;, it might give you an idea of what, I think, he means, if you substitute for another &hellip; susceptible Jewish sentiment an equally susceptible Celtic one. </div></p>

One is quite simple &hellip; On page 614 line 21 from top after the end of the paragraph finishing with the word &ldquo;word&rdquo; please insert the following new sentence in the same paragraph: Today&apos;s truth, tomorrow&apos;s trend. But to balance this a corresponding sentence has to be introduced previously. And the best place for it is the heavily corrected page 526. As it now stands the corrections should be introduced on line 15 from foot. After the sentence &ldquo;And the maid of folley will go where glory&rdquo; and before the sentence beginning with the words &ldquo;Sure, I thought&rdquo;, a new sentence should be added as follows: Trothed today, trenned tomorrow. The indication of the line as above holds good only on the first revise because it is a heavily corrected page where new paragraphs have been introduced so that will change the disposition of the text. As it is so heavily corrected however I think that you have not given your final approval to the quire, hence I hope it can be done without too great a trouble. </div></p>

It is still possible to make the correction on page 614 before those final sheets are printed off, but the printing of page 526 had already been completed when your letter came. What is to be done? I am not giving the printers any instructions about the correction on p.614 until I hear from you again, as I gather &hellip; that the correction on that page depends upon the earlier one on p.526. The pages of the book that still remain to be printed are as follows: pp.481-512 and 577-628 &mdash; and the preliminary pages of course. So if you have any final corrections for those pages, they will still be on time &mdash; but please don&apos;t take this as an invitation! And may I please have them at once. The advance copy of the book will definitely be sent off to you today by air mail. </div></p>

The point really is this: the jacket of a book is something ephemeral that is intended partly for protecting it from dust while it is in the bookshops, but nowadays much more importantly as a piece of advertising matter &mdash; It is a poster in miniature that has to proclaim the title of the book &hellip; and the author&apos;s name as promiently as it can from the bookshop window &hellip; Mr Joyce&apos;s name should be printed really big. </div></p>

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="a16May1939"><font color="red">16 May 1939</font> <i>NLFF</i> (from Paul L&eacute;on to Richard de la Mere) the error on Page 34 line 11/12 from foot &hellip; is of course a mistake and the lines need transposing.

<p class="spbr"> <div class="nbunit" id="22Jul1939"><font color="red">22 July 1939</font> <i>NLFF</i> (from Paul L&eacute;on to Richard de la Mere): Mr Joyce has been looking at FINNEGANS WAKE several times lately and every time he finds some misprints. In view of the possible necesity of a second edition of the book I think it will be well to start making the corrections right away. May I submit to you the following suggestion. You will remember that the sewn sheets sent to Monsieur Gillet were not the very best thing possible. Could not the correction be made on them and his copy substituted by a regular presscopy &hellip; Mr Joyce would then make the necessary corrections on them and return them to you.
