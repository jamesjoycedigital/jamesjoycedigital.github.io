Crom)</blockquote> <dd class="well"> <blockquote class="sources"> No record of brutality sullies that feat of arms; but at Drogheda, one of the most picturesquely situated towns in Ireland, and made more picturesque by the high viaduct which here spans the river, there are terrible memories connected with those old defences of which one part remains perfect &mdash; St Laurence&apos;s Gate with its two-storied tower. Here it was that Cromwell perpetrated the first of those massacres which disgrace his name. Such of the captured as were not slain were sent for slaves to the West Indies where to-day in certain islands a debased Irish can be heard from negroes, and Irish names are general among the negro population. <small> Stephen Gwynn, <a name="SGWL" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#SGWL"><cite title="source">Leinster</cite></a> (1911) 59</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c12173g" href="c12all.htm#c12173g">VI.C.12:173(g)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
