They chose this ore because of its colour. As has been shown by Mr. Donald Mackenzie, they considered that the green was a life-giving colour, so that green paint worn on the cheek would protect the wearer. They thought that green was life-giving because that was the colour of the Nile flood water when it first started in July. <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> The Egyptians were presumably the inventors of ocean-going ships. These boats were built, so far as can be told, for the purpose of fetching from other countries things that the Egyptians needed in their industry, and the foundation of civilization in outlying places was primarily due to this activity. Conclusive evidence of intercourse with the outside world in pre-dynastic times is afforded by the list of materials used by the pre-dynastic Egyptians, which includes coral, copper, emery, <mark>galena (lead ore), haematite (iron ore)</mark>, lead, lapis lazuli, mica, obsidian, resin, serpentine, silver, tortoise-shell, and turquoise. Many of these substances must have come from abroad; for coral, iron, emery, lead, and silver, to mention only some of them, are not known in Egypt. The realization of this foreign intercourse of the Egyptians makes the foundation of civilization in other countries perfectly obvious. For instance, what is more natural than that the Egyptians, having discovered the use of copper for chisels, and consequently needing the metal in great quantities, should send out mining expeditions to those countries that possessed stores of it? <small> William James Perry, <a name="ORMR" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#ORMR"><cite title="source">Origin of Magic and Religion</cite></a> (1923) 34, 43</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: See also <a name="n55009n" href="n55all.htm#n55009n">N55 (VI.X.5):009(n)</a>, <a name="n56095k" href="n56all.htm#n56095k">N56 (VI.B.41):095(k)</a> and <a name="n57084f" href="n57all.htm#n57084f">N57 (VI.B.47):084(f)</a>. </mm> </dd></dl>
