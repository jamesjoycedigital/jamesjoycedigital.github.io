Among these was one of which no child could tell the name. Ilse <font color="green">[the dog]</font>, his constant companion, was also of the party, and she now pressed forward with such marked interest that her master put the question to her too. At this <mark>Ilse started rapping and spelt out the correct name</mark>&mdash;the tree was a larch. Her master was greatly surprised at this, suggested, however, that it was probably less a matter of knowledge than of thought-transference, yet Dr. Oelhausen queries whether the dog might not have heard the name mentioned on some previous outing, and her master admits that this might have been the case.&rdquo; <small> Henny Kindermann, <a name="LOLA" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#LOLA"><cite title="source">Lola or the thought and speech of animals</cite></a> (1922) 17</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
