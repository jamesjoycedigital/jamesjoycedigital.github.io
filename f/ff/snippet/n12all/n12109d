Cf.<cite>The Legend of St Ronan</cite>: The route of the Grand Trom&eacute;nie follows very old paths, along an olden route that should not be shortened by shortcuts. You should miss none of the traditional stations. These are made up of small boughs of leaves covered up with white linens sheltering statues from Locronan and neighbouring parishes. There are in all 44 such altars of repose: 12 of them are the &ldquo;major stations&rdquo;. Each station is attended by a &ldquo;fabrician&rdquo; with a bell announcing his presence afar. </mm> </dd></dl>
