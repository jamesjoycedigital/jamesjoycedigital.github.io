So we may say, Scandinavia produced Jutland, Germany, Saxony, and so on; Saxony produced Sussex, Essex, and Wessex. The Goths could be made to descend from Goth, the son of Scan; his sons would be <mark>Ostrogoth</mark> and Visigoth; the sons of Visigoth would be France, Spain, and Africa, and so forth. In this way the spread of the ruling families of Scandinavia could be set out by naming the various States founded by the wandering bands, and, what is more, the States would be identified with the ruling groups. Thus the table of Noah&apos;s sons could be exactly paralleled among European peoples. <small> William James Perry, <a name="ORMR" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#ORMR"><cite title="source">Origin of Magic and Religion</cite></a> (1923) 170</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
