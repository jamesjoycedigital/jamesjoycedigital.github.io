Near Dublin they almost touch the shore: one rocky spur comes down to <mark>Dalkey Island, which was the deep-water landing place</mark> before Kingstown harbour was built: it rises into the peaked fantastic summit of Killiney Hill. <small> Stephen Gwynn, <a name="SGWL" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#SGWL"><cite title="source">Leinster</cite></a> (1911) 6-7</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
