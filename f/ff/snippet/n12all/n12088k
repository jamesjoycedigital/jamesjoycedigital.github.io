As unremember&apos;d it may have been," I continued, after a pause, &ldquo;by the only living &mdash; and like to live &mdash; Poet I had known, when, so many years after, he found himself beside that &lsquo;bonnie Doon&rsquo; and &mdash; whether it were from recollection of poor Burns, or of &lsquo;the days that are no more&rsquo; which haunt us all, I know not &mdash; I think he did not know &mdash; but, he somehow &lsquo;broke&rsquo; as he told me, &lsquo;broke into a passion of tears&rsquo;. &mdash; Of tears, which during a pretty long and intimate intercourse, I had never seen glisten in his eye but once, when reading Virgil, &lsquo;dear old Virgil&rsquo; as he call&apos;d him &mdash; together: and then of the burning of Troy in the Second Eneid whether moved by the catastrophe&apos;s self, or the majesty of the Verse it is told in &mdash; or, as before, scarce knowing why. For, as King Arthur shall bear witness, <mark>no young Edwin he</mark>, though, as a great Poet, comprehending all the softer stops of human Emotion in that Register where the Intellectual, no less than what is call&apos;d the Poetical, faculty predominated. <small> Edward FitzGerald, <a name="EFMI" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#EFMI"><cite title="source">Miscellanies</cite></a> (1900) 135</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
