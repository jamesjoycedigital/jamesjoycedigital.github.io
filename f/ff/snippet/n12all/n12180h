To reach it gives one some idea of the island economy, far half a dozen high-piled walls of loose stone have to be crossed or knocked down. <mark>There are no gates in these fields; to let in a cow you &ldquo;knock&rdquo; the wall and then pile it again.</mark> But you will not easily knock the walls of Dun Eochaill. The outer ring is only some eight foot high and six wide, but the inner circle rises sixteen foot, and may be twelve in thickness. <small> Stephen Gwynn, <a name="SGWC" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#SGWC"><cite title="source">Connaught</cite></a> (1911) 41-2</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
