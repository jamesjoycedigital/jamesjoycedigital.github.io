The Great Rabbit looked down on earth from the sky, and saw how ignorant men were. So he instructed the Otter in the mysteries, and gave him the sacred rattle, drum and tobacco. He made a lodge and taught the otter all the secrets, and with a bag containing cowrie shells &ldquo;shot&rdquo; him, so that he might have immortality, and be able to convey the secrets of his kinsmen.<font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> The novice is instructed by the priest prior to his initiation into the first of the four grades of the society. He has to take a <mark>sweat-bath</mark><font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> When he goes into the lodge for the ceremony, the Supreme Being is supposed to be there. The candidate has to stand up, and is approached by a priest with a bag of mink skin containing shells, pigments, effigies, amulets, and so forth. <mark>The priest &ldquo;shoots&rdquo; him with the bag</mark>, and he has to fall down apparently lifeless.<font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> The decision to join the society is the result of an experience which each boy has at some time or other. He goes out into the wilds, <mark>fasts, and after a time has a vision. If this be of a bear, he kills a bear</mark> and wears one of its claws for an amulet, believing that the bear will always protect him, an idea that evidently lay at the back of the custom of wearing bear&apos;s claws in the Upper Pal?olithic Age. <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> In the third degree use is made of ginseng, &ldquo;<mark>man root</mark>,&rdquo; which is supposed to be of &ldquo;divine&rdquo; origin. <small> William James Perry, <a name="ORMR" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#ORMR"><cite title="source">Origin of Magic and Religion</cite></a> (1923) 151-3</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
