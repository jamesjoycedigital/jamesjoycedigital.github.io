This lady &mdash; M&aacute;ire Dubh &mdash; was a fruitful mother of children &mdash; she bore twenty-two of them and brought twelve to full age; but she was also notable as a poetess in the Irish tongue, Her second son, Maurice, inherited Darrynane, and was known all over the country as <mark>Hunting Cap O&apos;Connell</mark>, for a tax was put on beaver hats, and from that day he wore nothing but the velvet cap in which he was used to hunt hare and fox on the mountains of Iveragh. Daniel O&apos;Connell, his nephew, was a great votary of that sport, and I have talked, with a man who had hunted in his company. <small> Stephen Gwynn, <a name="SGWM" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#SGWM"><cite title="source">Munster</cite></a> (1911) 154-5</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
