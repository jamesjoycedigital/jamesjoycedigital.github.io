The charioteer, Odran, having heard of the plot, resolved to save the life of his master by the sacrifice of his own.</mark> The faithful servant feigning great fatigue, requested our Saint to allow him take some rest in the easy part of the chariot. The permission was no sooner asked than granted, and Odran entered the carriage, and St. Patrick took the reins. The Pagan chieftain was true to his word, and a well-directed thrust of a lance through the heart won the crown of martyrdom for the charioteer, and the life of the Apostle of Erin was saved. <small> Very Rev.
