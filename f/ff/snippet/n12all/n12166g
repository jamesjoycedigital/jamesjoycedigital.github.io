We shall see presently that though he visited southern Ireland, his work there was relatively slight. The evidence suggests that while the whole island formed a single ecclesiastical province, in which Patrick occupied the position of &ldquo;metropolitan,&rdquo; there was actually, though not officially, a province within a province. There can be little question that the (contemporary) expression <i>in provincia nostra</i> in <i>Ann. Ult.</i>, <year>A.D.</year> 443, means &ldquo;in Ireland,&rdquo; conceived as a single ecclesiastical province, like the province of a metropolitan. <small> J.B.
