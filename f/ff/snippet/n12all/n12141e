It is curious to see how that the manner of contact between the people of the archaic civilization and the native tribes has apparently determined the lines upon which native thought should develop. For example, the gold-miners of the past in British New Guinea have left behind them many objects of stone, which are regarded by the native tribes as potent in magic. &hellip; The natives of British New Guinea also use, for their magical practice, stone of the kinds of rock of which the people of the archaic civilization made their implements, of mica-schist, sand-stone, volcanic rock, diabase, diorite, granite, quartz, hornblende, ophicalcite, obsidian and so forth. This is another instance of the transference of supposed power from one object to another that resembles it. <small> William James Perry, <a name="ORMR" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#ORMR"><cite title="source">Origin of Magic and Religion</cite></a> (1923) 164-5</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
