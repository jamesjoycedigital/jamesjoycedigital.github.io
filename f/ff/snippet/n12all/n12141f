When a man finds a stone that he thinks is full of mana, he tries to find out by means of dreams if it be the abode of a spirit. If it is, then he uses it to get rain, good crops, and so on. <small> William James Perry, <a name="ORMR" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#ORMR"><cite title="source">Origin of Magic and Religion</cite></a> (1923) 168</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
