This is a common phenomenon. The claim to a former system of mother-right has been made in the case of practically every country of Europe. <small> William James Perry, <a name="ORMR" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#ORMR"><cite title="source">Origin of Magic and Religion</cite></a> (1923) 172-173</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
