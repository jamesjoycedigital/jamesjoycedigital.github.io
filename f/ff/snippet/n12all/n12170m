Such a scene as Mr. Williams has drawn somewhere in the Queen&apos;s County is intensely typical of this midland country. Even where the furze blossom makes a flicker of gay colour, the whole effect is dismal, and its loneliness is constantly accentuated by what he has suggested, the flight of wild marsh-haunting birds: the trees are apt to be stunted and weather-twisted by winds off the <mark>stormy Slieve Bloom</mark>, whose veiled purple shapes are shown against the western sky in his picture. <small> Stephen Gwynn, <a name="SGWL" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#SGWL"><cite title="source">Leinster</cite></a> (1911) 12</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
