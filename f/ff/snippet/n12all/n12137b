On the other hand, the many variations recorded as noted when examining bodies of &lsquo;Europeans,&rsquo; while correlated, it is true, with &lsquo;variations&rsquo; known to occur normally in this or other race of man or ape, are never correlated with the individual type of the person dissected. <small> F.G.
