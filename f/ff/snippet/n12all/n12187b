St. Augustine&apos;s rigid view was dominant until the beginning of mediaeval scholasticism. Then the general principle expressed in the formula <i>Deus non alligatur sacramentis suis</i> <font color="green">[God is not bound by His sacraments]</font> begins to find new favour, and the greatest names in scholastic theology &mdash; Albertus Magnus, St. Thomas and St. Bona venture &mdash; speculate as to the possibility of <i>sanctificatio in utero</i> <font color="green">[sanctification in the womb]</font> as a means of salvation for those infants at least who die in the womb. <small> G.
