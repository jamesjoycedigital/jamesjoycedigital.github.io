On the margin of this well there grew a hazel-tree, bearing nuts of bright crimson, which would endow with all knowledge those who might eat of them &hellip; At length, a goddess, Sinan, a daughter of Lir, yielding to the promptings of curiosity, drew nigh, intending to pluck and eat the fruit, but the fountain rose against her, pouring forth an angry flood, which swept her down to the sea. Ever after, the waters of western Erin flowed in the channel thus formed, and the river received the name of the too curious goddess, Sinan, since varied into Shannon. Spenser writes the name, Shenane: &mdash; &ldquo;The stately Shenane spreading like a sea.&rdquo; <small> Standish O'Grady, <a name="OGSE" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#OGSE"><cite title="source">Selected Essays and Passages</cite></a> (1918) 64</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
