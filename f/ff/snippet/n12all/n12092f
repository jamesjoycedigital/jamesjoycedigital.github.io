And <mark>the girdle with which the apostles had girt the body was thrown down to him</mark>; he took it and went to the valley of Josaphat. When he had greeted the apostles, Peter said: &lsquo;Thou wast always unbelieving, and so the Lord hath not suffered thee to be at his mother&apos;s burial.&rsquo; He smote his breast and said: &lsquo;I know it and I ask pardon of you all,&rsquo; and they all prayed for him. Then he said: &lsquo;Where have ye laid her body?&rsquo; and they pointed to the sepulchre. But he said: &lsquo;The holy body is not there.&rsquo; Peter said: &lsquo;Formerly you would not believe in the resurrection of the Lord before you touched him: how should you believe us?&rsquo; Thomas went on saying: &lsquo;It is not here.&rsquo; Then in anger they went and took away the stone, and the body was not there; and they knew not what to say, being vanquished by Thomas&rsquo; words.(1) <br>(1) The episode of Thomas and the girdle is peculiar to this writing. The girdle is the great relic of <mark>Prato</mark>; and the prominence given to this incident is another indication that we have here a mediaeval Italian composition, not earlier, I imagine, than the thirteenth century. <small> Montague Rhodes James, <a name="APNT" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#APNT"><cite title="source">The Apocryphal New Testament</cite></a> (1924) 217-18</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
