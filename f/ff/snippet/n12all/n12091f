Unto him therefore he committed the charge of the holy Mary, saying to him: Behold thy mother; and to her: Behold thy son. From that hour the holy mother of God continued in the especial care of John so long as she endured the sojourn of this life. And when the apostles had taken the world by their lots for preaching, she abode in the house of his parents beside the Mount of Olivet. <small> Montague Rhodes James, <a name="APNT" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#APNT"><cite title="source">The Apocryphal New Testament</cite></a> (1924) 205</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
