They were all taken on a cloud to the west. The Lord spoke to the angels of the pit, and the earth sprang upwards and they saw the pit.(1) The lost saw Michael and begged for respite. Mary and the apostles fell down and interceded for them. Michael spoke to them, telling them that at all the twelve hours of the day and of the night the angels intercede for creation. The angel of the waters intercedes for the waters. Here the fragment ends. <br>(1) I have pointed out, and the Rev. St. J. Seymour has elaborated the thesis, that this visit of the apostles to Hell was known in <i>Ireland</i> at an early date, and that the Irish form must be derived somehow from this Syriac text. <small> Montague Rhodes James, <a name="APNT" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#APNT"><cite title="source">The Apocryphal New Testament</cite></a> (1924) 225</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
