Following the system introduced by KING, and followed by DEIMEL in his edition of a composite text as known to him in 1912, I have composed a table of the tablets, and one for the sources of the text. <small> Stephen Langdon, <a name="TEOC" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#TEOC"><cite title="source">The Epic of Creation</cite></a> (1923) 60</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: The <i>Enuma Elish</i> Mesopotamian myth of creation was reconstructed, in its most ancient Sumerian version, from seven clay tablets written in cuneiform in the twelfth century BC and found in the middle of the nineteenth century in the ruins of the palace of Ashurbanipal in Nineveh. The tablets are damaged and their reading is sometime hypothetical. Discoveries of later Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian versions helped to fill some of the lacunae. </mm> </dd></dl>
