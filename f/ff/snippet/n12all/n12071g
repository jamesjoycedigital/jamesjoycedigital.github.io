Dr. Henry, Bishop of Down and Connor. This reliquary of massive silver, representing the hand of the Saint raised in benediction, and containing his hand and arm, was made, and the sacred relics deposited therein, by the command of Cardinal Vivian in the twelfth century, when the bodies of SS. Patrick, Brigid and Columba were translated. <small> William Canon Fleming, <a name="WFSP" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#WFSP"><cite title="source">The Life of St Patrick: Apostle of Ireland</cite></a> (1905) 170-1</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c12064g" href="c12all.htm#c12064g">VI.C.12:064(g)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
