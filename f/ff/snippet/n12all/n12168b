To the Editor. &ldquo;Irish Independent&rdquo;. &hellip; Then I was ordered to get in across a ditch of briars, which I did, followed by the three men; they pushed me into a drain of water, one man gripped me by the throat to choke me, and I fell back into the briars. I got up and was struck several times by two of the men. I was again put on my knees, told to say my prayers, that I had only 60 secs. to live, I asked for a priest, but no. <br>One man then shouted to the other to go for Willie, meaning Mr. Sheehan. This man placed his revolver against my jaw and fired, the blaze and sparks singeing my face, then he lay down on the ditch in front of me covering me with his revolver all the time and cursing at me to tell the names of the men I got to burn the hay. Suddenly he gave three snores like as if he had fallen asleep. I suppose to see might I stir. <br>OTHERS ATTACKED <br>By this time the other two men had Mr Sheehan on his knees lower down, <mark>counting 30 seconds, swearing and cursing at him to know who burned the hay, which the man knew nothing about</mark>. Then those two men brought Mr. Sheehan up to where I was and I was ordered out of the ditch and told to advance 60 paces forward. <mark>Then there was a whistle blown</mark> and I was ordered to halt and come back. <small> <a name="II19sep24" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#II19sep24"><cite title="source">Irish Independent</cite></a> (19 September 1924) 8/5</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
