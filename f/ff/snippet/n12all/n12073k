After Our Lord had died on the Cross for the sins of the human race, a Roman army, avenging His Passion laid Judea waste, and the captive Jews were dispersed amongst the nations of the earth. Some of their number settled down among the Armorican Britons, and it is stated that it was from them that St. Patrick traced his origin. <small> William Canon Fleming, <a name="WFBS" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#WFBS"><cite title="source">Boulogne-sur-mer: St Patrick's native town</cite></a> (1907) 61</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
