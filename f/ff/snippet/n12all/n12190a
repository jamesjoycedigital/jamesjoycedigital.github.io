The King or Prince has his demesne lands cultivated for him by <mark>unfree</mark> occupiers; but the bulk of the land is held by kindreds of free tribesmen. They do not hold from the King, but by virtue of their tribal blood, which entitles them to a share in the country. The dues they pay to the King are not rent but taxes. <small> W.F.
