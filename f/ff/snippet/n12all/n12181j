The wind blew into the harbour. It was impossible to escape, and the sloop lay motionless and to all appearance idle. But just as the pursuer tacked and ran straight into the harbour mouth a sail was hoisted on the sloop, she began to move, and in a minute her sides were scraping through the tiny passage, while men with sweeps out fended her off this and that sunken rock; and in another minute she was out and away, <mark>cracking on full sail</mark> with a good half-hour&apos;s lead before the revenue boat could beat out of the narrow sound to chase her. <small> Stephen Gwynn, <a name="SGWM" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#SGWM"><cite title="source">Munster</cite></a> (1911) 41-2</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
