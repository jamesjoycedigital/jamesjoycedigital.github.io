I never landed there, though I often talked with the Tory fishers, including one who had made his fortune at the goldfields and come back to the place of his birth among the rocks and the fish heads. There is one sheltered spot, one growing bush, and one only, on Tory. There, of course, Irish is the language, and they maintain the practice of verse, chiefly for purposes of satire; quarrels are revenged in rhyme. I talked to a red-bearded mountainy man near Gortahork about this, but he said it was a <mark>peevish</mark> thing to do; he would rather have a skelp at a man. In truth there is an old feud between Tory and the shore, and fierce battles have been waged. <small> Stephen Gwynn, <a name="SGWU" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#SGWU"><cite title="source">Ulster</cite></a> (1911) 48</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c12183b" href="c12all.htm#c12183b">VI.C.12:183(b)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
