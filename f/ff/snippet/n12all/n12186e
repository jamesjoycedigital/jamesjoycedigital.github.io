I was pleased at the suggestion, as on several occasions I had found that this desire to work blindfold or with closed eyes had produced remarkable results. Almost immediately the pencil began to tap on the paper, then to move quite vigorously. The writing came in detached words as in normal handwriting. <small> Herbert Thurston, &ldquo;The &lsquo;Oscar Wilde&rsquo; Script&rdquo; <a name="HTOW" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#HTOW"><cite title="source">Studies</cite></a> (March 1924) 16</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
