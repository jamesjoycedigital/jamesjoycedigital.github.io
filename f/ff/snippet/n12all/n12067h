Some of his disciples, on searching, found it glistening in a shallow pool at a place called Cill-fiacla, now named Kilfeacle, where a church was built and the Saint&apos;s tooth preserved as a precious relic. <small> William Canon Fleming, <a name="WFSP" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#WFSP"><cite title="source">The Life of St Patrick: Apostle of Ireland</cite></a> (1905) 136</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
