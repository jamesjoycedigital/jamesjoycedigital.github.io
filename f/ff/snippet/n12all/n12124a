He then saw the sea in front of him and immediately behind him soldiers in battle array. <mark>He stopped and transformed the whole army into stones</mark>. &hellip; Pilgrims from all countries flocked to the place to implore St. Corn&eacute;ly to cure their diseased cattle. He cured them all in remembrance of the great services rendered to him by his yoke of oxen during his flight. The pilgrims, coming to the &lsquo;Pardon of St. Corn&eacute;ly,&rsquo; passed among the stone soldiers. The men were supposed to bring stones, the women earth, and to drop them on an elevation near to Carnac where in time they formed the mount of St. Michel. <small> Zacharie Le Rouzic, <a name="MMCL" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#MMCL"><cite title="source">The Megalithic Monuments of Carnac and Locmariaquer</cite></a> (1908) 31 [a legend about St. Corn&eacute;ly and the origin of the megaliths]</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c12127h" href="c12all.htm#c12127h">VI.C.12:127(h)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
