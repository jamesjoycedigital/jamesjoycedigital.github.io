The President read the answer which had been prepared for him by you. You were absent, and Deputy Figgis made a short statement at the close. As far as I know that was in August. This letter was handed in to you in September. That was 3rd August. In the meantime there had been an election. Now <mark>can you search your memory</mark> to find out what occurred between 3rd August and some date in September, which led Mr. Beldton to send this letter to you? <small> <a name="IT29mar24x" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#IT29mar24x"><cite title="source">Irish Times</cite></a> (29 March 1924) 7/3</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
