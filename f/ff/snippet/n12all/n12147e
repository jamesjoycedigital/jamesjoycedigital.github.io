It was the forerunner of the ophicleide (which derived its name from the Greek words <i>ophis</i> and <i>kleis</i>, meaning respectively &lsquo;serpent&rsquo; and &lsquo;key&rsquo;) and was made of wood. The Serpent was highly popular in French church music where it was known as the <i>Serpent d&apos;&eacute;glise</i>.
