And I saw many signs come to pass, blind receiving sight, deaf hearing, lame walking, lepers cleansed, and them that were possessed of unclean spirits healed. And every one that was under any sickness or disease <i>came and</i> touched the wall where she lay, and cried: Holy Mary, thou didst bear Christ our God, have mercy on us. And forthwith they were cured. <small> Montague Rhodes James, <a name="APNT" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#APNT"><cite title="source">The Apocryphal New Testament</cite></a> (1924) 205</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: German <i>Sonntag</i>, Sunday. </mm> </dd></dl>
