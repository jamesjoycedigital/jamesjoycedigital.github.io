These flaked stones are divided into different types, of which the most ancient is the Chellean type, of Chelles (Seine-et-Marne), having more or less the shape of an almond, dressed on its two faces, but differing very much in form, shape, and finish. <small> Zacharie Le Rouzic, <a name="MMCL" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#MMCL"><cite title="source">The Megalithic Monuments of Carnac and Locmariaquer</cite></a> (1908) 9</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: <cite>FW</cite> 4.35 derives from <a name="n03012a" href="n03all.htm#n03012a">N03 (VI.B.3):012(a)</a>. </mm> </dd></dl>
