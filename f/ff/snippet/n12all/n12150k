For this purpose it will be well to study the history of our own country. In his work on <cite>The Origin of the English Nation</cite>, Professor Chadwick gives a clear account of the manner by which the earliest known warlike States in Europe have developed. He insists throughout his work on the importance of royal blood as the essential factor in the foundation of States by the Anglo-Saxons and Jutes, and on the clear-cut contrast which existed in these States between rulers and commoners. He states that <mark>all the royal genealogies</mark> that have been kept&mdash;those of Kent, Wessex, Essex, East Anglia, Mercia, Lindsey, Deira, Bernicia&mdash;go back to gods, and thus lay claim to a distinction from the commoners. Usually descent is claimed <mark>from Odin</mark>, who himself is said to have come to Denmark from Persia, where he was a member of the royal family. It may sound strange to read of a &ldquo;god&rdquo; as a man, but, as is shown in <cite>The Origin of Magic and Religion</cite>, there is nothing extraordinary in this claim; on the contrary, it is a fact of the utmost importance to the thesis that I am sustaining. <small> William James Perry, <a name="ORMR" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#ORMR"><cite title="source">Origin of Magic and Religion</cite></a> (1923) 152</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
