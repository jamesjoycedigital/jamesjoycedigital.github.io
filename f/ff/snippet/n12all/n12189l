It was subject, however, in Ireland to a complication unknown in Wales &mdash; the existence as a political unit of the clan. <br>It is not necessary to go into this subject here, beyond saying that in Wales there were no clans having a separate political existence. Sovereignty in Wales was territorial, not based on claims of kindred. The Irish feeling that O&apos;Conors should be ruled only by O&apos;Conors, and MacDermotts only by MacDermotts, never sprang up in Wales. <mark>There were no surnames in Wales</mark>; nor was it held that the King or Prince should necessarily be of the same blood as his subjects. Apart from this, the Irish and Welsh systems of family tenure seem to have been practically identical. <small> W.F.
