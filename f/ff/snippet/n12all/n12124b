To begin with, gold is found in connection with them; other objects, such as weapons and ornaments of bronze, have also been found, and we have seen that the greater part of the objects found in the tombs were ritual and votive and were made especially to be placed there for use in the next world. <mark>Doubtless the use of metal was excluded by the religious caste</mark> which made and sold such articles. Not being able or willing to work the metals the priests of that time in this district, the centre of their religion, resisted the use of metal much longer than was the case elsewhere. <small> Zacharie Le Rouzic, <a name="MMCL" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#MMCL"><cite title="source">The Megalithic Monuments of Carnac and Locmariaquer</cite></a> (1908) 34</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
