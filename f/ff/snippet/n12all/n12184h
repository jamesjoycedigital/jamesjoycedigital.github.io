It commits you to return that way; but what you leave by the roadside is as safe as if Argus watched it unless, indeed, some <mark>mountainy heifer</mark> should pass that way and eat it: they will chew anything from a fishing rod to a suit of clothes. I have seen embarrassed bathers pursuing an active cow, who carried essential garments in her mouth, still masticating them even while she pranced in her clumsy gallop. <small> Stephen Gwynn, <a name="SGWU" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#SGWU"><cite title="source">Ulster</cite></a> (1911) 55</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
