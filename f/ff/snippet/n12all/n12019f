In the form of &ldquo;Norman&rdquo; it is the name of those colonists from Scandinavia who settled themselves in Gaul, and founded Normandy, who (as was their wont) adopted the native (French) tongue and manners, and who from their new home set forth on new errands of conquest, chiefly in the British Isles and in Southern Italy and Sicily. </mm> </dd></dl>
