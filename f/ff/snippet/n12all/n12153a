These theses were as follows: <br>(1) Even if Adam had not sinned he would have died. <br>(2) Adam&apos;s sin harmed only himself, not the human race. <br>(3) Children just born are in the same state as Adam before his fall. <br>(4) The whole human race neither dies through Adam&apos;s sin or death, nor rises again through the resurrection of Christ. <br>(5) The (Mosaic) Law is as good a guide to heaven as the Gospel. <br>(6) Even before the advent of Christ there were men who were without sin. <small> <a name="CEPEL" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#CEPEL"><cite title="source">&ldquo;Pelagius&rdquo;</cite></a> <cite a>Catholic Encyclopaedia</cite></a> (1911) 605a-b</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c12157b" href="c12all.htm#c12157b">VI.C.12:157(b)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
