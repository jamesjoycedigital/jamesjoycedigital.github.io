It is recorded in the annals as the invasion of Ceasair. This race, according to the monkish historians, was swept away by the Deluge, but I doubt not that the true ethnic traditions represented this remote Ceasair, and the gods of her cycle, as the root whence sprang all the gods and heroes of later times. <small> Standish O'Grady, <a name="OGSE" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#OGSE"><cite title="source">Selected Essays and Passages</cite></a> (1918) 52-3</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
