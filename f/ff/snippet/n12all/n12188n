The saint was a true humanist, one who believed in the culture of the whole human being: the emotions have their place in education, for man is not pure intellect; the body is not to be merely tolerated or depressed, but is to receive a positive education. <small> T.C., review of &ldquo;Saint Francis de Sales&rdquo; <a name="SFDS" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#SFDS"><cite title="source">Studies</cite></a> (June 1924) 331</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c12186m" href="c12all.htm#c12186m">VI.C.12:186(m)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
