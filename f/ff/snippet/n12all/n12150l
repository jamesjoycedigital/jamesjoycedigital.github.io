As Sir Arthur Evans has pointed out, in his <cite>Palace of Minos</cite>, the Mycenaean civilization of mainland Greece was derived from Crete, and was far below it in cultural level. This form of culture first appears in Crete at the beginning of what is termed the Middle Minoan Age (<i>circ.</i> 2100 <year>B.C.</year>). As usual, this culture shows manifold traces of derivation from Egyptian sources. One of the most important items of evidence of this derivation lies in the form of grave in which the rulers of the Mycenaean Age were buried. These appeared in Crete in the Middle Minoan Age, and were obviously modelled on Egyptian pyramids of the Twelfth Dynasty, that is, of about the same time. What is more, models of mummies have been found in the Cretan examples; while in those of Greece itself the bodies were actually <mark>embalmed in honey</mark>. This certainly suggests the coming into the <font color="green">[158]</font> Mediterranean of rulers closely connected with the Egyptian ruling family. <small> William James Perry, <a name="ORMR" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#ORMR"><cite title="source">Origin of Magic and Religion</cite></a> (1923) 158-159</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
