Sabbathier, <a name="MSAD" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#MSAD"><cite title="source">Dictionnaire pour l'intelligence des auteurs classiques, Grecs et Latins</cite></a> (1773) 494</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: [The Druids distributed the mistletoe, as a New Year&apos;s present, at the beginning of the year; hence the custom among the people of Chartres to call presents (&hellip;) <i>&eacute;guilables</i>, meaning the mistletoe for the New Year.]  <br>Note: See Pliny, <cite>Natural History</cite>, VI/95: The druids &mdash; that is what the Gauls call their magicians &mdash; hold nothing more sacred than mistletoe and the tree on which it grows, provided that it is an oak. Groves of oaks are chosen even for their own sake, and the magicians perform no rites without using the foliage of these trees [&hellip;] Anything growing on oak trees they think to have been sent down from heaven, and to be a signal that that particular tree has been chosen by a god. Mistletoe is, however, rather seldom found on an oak, and, when it is so discovered, it is gathered with great ceremony, particularly on the ninth day of the moon [&hellip;] because it is then rising in strength and not yet half its full size. Hailing the moon in a native word that means &lsquo;healing all things&rsquo;, they prepare a ritual sacrifice and banquet beneath a tree and bring up two white bulls, whose horns are bound for the first time on this occasion. A priest arrayed in white vestments climbs the tree and with a golden sickle cuts down the mistletoe, which is caught in a white cloak. Then finally they kill the victims, praying to the god to render his gift propitious to those on whom he has bestowed it. <br>At New Year, the French kiss under the mistletoe and shout: &lsquo;<i>Au gui l&apos;an neuf</i>&lsquo; (mistletoe for the New Year). This custom is said to derive from the druids&apos; picking of mistletoe on the first day of the year. </mm> </mm></dd></dl>
