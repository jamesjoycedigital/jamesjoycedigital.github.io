Not so the Palaeolithic, or <mark>flaked, or worked stones,</mark> of the second period, discovered at the bottom of the quaternary strata with the remains of extinct or migrated animals. These flaked stones are divided into different types, of which the most ancient is the Chellean type, of Chelles (Seine-et-Marne), having more or less the shape of an almond, dressed on its two faces, but differing very much in form, shape, and finish. <small> Zacharie Le Rouzic, <a name="MMCL" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#MMCL"><cite title="source">The Megalithic Monuments of Carnac and Locmariaquer</cite></a> (1908) 9</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
