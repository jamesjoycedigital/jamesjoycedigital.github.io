We must also take into account that his intimacy with the Greeks developed in him, though unknown to himself, a one-sidedness, which at first sight appears pardonable. The gravest error into which he and the rest of the Pelagians fell, was that they did not submit to the doctrinal decisions of the Church. While <mark>the Latins</mark> had emphasized the guilt rather than its punishment, as the chief characteristic of original sin, <mark>the Greeks</mark> on the other hand (even Chrysostom) laid greater stress on the punishment than on the guilt. Theodore of Mopsuestia went even so far as to deny the possibility of original guilt and consequently the penal character of the death of the body. <small> <a name="CEPEL" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#CEPEL"><cite title="source">&ldquo;Pelagius&rdquo;</cite></a> <cite a>Catholic Encyclopaedia</cite></a> (1911) 605a</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
