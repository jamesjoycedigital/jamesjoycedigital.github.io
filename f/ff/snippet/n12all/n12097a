Kereon street is the most famous in Quimper. In Breton, <i>kereon</i> is the plural form of <i>kere</i> (Fr. <i>cordonnier</i>), a cobbler. There was a <i>couvent des Cordeliers</i> (convent of corded friars) in the same town, replaced in 1847 by a market, and there is still a street of that name. </mm> </dd></dl>
