But the chronicler Dudo of Saint-Quentin&apos;s statement that Rollo married Gisela, daughter of Charles the Simple, must be considered to be legendary. In 924 Rollo received from the king of France Bessin and Maine. </mm> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c12002b" href="c12all.htm#c12002b">VI.C.12:002(b)</a> </mm></mm></dd> </dd></dl>
