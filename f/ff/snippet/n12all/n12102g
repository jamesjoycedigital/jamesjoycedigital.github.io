This was a ruse on his part, and one to which I succumbed, for no sooner did I hold it nearer to his nose than he snatched it out of my hand! It was, however, promptly taken from him and he was told he would have to &ldquo;deserve it&rdquo; first. In the meantime a young female dog had come into the room&mdash;she answered to the name of Lola, and I asked Rolf if Lola might come with me. His reply was a most decided &ldquo;No!&rdquo; I put some further questions to him, and Frau von Moers particularly asked him: &ldquo;Is Lola clever? | Is Lola to learn?&rdquo; to which he made answer: &ldquo;Lola is clever, but she is not to learn because of the professors&rdquo;&mdash;and he actually <mark>made a face</mark>, apparently he was thinking of his own experiences. I laughed, and said: <br>&ldquo;Lola shall have a good time with me; she shall run about in the woods and the meadows, and play with a lot of other animals, and not have to work too long; the professors shall be sent away when Lola is tired.&rdquo; This evidently pleased him, and he became very friendly to me, and on my returning to my point and asking once more whether Lola might go with me, he rapped out his answer on my hand: it was &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; <small> Henny Kindermann, <a name="LOLA" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#LOLA"><cite title="source">Lola or the thought and speech of animals</cite></a> (1922) 27-8</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
