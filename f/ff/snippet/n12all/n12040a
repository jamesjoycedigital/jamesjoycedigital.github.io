After her death funeral games, known as the Oenach Tailten were held in her memory. The Tailteann Games, as they came to be known, were revived by the Irish Free State and held in August 1924. The event also included a ceremony honouring Irish writers. (See <cite>Letters III</cite>, 100-1 for Joyce&apos;s polite letter of refusal to Yeats, who had invited him to attend.) </mm> </dd></dl>
