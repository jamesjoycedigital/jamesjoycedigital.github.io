She sat in the railway carriage with me, and began to howl violently when she saw Mannheim disappearing from her gaze. I tried to console her, saying: &ldquo;Don&apos;t cry! You shall be quite happy with me!&rdquo; It was then that Lola looked at me for the first time attentively. She quieted down and our friendship seemed sealed. She was apparently resigned to her fate; she was also doubtless aware that she had played &ldquo;second fiddle&rdquo; at Mannheim, and that it would, therefore, be preferable to be somewhere &ldquo;on her own.&rdquo; That something of the kind was passing through her mind I could see&mdash;also that she was quite aware that she now belonged to me, and imagined she would be alone with me. This latter surmise became evident as soon as we reached my home where the sheep-dog I had had for two years rushed out to welcome me. <p>Then Lola gazed at me with horror and disappointment; the reproach in her eyes was such that I could not but understand, and then&mdash;the two dogs flew at each other, for, in the meantime the sheep-dog had begun to understand too! <mark>This was remarkable, for male and female dogs do not as a rule fall foul of each other</mark>.</p> <small> Henny Kindermann, <a name="LOLA" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#LOLA"><cite title="source">Lola or the thought and speech of animals</cite></a> (1922) 33-4</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
