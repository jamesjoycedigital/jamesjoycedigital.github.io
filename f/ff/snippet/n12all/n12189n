We should find England divided up into a great number of units of landed property of varying sizes, called manors. The manor may be considered as a self-supporting village community, the property of an individual holding from the King or some other person as the superior lord. The land within the manor falls into two distinct categories: one the Lord&apos;s demesne worked by him for his own profit; the other held by tenants, using the word practically in its modern sense. But these tenants fall into two classes: one, a relatively small one, of free tenants holding by military service or by the payment of a fixed rental or by both; the other, and much the larger class, composed of holders described by various names and of varied rank; but who all for convenience sake may be called bond or villein or nativus; and who all have this characteristic in common that they owed to the lord uncertain or unlimited services, very largely in the nature of work to be done in ploughing, sowing and reaping the lands he held in demesne. <small> W.F.
