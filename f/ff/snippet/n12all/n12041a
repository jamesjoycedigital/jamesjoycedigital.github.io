They questioned Patrick, &ldquo;Whence are you, and whither have you come? Is it from the sidhe? &hellip; Teach us duly that we may see the Lord face to face &mdash; teach us, and we will do as you will say to us. &rdquo; <p>And St. Patrick said, &ldquo;Do you believe that through baptism the sin of your mother and your father shall be put away from you?&rdquo; They answered, &ldquo;We believe.&rdquo; &ldquo;Do you believe in repentance after sin?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; And they were baptized, and Patrick blessed a white veil upon their heads, and they desired to see Christ face to face. And Patrick said to them, &ldquo;You cannot see Christ except that you first taste death, and unless you receive the body of Christ, and His blood.&rdquo; And the daughters replied, saying, &ldquo;Give us the communion, that we may be able to see the Prophesied One.&rdquo; And they after this received the communion, and fell asleep in death, and Patrick placed them under one covering and in one bed (grave), and their friends made great lamentations over them. <small> Very Rev.
