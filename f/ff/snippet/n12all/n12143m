This king of Meath had become the Ardri or sovereign king of all Ireland. Until the time of King Tuathal all the Irish provinces met at the spot marked by <mark>a large stone called &ldquo;The Stone of the Divisions.</mark>&rdquo; Near this stone some of the territory from all the provinces was taken, and thus formed the kingdom of Meath. The new kingdom included four of the chief towns which had belonged to the ancient provinces and were no great distance apart: Tara in Leinster, Tailtenn in Ulster, Tlachtga in Munster, and Usnach in Connaught. Tuathal built a royal residence in each of these towns, but he chiefly resided at Tara.]</font></blockquote> </dl>
