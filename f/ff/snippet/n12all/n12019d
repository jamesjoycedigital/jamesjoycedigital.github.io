The name is taken from Merovech (&lsquo;sea-born&rsquo;), one of the first kings of the Salian Franks, who succeeded to Clodio in the middle of the 5th century, and soon became the centre of many legends. Merovach was the father of Childeric I. (457-481), and grandfather of Clovis (481-511), under whom the war-loving Salian Franks conquered the whole of Gaul, except the kingdom of Burgundy, Provence and Septimania. </mm> </dd></dl>
