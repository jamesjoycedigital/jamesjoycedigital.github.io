From a hunter he becomes a shepherd and a husbandman. His implements, weapons and tools change and increase in number; the dressed flint continues, the axe, the <mark>gouge</mark> and the hammer are polished and are provided with <mark>handles</mark>. <mark>Manufactories for the working of different hard and soft rocks appear</mark> and their produce is sent into all parts. With this new industry we find certain indications of a religion in the care which is taken of the dead. Special chambers are prepared for their bodies, and with the corpses are laid their weapons, jewels, and amulets; alongside, but in less important sepulchres, the slaves and servants are placed. In certain districts these sepulchral chambers are dug in the earth, in others they are built above ground with detached blocks of stone and then covered with earth and stone, thus forming a tumulus. The monuments being burial-places, the human bones of this period are very numerous. The races are already very much mixed; they practised <mark>trepanning</mark>, and certain indications lead us to believe that they were cannibals. &hellip; <mark>Bronze</mark> makes its appearance about this time in the shape of axes which were at first flat. &hellip; The weapons and implements of stone of the dead are no longer utilitarian but votive objects; pottery even attains a sacred character. &hellip; It was also the time of the chariot-sepulture in Champagne called Marnienne (fourth century, <year>B.C.</year>). It was, to sum up, the dawn of our history. &hellip; <small> Zacharie Le Rouzic, <a name="MMCL" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#MMCL"><cite title="source">The Megalithic Monuments of Carnac and Locmariaquer</cite></a> (1908) 11</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
