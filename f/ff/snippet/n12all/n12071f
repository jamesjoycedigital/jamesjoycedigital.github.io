Angry words were succeeded by an open rupture at which blood was shed at a place which has been lately identified as Lismoghan, near Blackstaff Bridge, on the inner bay of Dundrum. <small> William Canon Fleming, <a name="WFSP" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#WFSP"><cite title="source">The Life of St Patrick: Apostle of Ireland</cite></a> (1905) 162</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
