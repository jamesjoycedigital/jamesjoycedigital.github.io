It is easy to trace the lie of the fight, along the range of hillocks by Aughrim where St. Ruth, James&apos;s general, took up position, facing the bog which divided him from Urrachree, to which Ginkel had moved out from Ballinasloe. Till quite lately a thorn-tree marked the spot where St Ruth lay, struck down by a cannon shot as he headed what should have been the decisive charge One can guess, too, at the position behind the ridges, where the Frenchman&apos;s jealousy kept Ireland&apos;s own leader, <mark>Sarsfield</mark>, out of action with the reserves, chafing for action, till St Ruth&apos;s fall disorganized everything, and the call for Sarsield came too late. <small> Stephen Gwynn, <a name="SGWC" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#SGWC"><cite title="source">Connaught</cite></a> (1911) 12</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: See <a name="n12101f" href="n12all.htm#n12101f">N12 (VI.B.14):101(f)</a> for <cite>FW</cite> 452.28f. </mm> </dd></dl>
