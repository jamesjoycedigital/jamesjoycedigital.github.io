But, as regards the free landholders, though the lords attempted in many cases to turn them into tenants, and in some cases succeeded, yet, as I have shown in my <i>Policy of <mark>Surrender and Regrant</mark></i>, these free landowners, were recognised as owners of their land, at least when it suited the convenience of the Government. <small> W.F.
