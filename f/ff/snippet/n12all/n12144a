This king of Meath had become the Ardri or sovereign king of all Ireland. Until the time of King Tuathal all the Irish provinces met at the spot marked by <mark>a large stone called &ldquo;The Stone of the Divisions.</mark>&rdquo; Near this stone some of the territory from all the provinces was taken, and thus formed the kingdom of Meath. <mark>The new kingdom included four of the chief towns which had belonged to the ancient provinces and were no great distance apart: Tara in Leinster, Tailtenn in Ulster, Tlachtga in Munster, and Usnach in Connaught. Tuathal built a royal residence in each of these towns, but he chiefly resided at Tara.</mark>]</font></blockquote> <dd class="well"> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c12148a" href="c12all.htm#c12148a">VI.C.12:148(a)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
