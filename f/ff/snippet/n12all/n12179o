But you can see also in markets in north Mayo many a handsome old man, springy and active even in his extreme age, who wears <mark>the blue tail coat</mark>, with its complement of brass buttons, which perhaps his father handed down to him &mdash; and a fine figure he makes in it, especially if he still keeps to the tight knee breeches and buckled shoes which were universal in his boyhood. <small> Stephen Gwynn, <a name="SGWC" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#SGWC"><cite title="source">Connaught</cite></a> (1911) 7-8</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
