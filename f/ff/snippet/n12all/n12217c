A triangle, in this context, was originally formed of three halberds stuck in the ground and joined at the top, to which soldiers were formerly bound to be flogged. Cf. Seumas MacManus, <cite>The Story of the Irish Race</cite> (1921), 518: On the 30th March, Martial Law was proclaimed all through the country. The most frightful atrocities were committed by the troops under its shelter, for the purpose avowed by Lord Castlereagh himself &ldquo;to cause a premature rebellion&rdquo;. To the &ldquo;frightfulness&rdquo; associated with General Lake&apos;s conduct in Ulster in 1797, new terrors were added by the policy of &ldquo;free quarters&rdquo;. A savage and undisciplined soldiery, mad with lust and drink, were let loose in the pure homes of the countryside, and the land was filled with the cries of ravished women, the shrieks of the victims of pitch cap and triangle, the lamentations of those who saw their homes go up in flames. So dreadful was the conduct of the troops, that their Commander-in-Chief, Sir Ralph Abercrombie, unable to stomach them any longer, resigned. He had previously declared the &ldquo;army was in a state of licentiousness, which must render it formidable to everyone but the enemy&rdquo;. &ldquo;Within these twelve months&rdquo;, he writes, on another occasion, &ldquo;every crime, every cruelty that could be committed by Cossacks and Calmucks has been transacted here&rdquo;. </mm> </dd></dl>
