For in the earliest settlements of these peoples in central Europe there have been found Greek and Etruscan remains, showing that highly civilized peoples from the <mark>Mediterranean</mark> had been working up into central Europe, and had given these barbarians some measure of culture. The Celts, like the Teutons, never invented anything; the whole of their <font color="green">[138]</font> culture shows signs of derivation from the Mediterranean. Moreover, their countries of origin had previously been tenanted by peoples of the Bronze Age, who possessed a culture obviously derived from the Mediterranean. In no case do we find them apart from peoples of a higher civilization than themselves. The original Celts, as we know them, were a boundary folk, originating in a centre where remains of older peoples exist, and they obviously derived the whole of their culture from the Mediterranean, with the exception of their horse-riding habits. <small> William James Perry, <a name="ORMR" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#ORMR"><cite title="source">Origin of Magic and Religion</cite></a> (1923) 138f</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: See also <a name="n14073b" href="n14all.htm#n14073b">N14 (VI.B.7):073(b)</a> </mm> </dd></dl>
