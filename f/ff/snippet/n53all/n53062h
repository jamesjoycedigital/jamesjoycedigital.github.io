They inhabited the woodlands of Upper New York State, in the area extending from the Genesee River to Lake Champlain. Deganawidah, a Huron Indian, and his desciple Hiawatha, a Mohawk, found the League of the Five Nations in the sixteenth century. This was designed to eliminate inter-tribal warfare and in 1715 was joined by a sixth tribe, the Tuscacora. The confederacy prospered through the fur trade until shortly after the war of 1812, when at last the encroachment of white settlers uprooted and dispersed the Indians. </mm> </dd></dl>
