It was so arranged that it <font color="green">[118]</font> leaned slightly inwards, and was only kept from falling by a cord which passed in front of it and which was attached to two screw pickets&mdash;one on each side. The hole itself was covered with a sack. So much for the scenery. <p>The stage directions were equally simple. The curtain rises on a German raid.
