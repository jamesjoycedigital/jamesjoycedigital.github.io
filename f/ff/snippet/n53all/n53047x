One popular system of sorting is termed the <i>fan-ts&apos;ie</i> (literally, to cut off in two directions). In this, each syllable is split into two parts, initial and final, by way of placing the character whose pronunciation is to be described (in whatevevr dialect is pertinent) between two other characters, necessarily known to the reader. These two characters indicate the initial and final sound, respectively. In this roundabout way, the character <i>ching</i>, for example, is recorded in the &lsquo;ch&rsquo; and &lsquo;ing&rsquo; parts of <i>chi shing</i>. A third symbol then indicates the correct tone. This seems to be illustrated here. </mm> </dd></dl>
