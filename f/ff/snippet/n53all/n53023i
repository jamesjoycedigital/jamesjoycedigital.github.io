What <mark>star</mark> was so called of old is not easily ascertained. Some now distinguish the pole-star by that name. A song, which is still in repute, among the sea-faring part of the Highlanders, alludes to this passage of Ossian. The author commends the knowledge of Ossian in sea affairs, a merit, which, perhaps, few of us moderns will allow him, or any in the age in which he lived. <small> James MacPherson, <a name="JMPO" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#JMPO"><cite title="source">The Poems of Ossian</cite></a> (1806) <font size="-1">OINA-MORUL</font> Book I, 208</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: See also <a name="n54117f" href="n54all.htm#n54117f">N54 (VI.B.45):117(f)</a>. </mm> </dd></dl>
