While a psalter, strictly speaking, should contain only verse, Mac Cuileanain&apos;s one seems to have included both prose and pedigrees. It is not now extant, and was last seen in Limerick in 1712. Much of its text, however, is replicated in the books of Lecan and Ballymote. One part of the replicated materials is the prose fragment entitled <i>Maccgniomharta Fhinn</i> (The Youthful Exploits of Finn). This occupies about six pages of a manuscript now in the Bodleian Library at Oxford and is believed to be a direct copy of its counterpart in the Psalter of Cashel, having been made by Shane O&apos;Clery in 1454. In 1854 a literal transcription was made by E.D. Cleaver for John O&apos;Donovan, who published it alongside a translation in the <cite>Transactions of the <mark>Ossianic Society</mark></cite> (Dublin, 1859).] </mm> </dd></dl>
