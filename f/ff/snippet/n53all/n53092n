This skeletal index is scattered over pages 92, 93, and 88. It concerns itself with a) the consolidation and expansion of Danish power in the latter half of the tenth century, and b) with the founding of the Russian state by Swedish Vikings in or about the year <year>A.D.</year> 860 Haraldr Gormsson, or Bl&aacute;t&ouml;nn (Bluetooth), king of Denmark c. <year>A.D.</year> 950-984 gained control of the <mark>Vik &mdash; an inlet of waters south of the Oslofjord</mark> &mdash; and of the surrounding territory. He achieved this mainly by assisting Haraldr Gr&aacute;feldr (Harold Greycoat), son of Eirikr Bl&oacute;dox (Erick Bloodaxe) in his successful campaign to regain kingship in Norway. <br>In the east, Bluetooth promoted commerce with the Wends, a Slavonic people who occupied the south Baltic coast extending from Denmark to the Vistula. In his efforts to push the trading lines into central Europe, Bluetooth is said to have founded the fortress at J&oacute;msborg at a strategic point in Wendland, at the mouth of the Oder. <br>Joyce&apos;s source for this material was identified by Viviana Mirela Braslasu and Robbert-Jan Henkes, &lsquo;How the &ldquo;offsprout of vikings&rdquo; went &ldquo;east-viking&rdquo; Joyce&apos;s Notes on A. Mawer&apos;s <i>The Vikings</i>&rsquo;, <i>Genetic Joyce Studies</i> Issue 16 (Spring 2016). As the authors detail, a much more extended index of notes from the same source appears in the earlier notebook N14 (VI.B.7). Their notes are repeated here. The present index is drawn only from Chapter VII of Mawer&apos;s book: &lsquo;The Vikings in Baltic Lands and Russia&rsquo;. </mm> </dd></dl>
