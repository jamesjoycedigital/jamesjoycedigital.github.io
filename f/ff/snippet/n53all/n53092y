Enquiries were made and it was found that these &lsquo;Rhos&rsquo; were Swedes. This would point to the presence of &lsquo;Rus&rsquo; in Russia at a date earlier than that given by Nestor, and indeed the rapid extension of their influence indicates a period of activity considerably longer than that allowed by him. These &lsquo;Rus&rsquo; or &lsquo;Rhos&rsquo; soon came into relations, both of trade and war, with the Byzantine empire. We have preserved to us from the years 911 and 944 commercial treaties made between the &lsquo;Rus&rsquo; and the Greeks showing that they brought all kinds of furs and also slaves to Constantinople, receiving in exchange various articles of luxury including gold and silver ornaments, silks and other rich stuffs. The names of the signatories to these treaties are, on the side of the <mark>&lsquo;Rus&rsquo;, almost entirely of Scandinavian origin</mark> and may to some extent to be shown to be of definitely Swedish provenance. <small> Allen Mawer, <a name="AMTV2" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#AMTV2"><cite title="source">The Vikings</cite></a>, (1913) 74-5</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
