C. JEVONS <p class="spbr">THE railway traveller is safeguarded from point to point along his journey by a system of signalling which is as nearly foolproof as human ingenuity can make it. The time is not far off when the traveller by air will be in practically the same position. He will fly from aerodrome to aerodrome along an invisible track formed by the "overlap" of two beams of wireless energy, and at the end of his journey will glide safely down to earth on the back of a <mark>short-wave</mark> "landing" beam.</p> <small> <a name="PWT25dec37" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#PWT25dec37"><cite title="source">Populary Wireless and Television Times</cite></a> (25 December 1937) 387</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: To achieve high-definition pictures it has been found necessary to broadcast in the <mark>shortwave</mark> region of the radio spectrum. This restricts the service area of the transmitter because the short carrier waves, which do not reflect from the ionosphere, rapidly fade beyond the horizon. </mm> </dd></dl>
