The rugged Basque language (natively, Euskera, Eskuara, Heskuara, Eskoarea, or sometimes Eskoara) is spoken on both sides of the Pyrenean Mountains. If one excludes its agglutinative nature&mdash;shared with Finnish, Turkish, and some other languages &mdash; it stands magnificiently isolated as a language, being <i>sui generis</i>. There are six principal dialects differing slightly among themselves. It is written today in a modified Latin alphabet; its original alphabet is no longer known. The language is directly referred to by name at <cite>FW</cite> 102.16, 121.05, 230.06, 233.35, 287f4, 329.01, 507.15, 566.33, and 577.01.  <br>Note: Index title. Underlined in violet. </mm> </mm></dd></dl>
