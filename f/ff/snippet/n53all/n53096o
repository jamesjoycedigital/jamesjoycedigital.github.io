The &lsquo;mabinogi&rsquo; of <i>Branwen</i>, daughter of <i>Llyr</i>, relates how the head of Br&acirc;n had been buried, by his own command, in the White Mount, with its face towards France. While it remained undisturbed, this island would be secure from invasion,&mdash;hence the &ldquo;wickedness&rdquo; of Arthur&apos;s &ldquo;uncovering.&rdquo; <small> W.
