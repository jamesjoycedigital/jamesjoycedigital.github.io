We agree with this entirely. It cannot serve the purpose of morality, health, or cleanliness, nor advance the ideals of Christianity one jot, to drive away numbers of diseased, unhappy, deplorable women from positions where society could, as it were, keep a guard over them, to by-ways and slums where they can entice perhaps ignorant and undefended men, rob them, blackmail them, invest them with disease, and let them go forth to taint others with whom they come in contact. <small> Mrs Archibald Mackirdy and W.N.
