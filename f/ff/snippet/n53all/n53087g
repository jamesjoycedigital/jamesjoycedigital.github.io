Their head-quarters was on the <mark>Hill of Allen</mark>, found some five miles north of the town of Kildare, and it commands a fine view of the surrounding countryside. To its north is the plain of Meath and beyond it lies Tara. To the east is the Liffey. To the south is the curragh of Kildare, and, to the west is found the Bog of Allen. Eventually Finn and Goll fell out in the ineluctable unfolding of the hereditary vendetta (Ir. <i>fich bunaid</i>) which had begun when the son of Morna killed the father of Finn at the battle of Cnucha. Goll was in his turn killed by the son. According to the <i>Annals of the Four Masters</i>, in the year 283 Finn was put to death by Aichleach, a member of the Luaighne, at Ath-Brea upon the Boyne. In the following year, at Gabhhair, the Galeoin and the sons of Morna &mdash; who were of the sept of the Fir Bolgs &mdash; in a bloody battle massacred one another, and thus put an end once and for all to the Fianna.] <small> David Comyn, <a name="DCYE" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#DCYE"><cite title="source">The Youthful Exploits of Fionn</cite></a> (1881) ??</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
