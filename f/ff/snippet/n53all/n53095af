This plate is a thin sheet of mica or like dialectic coated on one side with vast numbers of tiny silver globules. These &mdash; which are coated with caesium to render them photosensitive &mdash; form a mosaic of independent photoelectric cells. Each element accumulates an amount of charge (a number of electrons) proportional to the intensity of light incident upon it. The resultant charge image is converted into a continuous flow of electrical current by means of a scanner. A fine continuous electron beam from a gun is produced and this beam then impinges upon the mosaic in a spot only a few thousands of an inch in diameter. The scanning spot traverses the picture in a series of straight parallel lines that are slightly <mark>sloped</mark> to the horizontal and it dischares one by one the silver globules, thus causing a current to flow in the signal plate. </mm> </dd></dl>
