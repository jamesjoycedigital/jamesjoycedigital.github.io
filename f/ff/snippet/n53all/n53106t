In gyandromorphs, this is caused by a malfunction in the distribution of the sex-chromosomes, resulting in a patchy distribution of male and female characteristics in different parts of the genotype. If this occurs at the first division of the egg the result will be an insect that is half-male and half-female. In other species, the gynandromorphism may be restricted to the head alone. In inter-sexism there is no loss of chromosomes, but a lack of balance: the insect matures as one sex for a while, then abruptly switches into the opposite. All of these imperfectly-formed insects are termed <i>chimerae</i>, a word also used to describe artificially-mutilated specimens. </mm> </dd></dl>
