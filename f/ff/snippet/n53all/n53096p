This Triad refers, mainly, to certain swine legends, and is entitled <cite><mark>The Three Stout Swineherds</mark> of the Isle of Britain</cite>; but it mentions, besides swine, &ldquo;Palug&apos;s cat&rdquo;&mdash;hence its connection with &lsquo;Preiddeu Annwvn&rsquo; the poem from <cite>The Book of Taliesin</cite> already alluded to. The first of the &ldquo;three swineherds&rdquo; is Pryderi, the son of Pwyll, &ldquo;Head of Annwn,&rdquo; and his story is told in full in the &lsquo;mabinogi&rsquo; of <i>Pwyll, prince of Dyved</i>. It is strange, however, to find that the second of these pre-eminent swineherds is Drystan, or Tristan, son of Tallwch,&mdash;the knightly Tristram of later romance. &ldquo;The second&rdquo; stout swineherd, so the record runs, &ldquo;was Drystan, son of Tallwch, with the swine of March (Mark), son of Meirchion, while the swineherd went on a message to Essyllt (Iseult). <small> W.
