The woman in charge of the office wrote and told her to come to England and she would get a place at once. On the girl&apos;s arrival she found that the house was a house of infamy, and straightway went wrong. She was rescued, but too late to save her honour, by two gentlemen whom she happened to hear speaking German at a railway station, and whom she told of her trouble. They went to the Salvation Army Depot at Regent Street and reported the matter. <small> Mrs Archibald Mackirdy and W.N.
