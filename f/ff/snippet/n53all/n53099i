To combat this, Mih&aacute;ly K&aacute;rolyi set up a government, and a Republic was proclaimed on 16 November 1918. K&aacute;roli was ineffective and he resigned on 20 March 1919 in favour of the Communists and Social Democrats. On the next day, these proclaimed a Soviet Republic under the leadership of B&eacute;la Kun, a Communist agent &mdash; a spy &mdash; of Hungro-Jewish origin whom Lenin had entrusted with the mission of &lsquo;Bolshevising&rsquo; Hungary and central Europe. When the Russians&apos; promise to limit the Roumanian incursions failed to materialise and Kun&apos;s so-called internal Red Terror tactics proved intolerable, the regime fell after a mere 133 days. Kun himself bravely fled to Austria. An anti-Communist regime under Admiral Mikl&oacute;s Horthy was subsequently set up, and Horthy was made Regent, or provisional Head of State in the absence of the Hapsburg monarch, in March 1920. Horty then instituted the <mark>White Terror</mark>, in which many thousands of Bolshevik sympathisers were forced to emigrate, were interned, or were murdered. </mm> </dd></dl>
