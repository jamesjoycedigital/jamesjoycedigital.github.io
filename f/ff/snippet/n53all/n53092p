He achieved this mainly by assisting Haraldr Gr&aacute;feldr (Harold Greycoat), son of Eirikr Bl&oacute;dox (Erick Bloodaxe) in his successful campaign to regain kingship in Norway. In the east, Bluetooth promoted commerce with the Wends, a Slavonic people who occupied the south Baltic coast extending from Denmark to the Vistula. In his efforts to push the trading lines into central Europe, Bluetooth is said to have founded the fortress at J&oacute;msborg at a strategic point in Wendland, at the mouth of the Oder. </mm> </dd></dl>
