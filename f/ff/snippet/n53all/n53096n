The sword was in the keeping of &ldquo;Kadwr, earl of Cornwall,&rdquo; whose duty it was to &ldquo;arm the king on the days of battle.&rdquo; &ldquo;And the similitude of two serpents was upon the sword in gold. And when it was drawn from its scabbard, it seemed as if two flames of fire burst forth from the jaws of serpents.&rdquo; Gwenn, <mark>the mantle, was &ldquo;of diapered satin&rdquo; with &ldquo;an apple of ruddy gold at each corner</mark> thereof,&rdquo; and &ldquo;it was one of its properties that upon whomsoever it was put, he became lost to sight though he himself could see every one.&rdquo; <small> W.
