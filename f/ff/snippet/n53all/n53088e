There he stayed several years, conquering some eighty cities for his master and gaining rich treasures for himself. One interesting memorial of these journeys still remains to us. At the entrance to the arsenal in Venice stands a marble lion brought from Athens in 1687. Formerly it stood at the harbour of Piraeus, known thence as the Porto Leone. On the sides of the lion are carved two long runic inscriptions arranged in snake-like bands. The runes are too much worn to be deciphered but they are unquestionably of Scandinavian origin and the snake-bands closely resemble those that may be seen on certain runic stones in Sweden. The carving was probably done by Swedes from <mark>Uppland</mark> about the middle of the 10th century. One can hardly imagine a more striking illustration of the extent and importance of the Viking movement in Europe. <small> Allen Mawer, <a name="AMTV2" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#AMTV2"><cite title="source">The Vikings</cite></a>, (1913) 81</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: The etymology of the term Rus is uncertain. Some, who dispute the Scandinavian influence, claim that it derives from one of the many rivers with names suffixed by <i>ros</i> or <i>rus</i>, or perhaps from a lost Slav tribe, the Rhos. Even the Biblical Rosh, from Ezek. 38.2-3, 39.1, has been advanced. The Normanists &mdash; those who uphold the Scandinavian claim &mdash; derive the word from <i>Ruotsi</i>, the Finnish name for the Swedish coast of <mark>Uppland</mark> (where the Rus are supposed to have originated). </mm> </dd></dl>
