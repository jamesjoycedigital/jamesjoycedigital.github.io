Stewart MacAlister, <a name="MSLI" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#MSLI"><cite title="source">The Secret Languages of Ireland</cite></a> (Jan 1937) Ogham, 30</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: Ogham is essentially transliterative. For each letter of the alphabet a certain mark was dedicated, represented by small cuts made on a fixed axis or line. This representation could be communicated by means of the hands or recorded on a suitable surface, by making scratches on a rock, say, or notches on a piece of wood. A study of the surviving inscriptions shows the base language to have been an ancient form of Goidelic &mdash; though it had by this time become obsolete. </mm> </dd></dl>
