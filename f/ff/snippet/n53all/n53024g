He inform us that there were no fewer than one hundred and thirty six different kinds of measure of verse used in their vyses; and though we are accustomed to call rhyme a Gothic invention, he says expressly, that among all these measures, rhyme, or correspondence of final syllables, was never employed. <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> As an example of this measure, Olaus gives us these two Latin lines, constructed exactly according to the above rules of Runic verse: <p class="set">Christus caput nostrum <br>Coronet te bonis</p> <p>The initial letters of Christus, Caput, and Coronet, make the three corresponding letters of the distich. In the first line, the first syllables of Christus and of nostrum; in the second line, the on in coronet and in bonis make the requisite correspondence of syllables.</p> <small> James MacPherson, <a name="JMPO" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#JMPO"><cite title="source">The Poems of Ossian</cite></a> (1806) <font size="-1">THE POEMS OF OSSIAN</font> Book I, 50f</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
