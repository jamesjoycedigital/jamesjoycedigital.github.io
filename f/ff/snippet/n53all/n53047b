The unit in the language is the morpheme (syllable) and not the phoneme (which is unknown). As the number of syllables is limited, it follows that in Chinese we encounter a vast number of homophones (words of identical sound). To differentiate between these (to a point) a system is used whereby different tones are superimposed on the syllables. <br>Mandarin (<i>Kuan hua</i>) &mdash; the officials&apos; language &mdash; has been the received standard since 1911. This is based on the Peking dialect, which allows for each syllablle 18 possible initial consonants, 6 vowels and 4 final endings. This results in 424 possible syllables, and, allowing for diph- and triphthongs, we can increase this to about 1,000. Mandarin admits 4 tones, and thus the total amount of words (Fr. <i>mots</i>) is about 4,000-5,000. While one finds in China a number of mutually incomprehensible dialects, there is everywhere a common orthography (putting into writing). To each word there is assigned a single complex symbol or character. This arose from the earliest periods, when pictures were drawn to represent things or ideas, that is, from a purely <i>ideographic</i> system. The orthography developed from this into a <i>logography</i> &mdash; representations of words. To make matters inscrutable, there is therefore no alphabet. On the other hand, to each little picture is assigned universally only one meaning, though many different sounds as one goes from dialect to dialect. </mm> </dd></dl>
