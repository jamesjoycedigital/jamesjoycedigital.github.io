Its name, also given as Sandalwood English, derives from two commodies traded &mdash; sandalwood, a fragrant wood from the tree <i>Santalum album</i>, and B&ecirc;che-le-mer (from the Portuguese <i>bicho do mar</i>, or &lsquo;worm of the sea&rsquo;), a sea slug highly prized by the Chinese as a delicacy. The vocabulary is simplistic, of necessity, and in the main English, while the syntax is almost comical. </mm> </dd></dl>
