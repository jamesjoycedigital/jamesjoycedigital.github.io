The Fianna, that he was destined to rule over, were a band of professional warriors usually chosen from among the vassal races of Ireland (Ir. <i>doer-thuatha</i>) and whose purpose was to protect the interests of the reigning high king. Members of the dominant Milesian or free races (Ir. <i>soer-chlanda</i>) were not obliged to serve the year round in any military campaign. Finn&apos;s father, Cumhall, was of the Galeoin sept.
