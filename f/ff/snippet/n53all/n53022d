When the news of an enemy came to the residence of a chief, he immediately killed a goat with his own sword, dipped the end of an half-burnt piece of wood in the blood, and gave it to one of his servants, to be carried to the next hamlet. From hamlet to hamlet this tessera was carried with the utmost expedition, and, in the space of a few hours, the whole clan were in arms, and convened in an appointed place; the name of which was the only word that accompanied the delivery of the Cran-tara. <small> James MacPherson, <a name="JMPO" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#JMPO"><cite title="source">The Poems of Ossian</cite></a> (1806) <font size="-1">CATHLIN OF CLUTHA</font> Book I, 261n</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
