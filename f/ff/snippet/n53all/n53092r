Again he tells us that in 862 the Varangians were driven over seas and tribute was refused, but soon the tribes quarrelled among themselves and some suggested that they should find a prince who might rule over them and keep the peace. So they sent across the sea to the Varangians, to the &lsquo;Rus,&rsquo; for such is the name of these Varangians, just as others are called Swedes, Northmen, Anglians, Goths, saying that their land was great and powerful but there was no order within it and asking them to rule over them. <small> Allen Mawer, <a name="AMTV2" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#AMTV2"><cite title="source">The Vikings</cite></a>, (1913) 73-4</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: See also <a name="n50080c" href="n50all.htm#n50080c">N50 (VI.B.37):080(c)</a>. The migration eastwards of the Swedish Vikings began, at the latest, in the early part of the ninth century. They voyaged variously as pirates, traders, and soldiers of fortune, attracted to this way of life by the extraordinary system of waterways that covered the country that is now Russia like a huge web. One route connected the Baltic Sea and the Caspian Sea &mdash; via the Volga and the Dvina. Another, along the Neva, Volkhov and Dnieper rivers, stretched from the Gulf of Finland to the Black Sea and beyond that to Constantinople. An account of the foundation of the State of the Rus is found in the &lsquo;Primary Russian Chronicle&rsquo;, the <i>Provest&apos; Vremennykh Let</i>, or The Tale of Bygone Days, that covers the period 850-1100. It was written, it is said, in 1100 or so by Nestor the monk, but the earliest extant copy is the Laurentian Redaction made in 1377. [See S.H. Cross and O.P. Sherbowitz-wetzor (1953) for a translation.] In 810-812, according the Redaction, the Variags or Varangian (that is, Scandavian) rulers of North Russia were driven out by the hostile Slavonic tribes, bent on self-government. When this failed as a government, the Varagians were recalled. Rurik, a prince of the Rus, a Swedish tribe, and his brothers Sineus and Truvor, were elected as rulers. Rurik settled in Novgorod, Sineus in Beloozero, and Truvor in Izborsk. Two members of Rurik&apos;s retinue, Askold and Dir, sailed down the Dnieper and came upon the small city of Kiev. (Kiev had been built on top of a hill by three brothers, Kiy, Shchek, and Khoriv.) It was here the pair settled and they ruled over it for twenty years or so. Back in Novgorod, Rurik passed away and handed down his ownership of the realm along with the custody of his son Igor to his kinsman Oleg. Oleg, accompanied by a large force, sailed south, and by means of a ruse slew Askold and Dir. With Kiev taken, Oleg made himself prince of the Rus and settled on the city as its capitol. Oleg &mdash; known as the Wise &mdash; reigned until 913 and in that time united the great territory, even going so far as to attack Constantinople. Town after town fell under his sway. In this way, the Rus was gradually Slavicized and the Slavs asumed the name of the Rus. Igor, who ruled from 913-945, wed a Slav, and his son Sviatoslav was the first prince of the Rus to bear a Slavic name. </mm> </dd></dl>
