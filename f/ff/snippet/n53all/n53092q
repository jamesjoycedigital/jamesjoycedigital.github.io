For many years there had been an important trading centre at Julin <mark>on the Island of Wollin</mark>, where traders from Scandinavia, Saxony, Russia and many other lands met together to take part in the rich trade between the north and south, east and west, which passed through Julin, standing as it did on one of the great waterways of central Europe. <small> Allen Mawer, <a name="AMTV2" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#AMTV2"><cite title="source">The Vikings</cite></a>, (1913) 70-1</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: The location &mdash; even the existence &mdash; of J&oacute;msborg has long been disputed. The <i>J&oacute;msvikinga Saga</i>, the contents of which are mainly fictitious, describes it as having been a military encampment of mercenary Vikings. Other traditions have it either on the now-submerged land off the coast of the island of Usedom, or near the town of Wollin on Usedom. During 1934-1939, O. Kunkel and K.A. Wilde made excavations near the latter site and uncovered the ruins of a Viking fort on the <i>Silberberg</i> (Silver Hill) just outside the town. These date from c. <year>A.D.</year> 950 and it it is therefore possible that the fortress was built by Bluetooth to control Wollin, an important Wendish market-town. Bluetooth, to whom is attributed the conversion to Christianity of the Danes, was deposed in 984 by his son Sveinn Tjuguskegg (Sveinn Forkbeard) and driven out to J&oacute;msborg. Sveinn went on to conquer England. </mm> </dd></dl>
