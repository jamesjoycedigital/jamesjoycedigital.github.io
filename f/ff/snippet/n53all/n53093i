But what caught the imagination of poets and romancers even more was the fable of his &ldquo;return.&rdquo; &ldquo;Some men say yet,&rdquo; writes Malory, &ldquo;that King Arthur is not dead, but had by the will of our Lord Jesu into another place. And men say that he shall come again, and he shall win the holy cross. <mark>I will not say it shall not be so</mark>, but rather I will say, here in this world he changed his life.
