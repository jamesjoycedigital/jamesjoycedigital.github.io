Psalm 68 is a triumphal; processional hymn, written to celebrate the transference of the Ark of the Lord from the house of Obed-edom to the New Tabernacle on Mount Zion that David had prepared to receive it. The Psalm is sometimes claimed to portend the advent and divinity of Jesus Christ. It runs: &hellip; Let the Just rejoice in the sight of God; yea, let them exceedingly rejoice &hellip; Thou art gone up on high; thou hast led captivity captive &hellip; His excellency is over Israel &hellip; extol him who rides upon the clouds &hellip; Lo, he doth send out his voice, yea, and that a mighty voice. </mm> </dd></dl>
