It was, in heathen times, of neuter gender and was used almost exclusively in the plural number. This was not because these people thought of the gods as many, but rather it expressed a feeling for the multiform majesty of the divinity. The <i>V&ouml;lusp&aacute;</i> [Song of the Sybil] &mdash; a poem of the Elder Edda written in Iceland in the eleventh century &mdash; writes of the history of the Norse gods and distinguishes a two-fold form of nomenclature: the esoteric influences&mdash;nameless and without attributes &mdash; who ruled the world, and the exoteric and personalised gods. Of the first of these, we find the &lsquo;deciding powers&rsquo; (Old Norse <i>regin</i> or <i>r&ouml;gn</i>) and the &lsquo;decision-making powers&rsquo; (ON <i>b&ouml;nd</i> and <i>h&ouml;pt</i>). [In the singular <i>band</i> and <i>hapt</i>.] Of the more manifested gods, two divine families were identified: the <i>Aesir</i> [singular: <i>&aacute;ss</i>] &mdash; these include Odin, Thor, and Tyr &mdash; and the <i>Vanir</i> [sing.: <i>Vanr</i>] &mdash; these include Njord, Frey (the fertility god) and Freya (Frey&apos;s female counterpart). Fjorgynn [Earth] was the mother of Thor. <br>The etymology of these names is disputed. Grimm suggests that the former is cognate with <i>Aesares</i>, the gods of the Etruscans who formed a circle of implicitly involved powers known as <i>dii consentes</i> and <i>complices</i> &mdash; in exactly the same imagination as the ON <i>b&ouml;nd</i> and <i>h&ouml;pt</i>. Other commentators see the Aesir and Vanir as being the gods of the rulers and of the herders, respectively. <br>ON <i>d&iacute;ar</i> has two senses. The first is a general name for certain of the Aesir; the second for sacrifice-conducting priests or chiefs. <i>J&ouml;tunn</i> [with plural <i>Jotnar</i>] has the meaning of a &lsquo;giant&rsquo;. <i>Vear</i> is a poetic term for the gods in general. </mm> </dd></dl>
