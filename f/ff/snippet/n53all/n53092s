Other traditions have it either on the now-submerged land off the coast of the island of Usedom, or near the town of Wollin on Usedom. During 1934-1939, O. Kunkel and K.A. Wilde made excavations near the latter site and uncovered the ruins of a Viking fort on the <i>Silberberg</i> (Silver Hill) just outside the town. These date from c. <year>A.D.</year> 950 and it it is therefore possible that the fortress was built by Bluetooth to control Wollin, an important Wendish market-town. Bluetooth, to whom is attributed the conversion to Christianity of the Danes, was deposed in 984 by his son Sveinn Tjuguskegg (Sveinn Forkbeard) and driven out to J&oacute;msborg. Sveinn went on to conquer England. </mm> </dd></dl>
