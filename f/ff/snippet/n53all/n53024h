It was his misfortune to fall at last into the hands of one of his enemies, by whom he was thrown into prison, and condemned to be destroyed by serpents. In this situation he solaced himself with rehearsing all the exploits of his life. The poem is divided into twenty nine stanzas, of ten lines each; and every stanza begins with these words, <mark>Pagnavimus Ensibus</mark>, We have fought with our swords. <small> James MacPherson, <a name="JMPO" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#JMPO"><cite title="source">The Poems of Ossian</cite></a> (1806) <font size="-1">THE POEMS OF OSSIAN</font> Book I, 51f</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
