Before the girl arrived an officer called on the future mistress, but was treated with scant courtesy, and, the interview being so unsatisfactory, it was thought advisable that the girl should not go to the place. The girl was met at Liverpool Street Station and taken to the midnight quarters of the Salvation Army, instead of to the situation. <small> Mrs Archibald Mackirdy and W.N.
