I did not know quite what I was going to see, but was invited to inspect the work of some &ldquo;sisters,&rdquo; and I was taken into what was called a &ldquo;Magdalenes&apos; Home.&rdquo; A number of women with close-cropped hair were at work over wash-tubs in a semi-underground place. They had hideous little caps tied partly over their heads, and stiff straight gowns of a very ugly material. They were, in fact, branded; and the &ldquo;saintly sisters&rdquo; went among them with the same sort of air that one would have if compelled to walk among lepers or plague-stricken people. <small> Mrs Archibald Mackirdy and W.N.
