On the journey I explained to my companion the killing power of a Colt <mark>six-shooter</mark>. This was another precautionary measure, to disabuse his mind of any possible idea of having &ldquo;a cheap proposition&rdquo; to face if treachery were in the air. <small> Mrs Archibald Mackirdy and W.N.
