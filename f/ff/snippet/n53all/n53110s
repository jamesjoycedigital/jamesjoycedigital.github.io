According to the picture in Louis Elson&apos;s History of American Music, Mr. Work looked like the two Smith Brothers rolled into one, and his best-known song is <i>Marching through <mark>Georgia</mark></i>. But he also did <i>Kingdom Coming</i>, which was revived not so long ago by Jerome Kern in a magnificent arrangement, and his <i>Grandfather&apos;s Clock</i> has been a household favourite for years and is still to be found in the Rotary Song Book. <small> Sigmund Spaeth, <a name="REAW1" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#REAW1"><cite title="source">Read 'Em and Weep</cite></a> (1935) 64</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
