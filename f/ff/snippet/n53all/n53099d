To combat this, Mih&aacute;ly K&aacute;rolyi set up a government, and a Republic was proclaimed on 16 November 1918. K&aacute;roli was ineffective and he resigned on 20 March 1919 in favour of the Communists and Social Democrats. On the next day, these proclaimed a Soviet Republic under the leadership of <mark>B&eacute;la Kun</mark>, a Communist agent &mdash; a spy &mdash; of Hungro-Jewish origin whom Lenin had entrusted with the mission of &lsquo;Bolshevising&rsquo; Hungary and central Europe. When the Russians&apos; promise to limit the Roumanian incursions failed to materialise and Kun&apos;s so-called internal Red Terror tactics proved intolerable, the regime fell after a mere 133 days. Kun himself bravely fled to Austria. An anti-Communist regime under Admiral Mikl&oacute;s Horthy was subsequently set up, and Horthy was made <mark>Regent</mark>, or provisional Head of State in the absence of the Hapsburg monarch, in March 1920. Horty then instituted the White Terror, in which many thousands of Bolshevik sympathisers were forced to emigrate, were <mark>interned</mark>, or were murdered. Kun for his part became a prominent member of Comintern (the Third Communist International) and spent the rest of his days trying to stir up trouble in Europe. He was executed by Stalin in 1939. </mm> </dd></dl>
