A continuous group of craters stretched along No Man&apos;s Land, separating them from the wily Hun, for half the battalion front&mdash;a group which we will call Outpost. The name is wrong, but it will serve. To the near lips of each crater a sap ran out from the front line, so that merely the great yawning hole lay between the saphead and the corresponding abode of the Germans on the other lip. Each night these sapheads were held by a small group of men armed with Verey lights, bombs, <mark>bowie-knives</mark>, and other impedimenta of destruction; while between the saps the trench was held but lightly&mdash;in some cases, not at all.
