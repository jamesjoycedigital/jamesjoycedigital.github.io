The first screen S is made of a very thin sheet of oxidised aluminium, which is covered with <mark>a coating of caesium</mark>, only one molecule thick. When such a screen is bombarded with primary electrons, it will liberate many more secondary electrons from the surface in the ordinary way, but the number given off at each point can be regulated by the intensity of a ray of light focused at a corresponding point on the reverse side.</p> <small> <a name="PWT25dec37" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#PWT25dec37"><cite title="source">Populary Wireless and Television Times</cite></a> (25 December 1937) 399b</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
