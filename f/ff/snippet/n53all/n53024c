The general belief of the existence of such heroic personages, and the great poet OSSIAN, the son of FINGAL, by whom their exploits were sung, is as universal in the Highlands as the belief of any ancient fact whatsoever. It is recorded in proverbs, which pass through all ranks and conditions of men. <i>Ossian dall</i>, <mark>BLIND OSSIAN</mark>, is a person as well known as strong SAMSON or wise SOLOMON. <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> Ossian, &ldquo;<i>an deigh nam fiann</i>&rdquo; <mark>OSSIAN, the last of his race</mark>, is proverbial, to signify a man who has had the misfortune to survive his kindred. <small> James MacPherson, <a name="JMPO" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#JMPO"><cite title="source">The Poems of Ossian</cite></a> (1806) <font size="-1">A PRELIMINARY DISCOURSE</font> Book I, xivf</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
