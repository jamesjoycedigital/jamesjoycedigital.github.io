When this enterprise failed, the Varagians were recalled. Rurik, a prince of the Rus, a Swedish tribe, and his brothers Sineus and Truvor, were elected as rulers. Rurik settled in Novgorod, Sineus in Beloozero, and Truvor in Izborsk. Two members of Rurik&apos;s retinue, Askold and Dir, sailed down the Dnieper and came upon the small city of Kiev. (Kiev had been built on top of a hill by three brothers, Kiy, Shchek, and Khoriv.) It was here the pair settled and they ruled over it for twenty years or so. Back in Novgorod, Rurik passed away and handed down his ownership of the realm along with the custody of his son Igor to his kinsman Oleg. Oleg, accompanied by a large force, sailed south, and by means of a ruse slew Askold and Dir. With Kiev taken, Oleg made himself prince of the Rus and settled on the city as its capitol.  <br>Note: See also <a name="n50080d" href="n50all.htm#n50080d">N50 (VI.B.37):080(d)</a> </mm> </mm></dd></dl>
