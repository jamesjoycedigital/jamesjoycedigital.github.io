Underlined in black. Ukranian (Ruthenian) forms with Russian and White Russian the East Slavonic group of languages, all of which derive from Old Russian &mdash; the language of the non-ecclesiastical documents of Kiev Rus prior to its destruction by the Tatars in 1240. It differs from Russian in a number of points of morphology and phonology, and in vocabulary following the introduction of Polish loan-words in the 1569-1772 period. </mm> </dd></dl>
