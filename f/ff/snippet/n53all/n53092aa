Not only have we the evidence given above but also the very names &lsquo;Rus&rsquo; and &lsquo;Varangian&rsquo; can be satisfactorily explained only on this theory. The name &lsquo;Rus&rsquo; is the Slavonic, &lsquo;<mark>Rh&ocirc;s</mark>&rsquo; the Greek, and &lsquo;R&ucirc;s&rsquo; the Arabic form of the Finnish name for Sweden, viz. <mark>Ruotsi</mark>. This name was originally derived from Ro&thorn;r or Ro&thorn;in, the name of certain districts of Upland and &Ouml;sterg&ouml;tland, whose inhabitants were known as Rods-karlar or Rods-m&oelig;n. The Finns had early come into relation with the Swedes and they used the name of those people with whom they were in earliest and most intimate contact for the whole Swedish nationality. When these Swedes settled in Russia the Finns applied the same term to the new colonists and the term came to be adopted later into the various Slavonic dialects. We are most familiar with the term &lsquo;Varangian&rsquo; or &lsquo;Variag,&rsquo; to use the Slavonic form, as applied to the famous guard of the Byzantine emperors, which seems to have been formed in the latter half of the 10th century and was largely composed of Norwegian, Icelandic and Swedish recruits. In Russian and Arabic historians on the other hand the term is used rather in an ethnographic or geographic sense <small> Allen Mawer, <a name="AMTV2" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#AMTV2"><cite title="source">The Vikings</cite></a>, (1913) 77</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: The etymology of the term Rus is uncertain. Some, who dispute the Scandinavian influence, claim that it derives from one of the many rivers with names suffixed by <i>ros</i> or <i>rus</i>, or perhaps from a lost Slav tribe, the Rhos. Even the Biblical Rosh, from Ezek. 38.2-3, 39.1, has been advanced. The Normanists &mdash; those who uphold the Scandinavian claim &mdash; derive the word from <i>Ruotsi</i>, the Finnish name for the Swedish coast of Uppland (whence the Rus are supposed to have originated). Ruotsi itself derives from Old Norse <i>rodr</i>, meaning a rowing way. <i>Rodsmenn</i>, meaning men who row, is cognate. To support this view they note that the Finns separated the Slavs from the sea. </mm> </dd></dl>
