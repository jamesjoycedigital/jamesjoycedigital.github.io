Not only have we the evidence given above but also the very names &lsquo;Rus&rsquo; and &lsquo;Varangian&rsquo; can be satisfactorily explained only on this theory. ... The Finns had early come into relation with the Swedes and they used the name of those people with whom they were in earliest and most intimate contact for the whole Swedish nationality. When these Swedes settled in Russia the Finns applied the same term to the new colonists and the term came to be adopted later into the various Slavonic dialects. We are most familiar with the term &lsquo;Varangian&rsquo; or &lsquo;<mark>Variag</mark>,&rsquo; to use the Slavonic form, as applied to the famous guard of the Byzantine emperors, which seems to have been formed in the latter half of the 10th century and was largely composed of Norwegian, Icelandic and Swedish recruits. In Russian and Arabic historians on the other hand the term is used rather in an ethnographic or geographic sense <small> Allen Mawer, <a name="AMTV2" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#AMTV2"><cite title="source">The Vikings</cite></a>, (1913) 77</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: &lsquo;Varangian&rsquo; is held to be derived from the Old Norse word <i>V&aacute;rar</i>, meaning pledge (<i>V&aacute;raring</i> meaning &lsquo;men of the pledge&rsquo;). In Greek sources, it is replaced by the term <i>Barangoi</i>, and in Arabic as <i>Varank</i>. In Russian <i>Variag</i>, meaning an itinerant pedlar, is cognate. In the &lsquo;Tale of Bygone Days&rsquo;, the term is used to denote all those &lsquo;from beyond the sea&rsquo;, whereas the Angles, the Normans, the Gotlanders, and the Rus are specified as such. Neither the Franks nor the Saxons are cited. These latter tribes, nevertheless, were probably represented in the Varangian Guard, a corps of North European mercenaries in the service of the Byzantine emperors from about <year>A.D.</year> 1000.</mm> </dd></dl>
