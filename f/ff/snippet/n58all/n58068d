These ideas ruled for a very long time men&apos;s conceptions of the construction of the universe. <small> Camille Flammarion, <a name="CFPA" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#CFPA"><cite title="source">Popular Astronomy</cite></a> (1907) 6</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: Vulcan, the son of Juno alone (Hesiod, Theog. 397), as Phurnutus. Jupiter being angry with him, he hurled him into heaven, and he was falling from morning till sunset, when he lighted on the island of Lamnos but was lamed. He was Jupiter&apos;s founder or smith, and with his servants the Cyclopes on his anvil forged Jupiter&apos;s lightning bolts; whence he is also called Mulciber. Vulcan most anciently represented the uncontrollable god of fire and of such of its expressions as the volcano. </mm> </dd></dl>
