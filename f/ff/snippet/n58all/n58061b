There is no such thing as a naturally intransitive verb. The passive form is evidently a correlative sentence, which turns about and makes the object into a subject. That the object is not in itself passive, but contributes some positive force of its own to the action, is in harmony both with scientific law and with ordinary experience. The English passive voice with &ldquo;is&rdquo; seemed at first an obstacle to this hypothesis, but one suspected that the true form was a generalized transitive verb meaning something like &ldquo;re-ceive,&rdquo; which had degenerated into an auxiliary. It was a delight to find this the case in Chinese. <small> Ernest Fenollosa, &ldquo;The Chinese Written Character as a Medium for Poetry&rdquo;, in <a name="EFCW" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#EFCW"><cite title="source">Instigations of Ezra Pound</cite></a> (1920) 368f</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
