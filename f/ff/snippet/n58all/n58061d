We do not say a tree &ldquo;greens itself,&rdquo; but &ldquo;the tree is green;&rdquo; not that &ldquo;monkeys bring forth live young,&rdquo; but, that &ldquo;the monkey is a mammal.&rdquo; This is an ultimate weakness of language. It has come from generalizing all intransitive words into one. As &ldquo;live,&rdquo; &ldquo;see,&rdquo; &ldquo;walk,&rdquo; &ldquo;breathe,&rdquo; are generalized into states by dropping their objects, so these weak verbs are in turn reduced to the abstractest state of all, namely, bare existence. <small> Ernest Fenollosa, &ldquo;The Chinese Written Character as a Medium for Poetry&rdquo;, in <a name="EFCW" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#EFCW"><cite title="source">Instigations of Ezra Pound</cite></a> (1920) 369</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
