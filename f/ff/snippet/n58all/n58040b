Finn and the fian and King Cormac are invited to Rath Grainne. After a year&apos;s feasting, Finn and Diarmuid find themselves standing atop a nearby hill awaiting the arrival of the wild boar of Benn Gulban. Finn tells the story of the boar: Crocnuit the daughter of Cyrrac of Liffe became pregnant by Donn O&apos;Donncuda, and she bore a beautiful man-child, and Angus of the Brug took that boy, Diarmuid, to foster him. Crocnuit later bore another son to the steward Roc mac Dicain, a commoner, and Donn refused to foster that son. Angus took him instead. After that, Donn and Finn went to the house of Angus for a night&apos;s entertainment, and Donn because incensed because Angus showed as much fondness for the steward&apos;s son as for Diarmuid. During an altercation involving some staghounds, the son of the steward went between Donn&apos;s knees, and]</font> he gave the child a mighty, powerful, <mark>strong squeeze of his two knees, so that he slew him</mark> on the spot. <font color="green">[The steward struck his fallen son with a magic wand]</font> so that he made of him a cropped green pig, having neither ears nor tail, and he said, &ldquo;I conjure thee that thou have the same length of life as Diarmuid O&apos;Duibne, and that it be by thee that he shall fall at last&rdquo;. <small> Tom Peete Cross and Clark Harris Slover, <a name="AIT2" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#AIT2"><cite title="source">Ancient Irish Tales</cite></a> ([Nov. 1936]) 409ff</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
