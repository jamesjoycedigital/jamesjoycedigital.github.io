These ideas ruled for a very long time men&apos;s conceptions of the construction of the universe. <small> Camille Flammarion, <a name="CFPA" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#CFPA"><cite title="source">Popular Astronomy</cite></a> (1907) 6</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: See unit <a name="n58069f" href="n58all.htm#n58069f">N58 (VI.B.30):069(f)</a> below. </mm> </dd></dl>
