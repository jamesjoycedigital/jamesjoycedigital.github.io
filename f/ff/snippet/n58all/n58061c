It requires great effort to annihilate. Therefore we should suspect that, if we could follow back the history of all negative particles, we should find that they also are sprung from transitive verbs. It is too late to demonstrate such derivations in the Aryan languages, the clue has been lost, but in Chinese we can still watch positive verbal conceptions passing over into so-called negatives. Thus in Chinese the sign meaning <mark>&ldquo;to be lost in the forest&rdquo; relates to a state of non-existence</mark>. English &ldquo;not&rdquo; = the Sanskrit <i>na</i>, which may come from the root <i>na</i>, to be lost, to perish. <small> Ernest Fenollosa, &ldquo;The Chinese Written Character as a Medium for Poetry&rdquo;, in <a name="EFCW" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#EFCW"><cite title="source">Instigations of Ezra Pound</cite></a> (1920) 369</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
