Some represented our abode under the form of a <mark>circular table borne upon twelve columns</mark>, others under the form of a <mark>dome placed on the backs of four bronze elephants</mark>; but the idea of supporting the earth on mountains, elephants, or columns would, of course, require to rest on some lower foundation. As, moreover, the sky seems to turn round us in one piece, the subterfuges invented in order to preserve for the earth something of its original stability at last disappeared by the force of circumstances, and they were obliged to admit that <i>the earth is isolated in all its parts</i>. <small> Camille Flammarion, <a name="CFPA" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#CFPA"><cite title="source">Popular Astronomy</cite></a> (1907) 6</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
