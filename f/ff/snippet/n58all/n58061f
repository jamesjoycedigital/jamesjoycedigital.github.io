Almost all the Sanskrit roots, which seem to underlie European languages, are primitive verbs, which express characteristic actions of visible nature. The verb must be the primary fact of nature, since motion and change are all that we can recognize in her. In the primitive transitive sentence, such as &ldquo;Farmer pounds rice,&rdquo; the agent and the object are nouns only in so far as they limit a unit of action. &ldquo;Farmer&rdquo; and &ldquo;rice&rdquo; are mere hard terms which define the extremes of the pounding. But in themselves, apart from this sentence-function, they are naturally verbs. The farmer is one who tills the ground, and the rice is a plant which grows in a special way. This is indicated in the Chinese characters. And this probably exemplifies the ordinary derivation of nouns from verbs. In all languages, Chinese included, <mark>a noun is originally &ldquo;that which does something,&rdquo; that which performs the verbal action</mark>. <small> Ernest Fenollosa, &ldquo;The Chinese Written Character as a Medium for Poetry&rdquo;, in <a name="EFCW" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#EFCW"><cite title="source">Instigations of Ezra Pound</cite></a> (1920) 373</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
