Pointing toward nouns as a limit they bring force to bear upon them. That is to say, they are naturally verbs, of generalized or condensed use. In Aryan languages it is often difficult to trace the verbal origins of simple prepositions. Only in &ldquo;<i>off</i>&rdquo; do we see a fragment of the thought &ldquo;to throw off.&rdquo; In Chinese the preposition is frankly a verb, specially used in a generalized sense. These verbs <font color="green">[374]</font> are often used in their specially verbal sense, and it greatly weakens an English translation if they are systematically rendered by colorless prepositions. <p>Thus in Chinese: <mark>By = to cause; to = to fall toward; in = to remain, to dwell; from = to follow</mark>; and so on.</p> <small> Ernest Fenollosa, &ldquo;The Chinese Written Character as a Medium for Poetry&rdquo;, in <a name="EFCW" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#EFCW"><cite title="source">Instigations of Ezra Pound</cite></a> (1920) 374f</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: Transferred to <a name="n58072a" href="n58all.htm#n58072a">N58 (VI.B.30):072(a)</a>, <a name="n58072b" href="n58all.htm#n58072b">N58 (VI.B.30):072(b)</a>, <a name="n58072c" href="n58all.htm#n58072c">N58 (VI.B.30):072(c)</a>, <a name="n58072d" href="n58all.htm#n58072d">N58 (VI.B.30):072(d)</a>. </mm> </dd></dl>
