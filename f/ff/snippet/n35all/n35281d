Two species of base money called <i>pollards</i> and <i>crocards</i> were forbidden by proclamation. Holingshed explains these coins to be a white money, artificially composed by a mixture of silver, copper and sulphur, and that a penny of them were worth no more than a halfpenny. The <i>crocard</i> might have been perhaps of such a composition; but the <i>pollard</i> seems to have been a legal money clipped, and reduced by that means to less than the value. <small> J.
