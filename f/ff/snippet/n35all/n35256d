By some he was called a quack; by others he was supposed to hold converse with the devil; but be that as it may, many thronged to ask advice from him. Andrew Crumpsty he regarded with wrath as a pretender to knowledge of a divine science, who really &ldquo;knew no more of genuine astrology than one of his brethren which are usually plac&apos;t in perriwig-makers&apos; windows,&rdquo; and Crumpsty was moreover &ldquo;a mathemaggoty monster.&rdquo; <small> J.
