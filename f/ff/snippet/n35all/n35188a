At this time the genius of Carthage is incarnate in Hannibal; his campaigns in Spain, Italy and Africa have won the admiration of military experts of all periods. <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> The battles of the Ticinus, <mark>Trebia</mark> and Trasimene Lake are but stages in the wonderful progress which culminated in the battle of Cannae (Auugust 2, 216). The road to Rome was now open to him, but he did not profit by his advantage, while the Carthaginian senate, to its shame, withheld all further support. His brother Hasdrubal with his relieving army was defeated at the Metaurus in 207; the Romans recovered their hold in Spain, and, seeing that Hannibal was unable to move in Italy, carried the war back to Africa. Hearing that Scipio had taken Utica (203) and defeated Hasdrubal and Syphax, king of Numidia, Hannibal returned from Italy, but with a hastily levied army was defeated at Zama (October 19, 202). The subsequent peace was disastrous to Carthage, which lost its fleet and all save its African possessions. <small> &ldquo;CARTHAGET&rdquo; <a name="EBCE" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#EBCE"><cite title="source">Encyclopaedia Britannica</cite></a>, 11th edit.
