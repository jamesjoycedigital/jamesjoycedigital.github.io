This practice seems to be hinted at by an old proverb, though not applied to this place, namely, <i>he struck at Tib and down fell Tom</i>. We find these buildings called Tib and Tom, metioned in the will of Richard, the first Earl of Cork, as mortgaged to him by Theodore, Lord Dockwra, and the Lady Anne his mother, for three hundred pounds, and rented from the mortgagee by Sir Philip Percival, at twenty-four pounds per annum. <small> J.
