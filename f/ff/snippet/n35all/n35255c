May we never want a Williamite to kick a Jacobite, or a rope for the Bishop of Cork. And he that won&apos;t drink this, whether he be priest, bishop, deacon, bellows-blower, or grave-digger, may a north wind blow him to the south, and a west wind blow him to the east. May Cerberus make a meal of him, and Pluto a snuff-box of his skull. Amen.&rdquo; <small> J.
