The door to this stair (called the door of mercy&mdash; Bab el-Rahma) was plated with silver by the caliph Motawakkil. Here, in the time of Ibn Jubair, the <i>Maquam</i> or standing stone of Abraham was usually placed for better security. <small> &ldquo;MECCA&rdquo; <a name="EBMC" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#EBMC"><cite title="source">Encyclopaedia Britannica</cite></a>, 11th edit.
