(15 stadia) to the west of the limits of the old town. <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> We have two indications of the course of these walls on the 7th hill. One is found in the name Isa Kapusi (the Gate of Jesus) attached to a mosque, formerly a Christian church, situated above the quarter of Psamatia. It perpetuates the memory of the beautiful gateway which formed the triumphal entrance into the city of Constantine. <small> &ldquo;CONSTANTINOPLE&rdquo; <cite a>Encyclopaedia Britannica</cite></a>, 11th edit.
