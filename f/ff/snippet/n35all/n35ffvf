The last clause implies the establishment of a definite ratio in value between the two metals (e.g. I oz. of gold =15 2 oz. of silver) so that the title &ldquo;rated bimetallism&rdquo; may be given to it, in contradistinction to the &ldquo;unrated bimetallism&rdquo; which exists wherever two metals circulate together, but have their relative values determined, not by law, but by &ldquo;the higgling of the market.&rdquo; </mm> </dd></dl>
