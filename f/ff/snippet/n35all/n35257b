Such indeed was its force that women continually went into hysterics over Ophelia&apos;s madness or Cordelia&apos;s wrongs, and shrieked at the combat of Hamlet or the death of Richard. The summer, as has already been remarked, being unusually warm, a fever broke out in the town, which was attributed to the heat of Smock Alley Theatre and the excitement of the performances on emotional people. It carried off vast numbers, and was long referred to as the Garrick fever. <small> J.
