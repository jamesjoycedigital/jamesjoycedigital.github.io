But private revenge was the motive to this undertaking, for the citizens had long before, under colour of friendship, invited Dermod&apos;s father to an entertainment, and getting him into their power, under pretence of some former injuries, basely murdered him, and contemptuously buried his body in a dunghill with a dog; from which time they cast off their allegiance to their prince, and continued in a state of rebellion under their own petty king, Asculph Mac-Torcall. <small> J.
