The word signifies a wanton woman; and possibly the place took its name from being the resort of such. If it be not called Cock-hill at this day, extending from Michael&apos;s-lane to the upper end of Wine-tavern-street, it has eluded our searches. <small> J. Warburton, Rev. J. Whitelaw, and Rev. R.
