Here the semi-mythical prince Krok, his daughter Libusa, and her husband the peasant Premysl are stated to have resided. To Libusa is attributed also the foundation of a settlement on the opposite bank of the Vltava on the Hradcany hill. <small> &ldquo;PRAGUE&rdquo; <a name="EBPG" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#EBPG"><cite title="source">Encyclopaedia Britannica</cite></a>, 11th edit.
