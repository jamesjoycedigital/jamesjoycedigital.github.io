Rauma / (salmo) </blockquote> <dd class="well"><mm class="note">Note: ROMSDAL, the valley of the river <mark>Rauma</mark>, in Norway. The Rauma is a torrent descending from Lake Lesjekogen to the Romsdal Fjord on the west coast (62&deg; 30' N.). The nearest port is Molde, from which steamers run to Veblungsnaes (30 m.) at the foot of the valley. A good road traverses the valley, which is one of the finest in southern Norway, flanked by steep mountains terminating in abrupt peaks - Vengetinder (5960 ft.), Romsdalshorn (5105), Troldtinder (&ldquo;witch-peaks,&rdquo; 60ro) and others. Several waterfalls are seen, such as the Mongefos, the Vaermofos, falling nearly 1000 ft., and the Slettafos. </mm> </dd></dl>
