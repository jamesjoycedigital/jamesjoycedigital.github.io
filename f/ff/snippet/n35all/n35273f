The Irish called it <mark><i>Drom-Choll-Coil</i></mark>, i.e. <i>the brow of a hazel-wood</i>, from an abundance of those trees growing about it. But this name must have prevailed before, (by the great increase of buildings, and confluence of inhabitants) it merited the character of a city. <small> J. Warburton, Rev. J. Whitelaw, and Rev. R.
