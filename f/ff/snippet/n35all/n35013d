It is performed thus: A man who is to represent king Arthur, ridiculously dressed, having a large wig made out of oakum, or of some old swabs, is seated on the side, or over a large vessel of water. Every person in his turn is to be ceremoniously introduced to him, and to pour a bucket of water over him, crying, Hail, king Arthur! If <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> the person introduced laughs or smiles <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> he changes places with, and then becomes, king Arthur, till relieved by some brother tar, who has as little command over his muscles as himself. <small> Captain Francis Grose, <a name="FGCD" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#FGCD"><cite title="source">A Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue</cite></a> (1785) ART-AUT</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
