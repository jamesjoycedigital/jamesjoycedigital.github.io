In his reign came the deluge or universal flood, and he and his wife got into a small ship, which was carried to Mount Parnassus and there stayed, and there the dry masses first appeared after the waters abated. He consulted with the oracle of Themis how mankind might be repaired, and was answered: if he cast his grandmother&apos;s bones behind his back; whereupon he and his wife cast bones over their shoulders, and they became men and women.
