A great famine afflicted all Ireland in this and the foregoing year, and the city of Dublin suffered miserably. But the people in their distress met with an unexpected and providential relief; for about the 24th of June, a prodigious number of large sea fish, called Turlehydes, were brought into the bay of Dublin, and cast on shore at the mouth of the river Dodder. They were from thirty to forty feet long, and so bulky, that two tall men, placed one on each side of the fish, could not see one another. The lord justice, Sir Anthony Lucy, with his servants, and many of the citizens of Dublin, killed above two hundred of them, and gave leave to the poor to carry them away at their pleasure. <small> J.
