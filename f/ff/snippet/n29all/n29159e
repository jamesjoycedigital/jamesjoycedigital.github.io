A heavy rainfall will cause streams to run in winter from the saturated soil. These are the winter bournes that have given name to several settlements upon Salisbury Plain, such as Winterbourne Gunning. The "bourne" may also be a permanent "burn," but the word is usually applied to an intermittent stream. </mm> </dd></dl>
