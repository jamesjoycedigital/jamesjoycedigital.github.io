This is evident from the actual composition of the book ... Mahomet issued his revelations in fly-leaves of greater or lesser extent. A single piece of this kind was called either, like the entire collection, kor&apos;an, i.e. "recitation," "reading," or, better still, is the equivalent of Aramaic <i>geryana</i> "lectionary"; or <i>kitab</i>, "writing"; or <mark>sura</mark>, which is perhaps the late-Hebrew shura, and means literally "series." </mm> </dd></dl>
