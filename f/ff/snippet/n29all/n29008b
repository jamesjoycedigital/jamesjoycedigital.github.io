It is formed by the confluence of the Mali and N&apos;mai rivers (usually called Mali-kha and N&apos;mai-kha, the kha being the Kachin word for river) in 25&deg; 45' N. The N&apos;mai is the eastern branch. The definite position of its source is still uncertain, and it seems to be made up of a number of considerable streams, all rising within a short distance of each other in about 28&deg; 30' N. It is shown on some maps as the <mark>Lu</mark> river of Tibet; but it is now quite certain that the Tibetan Lu river is the <mark>Salween</mark>, and that the N&apos;mai has its source or sources near the southern boundary of Tibet, to the north-east or east of the source of the Mali. </mm> </dd></dl>
