The first settlers consisted principally of retired French officers as well as privates, who had served in the army of King William. &hellip; When they first came into the neighbourhood, the town of Portarlington could scarcely be said to exist. The village of <mark>Cootletoodra</mark>, as it was formerly called, was only a collection of miserable huts unfit for human residence; and until the dwellings designed for the reception of the exiles by the Earl of Galway could be built, they resided in the adjoining villages of Doolough, Monasterevin, Cloneygown, and the ancient village of Lea. <small> Samuel Smiles, <a name="SSHU" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#SSHU"><cite title="source">The Huguenots</cite></a> (1876) [chap. xvii&mdash;Huguenot Settlements in Ireland] 311f</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
