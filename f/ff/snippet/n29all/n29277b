As to &ldquo;<mark>some <i>x</i> is <i>z</i></mark>&rdquo;, they are discreetly silent; and the living authorities I have appealed to, including our Professor of Logic, take opposite sides! Some say &hellip; if any <i>x</i>s <i>did</i> exist, some <i>must</i> be <i>z</i>&mdash;others &hellip; that some <i>might</i> be <i>z</i>, and they would go on asserting, with perfect belief in their truthfulness, &ldquo;some boots are made of brass,&rdquo; even if they had all the boots in the world before them, and knew that <i>none</i> were so made, merely because there is no inherent impossibility in making boots of brass! <mark>Isn&apos;t it bewildering?</mark>&rsquo; <small> Stuart Dodgson Collingwood, <a name="SDCL" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#SDCL"><cite title="source">The Life and Letters of Lewis Carroll</cite></a> ([1912]) 201</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
