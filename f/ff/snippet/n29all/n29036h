In pagan times the Irish had royal cemeteries in various parts of the country for the interment of kings or chiefs and their families, for example, Brugh, Croghan and Taillltenn. The cemetery of <mark>Brugh</mark>, the burial place of the Dedannans, lies on the northern bank of the Boyne, and consists of about twenty barrows (burial-miounds) of various sizes, containing chambers or artificial caves, with shallow saucer-shaped sarcophagi. The three principal mounds are those of New Grange, <mark>Knowth and Dowth</mark>, which are the largest sepulchral mounds in Ireland. There are numerous pillar-stones: and many of the great stones forming the sides and roofs of the caves are carved with curious ornamental designs of various patterns - circles, spirals, lozenges, and soforth. </mm> </dd></dl>
