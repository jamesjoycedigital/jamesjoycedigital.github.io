The dwellings of the strangers were distinguished for their neatness and comfort. Their farms and gardens were patterns of tidiness and good management. They introduced new fruit-trees from abroad; among others the black Italian walnut and the jargonelle pear,&mdash;speciments of which still flourish at Portarlington in vigorous old age. The planter of these trees fought at the Boyne as an ensign in the regiment of La Melonniere. The immigrants also introduced the &ldquo;espalier&rdquo; with success; and their fruit of all kinds became widely celebrarted. Another favourite branch of cultivation was flowers, of which they imported many new sorts; <mark>while their vegetables were unmatched in Ireland</mark>. <small> Samuel Smiles, <a name="SSHU" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#SSHU"><cite title="source">The Huguenots</cite></a> (1876) [chap. xvii&mdash;<mark>Huguenot</mark> Settlements in Ireland] 313</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
