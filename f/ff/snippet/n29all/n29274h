Rossetti&apos;s pictures in the Burlington Gallery. He was especially struck with &ldquo;Found,&rdquo; which he thus describes:&mdash; &ldquo;A <mark>picture of a man finding</mark>, in the streets of London, <mark>a girl he had loved years before</mark> in the days of her innocence. She is huddled up against the wall, dressed in gaudy colours, and trying to turn away her agonised face, while he, holding her wrists, is looking down with an expression of pain and pity, condemnation and love, which is one of the most marvelous things I have ever seen done in painting. <small> Stuart Dodgson Collingwood, <a name="SDCL" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#SDCL"><cite title="source">The Life and Letters of Lewis Carroll</cite></a> ([1912]) 186-7</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
