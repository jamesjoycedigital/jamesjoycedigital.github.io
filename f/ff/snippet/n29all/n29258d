Since Bel signifies the "lord" or "master" par excellence, it is, therefore, a title rather than a genuine name, and must have been given to a deity who had acquired a position at the head of a pantheon. MARDUK (Bibl. Merodach 2), the name of the patron deity of the city of Babylon, who, when Babylon permanently became the political centre of the united states of the Euphrates valley under Khammurabi (c. 2250 <year>B.C.</year>), rose to the position of the head of the Babylonian pantheon. </mm> </dd></dl>
