He studied at Franeker, entered the military service in the West Indies about 1625, and was director of the West India Company&apos;s colony of Curacao from 1634 to 1644. In April 1644 he attacked the Portuguese island of Saint Martin and was wounded; he had to return to Holland, and there one of his legs was amputated. Thereafter he wore a wooden leg ornamented with silver bands. In May 1645 he was selected by the West India Company to supersede William Kieft as director of New Netherland. He arrived in New Amsterdam (later New York) in May 1647, and was received with great enthusiasm. </mm> </dd></dl>
