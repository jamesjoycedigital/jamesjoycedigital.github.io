The difficulty of answering this apparently simple question has cast a gloom over many a pleasant party. <small> Stuart Dodgson Collingwood, <a name="SDCL" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#SDCL"><cite title="source">The Life and Letters of Lewis Carroll</cite></a> ([1912]) 78</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
