He suggested &ldquo;Dares&rdquo; (the first syllable of his birthplace) to Edmund Yates, but, as this did not meet with his editor&apos;s approval, he wrote again, giving a choice of four names, (1) Edgar Cuthwellis, (2) Edgar U.C. Westhall, (3) Louis Carroll, and (4) Lewis Carroll. The first two were formed from the letters of his two Christian names, <mark>Charles Lutwidge</mark>; the others are merely variant forms of those names&mdash;Lewis = Ludovicus = Lutwidge; Carroll = Carolus = Charles. Mr. Yates chose the last, and thenceforward it became Mr. Dodgson&apos;s ordinary <i>nom de plume</i>. <small> Stuart Dodgson Collingwood, <a name="SDCL" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#SDCL"><cite title="source">The Life and Letters of Lewis Carroll</cite></a> ([1912]) 66</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: See also Joyce&apos;s letter to Harriet Weaver of <a name="28Mar1928" href="..\flett\ff28lett.htm#28Mar1928">28 March</a> 1928. </mm> </dd></dl>
