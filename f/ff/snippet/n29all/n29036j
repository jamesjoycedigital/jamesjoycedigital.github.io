The cemetery of Brugh, the burial place of the Dedannans, lies on the northern bank of the Boyne, and consists of about twenty barrows (burial-miounds) of various sizes, containing <mark>chambers</mark> or artificial caves, with shallow saucer-shaped sarcophagi. The three principal mounds are those of New Grange, Knowth and Dowth, which are the largest sepulchral mounds in Ireland. There are numerous <mark>pillar-stones</mark>: and many of the great stones forming the sides and roofs of the caves are carved with curious ornamental designs of various patterns - circles, spirals, lozenges, and soforth.</mm> </dd></dl>
