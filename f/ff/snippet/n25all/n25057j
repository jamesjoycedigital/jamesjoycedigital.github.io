Nessan</blockquote> <dd class="well"> <blockquote class="sources">The good <mark>S. Nessan</mark> of Ireland&apos;s Eye, while engaged on his task of <mark>illuminating</mark> the Gospel of Howth, was so plagued by this Puck that, in a burst of anger, he flung the sacred manuscript at his tormentor. The missile struck the irreverent goblin with such force that he was transfixed against the rock, where he remains to this day, &ldquo;to point a moral and adorn a tale.&rdquo; He is still vainly struggling to free himself, and hence his face appears turned upwards and contorted with pain and terror. <small> D.A. Chart, <a name="DACD1" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#DACD1"><cite title="source">The Story of Dublin</cite></a> (1907) 347</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: Saint Nessan founded an abbey on Ireland&apos;s Eye in the year 570. All that remains are the ruins of a church appertaining. The saint was long respected by the people of Howth for his extreme piety and it is recorded of him, in Colgan&apos;s <cite>Acta Sanctorum</cite>, that he was assailed while reading a holy book, <cite>The Garland of Howth</cite>, by an evil spirit that swelled to a terrifying size. Undeterred, Nessan struck the demon on the forehead with such force as sent him headlong into the cliff of Howth opposite, lodging him into a fissure&mdash;now known as Puck&apos;s Rock&mdash;from which he is to this day attempting to extricate himself.  <br>Raphael transcription: <a name="c14031l" href="c14all.htm#c14031l">VI.C.14:031(l)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
