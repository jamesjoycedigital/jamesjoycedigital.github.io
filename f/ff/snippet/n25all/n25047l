There is no such word as &lsquo;Dane&rsquo; in the Irish language. The Scandinavian rovers that we call Danes were called by the ancient Irish either &lsquo;black strangers&rsquo; or &lsquo;white strangers&rsquo; and strange to say, at the battle of Clontarf, they are called &lsquo;green strangers,&rsquo; but never Danes.
