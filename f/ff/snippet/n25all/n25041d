Here the choice of the youngest seems not unnatural: there being no inheritance to transmit, the children are sent into the world as they come of age; the youngest is the one most likely to be found at the hearth when the father dies. <small> Sir James Frazer, <a name="FLOT2" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#FLOT2"><cite title="source">Folk-Lore in the Old Testament</cite></a> (1923) 176</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c14021d" href="c14all.htm#c14021d">VI.C.14:021(d)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
