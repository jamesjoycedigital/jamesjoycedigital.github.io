Following military success in India, during the Napoleonic Wars he released Spain from French occupation and fought Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. After the wars, he became less successfully involved in politics as opposition leader, cabinet minister, and Prime Minster from 1828 until 1830.
