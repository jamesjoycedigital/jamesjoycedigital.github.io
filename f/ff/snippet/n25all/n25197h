By the end of the day, the French had suffered 7,000 losses and 18,000 were wounded. The Anglo-Allied toll was 3,500 dead and 11,500 wounded, with 1,300 Prussian dead and nearly 6,000 wounded. The defeat marked the end of Napoleon&apos;s military career, and the Lion&apos;s Mound, an artificial mound on the battlefield site, was built by 1826 to commemorate this key moment in history.  <br>Raphael transcription: <a name="c14135l" href="c14all.htm#c14135l">VI.C.14:135(l)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
