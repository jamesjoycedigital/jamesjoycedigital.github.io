Returning on a certain time from England, where she had paid a visit to the Queen, she landed at Howth, and proceeded to the castle. It was the hour of dinner, and the gates were shut. Shocked at an exclusion so repugnant to her notion of Irish hospitality, she immediately proceeded to the shore, where the young lord was at nurse, and seizing the child, she embarked with him, and sailed to Connaught, where her own castle stood. After some time, however, she returned the child, with the express stipulation that the gates should be always thrown open when the family went to dinner, a practice which is observed to this day.  <br>Raphael transcription: <a name="c14017f" href="c14all.htm#c14017f">VI.C.14:017(f)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
