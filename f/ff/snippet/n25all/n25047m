There is no such word as &lsquo;Dane&rsquo; in the Irish language. The Scandinavian rovers that we call Danes were called by the ancient Irish either &lsquo;black strangers&rsquo; or &lsquo;white strangers&rsquo; and strange to say, at the battle of Clontarf, they are called &lsquo;green strangers,&rsquo; but never Danes. It is the Danann forts that we have corrupted into &lsquo;Danes&rsquo; Forts. <small> J. F. M.

The graceful and mystical <i>Tuatha D&eacute; Dana</i>, De Danaans, or the People of Danu, whose hair undulated and moved as if alive, were an ancient people of Ireland. They became the shee, or fairies, after their defeat by the barbaric Fomorians.</mm> </dd></dl>
