The festival was (most probably) originally an Astarte-Tammuz festival, it would be surprising did it not begin, as did all other such festivals, with a period of fasting and mourning for the dead and soon-to-be-revived god. Of actual mourning rites only meager traces remain. But there is abundant evidence of the ceremony of fasting as preparatory, or introductory, to the celebration of the Massoth-festival.  <br>Raphael transcription: <a name="c14127c" href="c14all.htm#c14127c">VI.C.14:127(c)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
