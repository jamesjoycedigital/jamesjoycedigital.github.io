By tradition, on the first dasy of August, the first sheaves of grain were cut by the farmer, and by nightfall his wife had made the first loaves of bread of the season. The word Lammas derives from the Old English phrase <i>hlaf-maesse</i>, which translates to &lsquo;loaf mass&rsquo;.  <br>Raphael transcription: <a name="c14041n" href="c14all.htm#c14041n">VI.C.14:041(n)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
