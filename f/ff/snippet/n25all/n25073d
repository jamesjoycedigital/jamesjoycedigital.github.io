He was one of the original 18 Marshals of the Empire created by Napoleon. He was known as <i>Le Rougeaud</i> (&ldquo;the ruddy&rdquo;) by his men and nicknamed &ldquo;<i>le Brave des Braves</i>&rdquo; (the bravest of the brave) by Napoleon. During the battle of Waterloo, he had five horses killed under him; and at the end of the day, he led one of the last infantry charges. After Napoleon&apos;s defeat, he was arrested and duly duly condemned, and on 7 December, 1815, he was executed by firing squad in Paris near the Luxembourg Garden. He refused to wear a blindfold and was allowed the right to give the order to fire. </mm> </dd></dl>
