A new candle is blessed and lit every year at Easter, and is used throughout the Paschal season and afterwards throughout the year on such special occasions as baptisms and funerals. The term &lsquo;Paschal&rsquo; comes from the Latin word <i>Pascha</i>, which came from the Hebrew word <i>Pesach</i> (Passover) and relates to the Paschal mystery of salvation. It is sometimes referred to as the Easter candle or the Christ candle.  <br>Raphael transcription: <a name="c13273l" href="c13all.htm#c13273l">VI.C.13:273(l)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
