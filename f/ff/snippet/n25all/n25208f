It was, in heathen times, of neuter gender and was used almost exclusively in the plural number. This was not because these people thought of the gods as many, but rather it expressed a feeling for the multiform majesty of the divinity.

Of the first of these, we find the &lsquo;deciding powers&rsquo; (Old Norse <i>regin</i> or <i>r&ouml;gn</i>) and the &lsquo;decision-making powers&rsquo; (ON <i>b&ouml;nd</i> and <i>h&ouml;pt</i>).  <br>Raphael transcription: <a name="c14145c" href="c14all.htm#c14145c">VI.C.14:145(c)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
