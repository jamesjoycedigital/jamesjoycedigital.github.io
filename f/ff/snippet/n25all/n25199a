In fact these three peoples, with certain less known tribes in Siberia, are classed together by some ethnologists as the Hyperborean Race. The word Samoyedes signifies &ldquo;swampdwellers,&rdquo; referring to the fact of this tribe inhabiting the vast mossy plains of Northern Russia and Siberia. <small> Frank Vincent, <a name="FVNLF" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#FVNLF"><cite title="source">Norsk, Lapp, and Finn</cite></a> (1881) 127</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: The <i>Samoyedes</i> are a nomadic tribe who wander with their reindeer over the treeless plains which border on the White and Kara seas on either side of the Urals. In culture and habits they closely resemble the Finno-Ugaric tribes, to which they probably properly belong. The Finns (the Fenni of Tacitus and <i>Finnoi</i> of Ptolemy) were the &ldquo;people of the swamps or fens&rdquo;, or <i>Suomi</i>.  <br>Raphael transcription: <a name="c14137a" href="c14all.htm#c14137a">VI.C.14:137(a)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
