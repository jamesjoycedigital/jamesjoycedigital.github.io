I had hardly mentioned this to a brother officer when two guns <mark>unlimbered</mark> within seventy paces of us, and, by their first discharge of grape, blew seven men into the centre of the square. They immediately reloaded, and kept up a constant and destructive fire. It was noble to see our fellows fill up the gaps after every discharge. <small> Edward Creasy, <a name="ECFD" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#ECFD"><cite title="source">The Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World</cite></a> (1915) 429</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: To unlimber: to detach (a canon) from its limber so that it can be used.  <br>Raphael transcription: <a name="c14043g" href="c14all.htm#c14043g">VI.C.14:043(g)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
