On the Continent the practice survived the Roman occupation and the Teutonic conquest, which survival attests the extraordinary vitality of Celtic tradition. In the Bavarian highlands they are known as sonnen-wend-feuer (solstice fires), and a <mark>capitular</mark> of Charlemagne condemns them as a remnant of paganism. <small> J. F. M.
