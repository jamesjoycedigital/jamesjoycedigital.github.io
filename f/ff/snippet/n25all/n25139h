It is a great day when the dead bear is brought back to the village, and one usually celebrated by a triumphal procession, merry-making, and a grand feast, followed by much singing of the national songs, handed down from father to son, and thrilling tales of wondrous acts of daring at bear-hunts, for, as we have seen, in the Kalevala the bear is a great subject for the poet&apos;s verse. <small> Mrs Alec Tweedie, <a name="TTFC" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#TTFC"><cite title="source">Through Finland in Carts</cite></a> (1914) 189-90</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c14089a" href="c14all.htm#c14089a">VI.C.14:089(a)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
