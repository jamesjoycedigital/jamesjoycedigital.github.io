He does, indeed, stand above his knights by virtue of his royal dignity,&mdash;he is still &ldquo;King Arthur&rdquo; and the head of a great Court. But our interest in his own personality diminishes with the increasing accumulation of exploits attributed to his knightly retinue. The glory of the king is dimmed by the general brilliance of his Court. It is as though the Round Table, originally founded to put <mark>an end to all claims of precedence</mark> among his knights, had had the result of bringing Arthur himself into the unvalued &ldquo;file.&rdquo; Knightly heroes, of whom little, or nothing, had been heard before, enter the Arthurian circle, and perform feats which interest us far more than anything done by the king. <small> W.
