Legend has it, it was used by Jacob as a pillow when he dreamed of a ladder reaching to heaven, before being brought to Scotland by way of Egypt, Spain and Ireland. It was used for centuries in the coronation ceremonies of Scottish monarchs. King Edward I of England seized the stone from Scotland&apos;s Scone Abbey following his victory at the Battle of Dunbar in 1296, and had it fitted into the base of a specially-crafted wooden &lsquo;coronation chair&rsquo; on which English, and later British, monarchs have been crowned inside London&apos;s Westminster Abbey ever since. </mm> </dd></dl>
