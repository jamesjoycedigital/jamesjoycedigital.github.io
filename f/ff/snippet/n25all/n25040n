Ultimogeniture in Europe.&mdash;One of the countries in which the custom of ultimogeniture has been observed, and is still observed, is England. Under the title of Borough English this ancient usage is still, or was till lately, the law of the land in many parts of the country. The English name for the custom is taken from a local word used in a trial of the time of Edward the Third. It appears from a report in the Yearbook for the first year of that reign that in Nottingham there were then two tenures of land, called respectively Borough English and Borough French; and that under Borough English all the tenements descended to the youngest son, and that under Borough French all the tenements descended to the eldest son, as at the common law. It is said that as late as 1713 Nottingham remained divided into the English Borough and the French Borough, the customs of descent continuing distinct in each; and even at the present time similar customs are observed in that neighbourhood. <small> Sir James Frazer, <a name="FLOT2" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#FLOT2"><cite title="source">Folk-Lore in the Old Testament</cite></a> (1923) 175</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: not copied </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
