Adult salmon lay their eggs in special nests in the gravel called <i>redds</i> in late autumn in freshwater. These eggs hatch in the spring time (depending on water temperature) into <i>alevins</i>, which feed on their yolk-sac to become <i>fry</i>. These become <i>parr</i> once they are over a year old and stay in freshwater for one to four years, feeding on small insects and growing larger. The parr change into <i>smolts</i> in the spring of their second, third or fourth year. They head out to sea in shoals during late spring to become adult salmon. &lsquo;Old Parr&rsquo; was the name given to one Thomas Parr, who lived from 1483 to 1635, making him 152 years old when he died. He was interred in the Poets&apos; Corner, at Westminster Abbey.  <br>Raphael transcription: <a name="c14019j" href="c14all.htm#c14019j">VI.C.14:019(j)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
