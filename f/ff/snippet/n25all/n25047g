It contains an area of three hundred acres, with a population of two hundred, whose sole subsistence consists in shellfish, seaweed, and potatoes. The waves of the broad Atlantic dash against its rocky shore, and the roar of the ocean billow reverberates along its beach; although, when the tide is out, it is easy of access, not being more than a hundred yards from the mainland. Nothing can be more wretched than the temporal condition of its inhabitants. Their huts are merely excavations in the sand, covered over with <mark>sods and seaweed</mark>, and might, indeed, easily escape the notice of a casual observer. I went into one of them, which could not certainly have been more than six feet in diameter, and five or six feet in height. A small portion of dried grass for a bed, a pot for boiling seaweed collected on the shore, and a few potatoes, was all that appeared in this miserable hovel, the entrance to which answered the purpose of a window, a chimney, and a door. <small> J.
