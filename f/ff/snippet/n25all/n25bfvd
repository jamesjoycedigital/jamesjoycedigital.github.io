Ahab wished to acquire it as a garden of herbs (probably as a ceremonial garden for Baal worship). The king promised compensation, based upon the assumption that Naboth owned the vineyard in fee simple. Naboth, however, had inherited his land from his father, and, according to Jewish law, could not alienate it. Accordingly, he refused to sell it to the king. Ahab was incensed. His wife, Jezebel, after learning the reason for this royal outrage, promised that she would obtain the vineyard for him. To do so, she plotted to kill Naboth by mock trial, and then told Ahab to seize of the vineyard as legal heir. As punishment for this crime, the prophet Elijah visited Ahab while he was in the vineyard and pronounced doom on him. Ahab humbled himself at Elijah&apos;s reproach and God spared the king accordingly, instead visiting the prophesied destruction on his son Joram.  <br>Raphael transcription: <a name="c14160c" href="c14all.htm#c14160c">VI.C.14:160(c)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
