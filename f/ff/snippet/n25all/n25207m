He is often accompanied by his animal companions&mdash;the wolves Geri and Freki and the ravens Huginn and Muninn, who bring him information from all over Midgard&mdash;and rides the flying, eight-legged steed Sleipnir across the sky and into the underworld. Odin is attested as having many sons, most famously the gods Thor and Baldr. <br>Raphael transcription: <a name="c14144k" href="c14all.htm#c14144k">VI.C.14:144(k)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
