A French private soldier named Lami, of the 8th Regiment of cuirassiers, captured one of the English colors and presented it to Ney. It was a solitary trophy. The arrival of the English Guards about half-past six o&apos;clock enabled the Duke to recover the wood of Bossu, which the French had almost entirely won and the possession of which by them would have enabled Ney to operate destructively upon the allied <mark>flank</mark> and rear. Not only was the wood of Bossu recovered on the British right, but the <font color="green">[398]</font> enclosures of Pierremont were also carried on the left. When night set in the French had been driven back on all points towards Frasne; but they still held the farm of Gemiancourt in front of the Duke&apos;s centre. Wellington and M&uuml;ffling were unacquainted with the result of the collateral battle between Bl&uuml;cher and Napoleon, the cannonading of which had been distinctly audible at Quatre Bras throughout the afternoon and evening. The Duke observed to M&uuml;ffling that of course the two allied armies would assume the <mark>offensive</mark> against the enemy on the morrow, and, consequently, it would be better to capture the farm at once, instead of waiting till next morning. <small> Edward Creasy, <a name="ECFD" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#ECFD"><cite title="source">The Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World</cite></a> (1915) 398-9</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
