So the Moslems smote their enemies, and passed the river Garonne, and laid waste the country, and took captives without number. And that army went through all places like a desolating storm. Prosperity made those warriors insatiable. At the passage of the river, Abderrahman overthrew the count, and the count retired into his stronghold, but the Moslems fought against it, and entered it by force, and slew the count; for everything gave way to their <mark>scimitars, which were the robbers of lives</mark>.&rdquo; <small> Edward Creasy, <a name="ECFD" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#ECFD"><cite title="source">The Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World</cite></a> (1915) 184-5</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c14062h" href="c14all.htm#c14062h">VI.C.14:062(h)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
