According to the <cite>Lebor Gab&aacute;la &Eacute;renn</cite>, the Fomorians had lived in Ireland for 200 years, subsisting by fishing and fowling, before the arrival of Parthol&oacute;n, whose people were the first in Ireland to build houses and brew ale. <br>The <cite>Lebor Gab&aacute;la</cite> dates Parthol&oacute;n&apos;s arrival in Ireland to 2608 years after the creation of the world, and says the Battle of Mag Itha took place ten years after that, in Anno Mundi 2618. The plain of Mag Itha is said to have been cleared by Parthol&oacute;n&apos;s hireling Ith, and the battle to have taken place on the <i>slemna</i>, or &ldquo;smooth lands&rdquo;, of that plain. 300 Fomorians took part in the battle, and Parthol&oacute;n was victorious. The earliest recensions of the book say that Cichol was killed and the Fomorians destroyed; later recensions say the Fomorians had one arm and one leg each, the battle lasted a week, and no-one was killed or wounded as it was fought by magic. <br>See also <a name="n17119c" href="n17all.htm#n17119c">N17 (VI.B.9):119(c)</a> </mm> </dd></dl>
