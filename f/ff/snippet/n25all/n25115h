This practice, Pliny adds, still remains in the pontifical discipline, and it is certainly for this reason that it has been kept <mark>secret under the protection of what god Rome</mark> itself has been, lest its enemies should use like tactics. <small> Edward Clodd, <a name="ECTTT" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#ECTTT"><cite title="source">Tom Tit Tot</cite></a> (1898) 176</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c14070k" href="c14all.htm#c14070k">VI.C.14:070(k)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
