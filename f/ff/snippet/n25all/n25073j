We proceeded on our sad and lonely march. We were a prey to the most cruel reflections; we were humiliated, we were hopeless; but not a word of complaint was heard. We walked silently as a troop of mourners and it might have been said that we were attending the funeral of our country&apos;s glory. Suddenly the stillness was broken by a challenge &ldquo;<mark>Qui vive?</mark>&rdquo; &ldquo;France!&rdquo; &ldquo;Kellermann!&rdquo; &ldquo;Foy!&rdquo; &ldquo;Is it you, general? Come nearer to us.&rdquo; <small> Edward Creasy, <a name="ECFD" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#ECFD"><cite title="source">The Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World</cite></a> (1915) 439-40</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: <i>Qui vive?</i>: a challenge (e.g., at Waterloo) requesting a person to identify who he is.
