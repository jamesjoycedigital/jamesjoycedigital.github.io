Nor is there any improbability in the tradition, that after Attila&apos;s death many of his warriors remained in Hungary, and that their descendants afterwards joined the Huns of Arpad in their career of conquest. It is certain that Attila made <mark>Hungary</mark> the seat of his empire. It seems also susceptible of clear proof that the territory was then called <mark>Hungvar, and Attila&apos;s soldiers Hungvari</mark>. <small> Edward Creasy, <a name="ECFD" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#ECFD"><cite title="source">The Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World</cite></a> (1915) 162-3</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
