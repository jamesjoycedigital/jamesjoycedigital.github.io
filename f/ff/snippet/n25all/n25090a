Otto Eduard Leopold, Prince of Bismarck, Duke of Lauenburg (1 April 1815-30 July 1898), known as Otto von Bismarck, was a conservative Prussian statesman who dominated German and European affairs from the 1860s until 1890. &lsquo;The Girl I Left Behind Me&rsquo; is a long-standing popular folk tune and song, dated by most authorities to the late 18th or early 19th century. It was a favourite song in the US regular army, who adopted it during the War of 1812 after they heard a British prisoner singing it, and was used by the Army as a marching tune throughout the 19th century. <br>Piss mark.
