The method is to extract the tar from the wood by means of heat. When the tar has been extracted, it is run into barrels, which are sometimes attached to shafts, so that a horse can draw them along as if they were carriages composed solely of large wheels. If it is not wanted for home use, <mark>the tar is taken to the nearest waterway</mark> and put into boats for transport to the coast. <small> Arthur Reade, <a name="ARFF" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#ARFF"><cite title="source">Finland and the Finns</cite></a> (1914) 109</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c14076k" href="c14all.htm#c14076k">VI.C.14:076(k)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
