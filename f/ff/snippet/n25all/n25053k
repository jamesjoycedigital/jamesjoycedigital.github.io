The battle was fought in Branxton (in Northumberland in northern England) on 9 September 1513, between an invading Scots army under King James IV and an English army commanded by the Earl of Surrey. It was a decisive English victory. In terms of troop numbers, it was the largest battle fought between the two kingdoms. James IV was killed in the battle, becoming the last monarch from the island of Britain to suffer such a death. </mm> </dd></dl>
