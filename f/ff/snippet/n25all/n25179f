It is <mark>akin to sleep-walking</mark> and to epilepsy, and its final outcome is madness, or the incapacity for distinguishing between the real and the imagined. The hypnotic condition is not produced by the will of another, but by the paralysis which results from staring long and intently at some particular object. The dazed brain strives to recover its powers, and the victim thus willingly accepts suggestions from without which may aid it to return to consciousness of reality. Not only do Indian Yogis hypnotise themselves by staring at their noses, but the bird is hypnotised by staring at the dreaded snake, and the mouse paralysed by looking at the cat. <small> Claude R.
