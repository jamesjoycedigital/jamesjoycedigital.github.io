The ruins of the altar are a little to the west of the high road, which leads from Hastings along the neck <mark>of hills</mark> already described, across the valley, and through the modern town of Battle, towards London. <small> Edward Creasy, <a name="ECFD" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#ECFD"><cite title="source">The Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World</cite></a> (1915) 204-5</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c14063h" href="c14all.htm#c14063h">VI.C.14:063(h)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
