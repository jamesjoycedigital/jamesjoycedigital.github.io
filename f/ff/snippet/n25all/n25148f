Some are incised in the hard stone to a depth of half and inch; others are traced in broad lines of red ochre or other colour, their weather-worn state witnessing to a high antiquity. <small> Edward Clodd, <a name="ECSA1" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#ECSA1"><cite title="source">The Story of the Alphabet</cite></a>, rev. ed.
