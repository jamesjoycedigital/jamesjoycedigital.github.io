A nippy was a waitress who worked in the J. Lyons &amp; Co tea-shops and caf&eacute;s in London. Beginning in the late-19th century, a J. Lyons waitress was called a &lsquo;Gladys&rsquo;. From 1926, because the waitresses nipped (flitted) around the tea-shops, and the term &lsquo;Nippy&rsquo; came into use. Nippies wore a distinctive maid-like uniform with a matching hat.  <br>Raphael transcription: <a name="c14105d" href="c14all.htm#c14105d">VI.C.14:105(d)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
