The better qualities of muslin are fine and smooth in texture and are woven from evenly spun warps and wefts, or fillings. They are given a soft finish, bleached or piece-dyed, and are sometimes patterned in the loom or printed.  <br>Raphael transcription: <a name="c14136l" href="c14all.htm#c14136l">VI.C.14:136(l)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
