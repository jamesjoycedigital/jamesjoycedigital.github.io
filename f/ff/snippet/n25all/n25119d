It is a framework of threads covered with straws and decorated with pieces of paper cut in the shape of stars and other appropriate emblems. Lit up from below by candle and firelight it has a beautiful transparent effect, and must seem very lovely to a child. <small> Arthur Reade, <a name="ARFF" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#ARFF"><cite title="source">Finland and the Finns</cite></a> (1914) 116</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c14073g" href="c14all.htm#c14073g">VI.C.14:073(g)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
