The most notable of these was the Jus Theelacticum, or custom of the &ldquo;Theel-lands,&rdquo; doles or allottable lands, at Norden, in East Friesland, not far from the mouth of the Ems. The &ldquo;<mark>Theel-boors</mark>&rdquo; of that district continued down to the nineteenth century to hold their allotments under a complicated system of rules designed to prevent an unprofitable subdivision of estates. An inherited allotment was indivisible: on the death of the father it passed intact to the youngest son, and on his death without issue it became the possession of the whole community. <small> Sir James Frazer, <a name="FLOT2" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#FLOT2"><cite title="source">Folk-Lore in the Old Testament</cite></a> (1923) 177</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c14021e" href="c14all.htm#c14021e">VI.C.14:021(e)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
