He and Sir John De Courcy sailed to Howth in 1177, accompanied by a chosen band of fighting men, and on landing were opposed by the inhabitants, mostly Danish pirates who had settled in this neighbourhood. A desperate battle was fought at &ldquo;The Bridge of Evora,&rdquo; which crossed the small river, called &ldquo;The Bloody Stream,&rdquo; flowing into the sea near the railway station, and, after heavy losses on both sides, the natives were completely defeated. <small> Weston St. John Joyce, <a name="WSJND" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#WSJND"><cite title="source">The Neighbourhood of Dublin</cite></a> (1921) 324-5</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
