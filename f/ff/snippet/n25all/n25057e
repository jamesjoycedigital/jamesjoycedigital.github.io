In the reign of Queen Elizabeth, Grace O&apos;Malley, known to the Irish as Granuaile, Princess of Connaught, returning from England, landed at Howth in expectation of the hospitality, which was then universally accorded to travellers. She found the gates of the castle closed, as the family were at dinner. In wrath at the slight, she seized an opportunity to kidnap the young heir, whom she carried off to Mayo and refused to release, until his parents solemnly promised that the doors of the castle should never again be shut at mealtimes. The promise was faithfully kept until recently. <small> D.A. Chart, <a name="DACD1" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#DACD1"><cite title="source">The Story of Dublin</cite></a> (1907) 342-3</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: The celebrated Grana Uille, or Grace O&apos;Malley, was noted for her piratical depredations in the reign of Elizabeth. Returning on a certain time from England, where she had paid a visit to the Queen, she landed at Howth, and proceeded to the castle. It was the hour of dinner, and the gates were shut. Shocked at an exclusion so repugnant to her notion of Irish hospitality, she immediately proceeded to the shore, where the young lord was at nurse, and seizing the child, she embarked with him, and sailed to Connaught, where her own castle stood. After some time, however, she returned the child, with the express stipulation that the gates should be always thrown open when the family went to dinner, a practice which is observed to this day. </mm> </dd></dl>
