It is even now a very widespread practice in the the peasants&apos; customary law, which makes it possible to trace the origin of this law of inheritance. The &lsquo;minor right&rsquo; is not a privilege but a natural course, owing to the fact that the elder sons usually separate from the father and from their own households, while the younger, or youngest, &lsquo;never severs from the father&apos;s root.&rsquo; If in addition to the father&apos;s house the younger son inherits other property to the disadvantage of the elder sons, he also inherits certain duties: to take care of his enfeebled father and mother, and often also of unmarried sisters. If the elder sons have not separated from the father before his death, the house goes to the youngest son, but it is his duty to help the elder brothers in starting new households for themselves. <small> Sir James Frazer, <a name="FLOT2" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#FLOT2"><cite title="source">Folk-Lore in the Old Testament</cite></a> (1923) 178</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c14021g" href="c14all.htm#c14021g">VI.C.14:021(g)</a>, <a name="c14021g" href="c14all.htm#c14021g">VI.C.14:021(g)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
