It lasted from sunrise to sunset, and ended in a rout of the Viking and Leinster forces. It is estimated that between 7,000 and 10,000 men were killed during the battle. Although his forces were victorious, Brian was slain, on 23 April, as were his son Murchad and his grandson Toirdelbach. The Leinster king and the Viking leaders were also slain. After the battle, the Vikings of Dublin were reduced to a secondary power. Brian&apos;s family was temporarily eclipsed, and there was no undisputed High King of Ireland until the late 12th century. </mm> </dd></dl>
