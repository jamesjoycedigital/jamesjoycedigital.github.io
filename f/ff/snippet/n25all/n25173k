But man, whose advance has been due to that imitative faculty which also led him so early to scratch rude sketches of various objects (and later enabled him to draw the mammoth) aided his exclamations by signs, and increased his vocabulary by double roots, apparently before the separation of the various families or tribes whence nations sprang. True <mark>speech</mark> may be said to appear when double cries, <mark>formed in different parts of the mouth</mark>, have been combined into one sound; and no animal (not even the parrot or the magpie) has the power of uttering such sounds. <small> Claude R.
