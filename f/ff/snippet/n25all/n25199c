Thus, those whom we call Lapps are apt to be called Finns by the Norwegians, and those whom we have been accustomed to term Finns they characterize as Quains. <small> Frank Vincent, <a name="FVNLF" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#FVNLF"><cite title="source">Norsk, Lapp, and Finn</cite></a> (1881) 127</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: The <i>Lapps</i> are found in Norway, Sweden and Finland. They call themselves Sabme, but are called Finns by the Norwegians. The <i>Finns</i> proper or Suomi, as they call themselves, formerly boasted a division or tribe called Kainulaiset, found also in Sweden, hence the Swedes call the Finns <i>Qven</i>.  <br>Raphael transcription: <a name="c14137c" href="c14all.htm#c14137c">VI.C.14:137(c)</a>, <a name="c14137d" href="c14all.htm#c14137d">VI.C.14:137(d)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
