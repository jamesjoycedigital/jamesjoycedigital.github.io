It tells us how the movement against ancient superstitions began among the people before Henry VIII. quarrelled with the Pope about his divorce&mdash;as in the story of the &ldquo;Rood of Dovercourt&rdquo; in Suffolk, destroyed by poor youths, of whom three were hanged in chains in 1532. &ldquo;For at that time there was a great roumour blown abroad amongst the ignorant folke, that the power of the idoll of Dovercourt was so great that no man had power to shut the church door.&rdquo; So, finding it open, &ldquo;they tooke the idoll from his shrine, and carried him a quarter of a mile from the place where he stood, without any resistance of the said idoll. Whereupon they <mark>strake</mark> fire with a flint stone, and sodainly set him on fire, who burned out so brim that he lighted them homeward one good mile of the ten.&rdquo; <small> Claude R.
