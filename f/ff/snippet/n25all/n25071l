The numerical difference was even greater at the beginning of the battle, as Lobau&apos;s corps did not come up from Charleroi till eight o&apos;clock. After five hours and a half of desperate and long, doubtful struggle, Napoleon succeeded in breaking the centre of the Prussian line at Ligny, and in forcing his obstinate antagonists off the field of battle.The issue was attributable to his skill, and not to any want of spirit or resolution on the part of the Prussian troops; nor did they, though defeated, abate one jot in discipline, heart, or hope. As Bl&uuml;cher observed, it was a battle in which his army <mark>lost the day</mark> but not its honor. <small> Edward Creasy, <a name="ECFD" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#ECFD"><cite title="source">The Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World</cite></a> (1915) 399-400</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c14042l" href="c14all.htm#c14042l">VI.C.14:042(l)</a></mm></dd> </dd></dl>
