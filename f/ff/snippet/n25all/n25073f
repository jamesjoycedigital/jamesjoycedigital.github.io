It was used both in land and naval warfare. When assembled, the balls resembled a cluster of grapes, hence the name. On firing, the balls spread out from the muzzle, giving an effect similar to a giant shotgun. Grapeshot was devastatingly effective against massed infantry at short range, At the Battle of Waterloo (1815) the Earl of Uxbridge was struck in the leg by French grapeshot; the leg was amputated, and the earl was commended for the injuries sustained and bravery in the battle. Canister shot is a kind of short-range cannon ammunition fired at the Battle of Waterloo, so-named named because these iron balls were packed inside a tin canister for firing. It was designed as a weapon of last resort, used by desperate cannon crew to fire on enemies as they charged at the guns. Like a giant shotgun shell, the canister would explode and fire out these iron balls in a devastating blast. </mm> </dd></dl>
