It was originally formed in the usual way by several upright pillars supporting a horizontal slab, but has partially collapsed, so that the great roof-stone, many tons in weight, has half fallen from its perch and now has one end resting on the ground. These ancient monuments are believed to be prehistoric tombstones, probably erected over some great and revered chief. There are many of them in Ireland, and the peasantry, who call them &ldquo;the beds of Diarmid and Grania,&rdquo; tell a curious legend to account for their frequent appearance. Finn MacCool, the Irish Hercules, had a wife Grania, who, preferring good looks to muscle, eloped with the handsome youth Diarmid. The angry husband chased the pair through the length and breadth of Ireland. Wherever the fugitives stayed the night, Diarmid built one of these structures as a shelter for himself and his partner in guilt. <small> D.A.

These cromlechs are sepulchral chambers stripped of their cairns (or piles of overlaid rock).  <br>Raphael transcription: <a name="c14031i" href="c14all.htm#c14031i">VI.C.14:031(i)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
