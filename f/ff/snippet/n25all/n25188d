Paul here</blockquote> <dd class="well"> <blockquote class="sources">Finally, in the first epistle of Timothy (ii.), a bishop is defined as an overseer: &ldquo;which when he desireth to feed Christ&apos;s flock with the food of health&mdash;that is, with His holy word, as the bishops did in Paul&apos;s time&mdash;desireth a good work, and the very office of a bishop. But he that desireth honours, gapeth for lucre, trusteth great rents, seeketh preeminence, pomp, dominion, coveteth abundance of all things, without want; rest and heartsease castles, parks, lordships, earldoms&mdash;desireth not a work, much less a good work, and is nothing less than a bishop as <mark>St. Paul here</mark> understandeth a bishop.&rdquo; <small> Claude R.
