Amory Tristram, one of the Norman adventurers, who followed Strongbow, defeated the Danish inhabitants, who still lingered here after the fall of Dublin, and took their lands for himself. The victory was won on S. Lawrence&apos;s Day and the knight in gratitude took the name of the saint, under whose auspices the battle had been fought. <small> D.A.
