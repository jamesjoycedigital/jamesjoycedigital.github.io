The hieroglyphic for the Ka&mdash;genius or spirit&mdash;consists of the sign of the <mark>phallus</mark> (which, among all rude and primitive races, was the emblem of life) joined to the sign of two arms raised in invocation, to which the sound <i>ka</i>, &ldquo;to cry,&rdquo; attached. It was vaguely supposed that the life of man depended not only on a soul (<i>Ba</i>) within, but also on a genius or double (<i>Ka</i>), and that it moreover animated the shade or shadow (<i>Ta</i>) which reappeared as a ghost. Thus the Ka dwelt in the statue placed in the antechamber of the tomb, and to it were offered the gifts of descendants, whose duty it was to insure the happiness of the departed soul during its long journey to join the gods, or when it fluttered as a human-headed bird down the air-shaft to look at the embalmed body, while the shade remained in Hades. <small> Claude R.
