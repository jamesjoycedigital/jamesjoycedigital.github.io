The first offshoot of the former was the tribe which entered Lower Egypt and spoke a language of which Semitic speech may be considered to be a later development. The northern race was Turanian, and its offshoot was the Aryan family, which wandered far north. Turanian speech was arrested by the early use of letters, but the language of the illiterate <mark>Aryans</mark> developed rapidly into various inflectional dialects. The two great classes are distinguished especially by syntax, for while in the north such a compound as &ldquo;<mark>cow-herd</mark>&rdquo; is regular and usual (the defining word preceding), in Egyptian and <mark>Semitic</mark> speech the invariable rule is the reverse, and the compound always stands as &ldquo;<mark>herd-cow</mark>.&rdquo; <small> Claude R.
