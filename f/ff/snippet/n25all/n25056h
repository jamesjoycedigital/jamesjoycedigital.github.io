These include a circular entrenchment called <i>Arthur&apos;s Round Table</i>, about half a mile south, and a nearby Druid temple, called <i>Long Meg and her Daughter</i>. A &lsquo;Giant&apos;s grave&rsquo; is found very near the church at Penrith.  <br>Raphael transcription: <a name="c14030n" href="c14all.htm#c14030n">VI.C.14:030(n)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
