The hearts of Abderrahman, his captains, and his men were filled with wrath and pride, and they were the first to begin the fight. The Moslem horsemen dashed fierce and frequent forward against the battalions of the Franks, who resisted manfully, and many fell dead on either side, until the going down of the sun. Night parted the two armies, but in the grey of the morning the Moslems returned to the battle. Their cavaliers had soon hewn their way into the centre of the Christian host. But many of the Moslems were fearful for the safety of the spoil which they had stored in their tents, and a false cry arose in their ranks that some of the enemy were plundering the camp; whereupon several squadrons of the Moslem horsemen rode off to protect their tents. But it seemed as if they fled, and all the host was troubled. And while Abderrahman strove to check their tumult, and to lead them back to battle, the warriors of the Franks came around him, and he was pierced through with many spears, so that he died. <mark>Then all the host fled before the enemy, and many died in the flight.</mark> This deadly defeat of the Moslems, and the loss of the great leader and good cavalier, Abderrahman, took place in the hundred and fifteenth year.&rsquo; <small> Edward Creasy, <a name="ECFD" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#ECFD"><cite title="source">The Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World</cite></a> (1915) 185-6</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: At the end of the battle of Waterloo, the Frenchmen, terrified at the thunder of the British cannons, ran away pellmell, exclaiming, &ldquo;Sauve qui peut&rdquo;&mdash;Let him save himself who can.  <br>Raphael transcription: <a name="c14062i" href="c14all.htm#c14062i">VI.C.14:062(i)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
