Upon the walls, which are hung with rare and valuable tapestries, are many fine paintings, and the vaulted ceiling is covered with beautiful stucco reliefs. In the centre is the Danish escutcheon with its proper heraldic colors, while about it are the emblems of royalty&mdash;four large paintings. At one end of this hall stand two very curious old coronation-chairs. The larger is about eight feet in height and made almost entirely of narwhal horn, which material, two hundred years ago, was worth its weight in silver. <small> Frank Vincent, <a name="FVNLF" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#FVNLF"><cite title="source">Norsk, Lapp, and Finn</cite></a> (1881) 29</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: Often called the unicorns of the sea, narwhals are exotic sea-creatures having long tusks protruding from their heads. They are found in the Arctic waters of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Russia.  <br>Raphael transcription: <a name="c14140l" href="c14all.htm#c14140l">VI.C.14:140(l)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
