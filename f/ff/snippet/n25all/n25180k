Saint Nessan founded an abbey on Ireland&apos;s Eye in the year 570. All that remains are the ruins of a church appertaining. The saint was long respected by the people of Howth for his extreme piety and it is recorded of him, in Colgan&apos;s <cite>Acta Sanctorum</cite>, that he was assailed while reading a holy book, <cite>The Garland of Howth</cite>, by an evil spirit that swelled to a terrifying size. Undeterred, Nessan struck the demon on the forehead with such force as sent him headlong into the cliff of Howth opposite, lodging him into a fissure&mdash;now known as Puck&apos;s Rock&mdash;from which he is to this day attempting to extricate himself.</mm> </dd></dl>
