Cli&oacute;dna (or Cloona) was a lady of the Tuatha De Danaan who drowned at that place. <br>The connection with Tory Island is perhaps the assertion made of the high king Brian Boru that a woman could journey from the Wave of Cloona to Tory Island (the length of Ireland) bearing a wand with a golden ring, and no man would be found hardy enough to insult or rob her, so severe were the laws of the realm.  <br>Raphael transcription: <a name="c14078l" href="c14all.htm#c14078l">VI.C.14:078(l)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
