The rushes when thus prepared and dried were dipped into a vessel called a <mark>grisset</mark>, containing melted grease, and then dried. The grisset, of which I exhibit a miniature specimen, was a boat-shaped vessel of metal or iron, standing on three legs, and having a long handle projecting from the centre of the side. <small> J. F.
