He spied two Englishmen who were also carrying themselves boldly. They were both men of great worth, and had become companions in arms and fought together, the one protecting the other. They bore two long and broad <mark>bills</mark>, and did great mischief to the Normans, killing both horses and men. The French soldier looked at them and their bills, and was sore alarmed, for he was afraid of losing his good horse, the best that he had; and would willingly have turned to some other quarter, if it would not have looked like cowardice. <small> Edward Creasy, <a name="ECFD" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#ECFD"><cite title="source">The Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World</cite></a> (1915) 219</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: Bill: an obsolete weapon carried by soldiers and watchmen, varying in form from a concave blade with a long wooden handle, to a kind of concave axe with a spike at the back and its shaft ending in a spear-head. </mm> </dd></dl>
