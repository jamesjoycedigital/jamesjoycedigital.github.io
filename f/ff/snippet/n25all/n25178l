Thus, with the accession of Assur-bani-pal in 668 B.C, we reach the summit of Assyrian power. During his reign Susa was again conquered, and rebellion in Babylon&mdash;in spite of alliance with Judah, Arabia, and Egypt&mdash; was put down, the king of <mark>Nineveh</mark> becoming the suzerain of nearly the whole of Western Asia, and establishing Assyrian governors in various cities of Egypt. <small> Claude R. Conder, <a name="CRRM" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#CRRM"><cite title="source">The Rise of Man</cite></a> (1908) 95</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: Nineveh, the oldest and most-populous city of the ancient Assyrian empire was situated on the east bank of the Tigris River. It is encircled by the modern city of Mosul, Iraq. Nineveh was located at the intersection of important north-south and east-west trade routes, and its proximity to a tributary of the Tigris, the Khawsar River, added to the value of the fertile agricultural and pastoral lands in the district. The earliest cities for which there exist records appeared around the mouths of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Gradually civilization spread northward and around the Fertile Crescent. <br>Raphael transcription: <a name="c14120d" href="c14all.htm#c14120d">VI.C.14:120(d)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
