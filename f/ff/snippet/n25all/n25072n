Then, mounting a favorite charger, a small thoroughbred chestnut horse, named &lsquo;<mark>Copenhagen</mark>,&rsquo; Wellington rode forward to the range of hills where his men were posted. <small> Edward Creasy, <a name="ECFD" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#ECFD"><cite title="source">The Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World</cite></a> (1915) 412</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: &lsquo;Copenhagen&rsquo; (1808-1836) was the Duke of Wellington&apos;s war horse, which he most famously rode at the Battle of Waterloo. He was a dark chestnut horse with two white heels, and was a hollow-backed, powerful horse but reportedly with bad shoulders. The horse was eventually retired to the Duke&apos;s estate, Stratfield Saye House, and lived there for the remainder of his life, dying on 12 February, 1836, at the age of 28 years. His grave site, situated under a 173-174 year-old Turkey Oak, is marked with a marble headstone. <br>Napoleon&apos;s horse at Waterloo, a white charger, was named Marengo. It was born in Egypt and obtained by the emperor during his campaign there. Marengo was captured after the Battle of Waterloo, and died in England some years later. <br>See also <a name="n21026c" href="n21all.htm#n21026c">N21 (VI.B.20):026(c)</a> </mm> </dd></dl>
