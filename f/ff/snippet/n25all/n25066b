Several groups answer to this requirement. One of them centres round the tale, referred to above, of &lsquo;<mark>the Giant who had no Heart in his Body</mark>,&rsquo; variants of which have been found from India to the Highlands, and from the Arctic seaboard to Africa. <small> Edward Clodd, <a name="ECTTT" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#ECTTT"><cite title="source">Tom Tit Tot</cite></a> (1898) 5-6</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: Daniel O&apos;Connell&apos;s heart, but not the rest of him, is buried in Rome.  <br>Raphael transcription: <a name="c14038f" href="c14all.htm#c14038f">VI.C.14:038(f)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
