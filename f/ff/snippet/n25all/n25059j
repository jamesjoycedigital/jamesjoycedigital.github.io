It stood at the summit of the south cliff at Howth and commanded from its window a glorious view of Dublin Bay and the Wicklow Mountains, with about it acres of cliff glowing with crimson and yellow blossoms of <i>Geranium sanguinem</i> and <i>Lotus corniculatus</i>. No doubt the sunsets to be viewed from here and adjacent spots were spectacular. <br>Raphael transcription: <a name="c14033m" href="c14all.htm#c14033m">VI.C.14:033(m)</a>, <a name="c14034a" href="c14all.htm#c14034a">VI.C.14:034(a)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
