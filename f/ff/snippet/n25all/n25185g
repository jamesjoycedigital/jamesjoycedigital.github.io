They became acquainted first with Greek philosophy, and afterwards with Hindu mysticism, and the result was the appearance of the <mark>Sufis</mark> or &ldquo;wise men&rdquo; (the Greek <mark>Sophoi</mark>) in Persia. The name at first only denoted one who studied Greek science and philosophy, but by 800 A.D. it applied to those who discarded the popular theology, and accepted the wisdom of the Buddhists of Bactria, and of Hindu Brahmans and Yogis. <small> Claude R.
