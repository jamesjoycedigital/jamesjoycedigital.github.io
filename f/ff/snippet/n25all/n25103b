The battle broke the will of the Russian Army to defeat the allies in the field, and was followed by the Siege of Sevastopol. The role of troops fighting mostly on their own initiative due to the foggy conditions during the battle has earned the engagement the name &ldquo;The Soldier&apos;s Battle.&rdquo; </mm> </dd></dl>
