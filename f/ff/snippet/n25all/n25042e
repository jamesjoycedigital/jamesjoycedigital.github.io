I was registering my vote for the County Dublin, and at the same time that nice little Indian gentleman, the Professor of Arabic and Persian in Trinity College, Dublin, came forward for the same purpose. The County Court Judge ordered him to be sworn, and he declined to be sworn on the New Testament; lhe said he was not a Christian. &lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said the Judge, &lsquo;you are a heathen, I suppose.&rsquo; &lsquo;No, your Worship,&rsquo; said the little gentleman, &lsquo;I am not a heathen; I worship the very same God that you do.&rsquo; His Worship looked very puzzled, and said, &lsquo;I really do not know what to do with this man. I think there is a precedent in the law books for <mark>swearing a person like this on a cracked saucer</mark>&rsquo;; but our Indian friend indignantly refused to be sworn on a cracked saucer, and a compromise was made by allowing him to hold up his hand and affirm. We are told that during the Crimean War the Mohammedan officers told our officers that they could see no reason why they should not join with them in saying the Lord&apos;s Prayer. <small> J. F. M.
