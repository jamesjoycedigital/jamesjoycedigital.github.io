This was strongly garrisoned by the allied troops; and while it was in their possession, it was difficult for the enemy to press on and force the British right wing. On the other hand, if the enemy could take it, it would be difficult for that wing to keep its ground on the heights, with a strong post held adversely in its immediate front, being one that would give much shelter to the enemy&apos;s <mark>marksmen</mark>, and great facilities for the sudden concentration of attacking columns. <small> Edward Creasy, <a name="ECFD" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#ECFD"><cite title="source">The Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World</cite></a> (1915) 405</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c14042o" href="c14all.htm#c14042o">VI.C.14:042(o)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
