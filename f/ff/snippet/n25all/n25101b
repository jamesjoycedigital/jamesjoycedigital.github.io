Here and there, the ground swells into picturesque eminences; and occasionally a belt of forest land, a brown heath, or a clustering series of vineyards, breaks the monotony of the widespread meadows; but the general character of the land is that of a grassy plain, and it seems naturally adapted for the evolutions of numerous armies, especially of those vast bodies of <mark>cavalry</mark> which principally decided the fate of nations during the centuries that followed the downfall of Rome, and preceded the consolidation of the modern European powers. <small> Edward Creasy, <a name="ECFD" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#ECFD"><cite title="source">The Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World</cite></a> (1915) 176</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c14061k" href="c14all.htm#c14061k">VI.C.14:061(k)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
