It was owned in 1670 by Alderman Giles Mee (later Lord-Mayor) and, on his death, it passed to his son-in-law, Alderman Sir Mark Rainsford; and, on his death in 1709 to his son, also named Mark. In 1715 the property, extending over four acres, was leased for 99 years to one Paul Espinasse, but was recovered by the Rainsford family in 1750. In 1759, while the property was extensive, the brewery&mdash;with a copper kieve (mash tub), a mill, and two malthouses&mdash;was relatively small and poorly equipped. The estate otherwise consisted of a commodious dwelling-house, and stables for a dozen horses with a capacious loft for hay. A frontage of some ninety feet faced north on James&apos;s Street, while the rear extended four hundred feet southwards to Rainsford Street. The premises of a rival brewer, Mr Joyce, lay on the east or city side, and to the west was found the necessary pipe wall or city watercourse (drawing water from the Wicklow Mountains). Liffey water was never used in the brewing process. In 1759, Arthur Guinness, up from Leixlip, purchased the lease of the whole for a term of 9 000 years at an annual rent of &pound;45. When he did so, the building was a decade in disuse; but by 1798 by excercise of judicious management and business acumen, with a concern for the export market and a shrewd sense for business, he was amongst the biggest employers in Dublin. (Arthur was the eldest son of Richard Guinness of Celbridge, County Kildare, and, using a small legacy, on 29 September 1756 purchased the lease of a small brewery at Leixlip. Within three years he had secured the James&apos;s Gate lease, and left the Leixlip business under the control of his brother, Richard.) The company, Arthur Guinness Son and Co. Ltd., was incorporated only later in 1886. Beamish and Crawford&apos;s brewery in Cork was the most significant in Ireland in the first half of the the nineteenth century, but this was eclipsed by the Guinness empire up in Dublin during its second half.  <br>Raphael transcription: <a name="c14033g" href="c14all.htm#c14033g">VI.C.14:033(g)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
