It gains its efficacy from the fact that, in pronunciation, certain vibrations, corresponding to the mass-chord of the name, are set up; not only in the atmosphere, but also in the more ethereal substance, referred to by a modern philosopher as &ldquo;<mark>mind-stuff</mark>,&rdquo; whose modifications form the basis of changes of thought. This is evident to us in the fact that names import to our minds certain characteristics, more or less definite according to the acuteness of our psychometric sense. <small> Edward Clodd, <a name="ECTTT" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#ECTTT"><cite title="source">Tom Tit Tot</cite></a> (1898) 98</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: Possibly a pun on &lsquo;soul-stuff&rsquo;.  <br>Raphael transcription: <a name="c14044m" href="c14all.htm#c14044m">VI.C.14:044(m)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
