Porter, or porter&apos;s ale, is a kind of beer brewed from malt that has been partly darkened or charred from drying it at a high temperature. Ale is a liquor made from fermented malt with hops and other bitters. The Dublin brewers imported the hops, and the coal to roast these, from England. Alongside hops and malt, corn flake grist is used in the producrtion of lager and ale.  <br>Raphael transcription: <a name="c14033e" href="c14all.htm#c14033e">VI.C.14:033(e)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
