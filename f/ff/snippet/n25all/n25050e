The &lsquo;Battle of the Boyne&rsquo; in County Meath, Ireland, was fought by the forces of the Protestant Dutch Prince William III of Orange, who, with his wife Mary II (his cousin and James&apos;s daughter), had acceded to the Crowns of England and Scotland in 1688, and those lesser and untrained forces of the deposed Catholic King James II on 1st July, 1690. The issue was never in doubt. William&apos;s army (English, Scottish, Dutch, Danes and Huguenots [French Protestants]) numbered 36,000, a superiority in number of some 11,000. James&apos; forces were mainly Irish Catholics, reinforced by 6,500 French troops sent by King Louis XIV. Approximately 1,500 soldiers were killed at the Boyne. His army having been defeated, James fled to France never to return. The Williamite War in Ireland, meanwhile, dragged on until October 1691. </mm> </dd></dl>
