In Scotland there seems to be no evidence that ultimogeniture anywhere prevailed; but in the Shetland Islands it was the practice that the youngest child of either sex should have the dwelling-house, when the property came to be divided. <small> Sir James Frazer, <a name="FLOT2" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#FLOT2"><cite title="source">Folk-Lore in the Old Testament</cite></a> (1923) 176</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: See also <a name="n14159i" href="n14all.htm#n14159i">N14 (VI.B.7):159(i)</a>.
