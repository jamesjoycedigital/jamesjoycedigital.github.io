There <mark>Etsel or Attila</mark>, is described as the wearer of twelve mighty crowns, and as promising to his bride the lands of thirty kinds, whom his irresistible sword has subdued. He is, in fact, the hero of the latter part of this remarkable poem; and it is at his capital city, <mark>Etselenburgh</mark>, which evidently corresponds to the modern <mark>Buda</mark>, that much of its action takes place. <small> Edward Creasy, <a name="ECFD" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#ECFD"><cite title="source">The Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World</cite></a> (1915) 164</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c14056k" href="c14all.htm#c14056k">VI.C.14:056(k)</a>, <a name="c14056l" href="c14all.htm#c14056l">VI.C.14:056(l)</a>, <a name="c14056m" href="c14all.htm#c14056m">VI.C.14:056(m)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
