As he walked &lsquo;twixt hill and dale he met a troll, who, when he heard the king&apos;s wish, offered to build the church for him within a given time, stipulating that he was to have the sun and moon, or Olaf himself, in payment. The king agreed; the church was to be large enough to allow seven priests to preach in it at the same time without disturbing one another, and ere long the structure was finished, except the roof and spire. Perplexed at the bargain which he had made, Olaf once more wandered over hill and dale, when suddenly he heard a child cry from within a mountain, while a giantess quieted it with these words, &lsquo;Hush, hush, to-morrow comes thy father, Wind and Weather, home, bringing both sun and moon, or saintly Olaf&apos;s self.&rsquo; Overjoyed at this discovery, the king turned home, arriving just in time to see the spire being fixed. He cried out, &lsquo;Wind and Weather, thou hast set the spire askew,&rsquo; when instantly <mark>the giant fell</mark> off the ridge of the roof with a fearful crash, and burst into <mark>a thousand pieces, which were nothing but flint stones</mark>. <small> Edward Clodd, <a name="ECTTT" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#ECTTT"><cite title="source">Tom Tit Tot</cite></a> (1898) 48-9</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c14039i" href="c14all.htm#c14039i">VI.C.14:039(i)</a></mm></dd> </dd></dl>
