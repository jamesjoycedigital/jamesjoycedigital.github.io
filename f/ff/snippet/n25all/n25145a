In earlier periods it was relatively simple, a circular or (later) oblong enclosure containing a single roughly-walled grave covered with undressed stone slabs and concealed by a heap of sand and small.

The direction of the body with respect to the river Nile, and the orientation of the head was variously ritualized. <br>See also: <a name="n22048d" href="n22all.htm#n22048d">N22 (VI.B.17):048(d)</a> and <a name="n12138n" href="n12all.htm#n12138n">N12 (VI.B.14):138(n)</a>. </mm> </dd></dl>
