It is curious to note, however, that when bathing in sea or lake men and women bathe separately. The explanation is, perhaps, that the bath-house is a kind of temple, the bath-woman its priestess, and the bath of the nature of a ritual. The church and the bathhouse are holy places, says a Finnish proverb. <small> Arthur Reade, <a name="ARFF" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#ARFF"><cite title="source">Finland and the Finns</cite></a> (1914) 89</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c14076d" href="c14all.htm#c14076d">VI.C.14:076(d)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
