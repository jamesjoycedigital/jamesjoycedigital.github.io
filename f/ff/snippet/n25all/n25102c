Reign of Charlemagne. This monarch has justly been termed the principal regenerator of Western Europe, after the destruction of the Roman empire. The early death of his brother, Carloman, left him sole master of the dominions of the Franks, which, by a succession of victorious wars, he enlarged into the new Empire of the West. He conquered the Lombards, and re-established the pope at Rome, who, in return, acknowledged <mark>Charles</mark> as suzerain of Italy. And in the year 800, Leo III, in the name of the Roman people, solemnly crowned Charlemagne at Rome, as Emperor of the Roman Empire of the West. <small> Edward Creasy, <a name="ECFD" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#ECFD"><cite title="source">The Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World</cite></a> (1915) 187</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: With Charles Stewart Parnell.  <br>Raphael transcription: <a name="c14062j" href="c14all.htm#c14062j">VI.C.14:062(j)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
