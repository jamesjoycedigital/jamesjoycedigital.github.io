Weaving from wool of a dense cloth in strips, the weavers would sow these together to fashion sails for their ships, A single warship sail could require the wool of a thousand sheep. The VIking sailors would have donned tightly woven woollen cloaks, possibly covered by oil; waterproof leather (oilskins) to keep out the damp; and woolen tunics, leggings, socks, mittens, and hats, either woven or constructed by <i>n&aring;lebinding</i>, a kind of single-needle knitting.  <br>Raphael transcription: <a name="c14140g" href="c14all.htm#c14140g">VI.C.14:140(g)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
