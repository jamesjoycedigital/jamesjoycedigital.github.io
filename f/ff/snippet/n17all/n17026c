Young Peregrines of the year, on account of the red tinge of their plumage, are called, the female, a Red Falcon, and the male, a Red Tiercel, to distinguish them from the older birds; the names also of <mark>Eyas</mark>, or Nyas; Gentil; Peregrine or Passage; and <mark>Haggard</mark>, are also applied to them according to their age when taken. If kept over a moult they were then called intermewed Hawks. <small> William Yarrell, <a name="BIRDS" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#BIRDS"><cite title="source">British Birds</cite></a> (1843) 45</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
