One day, though, that glorious Atlantic rose like a mountain above Lyonesse, and where in the morning had been a beautiful city with churches and houses, and fertile lands, in the evening there was only a raging, boiling <mark>sea</mark>, bearing on its bosom fragments of <mark>the lost world it had devoured</mark>. This, though, was long after the time of which I am writing now. <small> Mabel Quiller Couch, <a name="TRIST" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#TRIST"><cite title="source">Cornwall's Wonderland</cite></a> (1914) 197-8</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
