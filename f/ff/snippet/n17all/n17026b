This <mark>Heronry</mark> is situated on a river, with an open country on every side of it. The Herons go out in the morning to rivers and ponds at a very considerable distance in search of food, and return to the Heronry towards the evening.&rdquo; <small> William Yarrell, <a name="BIRDS" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#BIRDS"><cite title="source">British Birds</cite></a> (1843) 46</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
