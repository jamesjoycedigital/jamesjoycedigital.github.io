His name was <mark>M&apos;Donnell</mark>, and he owned some household property in the neighbourhood, but he was an uneducated man, altogether in the rank of a peasant. He possessed extraordinary influence with the mob. <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> an attachment was issued against him <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> His residence was well known, and he was known to be in it; so the troops advanced to the attack.
