But when the demand reached King Mark, he and his knights absolutely refused to pay the money, and sent the messenger back, with none too polite a message, to say so. If he wanted the debt settled, they said, he could send the noblest knight of his court to fight for it, otherwise the king might whistle for his money. <br>201-2: &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Sir Tristram, throwing up his head proudly, &ldquo;I have been made a knight that I might come against you <font color="green">[Sir Marhaus]</font>, and I have sworn never to leave you until you are conquered or I am dead, for <mark>I will fight to the death to rescue Cornwall from the old truage</mark>.&rdquo; <small> Mabel Quiller Couch, <a name="TRIST" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#TRIST"><cite title="source">Cornwall's Wonderland</cite></a> (1914) 198</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
