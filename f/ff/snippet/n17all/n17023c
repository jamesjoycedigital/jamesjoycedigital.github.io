But the nerves of God are not, as is the case with human bodies, present in limited numbers, but are infinite or eternal. They possess all the properties of human nerves to an enormously intensified degree. In their creative capacity, that is their power of turning themselves into every imaginable object in the created world, they are known as rays. <small> Sigmund Freud, <a name="SFPS" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#SFPS"><cite title="source">&ldquo;Psychoanalytical Notes on an Autobiographic Account of a Case of Paranoia (Dementia Paranoides)&rdquo;</cite></a> (1925) 402</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
