But when the demand reached King Mark, he and his knights absolutely refused to pay the money, and sent the messenger back, with none too polite a message, to say so. If he wanted the debt settled, they said, he could send the noblest knight of his court to fight for it, otherwise the king might whistle for his money. <small> Mabel Quiller Couch, <a name="TRIST" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#TRIST"><cite title="source">Cornwall's Wonderland</cite></a> (1914) 198</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
