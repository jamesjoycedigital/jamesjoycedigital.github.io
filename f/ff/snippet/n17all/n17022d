The patient was so much occupied with these pathological phenomena that he was inaccessible to any other impression and would sit perfectly rigid and motionless for hours (hallucinatory stupor). On the other hand, they tortured him to such a degree that he longed for death. He made repeated attempts at drowning himself in his bath, and asked to be given the &lsquo;cyanide of potassium that was intended for him&rsquo;. His delusional ideas gradually assumed a mystical and religious character; he was in direct communication with God, he was the plaything of devils, he saw &lsquo;miraculous apparitions&rsquo;, he heard &lsquo;<mark>holy music</mark>&rsquo;, and in the end he even came to believe that he was living in another world. <small> Sigmund Freud, <a name="SFPS" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#SFPS"><cite title="source">&ldquo;Psychoanalytical Notes on an Autobiographic Account of a Case of Paranoia (Dementia Paranoides)&rdquo;</cite></a> (1925) 392</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
