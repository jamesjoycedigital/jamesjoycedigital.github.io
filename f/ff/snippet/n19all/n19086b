A sea and the crowds coming by auto-mobile through other gateways, especially Jacksonville. Many are going back. But for every returning car there seems to be ten or fifteen pointed south. That is about the proportion noted by this expedition during the last week on 1,200 miles of the <mark>Dixie trail</mark>. <small> <a name="ECL19oct25" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#ECL19oct25"><cite title="source">Elwood Call-Leader</cite></a> (19 October, 1925) 2</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: Transferred to <a name="n19190d" href="n19all.htm#n19190d">N19 (VI.B.19):190(d)</a> </mm> </dd></dl>
