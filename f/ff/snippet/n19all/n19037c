First I did lumf and widdled, and they looked on. Then I put them on the seat and they widdled and did lumf, and I wiped their behinds with paper. D&apos;you know why? Because I&apos;d so much like to have children; then I&apos;do do everything for them - take them to the W.C., clean their behinds, and do everything one does with children. After the admission afforded by this <mark>phantasy</mark>, it will scarcely be possible to dispute the fact that in Hans&apos;s mind there was pleasure attached to the excremental functions. <small> Sigmund Freud, <a name="SFLH" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#SFLH"><cite title="source">&ldquo;Analysis of a Phobia in a Five-Year old boy&rdquo; (&lsquo;Little Hans&rsquo;)&rdquo;</cite></a> (May 1925) 239</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
