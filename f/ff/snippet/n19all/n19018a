For the last few days a pretty little girl of about eight has been coming to the restaurant where we have lunch. Of course Hans fell in love with her on the spot. He keeps constantly turning round in his chair to take furtive looks at her; when he has finished eating he stations himself in her vicinity so as to flirt with her, but if he finds he is being observed, <mark>he blushes scarlet</mark>. If his glances are returned by the little girl, he at once looks shamefacedly the other way. His behaviour is naturally a great joy to every one lunching at the restaurant. <small> Sigmund Freud, <a name="SFLH" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#SFLH"><cite title="source">&ldquo;Analysis of a Phobia in a Five-Year old boy&rdquo; (&lsquo;Little Hans&rsquo;)&rdquo;</cite></a> (May 1925) 160</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
