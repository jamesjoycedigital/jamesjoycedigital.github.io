Already at the age of four, through his parents&apos; infantile behaviour towards him, a seasoned wanker, Hans wandered in and out of voyeuristic, exhibitionist, scatological, scoptophiliac, sibicidal and Oedipal fantasies. His obsession with his penis knew no bounds and for him onanism was a matter of extreme self-expression. One particular passage in Freud&apos;s account may well have occasioned Joyce&apos;s conception of the scene of the woken child in III.4: &lsquo;Hans (aged four and three-quarters) woke up one morning in tears. Asked why he was crying, he said to his mother: &ldquo;When I was asleep I thought you were gone and I had no Mummy to coax with.&rdquo;&rsquo; The coaxing involved seems to have involved the mother&apos;s fondling of Hans&apos;s genitals, or, at least, of his self-fondling them. Hans&apos;s mother was herself an early patient of Freud.</mm> </dd></dl>
