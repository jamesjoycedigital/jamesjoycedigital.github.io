Can you spend a quarter of an hour in the Brit. Museum and get me the enclosed words. I am cut off from all my books &hellip; I am trying to work &hellip; The Dutch printer is so delighted with what he doesn&apos;t understand of W i P that he offers me 40% (!) if I will let him bring out the fragment like A.L.P. &hellip; Irish Words for / rainbow / angel / blue / orange / green / violet / indigo / dumb / curtain / sailor / Lord / peace / sleep / game / children / The only letters in the Irish alphabet to confuse you are &#xA77D; = g / &#xA785; = s / Please do not forget the pips, e.g. b = b / &#x1E03; = v etc / P.S. I have Goethe&apos;s book in German. </div>
