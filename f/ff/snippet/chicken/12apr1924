I am too exhausted still to discuss the question except to say that, in my opinion, any one page of the Proteus episode, your favourite, needs at least as much annotation as any one page of M.M.Lucia Joyce &mdash; probably more, though naturally a study of youth is livelier than a blur of senility &hellip; I have followed Dr Borsch&apos;s your injunctions so well that I have ceased to work altogether. I even allow the Dublin daily papers to accumulate. Shaun is asleep at his post </div>
