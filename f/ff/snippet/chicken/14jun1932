<div class="nbunit" id="14Jun1932"><font color="red">14 June 1932</font> <i>NLGC</i> (Alf Bergan to Paul L&eacute;on): As far as I could gather I think deceased meant that only his and his wife&apos;s names should be on the tombstone, but he was not definite about it. Neither did he indicate what character the tombstone was to have, but appeared to leave the matter entirely to your client&apos;s discretion. (On back in Paul L&eacute;on hand: &ldquo;In Loving Memory / of / John Stanislaus Joyce, of Cork / born 4 July 1879 dies 29 December 1931 / and of his wife / Mary Jane of Dublin / born 15 May 1869 died 13 August 1903 / R.I.P.&rdquo; Sent 6th December 1932) </div>
