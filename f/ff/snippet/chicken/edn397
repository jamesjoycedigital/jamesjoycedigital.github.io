<div class="nbunit" id="edn397">  397  For another version (appropriately Japanese) of this argument see Masanobu Fukuoka, <i>The One-Straw Revolution</i> (Rodale Press, Emmaus 1978): &lsquo;In the world there are seven basic colours. But if these seven colours are combined, they become white. When split by a prism the white light becomes seven colours. When man views the world with &lsquo;no-mind&rsquo; the colour in the colour vanishes. It is no colour. Only when they are viewed by the seven-coloured mind of discrimination do the seven colours appear.&rsquo;  </div>
