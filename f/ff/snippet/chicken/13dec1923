<div class="nbunit" id="13Dec1923"><font color="red">UPLund 13 December 1923</font> (to Lily Bollach): Let me apologise for my rudeness in leaving such a load of MS for you all of a sudden with a single word of explanation. But I have been working so much and wanted to get rid of it. I do hope the mere sight of it with all the corrections did not annoy you and that you are not too busy at present to type some of it &mdash; if you have been able to read it. Perhaps you can manage to meet me tomorrow (Friday) (14 December 1923) at 6.15 or 6.30 at the corner of Avenue Gabriel? If not convenient for you please fix your own time and place. I shall call to your concierge for the reply. </div>
