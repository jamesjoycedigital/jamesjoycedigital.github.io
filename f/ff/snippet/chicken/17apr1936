<div class="nbunit" id="17Apr1936"><font color="red">17 April 1936</font> <i>NLFF</i> (from T.S. Eliot): We have now made the experiment of having the printers set up the page which you indicated for a test. While it appears to be quite within their powers to print the book from the text as we have it &hellip; the text clearly needs typing out first, and this could best be done in Paris in the way originally suggested &hellip; We understand if we return the manuscript L&eacute;on will have it typed under his supervision, provided we are willing to defray the costs of a typist up to 1000 francs. This we are quite willing to do. It was not clear to me whether you thought the whole of the text should be returned for this purpose, or only the more difficult Part III. It would obviously save a great deal of trouble and expense if you could correct and approve the typescript &hellip; I understand that there is no existing duplicate &hellip; I am proposing to come to Paris myself in about a month&apos;s time &hellip; bring the manuscript with me. </div>
