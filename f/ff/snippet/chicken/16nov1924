<div class="nbunit" id="16Nov1924"><font color="red">16 November 1924</font> <i>Letters I</i> (to Harriet Weaver): Many thanks for <i>Penguin Island</i>. I shall read it again in English &hellip; Borsch &hellip; is to do the operation on me on 27 Instant &mdash; for cataract &hellip; I am preparing for it by trying to learn a page of the <i>Sirens</i> for the record and by pulling down more earthwork. The gangs are now hammering on all sides. It is a bewildering business. I want to do as much as I can before the execution. Complications to right of me, complications to left of me, complex on the page before me, perplex in the pen beside me, duplex in the meandering eyes of me, stuplex on the face that reads me. Amen. And from time to time I lie back and listen to my hair growing whiter. Mr Eliot ran in yesterday with an invitation from the proprietoress which I did not accept but I promised to send him a piece for the review &hellip; Just at present it is hard for me to interest myself in feuds. If anybody were to tell me that Mr Pickwick wrote <i>The Sorrows of Satan</i> I would at once agree. So long as I can ramble on towards idiocy repeating: Are you Charles Floquet, late late everlate? I want you: all is well. </div>
