<div class="nbunit" id="5Jan1939"><font color="red">5 January 1939</font> <i>CUR L 301</i> (Paul L&eacute;on to C. P. Curran): Mr Joyce &hellip; is so exhausted writing the end of his book &mdash; the passing out of the Liffey &mdash; and still so busy over the galleys to be corrected that he is utterly incapable to hold a pen for the moment. The date of the Pantomime he had asked for was 1844 (my bad writing made you think 77) &mdash; but if it is too difficult it can be left alone, However, here is a last request. Could you call up the Gaiety Theatre and ask them in what year (recently) they staged the Pantomime Humpty Dumpty &mdash; and then get the number containing the review of it of the Irish Times or any other paper &mdash; cut it out and send it to him &mdash; as quickly as possible &mdash; as next week he will get already the text paged when it won&apos;t be possible to make any additions any more. A special copy for him is promised for February the 2nd to be followed in a fortnight or so by the regular publication. </div>
