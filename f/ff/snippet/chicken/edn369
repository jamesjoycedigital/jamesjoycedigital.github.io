<div class="nbunit" id="edn369">  369  This extended description of the king's arrival and the ensuing celebrations parodies that of King George IV's arrival in Dublin. The then Lord Mayor, Abraham Bradley King, presented to the king on his arrival in the centre of the city the keys of the City of Dublin, kissing his hand as he did so. The king, royally pleased at this obsequiousness, knighted (the appropriately named) King on the spot. </p><p> The promised arrival of a king, of course, is also that which has already happened: that of the king and retinue outside Humphrey's tavern in I.2.
