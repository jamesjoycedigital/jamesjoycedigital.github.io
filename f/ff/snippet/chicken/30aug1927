<div class="nbunit" id="30Aug1927"><font color="red">30 August 1927</font> <i>BLHW</i> (to Harriet Weaver): This is to &hellip; tell you that the first word of your guess is right with an apostrophe &lsquo;s&rsquo; so I suppose you can finish it. But I wish you would tell me on what words or phrase in question 11 you base your assumption that the model I use is the singer of <i>Mother Machree</i>! I have read it over a half a dozen times always more astonished. I am tempted to add a question 13 (for private perusal) Who is that infallible who pontificates over the arts of architecture, sculpture, drawing, painting, fiction, economics, philosophy etc etc etc etc, who writes as if he were the pope and preaches as if he were a parson, and so on. But it is useless to continue &hellip; an edition of t 6 was printed and bound but I held it up by wire as you may notice from the paging 106a, b, c, d, e, f, etc. I shall wait to see how it is received but I have obtained Miss Beach&apos;s promise that if I decide to ask James Stephens to write parts II and IV and he agrees she will publish the hotchpotch resulting therefrom </div>
