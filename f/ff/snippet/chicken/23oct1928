<div class="nbunit" id="23Oct1928"><font color="red">23 October 1928</font> <i>BLHW</i> (to Harriet Weaver, typed, here corrected): although they changed my lenses I still cannot distinguish a word of print except the large headlines in the newspapers &hellip; My doctor who by the same token has a rivery name Fontaine (cf. Drinkwater) &hellip; Of course I can&apos;t do any work though I take two Spanish lessons per diem through the ear in the insane belief that I shall one day soon be able to come to terms with print again &hellip; Gilbert is preparing an article for the N.R.F. on work in progress &hellip; I am glad you liked ALP &hellip; You will receive a copy of Transition 14 with three articles on my opus by Rodker, Sage and McGreevy. The latter, who did a good deal of copying for me last year is rather useful in explaining parts of it to Eliot for instance &hellip; though Shaun himself [John MacCormack] has been three times in the Trianons this last week &hellip; We did not meet &hellip; I hope he will ride up on a thoroughbred Irish stone wall flier one of these evenings &hellip; I am sure you are passing many valuable things through your hands in going through Miss Marsden&apos;s work and if I had sufficient energy I should be as restless as a little boy outside a pantry thinking of all the nice little bits I could pilfer with no loss to her but oh the difference to me. I do not know that there will be any occasion for such regret in the future as I told the Transition editors that I saw no prospect of doing any work on proofs &hellip; Mr Laney who is kindly typing the present letter &hellip; I will send you in a day or two the only thing I have written in the last four months, a short description of madness and blindness descending upon Swift composed in what Gilbert calls the damnedest trinity of colours, with a commentary </div>
