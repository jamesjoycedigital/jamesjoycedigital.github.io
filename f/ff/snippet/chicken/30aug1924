A year ago I sent you good wishes from S. Patrice. Here there is only  a trace of his nephew (at Elven) and unfortunately his name is German. Though I am a rolling stone I gathered a good deal of moss in Britanny in the way of books and maps and legends &hellip; If I could have closed down the clockwork in my head however the holiday would have been more beatic </div>
