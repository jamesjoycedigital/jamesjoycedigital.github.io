<div class="nbunit" id="edn145">  145  Shaun is talking about wine, of course, of which Joyce himself was very fond. The wine Shaun specifies as Shem's special tipple is <i>Orina di un archiduchessa</i>, known to Joyce as &lsquo;the archduchess's urine&rsquo; and his own favourite. As we read about Shem, we find that he has a great deal in common with Joyce in this self-parody. The book Shem is said to read in his cell is <cite>Ulysses</cite> and the one he is writing is <cite>Finnegans Wake</cite>. The titles of the stories in <cite>Dubliners</cite> can be detected spread out over pages 147-8 (l86-7). <cite>A Portrait</cite> is included at 144.10 (182.19); <cite>Chamber Music</cite> at 145.19 (184.04); and <cite>The Holy Office</cite> at 150.10 (190.13). Nobody reading the present chapter could doubt but that Shem's many failings, down to his piteous eye-patch, derive from Joyce himself. This is in stark contrast the flattering self-portrayals found in his earlier fiction, an indulgence that he here openly mocks.  </div>
