<div class="nbunit" id="23Sep1933"><font color="red">23 September 1933</font> <i>Letters III</i> (to Harriet Weaver from Paul L&eacute;on): Mr Joyce returned &hellip; three weeks ago and almost as soon as he arrived he collapsed with those terrible pains which have poisoned his existence during the last several years &hellip; Mr Joyce had lost seven kilos during the summer &hellip; Mr Budgen &hellip; came with the proofs of his book through which Mr Joyce went with him and Mr Gilbert. It is a long time since I have seen Mr Joyce so interested in anything as he has been in this work making suggestions, remembering points etc. &hellip; Now instead of making progress with his own book he is trying to help Mr Gilbert in a translation of some French novel &hellip; getting an unfurnished flat as the only means of terminating his long neglected book which I believe can only be achieved in some conditions of comfort and ease surrounded by his books which at present are scattered in some three or four different places in two countries </div>
