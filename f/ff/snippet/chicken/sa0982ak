Prideaux disingenuously suggests that it &ldquo;seems to have been purposely raised up by God, to be a scourge to the Christian church for not living in accordance with their most holy religion.&rdquo; The popular excuse is by the free use of the sword; this, however, is mere ignorance: in Mohammed&apos;s day and early Al-Islam only actual fighters were slain: the rest were allowed to pay the Jizyah, or <mark>capitation-tax</mark>, and to become tributaries, enjoying almost all the privileges of Moslems. <small> Richard Burton, &ldquo;Terminal Essay&rdquo; in <a name="RB01" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#RB01"><cite title="source">1000 Nights and 1 Night</cite></a> (Denver, 1919) x.186-7</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
