<div class="nbunit" id="edn193">  193  The exact route is specified: a quick left along &lsquo;Livius Lane,&rsquo; by &lsquo;Mezzofanti Mall,&rsquo; diagonally across &lsquo;Lavatery Square,&rsquo; up &lsquo;Tycho Brahe Crescent,&rsquo; past &lsquo;Berkeley's Alley,&rsquo; across &lsquo;Gainsborough Carfax,&rsquo; under &lsquo;Guido d'Arezzo's Gadeway,&rsquo; and along by &lsquo;New Livius Lane.&rsquo; These highly imaginative names Joyce gives to the route reflect the prime concerns of the chapter, referring as they do to exceptional exponents of the arts and sciences: Livy (history), Mezzofanti (language), Lavater (theology), Tycho Brahe (astronomy), Berkeley (philosophy), Gainsborough (painting), Guido d'Arezzo (music), and Livy again (history). </p><p> Some commentators have attempted to correlate Joyce's directions with real Dublin itineraries. Petr Skrabanek (<cite>AWN</cite> 10 (1973), 22-3) suggests that the traveller (who, we may add, is probably riding a bike), after a quick lunch in one of the pubs near Arran Quay, follows the Liffey downstream as far as the Custom House, veers left into Amiens Street to get onto the North Circular Road, passing Berkeley Road on route to the intersection with Phibsborough Road, then descends into the North Circular Road and gets as far as the main entrance to the Phoenix Park before returning along the river. Plotting the route, Skrabanek argues that it traces out a rough <i>vescis pescia</i> as exemplified in the geometrical diagram on page 226 (293), where <i>APL</i> represents the left bank of the Liffey and <i>L&#960;A</i> the North Circular Road. The traveller moves from <i>&#960;</i> to A, turns left at A, goes to L, continues L to P, and thence reaches P to A. The Square (not exactly a square) would be <i>&#960;</i>ALP. Skrabanek somewhat fantastically conjectures (who knows?) that the parallelogram <i>&#945;&#955;&#960;P</i> from the Euclid sketch &lsquo;is the part of the mother's bottom exposed to the lavatory bowl.&rsquo;  </div>
