<div class="nbunit" id="b27Jun1938"><font color="red">27 June 1938</font> <i>NLFF</i> (from Richard de la Mere to Paul L&eacute;on):  I have noted that you expect to return me that music sheet quite soon. I shall be glad to have it back, as the printers will shortly be held up if I am not able to send them the missing block. </div>
