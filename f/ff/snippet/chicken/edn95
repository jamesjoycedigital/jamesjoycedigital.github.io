<div class="nbunit" id="edn95">  95  A &lsquo;howe&rsquo; (ON) is a hill or hillock or a tumulus or a grave. Wellington's Monument is intended. At 44.20 (56.12), the cad calls it an &lsquo;overgrown leadpencil which was soon, monomentally at least, to rise to be his mausoleum.&rsquo; It is also the Earwicker's domicile/shack. That the area was flooded at the time of the encounter reflects the detail at 29.02 (36.14): &lsquo;above the ambijacent floodplain, scene of its happenence.&rsquo; The path is discussed at length at 63.38ff (80.01ff) where it is described as a <i>vicinal</i> in such poor repair that no trespass is legally possible, as a Flaminian way paved by one hundred thousand slaves, and as Dublin's finest, O'Connell Street. On this occasion of viewing it, it is situated &lsquo;near the Serpentine in Phornix Park;&rsquo; that is, near the monument. Scattered along the path, we are told, are the headstones of the unfortunate slaves who helped to lay it, transmogrified into milestones. In III.3 these details are scrupulously examined by the Four (<font face="wake">X</font>) and the significant business of the path is looked at again; see 371.13ff. (478.06ff).  </div>
