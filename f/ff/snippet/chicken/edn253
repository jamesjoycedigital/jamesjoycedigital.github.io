<div class="nbunit" id="edn253">  253  Joyce particularises here the better known of Diarmuid's exploits: how he bound men with ropes so tightly that none could ever loosen the knots; the <i>geasa</i> or moral obligation put upon him by Grainne to carry her off, explaining to him that she had seen him before at a goaling (hurley) match and admired his freckles and red cheeks; his words sweet as the song of the robin; how he pole-vaulted over doors rather than quietly walk through them; his sleeping out of doors in makeshift beds woven of soft rushes; his eating of the magical berries of the quicken-tree that gave immortality; the three kisses he disrespectfully gave Grainne in the sight of Finn; and so on. See in this interesting context, Danis Rose and John O'Hanlon, &lsquo;Finn MacCool and the Final Weeks of Work in Progress,&rsquo; <cite>AWN</cite> (17, 69-87, October 1980).  </div>
