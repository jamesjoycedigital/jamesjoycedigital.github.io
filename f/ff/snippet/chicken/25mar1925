<div class="nbunit" id="25Mar1925"><font color="red">25 March 1925</font> <i>Letters III</i> (dict to Lucia Joyce): I was able just to finish the revision of the piece for Mr Eliot but fear it would have to be copied out again as I doubt whether any typist would be able to make it out. There was little or no improvement in the sight of my right eye until the last few days when fresh trouble broke out in it &hellip; I should like to hear Vico read to me again in the hope that some day I may be able to write again. I put an advertisement in the Mail for a reader but got not even one reply </div>
