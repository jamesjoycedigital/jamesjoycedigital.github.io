<div class="nbunit" id="20Jun1923"><font color="red">20 June 1923</font> <i>BLHW</i> (to Harriet Weaver): Wednesday 3.45p. The wind is blowing up into a nice storm. It is worse than yesterday. It is not only a question of our nerves etc. but also the long standing about on the piers here and in Dover while they are checking luggage and passports? I don&apos;t want to risk it with my eyes. This is extremely tiresome. If possible we will cross by early boat tomorrow. </div>
