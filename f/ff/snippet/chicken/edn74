<div class="nbunit" id="edn74">  74  The man in the garden is none other than the cad, though his get-up is described in very Berwick-upon-Tweed terms: &lsquo;scratch wig, squarecuts, stock lavaleer, regattable oxeter, baggy pants and shufflers.&rsquo; He addresses the child hangers-on in his &lsquo;native&rsquo; language, Irish, just as he did Earwicker. His recollection of the details of his meeting with HCE and of Earwicker's stuttered response is faulty; though we are to understand that he represents an essential link in the passing on of the story. Why he fled to England is not discussed.  </div>
