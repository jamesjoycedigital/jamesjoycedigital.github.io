<div class="nbunit" id="26Nov1938"><font color="red">26 November 1938</font> <i>NLFF</i> (from Paul L&eacute;on to Richard de la Mere): I am sending you &hellip; the corrected revise of the 64 first pages. As you will see, except for the creation of a new paragraph quite near the beginning and two missing hyphens on one page there are no alterations whatever. There won&apos;t be any dedication or preface &hellip; </div>
