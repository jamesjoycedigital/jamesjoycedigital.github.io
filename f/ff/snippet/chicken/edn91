<div class="nbunit" id="edn91">  91  <i>Magh Elta></i>, the Old Plain of Elta, appears also at 14.09 (17.19), where Mutt speaks of the countless souls that perished there. The plain was historically the most ancient in Ireland and so barren nothing could grow there. An early colonist of Ireland, Parthalon, and his people, a group of some nine thousand in all, died there of a terrible plague. They were buried in a mass grave at Tallaght. The plain is said to have embraced the isthmus of Sutton. Cf. 3.05 (3.05) and 14.04 (17.11).  </p><p> Lough Neagh in Northern Ireland is said to possess the power of petrifaction. On calm days the roofs of the houses of a sunken city are reputedly visible under its waters. Hence the seven towers of HCE's grave. Joyce wrote (<cite>Letters</cite>, III, 26 February 1935) that under the lake &lsquo;there is said to be buried a kind of Atlantis.&rsquo; &lsquo;Others say,&rsquo; he adds, &lsquo;Finn MacCool in anger took a sod of turf out of Ireland and flung it into the sea, making 1) Lough Neagh 2) Isle of Man.&rsquo; The reference to a sod re-connects Lough Neagh (called &lsquo;Lough Murph,&rsquo; another dead sea, at 212.30 (272.23f) with HCE. Hence &lsquo;as much in demand among misonesans as the Isle of Man today among limniphobes,&rsquo; and &lsquo;after the Fianna's foreman had taken his handful&rsquo; at 61.11-14 (76.22-25).  </div>
