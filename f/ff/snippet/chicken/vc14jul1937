<div class="nbunit" id="vc14Jul1937"><font color="red">14 July 1937</font> <i>NLCV</i> (from Viscount Carlow to Paul L&eacute;on): Viscount Carlow is anxious to have pulled final proofs &hellip; and I find that the book of &ldquo;Storiella as She is Syung&rdquo; was returned to you a little while ago. Would you be good enough, therefore, to let us have it, in order that we may send Mr Joyce final proofs? </div>
