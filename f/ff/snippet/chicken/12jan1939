<div class="nbunit" id="12Jan1939"><font color="red">12 January 1939</font> <i>NLFF</i> (from Paul L&eacute;on to Richard de la Mere): Here are the two last quires of the second revise of the marginal notes, received yesterday. Barring slight corrections on page 303 and 304, there is a question of page 307. I strongly object to the indentation of the text as it spoils the idea of a text-book annotated by studying children. Could not the solution be adopted of increasing the spaces between the lines and between the words as this is sometimes done in text-books. &hellip; I also omitted yesterday one correction on the first revise of page 308. It is also enclosed. </div>
