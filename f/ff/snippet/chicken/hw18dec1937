<div class="nbunit" id="hw18Dec1937"><font color="red">18 December 1937</font> <i>Letters III</i> (from Paul L&eacute;on to Harriet Weaver): Mr Joyce has given me a considerable amount of autograph pages which are destined for you. They are additional pages of corrections and enlargements for Part II of WIP. May I know whether I can send them to your usual address &hellip; I am seeing Mr Joyce rather rarely now and then only for work. My part of it seems to be done but it takes some five or six other people to check the corrections, verify the additions and read the proofs. Himself, he does the composing part quite alone and from what I hear of Mr Joyce he works daily to about five in the morning </div>
