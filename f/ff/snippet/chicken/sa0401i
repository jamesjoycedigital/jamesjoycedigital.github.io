Eastern peoples have a practice of &ldquo;passing on&rdquo; venereal and other diseases, and transmission is supposed to cure the patient; for instance <mark>a virgin heals (and catches) gonorrhoea</mark>. Syphilis varies greatly with climate. In Persia it is said to be propagated without contact: in Abyssinia it is often fatal and in Egypt it is readily cured by sand baths and sulphur-unguents. Lastly in lands like Unyamwezi, where mercurials are wholly unknown, I never saw caries of the nasal or facial bones. <small> Richard Burton, &ldquo;Terminal Essay&rdquo; in <a name="RB01" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#RB01"><cite title="source">1000 Nights and 1 Night</cite></a> (Denver, 1919) x.90.n.2</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
