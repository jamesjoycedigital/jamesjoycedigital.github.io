<div class="nbunit" id="26Jan1938"><font color="red">26 January 1938</font> <i>NLFF</i> (from Geoffrey Faber to JJ): We could publish on &hellip; July 4, provided that (1) we received the rest of the MS within the next two or three weeks (2) both you and we could be sure that the correction of the proofs would not take you too long a time. I propose to treat Mr L&eacute;on&apos;s letter as if it had not been written, and to end simply with an appeal to you to reconcile yourself to publication in September &hellip; and not to carry out the idea of breaking off your work now, just when the completion is in sight. </div>
