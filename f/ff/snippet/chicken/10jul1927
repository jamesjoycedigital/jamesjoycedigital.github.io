<div class="nbunit" id="10Jul1927"><font color="red">10 July 1927</font> <i>Letters III</i> (to Harriet Weaver): That clergyman&apos;s name is Rev. James Cropper. Ireland&apos;s Eye (ey = island in Danish) is an islet off Howth Head. Phoenix Park is rather close but it is a place not built by hands &mdash; at least not all &mdash; whereas <font face="wake">N</font> is. I have been checking proof after proof and am tired. The dinner I had arranged for at Miss Beach&apos;s between J.J. and S. is of course off for the present. The footnote about him in the book I send confirms my statement </div>
