I have been working ten hours a day in semi-dark for the past seven months. I am to be operated on when the fine weather comes I suppose in May &hellip; I hope to resume with Shaun tomorrow. I had done about a third. But he (already a dawdler) will be longer on the road.  &hellip; strangely enough, the Shaun the Post piece is very amusing &mdash; to me, at least. It is extremely hard to write. </div>
