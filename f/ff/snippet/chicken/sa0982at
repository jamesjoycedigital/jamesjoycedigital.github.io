Viewed as a tout ensemble in full and complete form, they are a drama of Eastern life, and a Dance of Death made sublime by faith and the highest emotions, by the certainty of expiation and the fulness of atoning equity, where virtue is victorious, vice is vanquished and the ways of Allah are justified to man. They are a panorama which remains <mark>ken-speckle</mark> upon the mental retina. They form a phantasmagoria in which archangels and angels, devils and goblins, men of air, of fire, of water, naturally mingle with men of earth; where flying horses and talking fishes are utterly realistic: where King and Prince meet fisherman and pauper, lamia and cannibal; where citizen jostles Badawi, eunuch meets knight; the Kazi hob-nobs with the thief; the pure and pious sit down to the same tray with the bawd and the pimp; where the professional religionist, the learned Koranist and the strictest moralist consort with the wicked magician, the scoffer and the debauchee-poet like Abu Nowas; where the courtier jests with the boor and where the sweep is bedded with the noble lady. <small> Richard Burton, &ldquo;Terminal Essay&rdquo; in <a name="RB01" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#RB01"><cite title="source">1000 Nights and 1 Night</cite></a> (Denver, 1919) x.156-7</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: Ken-speckled [Scottish]: easily recognizable; conspicuous.
