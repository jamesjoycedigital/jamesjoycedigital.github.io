Curran): Mr Joyce asks me to write to you to beg you if possible to find him in the course of the week a criticism in the newspapers of a pantomime produced in Dublin in 1844 called Harlequin, Shaun and Lanthero &mdash; [must be Xmas or Lent or Easter] You had also promised to get him a Directory for last year &mdash; would it be possible to get it this week?
