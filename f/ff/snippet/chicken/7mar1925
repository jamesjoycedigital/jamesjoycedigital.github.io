<div class="nbunit" id="7Mar1925"><font color="red">7 March 1925</font> <i>Letters III</i> (in big black pencil): This is the most I can do so please forgive the style of paper and pen. My lease of this flat was up on the 15 instant &hellip; I asked to have it renewed for two months &hellip; I cannot see a word of print yet. It is very boring. Mr Eliot wrote to say that April no. had gone to press. Mr Auguste Morel helps me and with him, some red ink and a magnifying glass I shall have the piece ready before the tooth and eye act starts &hellip; I wish I could do more but it is useless to think until these new troubles are over, but I will send you the Criterion piece (new version) as soon as I can. &hellip; I wanted to send you a new book by Mr Pound, a large paper edition of the kind you do not like much but I will wait till I can write better.</div>
