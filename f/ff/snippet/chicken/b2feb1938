Thus it took them five weeks to do half of what they had received and what was in an absolutely clear typescript without many corrections. They have not done yet a part of some 6000 words also in absolute complete form without corrections and additions and the completion of which must have cost Mr Joyce surely more than he has received as advance payment &hellip;  </div>
