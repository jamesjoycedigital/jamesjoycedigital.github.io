<div class="nbunit" id="27Jun1924"><font color="red">27 June 1924</font> <i>Letters I</i> (to Harriet Weaver): It is now seventeen days since the operation &hellip; The eye is still bandaged but I am allowed to read as well as I can with the other.I am very doubtful of the result. So far there is practicaly no improvement in the vision &hellip; The long drudgery and disappointment in Trieste &hellip; and then the labour of <i>Ulysses</i> must have undermined my strength &hellip; I mention this because whenever I am obliged to lie with my eyes closed I see a cinematograph going on and on and it brings back to my memory things I had almost forgotten. The sight I have now &hellip; is not enough to do the kind of work I feel impelled to do except very slowly and painfully and in very favourable conditions of light and climate which Paris does not offer &hellip; Bloom&apos;s day &hellip; For instance Shaun, after a long absurd and rather incestuous Lenten lecture to Izzy, his sister, takes leave of her &ldquo;with a half a glance of Irish frisky from under the shag of his parallel brows&rdquo;. These are the words the reader will see but not those he will hear. He also alludes to Shem as my &ldquo;soamheis&rdquo; brother; he means Siamese. This is a better room &hellip; I found that my memory was getting lame so in the clinic I started to learn by heart the Lady of the Lake &hellip; It is not a sign of intelligence but it is very useful. I have invented a whole system of my own &mdash; by which I keep my brains from falling about but I have been forced to drop most of it owing to the grotesque way I live now. I showed Mr Larbaud the signs I was using for my notes HCE Anna Livia Shem Shaun. He laughed at them but it saves time </div>
