<div class="nbunit" id="bff24May1938"><font color="red">24 May 1938</font> <i>NLFF</i> (from Richard de la Mere to Paul L&eacute;on): Mr Eliot&apos;s letter to you of May 23rd, which was written, I think, before your letter of May 18th arrived &hellip; two further points &hellip; The first is with regard to the musical quotation which has to go on galley 25. Then my second question is: does Mr Joyce intend to give each part of the book a separate title? I think it would be a good plan &hellip; to let me have a typewritten copy of those parts of galleys 15 and 16 that you point out as being especially heavily corrected, and I will then send that on to the printers as a further check. </div>
