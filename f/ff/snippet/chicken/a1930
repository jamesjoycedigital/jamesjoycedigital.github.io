True, the help was slight, and there were others in his entourage who also lent a hand and a head. &hellip; The Joyces were living in Square Robiac then, and it was a relatively carefree time for all of them, it now seems to me, looking back on it. &hellip; Joyce was there alone, with Herbert Gorman. &hellip; &ldquo;We&apos;ve just worked your name into into <cite>Work in Progress</cite>,&rdquo; Gorman announced. I made a suitable reply. (The name is in the book, but, I am forced to think, impersonally: &ldquo;&mdash;The S.S. Paudraic&apos;s in the harbour.&rdquo;) </div>
