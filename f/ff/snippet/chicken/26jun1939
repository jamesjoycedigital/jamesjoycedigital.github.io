<div class="nbunit" id="26Jun1939"><font color="red">26 June 1939</font> <i>NLFF</i> (from Morley Kennerley to Paul L&eacute;on): We should very much appreciate your letting us know what you would like us to say in the <i>Irish Times</i> advertisement. Should you wish us to use quotes from reviews the best ones are, I think, those which have appeared in the <i>Listener</i> and <i>New Statesman</i>. The <i>Schoolmaster</i> gave the book an excellent notice but a quote from that paper would not be particularly effective. </div>
