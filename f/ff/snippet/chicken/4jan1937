<div class="nbunit" id="4Jan1937"><font color="red">4 January 1937</font> <i>NLCV</i> (from Viscount Carlow to Paul L&eacute;on): Viscount Carlow &hellip; will be coming to Paris on Thursday, 7th January &hellip; He is bringing the proof of the first pages of the story by Mr James Joyce he is printing. In his opinion it does not appear practicable to have the large &ldquo;R&rdquo; designed by Lucia Joyce in the footnote. The reason being that the first page is apt to be short and would bring the Capital &ldquo;A&rdquo; and the Capital &ldquo;R&rdquo; too close together &hellip; About half way through the book there is a new section starting with the word &ldquo;Thanks&rdquo;, and Viscount Carlow suggests that a capital &ldquo;T&rdquo; could be put in there. </div>
