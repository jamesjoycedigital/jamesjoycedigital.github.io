<div class="nbunit" id="25Apr1924"><font color="red">25 April 1924</font> <i>Beach Letters</i> (to Sylvia Beach): I work only 3 hours a day. I have finished the second draft (not the final) of the first part of Shaun the Post. When it is written out I shall call and inflict it on you in two or three days. The second part (far more difficult) I dare not even attempt yet Perhaps the semi-completion of the first part will aid me </div>
