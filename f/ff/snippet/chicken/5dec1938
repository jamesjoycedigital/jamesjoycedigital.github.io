<div class="nbunit" id="5Dec1938"><font color="red">5 December 1938</font> <i>NLHW</i> (from Harriet Weaver to Paul L&eacute;on): Mr Joyce telephoned me on the evening of November 13th that he had finished <i>Work in Progress</i> that night. No doubt he has had many proofs to correct since but I hope these too are finished or almost finished. </div>
