<div class="nbunit" id="29Jul1924"><font color="red">29 July 1924</font> <i>Letters I</i> (to Valery Larbaud): ((On Irish language)) I shall answer your questions on Breton in a few days but I think Breton, though more spoken, has incorporated more Latin words (for an obvious reason) than Irish has. I think the Latin words in Irish are chiefly (I) ecclesiastical &mdash; the oldest (sagart = priest-sacerdos: leabhar = book, liber) (2) administrative &mdash; Norman and Norman-English (post = post: seanad = senate) As for English words of Anglo-Saxon origin they should be rare. The Irish peasant had no need to change the word uisge (ishg&ouml;) into &lsquo;water&rsquo;. And though Breton (when &hellip; blessed by rome and c&acirc;lin&eacute; by S. Pseudonymous and Co) is probably more picturesque, of course Irish as a language is FAR SUPERIOR </div>
