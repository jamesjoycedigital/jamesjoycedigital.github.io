<div class="nbunit" id="endJul1939"><font color="red">end July 1939</font> <i>Letters I</i> (to Frank Budgen): The part of <cite>F.W.</cite> accepted as easiest to read is section pp. 104 et seq and the most difficult of all &hellip; pp. 260 et seq&mdash;yet the technique here is a reproduction of a schoolboy&apos;s (and schoolgirl&apos;s) old classbook complete with marginalia by the twins, who change sides at half time, footnotes by the girl (who doesn&apos;t), a Euclid diagram, funny drawings etc. It was like that in Ur of the Chaldees too, I daresay. </div>
