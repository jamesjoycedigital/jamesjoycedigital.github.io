I could not reply as my eyes were dilated with scopolamine and at twelve o&apos;clock today I enter the clinique for a 7th operation. Please excuse me but I have a long piece that I wanted you to be kind enough to type for me but it must wait till I come out when I hope you will not be so overworked </div>
