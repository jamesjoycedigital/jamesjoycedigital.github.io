<div class="nbunit" id="1Feb1939"><font color="red">1 February 1939</font> <i>NLFF</i> (from Richard de la Mere to Paul L&eacute;on): Thank you so much for your letter of January 30th. I was truly delighted to hear that Mr Joyce was pleased with the appearance of his book. I think you have made it quite clear about those two final corrections, so I will now tell the printers to finish off the machining. Please let me know &hellip; of the criticisms, if any, Mr Joyce has to make about the binding, on which I do not care very much for the style of lettering at present &hellip; also if he agrees to leave the design of the jacket to our discretion. </div>
