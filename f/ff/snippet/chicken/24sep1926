<div class="nbunit" id="24Sep1926"><font color="red">24 September 1926</font> <i>Letters I and BLHW</i> (to Harriet Weaver): <b><font face="wake">D</font></b>abcd was accepted by the <i>Dial</i> for 600 dollars and a week later they cabled, declining to print it as it stood whereupon I recalled it. (I enclose it in four pictures from the G.P.O vestibule here.) I then set to work, in spite of moving about, to finish the <font face="wake">A</font> [triangle] piece for Wyndham Lewis &hellip; I finished it and sent it to Paris to be typed and hope to correct it tomorrow and send it to you with the MS. I suppose no other review will take <b><font face="wake">D</font></b>abcd &hellip; Antwerp I renamed Gnantwerp &hellip; I finished my course of 64 Flemish lessons and will use bits of the language I have picked up for friend Sookerson, I think.
