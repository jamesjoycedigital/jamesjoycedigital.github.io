<div class="nbunit" id="sb16Jan1927"><font color="red">N.D. January 1927</font> (from Sylvia Beach to Wyndham Lewis, draft in J&apos;s hand, Buffalo X.G.1): I am greatly surprised not to have had any reply to my several letters and therefore send this registered. Have you received and accepted Mr Joyce&apos;s MS and if so when will it appear? In view of what has occurred he has decided to try to secure American copyright for everything he publishes here and he wishes to know the approximate date of the appearance of your review so that he may instruct his agent in New York to place it there about the same time. I enclose a protest about the case and will be glad if you will return it signed. </div>
