<div class="nbunit" id="edn75">  75  John D'Esterre was slain by Daniel O'Connell in a duel. Legend has it that O'Connell wore a black glove on his right hand. D'Esterre was a protestant from Limerick, a member of Dublin Corporation, an ex-officer of the marines, and reputedly one of the best shots that ever fired a pistol. The duel, held at dusk on a snowy day at Bishop's Court, was arranged to kill O'Connell. D'Esterre fired first but missed his man. O'Connell fired next, wounding D'Esterre in the thigh, mortally, as he died the following day. O'Connell offered to pay half of his income to D'Esterre's widow, but she declined his offer. Some years later, O'Connell successfully defended D'Esterre's daughter, free of charge, in a troublesome law suit.  </div>
