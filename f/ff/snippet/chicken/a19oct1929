<div class="nbunit" id="a19Oct1929"><font color="red">19 October 1929</font> <i>Letters I</i> (to Harriet Weaver, typed): I have not stopped working yet But I had better send you off some news. Crosby Gaige&apos;s successor Wells wrote for another fragment and I am trying to leave the city piece fit to submit to his agent here. I have finished however the work for <i>Transition</i> and also my connection with the review as you will see by a note in it. </div>
