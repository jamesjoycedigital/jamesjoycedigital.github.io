<div class="nbunit" id="24Jan1939"><font color="red">24 January 1939</font> <i>NLFF</i> (from Richard de la Mere to Paul L&eacute;on): I had a further look at those proofs that arrived today and about which I spoke to you on the telephone this morning &hellip; decided &hellip; not to bother you with further revised proofs &hellip; they sent off to you yesterday the remaining page proofs of the end of the book, and they will be sending you either today or tomorrow the revised proofs of that signature that was so heavily corrected &hellip; Would &hellip; Mr Joyce &hellip; like the title of the book to be printed in red on the title-page, the rest of the wording being left in black, of course. </div>
