<div class="nbunit" id="14Feb1924"><font color="red">14 February 1924</font> <i>STA</i> (to Lily Bollach): I am also enclosing some additional MS [<a name="g2d2" href="../../ff/fdra/gda.htm#g2d2">I.7&sect;2.2</a>] and I hope you will be able to find time to type it. The fault is of course in my own eyesight as the other sheets are quite legible to anyone else but if I am not troubling you too much I should prefer to have the MS typed heavy like the last sheets you were kind enough to do. P.S. Will you please retype from the word &lsquo;gallons&rsquo; to avoid a break and also could you let me have two blank sheets to serve as title and end page. </div>
