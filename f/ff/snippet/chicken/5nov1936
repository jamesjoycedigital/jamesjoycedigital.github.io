<div class="nbunit" id="5Nov1936"><font color="red">5 November 1936</font> <i>NLHW</i> (from Paul L&eacute;on to Harriet Weaver): Mr Joyce has asked me to forward to you the enclosed pages from a new fragment due to appear in the next number of TRANSITION. Ever since he has returned from Copenhagen he has never been out, or hardly, sees almost nobody, and sits listlessly within his four walls. Just about five days ago he has started to prepare for publication a short new fragment to be issued in Transition, hence the pages included. </div>
