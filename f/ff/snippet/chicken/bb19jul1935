<div class="nbunit" id="bb19Jul1935"><font color="red">19 July 1935</font> <i>NLHW</i> (from Paul L&eacute;on to Harriet Weaver): Of the second part the section of plays is finished. The greater part of the lessons has just come out in Transition. It leaves two sections to be done &mdash; the stories (one or two of which are ready) and the going to sleep. The Epilogue could be written while the thing went through the press. In fact I should say that six months or a year at most of labour would bring the work to an end. But when and where would we get this lapse of time?, the gaiety, the security the moral support necessary? One remark let fall yesterday brings me to the material side. He was speaking to the Doctor about his work and then turning to me he added: there is not ten cents of money in my work. I can see nothing but a dark wall in front of me, a dark wall or a precipice if you prefer physically, morally, materially. </div>
