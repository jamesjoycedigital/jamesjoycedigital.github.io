<div class="nbunit" id="bff15Dec1938"><font color="red">15 December 1938</font> <i>NLFF</i> (from Richard de la Mere to Paul L&eacute;on): Thank you for your two letters of December 17th and &hellip; December 10th &hellip; delayed in the post. The page proofs up to p.256 have arrived safely, so our printers will now have quite a fair amount of printing to get on with &hellip; rest of the galley proofs for revising in page form &mdash; I was glad to have the batch that I received from you this morning, the 30 galleys to follow on page 355. Yes, I think it best perhaps to complete the correction on the remaining galleys in advance of the page proofs that you still have &hellip; The additional correction that you sent me for p.197 has bee noted. I was most interested to hear about the title &hellip; may I tell [Mr H] about it? &hellip; Regarding the cover &hellip; any preference about colour? &hellip;P.S. I spoke to Mr Eliot about the unpublished poem of Lord Byron&apos;s and he thanked you for telling him about it and said that he would be writing to you shortly. P.P.S. I am sending you with this letter the new galley proofs for the last pages of the book. </div>
