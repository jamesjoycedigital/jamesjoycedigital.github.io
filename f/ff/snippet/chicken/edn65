<div class="nbunit" id="edn65">  65  Cf. <a name="n03130a" href="../fnbs/n03all.htm#n03130a">N3 (VI.B.3).130(a)</a>: &lsquo;Pop has a Waterbury watch.&rsquo; Jurgensen is another kind of watch. Earwicker's fear of being violently assaulted dogs him throughout the book. It perhaps reflects the Englishman's instinctive dread of the Irishman. The watch that he pulls out may well be a real watch, but it may equally be a shooter (he was quick to draw it, after all) whipped from a holster with the settled intention of perforating the cad with lead. In this sense, the threatening originates in and emanates from HCE. It is he who initiates the menace by raising a staff &mdash; his &lsquo;tigerwood roadstaff&rsquo; or &lsquo;copperstick&rsquo; &mdash; to the cad. Which of the pair is aggressor and which aggrieved remains ambiguous, the sword of certainty (alas) never falling.  </div>
