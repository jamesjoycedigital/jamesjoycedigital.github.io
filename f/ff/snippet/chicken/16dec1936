<div class="nbunit" id="16Dec1936"><font color="red">16 December 1936</font> <i>NLVP</i> (from Ben Huebsch to Paul L&eacute;on): I learn from Jolas, who is sailing for Europe next week, that he has received a considerable instalment of &ldquo;Work in Progress&rdquo; for publication in &ldquo;transition&rdquo;, and that copy of the book has been sent to Faber and Faber from time to time. Also that Joyce has in mind the idea of publication this year. I wrote to Fabers more than a month ago suggesting that we discuss the manner and place in which the book should be manufactured, proposing that we produce it on this side in order to safeguard the author&apos;s copyright, and sell sheets or electrotypes to them. Thus far there has been no reply. It would be to Mr Joyce&apos;s advantage in every way if production were to take place in America, for he would thus not only protect his rights here, but he would avoid the need of examining or having examined two sets of proofs. The reading of a single set in itself is sufficiently formidable. </div>
