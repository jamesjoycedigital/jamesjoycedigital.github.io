<div class="nbunit" id="6Jan1938"><font color="red">6 January 1938</font> <i>NLFF</i> (from T.S. Eliot to Paul L&eacute;on): &hellip; surprise &hellip; I was no more aware than was apparently Mr Huebsch of how near the book was to completion &hellip; although the bulk of the proof had been sent over, some of it a considerable time back, we have had no corrected proof returned to us, and no indication from Mr Joyce that he was working on the proof and intended to let us have it all back at once &hellip; impossible &hellip; to produce the book in the spring &hellip; if we have the complete material in hand in a final form by 2 February, it will I assure you be none too soon for our needs if we are to bring the book out in the autumn &hellip; in returning the galleys Mr Joyce should make his divisions very clear, and should state how he wants the page proofs arranged: where he wants sub-headings, and where he would like to have half-titles and titles. By half-titles I mean a blank page with the title of the following section of the book upon it  </div>
