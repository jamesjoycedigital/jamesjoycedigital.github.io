<div class="nbunit" id="edn392">  392  Regarding this, Joyce wrote to Frank Budgen in August 1939: &lsquo;Reread the second paragraph in the hagiographic triptych in Part IV (S. L. O'Toole is only adumbrated). Much more is intended in the colloquy between Berkeley the arch druid and his pidgin speech and Patrick the arch priest and his Nippon English. It is also the defence and indictment of the book itself, B's theory of colours, and Patrick's practical solution of the problem. Hence the phrase in the preceding Mutt and Jeff banter &ldquo;Dies is dorminus master&rdquo; = <i>Deus est Dominus noster</i> plus the day is Lord over sleep, i.e. when it days&rsquo; (<cite>Letters</cite> I, 406; <cite>Selected Letters</cite>, 398). </p><p> The confrontation takes place somewhere between the hills of Tara and Slane, nine miles to the north-east. In this connection consider also Joyce's explication (translated from the original Italian): &lsquo;Tara was the Mecca and the Jerusalem of the ancient Irish. The island was a pentarchy = 5 kings. One for each of the four provinces, Ulster, Munster, Leinster, Connaught and the fifth, the high king (<i>ard ri</i>) was crowned at Tara. Saint Patrick went there to confront the druid priests, just like Moses in Egypt. He performed every kind of miracle, too. Every fire in Ireland was supposed to be extinguished except the royal fire at Slane, I think. Patrick roused the druids' ire by lighting the Paschal fire. It was Holy Saturday.&rsquo; (<cite>Letters</cite> III, 345).  </div>
