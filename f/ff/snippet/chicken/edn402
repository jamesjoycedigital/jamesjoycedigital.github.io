<div class="nbunit" id="edn402">  402  St. Laurence O&apos;Toole, the city&apos;s patron saint, was born in Dublin in the year 1100 and canonised in 1225. His feast day is 14 November. He was consecrated Bishop of Glendalough, and was thence, the first native-born bishop to do so, translated to the Archiepiscopal See of Dublin. When a young man, Laurence was held captive by Dermot MacMurrough, King of Leinster, after the saint&apos;s father was suspected of treachery. He later found refuge at Glendaloch monastery. O&apos;Toole signed the capitulation of the city with Earl Strongbow, but while the treaty was completing the Anglo-Normans, led on by Miles and Raymond de Cogan, forced an entrance and sacked and plundered the town. O&apos;Toole&apos;s property alone was spared, as a mark of respect. He died in 1180 in Eu, northern France. His body was buried in Normandy, but his heart (physically) returned to Ireland. This heart was held as a relic in Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin, but, now some 800 years old, was stolen in 2012. The box in which it was kept was a wooden one, protected by an iron cage. And displayed in the cathedral&apos;s Chapel of St Laud. The thief prised the cage open and took off with the box. Nothing more was heard or seen of the missing heart until April 2018 when, mysteriously, the sacred relic was discovered in the Phoenix Park and restored to the cathedral.  </div>
