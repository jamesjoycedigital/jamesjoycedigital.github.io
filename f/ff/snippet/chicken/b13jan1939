<div class="nbunit" id="b13Jan1939"><font color="red">13 January 1939</font> <i>NLFF</i> (from Richard de la Mere to Paul L&eacute;on): I am very much afraid that your further corrections for pages 306 and 307 will need to be shown to you again, so I am asking our printers to send you further revised proofs of those pages. You know the difficulty about these side-notes has been caused by Mr Joyce not telling us about them when the we originally started setting the book up, and much of what you have been asking us to do recently has been almost impossible to do well on account of that fact &hellip;  </div>
