<div class="nbunit" id="22Nov1931"><font color="red">22 November 1931</font> <i>Letters III</i> (to T.S. Eliot): I was waiting for the proof promised me when we decided that the one pulled on 21 September was not clear enough. It has now (21 November) reached me and apparently was pulled on 16 October and is identical with that of 21 September, see enclosed. I suppose that ends the matter. Do you want to set up part I? If so, I could send it. </div>
