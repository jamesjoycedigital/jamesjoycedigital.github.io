<div class="nbunit" id="ff24May1938"><font color="red">24 May 1938</font> <i>NLFF</i> (from Richard de la Mere to Paul L&eacute;on):  I think it would be a good plan &hellip; to let me have a typewritten copy of those parts of galleys 15 and 16 that you point out as being especially heavily corrected, and I will then send that on to the printers as a further check. </div>
