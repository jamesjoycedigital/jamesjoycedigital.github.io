<div class="nbunit" id="edn45">  45  Clontarf field was formed by filling in with rubbish. HCE's impressive defecation is directly identified with the formation of <big><font face="wake">N</font></big> (the mound, midden, barrow, wheelbarrow, mastaba, kistvaen, dump, refuse heap, grave, as well as tavern and book). In this sense, his extraordinary turd represents the original fecund egg of the cosmos from which creation was hatched. At a different level, the movement is seen as the fall of Humpty Dumpty (HCE equated with his own turd) and the point of assassination as the impact and cracking/fragmentation of the shell.  </div>
