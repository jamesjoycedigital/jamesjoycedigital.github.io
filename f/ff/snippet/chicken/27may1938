<div class="nbunit" id="27May1938"><font color="red">27 May 1938</font> <i>NLFF</i> (from Richard de la Mere to Paul L&eacute;on): &hellip; your letter to [T.S. Eliot] dated May 25th. You have now made it quite clear to me about the division of the parts into separate sections, and I must apologise for bothering you with the other two queries, as I see that they are answered by the dummy that Viscount Carlow left with us some months ago &hellip; I had already returned the galley proofs to our printers for the corrections to be made, when your letter arrived, so I have now asked them to return them to me once more, so that I can make a final check of these section divisions before the pagination is begun. </div>
