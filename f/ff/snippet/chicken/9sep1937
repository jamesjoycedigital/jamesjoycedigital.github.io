The encounter between my father and a tramp (the basis of my book) actually took place at that part of the park. I went to the Br. Consulate and with the official consulted Lloyd&apos;s Register 1935. No trace of that phantom ship. Could you trace her. I hope you noted, by the way, the tayleren&apos;s Christian name. But one or two questions I mean till you send back the book marked, which do &hellip; to Paul L&eacute;on &hellip; What is Devereux&apos;s Christian name? Her name Lil or Lilian? Is Archer (Dangerfield) an Irishman? In what chapter is Sturk&apos;s dream of recognition? This point is a fine one, I think, since he saw the deed in a half dream. Why does Archer go back to Chapelizod and put his head in the noose? Yes. I know that sickening thud. But keep on, Bruce, saith the spider. What is the book called? I should subscribe to the Verdant One [<i>Tit Bits</i>]. </div>
