Eliot to Paul L&eacute;on): I must apologize for the delay in answering your letter of the 24th &hellip; I have noted that the rest of the galleys of Part III are to be sent to Mr Joyce as quickly as they are ready. As for Part II, Viscount Carlow is coming to see me on Monday, (7 June 1937) but I understand he is only bringing with him the certain parts of Part II which he is to print privately. We dare not ourselves take the responsibility for assembling the parts of Part II published in TRANSITION &hellip; as soon as Part II or any considerable section of it is ready &hellip; let us have the necessary pages of TRANSITION </div>
