<div class="nbunit" id="20May1927"><font color="red">20 May 1927</font> <i>Letters I</i> (to Harriet Weaver): I leave tomorrow for Holland and will send my address. Mr Donald Friede, owner of Boni and Liveright, offered me $2000 down and 15% royalties to publish my new book, but I declined. As regards that book and its future completion I have asked Miss Beach to get into closer relations with James Stephens. I started reading one of his last books yesterday <i>Deirdre</i> &hellip; He is a poet and Dublin born. Of course he would never take a fraction of the time or pains I take but so much the better for him and me and possibly for the book itself. If he consented to maintain three or four points I consider essential and I showed him the threads he could finish the design. JJ and S (the colloquial Irish for John Jameson and Son&apos;s Dublin whiskey) would be a nice lettering under the title. It would be a great load off my mind. I shall think this over and wait until the opposition becomes more general and pointed. </div>
