<div class="nbunit" id="nd8Nov1927"><font color="red">N.D. early November 1927</font> <i>Letters III</i> (to Ezra Pound): I had not a moment for I was working all day on Anna Livia (transition 8) which I had to read after in its final amended form, putting in an extra 200 hours on the 1000 I told you of. And after that I did not feel at all well, nervous collapse etc. &hellip; Part 1 has just finished in transition and next month I should begin to publish there serially Part 3. But I do not intend to publish there serially Part 2 or the shorter Part 4 when the 8 or 9 instalments of Part 3 are finished. Miss Beach, of course, has first claim on the right to publish but if my American copyright is secured I shall bear in mind your suggestion [as to possible U.S. pubishers] </div>
