<div class="nbunit" id="edn155">  155  Sigurdsson greets Shem in distorted Danish, properly <i>Hvorledes har De det i dag, min sorte herre?</i> He appears elsewhere in the text as HCE's handyman around the house, part-time barman and bottle-washer. His role as policeman re-arises in III.4 where, while again pounding his beat, he watches the shadows of the copulating Porters cast on the window blind by the bedroom light.  </div>
