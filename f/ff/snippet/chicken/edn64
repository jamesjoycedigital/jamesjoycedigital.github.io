<div class="nbunit" id="edn64">  64  The cad addresses HCE in Irish, <i>Conas ta tu indiu mo dhuine uasal fionn?</i> These are the exact words spoken by Mutt (in French) to Jute at 13.08 (16.04): &lsquo;Come on, fool porterfull, hosiered women blown monk sewer.&rsquo; The same phrase reappears elsewhere: as for example at 147.25 (186.32), where Sigurdsson addresses Shem in distorted Danish: &lsquo;<i>Where ladies have they that a dog meansort herrin?</i>&rsquo; Joyce emphasises the cad's pipe rather than his bike and has our hero mistake it, if indeed he is mistaken, for a weapon.  </div>
