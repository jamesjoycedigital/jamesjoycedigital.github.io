<div class="nbunit" id="edn277">  277  The prototypal fable on which Joyce constructs his re-imagined version, Aesop's <cite>The Ant and the Grasshopper</cite>, is that of the prudent ant and the spendthrift, live-for-the-moment grasshopper, roles Joyce apportions to Shaun and Shem respectively. &lsquo;Ondt&rsquo; is a Norwegian word meaning &lsquo;hard&rsquo; or &lsquo;ill,&rsquo; and &lsquo;gracehoper&rsquo; is an amusing pun on a grasshopper always hoping for grace. The two insects parallel the Mookse/Gripes couple from the earlier fable in I.6. Joyce went to some pains to incorporate hundreds of insect words (both entomological terms and foreign-language words for common insects) into the text of the fable, much as he did theological references in the Mookse skit. Interestingly, a text used in <i>both</i> fables is the Egyptian <cite>Book of the Dead</cite>. To illustrate Joyce's use of &lsquo;insect words&rsquo; consider the following lines at 323.37ff (417.10ff): </p><p class="set"> The Gracehoper, who, though blind as batflea, yet knew, not a leetle beetle, his good smetterling of entymology, asped nissunitimost lous nor liceens but promptly tossed himself in the vico, phthin and phthir, on top of his buzzer, tezzily wondering wheer would his aluck alight </p><p> One can follow the gist of this; but an entomologist who was also a polyglot would be able to discern in the foliage of the words all the creeping, crawling insects: grasshopper, flea, beetle, <i>Schmetterling</i> (German for &lsquo;butterfly&rsquo;), wasp, nit (German <i>Nisse</i>), louse (Greek <i>phtheir</i>) and lice, bee (buzzer), and so on. The whole fable is made up of sentences like this. Joyce explained his game to Harriet Shaw Weaver (<cite>Selected Letters</cite>, pp 329-32) and provided her with a key to many of the well-hidden allusions.  </div>
