<div class="nbunit" id="11Mar1934"><font color="red">11 March 1934</font> <i>UP</i> (to Harriet Weaver from Paul L&eacute;on) I will not dwell upon the atmosphere which until quite recently has influenced and enervated Mr Joyce, robbing him day after day of his power of concentration and not permitting him to use his creative genius &hellip; the departure of Miss Joyce to the Sanatorium in Nyon &hellip; Mr Joyce&apos;s thought actuated by this feeling has turned to his work and the last three years come unvoluntarily back to his mind &mdash; three years of unceasing worry about Miss Joyce which have caused him almost to abandon his work &mdash; it is remarkable that he was even able to accomplish what he did, I mean the publication of his last fragment &hellip; evening in Mr Joyce&apos;s honour &hellip; satisfaction to hear his fragment read quite well &hellip; I think some definite move should be done to induce Mr Joyce to take  an unfurnished flat where he could at last have his books around him, his desk, his solitude for reflection and creation &hellip; With his books around him I am sure he could terminate W.i.P. within six months or a year </div>
