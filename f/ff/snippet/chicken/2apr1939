A partial confirmation of this he sees in the publication of a novel &ldquo;The reincarnation of Finn MacCool&rdquo; which has just appeared &hellip; you  must have heard &hellip; of the lamentable situation created for Mr Joyce by the sale in lots of some of his manuscripts to public institutions in the U.S. He might suddenly see himself confronted with publications of texts many years old and which were not intended for publication &hellip; Speaking about manuscripts I do not think you have received everything which exists but I am afraid that some of it will have to wait as whatever is still to be sent must be packed with all the books and papers destined for the new apartment. </div>
