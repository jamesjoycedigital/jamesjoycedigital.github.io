<div class="nbunit" id="21Dec1922"><font color="red">21 December 1922</font>, <cite>Letters I</cite> (JJ to Mrs William Murray): Dear Aunt Josephine [&hellip;] I have been trying to collect my notes as well as my poor sight will allow and I find several names of people connected with the family who were of the older generation when I was a booy. I wonder if I sent you an exercise book with the names of those persons at the tops of the pages would you be kind enough (whenever you have a spare moment and anything occurs to your mind) to scribble down in pencil or ink anything noteworthy, details of dress, defects, hobbies, appearance, manner of death, voice, where they lived, etc just as you did for the questions I sent you about Major Powell&mdash;in my book Mayor Tweedy, Mrs Bloom's father? They all belong to a vanished world and most of them seem to have been very curious types. I am in no hurry. You could send me back the book in six months if you like but I would feel greatly obliged if you could fill in any details as you are the only one who is likely to know about them. </div>
