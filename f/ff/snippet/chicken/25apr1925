<div class="nbunit" id="25Apr1925"><font color="red">25 April 1925</font> <i>Letters I</i> (to Harriet Weaver, in thick black-pencil): I am home again &hellip; There is a slight, very slight return of vision in the operated eye &hellip; The other eye is not yet cured and I cannot read print at all without &lsquo;the loan of a lens to see as much as I once saw&rsquo; &hellip; Dr Sigerson&apos;s statement about the Norse in Ireland before S. Patrick justifies my precipitate jumbling of the fifth and tenth centuries in the last phase of Shaun (&lsquo;Norke He raven flag etc&rsquo;). I go to the clinic every morning and rue de la Paix every evening &hellip; I have some proofs to correct for Mr McAlmon and I had better do it before the other eye gets disabled. </div>
