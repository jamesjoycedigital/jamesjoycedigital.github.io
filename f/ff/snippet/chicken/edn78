<div class="nbunit" id="edn78">  78  The place to which Earwicker flees to elude apprehension on a charge of manslaughter, in this version of the saga, is a composite of Dublin, Uruvela (where the Buddha attained enlightenment) and Trieste on the Adriatic (where Joyce exiled himself). The city, the text suggests, was almost granted to him by a charter as bogus as King Edgar's of A.D. 964, which reads: <i>By the abundant mercy of God who thundereth on high divine providence hath granted me the greatest part of Ireland, with its most noble city of Dublin</i>. A fertile land, HCE's new sanctuary is soon to prove as hostile as the city from which he has fled.  </div>
