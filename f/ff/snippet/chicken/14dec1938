<div class="nbunit" id="14Dec1938"><font color="red">14 December 1938</font> <i>NLHW</i> (from Paul L&eacute;on to Harriet Weaver): two days after the reception of your letter &hellip; Mr Joyce &hellip; Bois de Boulogne &hellip; sudden collapse &hellip; overwork &hellip; too little sleep &hellip; but of course he has not stopped working &hellip; 355 pages have been finally revised &hellip; And this makes me think and wonder how this work thousands and tens of thousands words which have passed through my typewriter can with all their obvious triviality and to my mind often meaninglessness keep him in such suspense &mdash; in a moment when the triviality is standing in such gross relief on the background of the weighty and tragic events which surround us, are facing us or looming in the nearest future. However I cannot judge but I still dread the moment when it will be finished &hellip; I will try to send you all the matter I can but I am still holding back the end of Part II and Part IV until I have the pages for revise. </div>
