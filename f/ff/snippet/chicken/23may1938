<div class="nbunit" id="23May1938"><font color="red">23 May 1938</font> <i>NLFF</i> (from T.S. Eliot to Paul L&eacute;on): I thank you for your letter of May the 18th &hellip; the proofs which you mention in your letter have already arrived &hellip; certain points &hellip; clear up before he dares to instruct the printers to revise the galleys into page. &ldquo;It is not clear what is intended by those red pencilled lines that have been put in at various places right across the page. Is it intended that blank lines should be left at those points, or are new pages intended? And if new pages, are those divisions to have separate headings? &hellip; good plan if Mr Joyce were to mark clearly on the rest of the galleys as he sends them back to us, exactly where headings are to go in, where new pages to begin, and where half-titles if any are to be inserted, for the different parts. It is of course absolutely essential that I should know about this before the galley proofs are made into pages. Then, does Mr Joyce wish to see revised galley proofs, or can we now safely go into pages on the assumption that the corrections in the revised proofs will only be of literals and will not consist of additions and omissions of any kind? It would of course be disastrous to make heavy corrections in the page proofs of a long book such as this, as any over-running might prove to be extravagantly expensive.&rdquo; As soon as these points are cleared up the galleys can be paged rapidly and without difficulty. </div>
