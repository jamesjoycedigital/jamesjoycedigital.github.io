<div class="nbunit" id="11Mar1938"><font color="red">11 March 1938</font> <i>NLFF</i> (from T.S. Eliot): I enclose herewith a specimen page to show the best that can be done with this section. The only possible alteration is to suggest that the notes on the right-hand side should be set in italics instead of capitals. Will you let us know which you prefer? The point is that if we had known at the beginning that one section of the book would present these features, we could have adopted a format which would have made its lay-out easier to arrange &hellip; let me know &hellip; how much more is to come before the book will be complete? I hope you have been making further progress in Zurich. </div>
