<div class="nbunit" id="6Feb1923"><font color="red">6 February 1923</font> <i>Letters I</i> (to Harriet Weaver): Then it had to be arranged about my being admitted to the American hospital as a bogus American (this Dr Borsch is arranging) &hellip; in a way I was glad of all these obstacles for I detest the operations. But next week they must begin &mdash; alas! I have been able to do some reading and note taking with my back to the light but of course it cannot go on like that. All I hope now is that they will be successful &hellip; I am very glad that you like the <i>Book of Kells</i>. What can I say about the <i>Odyssey</i>? I made heaps of notes about it (supposedly) which I could not fit in. I was trying lately to sort these out according to a brandnew system I have invented for the greater complication and torment of myself. But I need eyes for that. </div>
