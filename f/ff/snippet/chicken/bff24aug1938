<div class="nbunit" id="bff24Aug1938"><font color="red">24 August 1938</font> <i>NLFF</i> (from Richard de la Mere to Paul L&eacute;on): In reply to your instructions about holding up the pagination when we got to the end of Section 2 of Part II, our printers write as follows: &ldquo;&hellip; In the meantime slips 126-251 [Book III] have not yet been returned to us for paging, though the subsequent slips 252-325 [II.1, II.2, II.3&sect;1] have come back. We have corrected the latter but of course we cannot page until we get the earlier ones. He has also got our proof of slips 292a-292q [II.3&sect;2-4]. This was an additional section of copy that came at a later  stage than the bulk. I have checked the position of the end of Section 2 of Part II. It is just a little confusing. Part II, Section 1, consists of slips 292-325 [II.1]; and part II, section 3, begins at slip 277 and presumably ends on slip 292 [II.3&sect;1]. You will see from the above report that in order to enable us to get ahead with the paging, the author must return slips 126-251 and, if possible, also slips 292a-292q.&rdquo; </div>
