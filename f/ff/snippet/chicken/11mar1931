<div class="nbunit" id="11Mar1931"><font color="red">11 March 1931</font> <i>Letters I</i> (to Harriet Weaver, typed): &hellip; Miss Monnier and Miss Beach have written to you to come over for the s&eacute;ance on the twentysixth which for all I know may celebrate the close of my Paris career, just as that of the 7th of December, 1921, opened it. &hellip; Gilbert is leaving Paris in a day or two for the south, so that I shall have nobody to help me with the reading except L&eacute;on who however, not having read a word I have written except the piece he revised for Babou, has no idea what the book is about or what I want. I take up some of my daughter-in-law&apos;s time trying to copy into one large book the worst of my illegibly scrawled notes. </div>
