<div class="nbunit" id="ff24Aug1938"><font color="red">24 August 1938</font> <i>NLFF</i> (from Richard de la Mere to Paul L&eacute;on): Thank you for your letter of August 21st. We will certainly do as you suggest with regard to page 44 of WORK IN PROGRESS (the page containing the musical fragment) and we will send proofs to Monsieur Edmond Pendleton when the time comes. I am arranging for a copy of OUR EXAGMINATION to be sent to Monsieur Jacques Mercanton at once &hellip; In reply to your instructions about holding up the pagination when we got to the end of Section 2 of Part II, our printers write as follows: &ldquo;&hellip; In the meantime slips 126-251 [Book III] have not yet been returned to us for paging, though the subsequent slips 252-325 [II.1, II.2, II.3&sect;1] have come back. We have corrected the latter but of course we cannot page until we get the earlier ones. He has also got our proof of slips 292a-292q [II.3&sect;2-4]. This was an additional section of copy that came at a later  stage than the bulk. I have checked the position of the end of Section 2 of Part II. It is just a little confusing. Part II, Section 1, consists of slips 292-325 [II.1]; and part II, section 3, begins at slip 277 and presumably ends on slip 292 [II.3&sect;1]. You will see from the above report that in order to enable us to get ahead with the paging, the author must return slips 126-251 and, if possible, also slips 292a-292q.&rdquo; </div>
