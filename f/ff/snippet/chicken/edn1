<div class="nbunit" id="edn1">  1  Joyce associated thunder with Vico (remember how at the beginning we came back via a &lsquo;commodious vicus&rsquo;). Vico's philosophy postulated a perpetual recurrence of a fourfold historical pattern and this is used loosely through the <cite>Wake</cite> as a pivotal structuring device, much as is Bruno's concept of the identity of opposites. Vico associated thunder with man's earliest consciousness of guilt. On hearing its deafening roar primitive man, he supposed, coming suddenly into a consciousness of externality, supposed it was an angry God that spoke out of the sky. The primitives then fled in fear into caves and began the slow process of civilised living.  </p><p> There are in the <cite>Wake</cite> ten thunder-words (at 3.14, 18.23, 35.16, 72.16, 90.03, 203.23, 242.04, 256.07, 322.01, and 329.30 [3.15, 23.05, 44.20, 90.31, 113.09, 257.27, 314.08, 332.05, 414.19, and 424.20]). Each represents an utterance (divine) as well as some sound appropriate to the narrative (a ladder collapsing, a door closing, etc). The hundred-lettered words may also serve as narrative chronological indicators. They are each some particular aggregate of elements, in most cases the same word given in different languages; thus, the root words for the first and second are simply &lsquo;thunder,&rsquo; for the third &lsquo;clap&rsquo; (as in &lsquo;applaud&rsquo;); for the fourth &lsquo;whore,&rsquo; for the sixth &lsquo;shut the door,&rsquo; and for the eighth &lsquo;cough.&rsquo; The others form sentences of a sort.  </p><p> Finnegan's fall is interpreted at 5.10 (5.29) as the fall from grace of Adam, the first man: &lsquo;so sore did abe ite ivvy's holired abbles.&rsquo; It is also referred to as a &lsquo;municipal sin business&rsquo; (as original sin). <font face="wake">A</font> is associated with apples and <font face="wake">H</font> with oranges: hence his interment at 3.21 (3.23) involves oranges being laid &lsquo;to rust upon the green.&rsquo; When the hen pecking at the Egyptian midden in chapter I.5 uncovers fragments of half-rotted orange-peel, it is at one level recovering bits of <font face="wake">H</font>'s corpse.  </div>
