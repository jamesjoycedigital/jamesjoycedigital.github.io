<div class="nbunit" id="edn2">  2  If we care to leaf through our copies of the <cite>Wake</cite> to get to the end of Book III we will find HCE, wrapped in the identity of Mr Porter, in a remarkably similar plight when, ultimately, the last straw having been added to his camel's back, an &lsquo;explosium of his distilleries deafadumped all his dry goods down to his most favoured sinflute and dropped him, what remains of a heptark, leareyed and lotterish, weeping worrybound on his bankrump&rsquo; 459.15-17 (489.36ff). After all that he is to go through, everything he has to endure, all that gossip and scandal-mongering, HCE is to end up exactly as he started out, on the beam-end of his behind.  </div>
