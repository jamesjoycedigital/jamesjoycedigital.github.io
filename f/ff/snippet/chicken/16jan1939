<div class="nbunit" id="16Jan1939"><font color="red">16 January 1939</font> <i>NLFF</i> (from Paul L&eacute;on to Richard de la Mere): Here are the quires received this morning &hellip; this seems to be the crucial week &hellip; Mr Joyce &hellip; tells me that he had written at length to Mr T.S. Eliot many months ago and even sent a special &ldquo;ambassador&rdquo; with the &ldquo;maquette&rdquo; of the book. In addition, he had this ambassador &mdash; Viscount Carlow &mdash; show your firm the publication made of the most difficult part of the episode (difficult typographically) with the request to follow it closely. This however has apparently not been done quite. As far as the type and the pages are concerned, he tells me, that several years ago after several attempts to obtain what he wanted he abandoned the idea as he was given to understand that your firm knew better what would please the reader. From what I have been able to hear from the few persons who have seen the pages it seems however that a slightly larger type and freer disposition on the pages would have been a help to the readers who find them a little crowded. </div>
