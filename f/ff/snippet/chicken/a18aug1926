He is in fact a very good <b><font face="wake">D</font></b> all the more as his name is the same as my own. Joyeux, Joyes, Joyce (Irish Sheehy or Hoey, the Irish change J into Sh e.g. James Sheumus, John Shaun etc) He very often uses the identical words I put into <b><font face="wake">D</font></b>&apos;s mouth at the Euclid lesson before coming down here.  </div>
