Have you a MS ending with verses in green ink in my wiriting: &lsquo;Sold him her lease of nineninenintie&rsquo; etc and ending &lsquo;That&apos;s what she&apos;s done for We [?him]&rsquo;? I am writing to Miss Beach about it. I thought Miss Moschos sent it weeks ago. I am glad you agree to check it. I cannot from memory. Please let me know if you have these pages. It is my fault to have sent it away but I wanted to clear the decks. </div>
