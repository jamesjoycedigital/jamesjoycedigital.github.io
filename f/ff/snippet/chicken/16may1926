<div class="nbunit" id="16May1926"><font color="red">16 May 1926</font> <i>Letters III</i> (to Lily Bollach): The phrase in my MS reads &lsquo;by that noblest of magistrates at his Saxon tannery with motto O&apos;Neill etc&rsquo;. You are right about &lsquo;my face&rsquo; and &lsquo;too&rsquo;. One more change. In the speech that <i>precedes</i> the verse (<b><font face="wake">D</font></b>c near end) <u>Day soaker four vanfloats</u> etc / for &lsquo;Magrath or MacMonagh&rsquo; read &lsquo;O&apos;Bejorumsen or Mockmacmahonson&rsquo; [VI.B.17 95] Do you think you could leave part of say <b><font face="wake">D</font></b>ab on Monday (17 May 1926) with your concierge so that I could be revising it in the meantime? You are having a terrible time with my MS, I am afraid. I am sorry to be the guilty cause and hope for your own sake it will soon be over. </div>
