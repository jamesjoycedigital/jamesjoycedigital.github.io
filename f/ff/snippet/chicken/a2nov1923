It is not new MS but the fair copy of Mamalujo which I forgot to send. I have since worked over the typed copy again and have now definitely abandoned it. I could not do much these last weeks as my wife has been attending the dentist for some unpleasant work &mdash; now finished. &hellip; P.S. I have written in the additions. </div>
