<div class="nbunit" id="edn427">  427  ALP is &lsquo;exquisitely pleased about the loveleavest dress&rsquo; she has. As the chapter draws to a close, the dress gradually disintegrates. Joyce spoke of it to Jacques Mercanton (&lsquo;The Hours of James Joyce,&rsquo; <i>Portrait of the Artist in Exile</i>), who writes, </p><p> &lsquo;With angelic tenderness so moving in that rebellious angel, and on a tone of confidence and wonder, Joyce evoked the last voyage of his heroine. She wears her beautiful gown, all leafy; but, behold, little by little her fianc&eacute;e's moving dress is coming apart: one leaf and then another flees towards the sea on the fugitive waters; one leaf glides on a wave that goes to mingle its foam with eternal waves.&rsquo; </p><p> <i>A leaf, just a leaf, and then leaves</i>. Here she murmurs again. <i>I only hope whole the heavens sees us. For I feel I could near to faint away. Into the deeps. Annamores leep.</i> </p><p> She carries one last leaf with her to remind her of life. And all things are reflected in their opposites; for the leaf is the leaf she first took to herself in the Garden of Eden. ALP does not ever renounce that original sin.  </div>
