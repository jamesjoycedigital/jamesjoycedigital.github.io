<div class="nbunit" id="13Jan1925"><font color="red">I and UP 13 January 1925</font> (to Harriet Weaver): Many thanks for that passage about the rivers. The coincidence you mention about the Dane [a river in Cheshire] is strange but I am well used to these things. Here is another. I mentioned to you a Dublin nabob who fed his guests when Lord Mayor off golden plates, sir Benjamin Guinness of the brewery, Dublin&apos;s Noah. He restored S.Patrick&apos;s cathedral too. He had two sons, lord Ardilaun afterwards and lord Iveagh. My father unseated the former for Dublin city. No conservative was ever returned after. The elder brother had some form of leprosy (see <i>Ulysses</i>), Arthur was his name. He was morose and charitable. The younger brother Cecil &lsquo;jockeyed&rsquo; him out of his birthright in a perfectly legal way. He married another Guinness as his father did before him. I suppose you see the map as I do. I cannot find anything at present about Noah&apos;s wife (the medieval figure of the mystery plays is one of the models for Anna Livia) Elizabeth, afterwards Lady Guinness, but thinking of the subject I wondered what the Irish word for Guinness&apos;s vineyard&apos;s beverage would be. It is <i>lin dub</i> or <i>dub lin</i> &hellip; I will soon send you the rest of Shaun &mdash; if the post accepts his bulk. </div>
