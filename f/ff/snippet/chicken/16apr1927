<div class="nbunit" id="16Apr1927"><font color="red">16 April 1927</font> <i>Selected Letters</i> (to Harriet Weaver): I finished my revision and have passed 24 hours prostrate more than the priests on Good Friday. I think I have done what I wanted to do. I am glad you liked my punctuality as an engine driver. I have taken this up because I am really one of the greatest engineers, if not the greatest, in the world besides being a musicmaker, philosophist and heaps of things. All the engines I know are wrong. Simplicity. I am making an engine with only one wheel. No spokes of course. The wheel is a perfect square. You see what I am driving at, don&apos;t you? I am awfully solemn about it, mind, so you must not think it is a silly story about the mooks and the grapes. No, it&apos;s a wheel, I tell the world. <i>And</i> it&apos;s all <i>square</i>. </div>
