<div class="nbunit" id="9Nov1932"><font color="red">9 November 1932</font> <i>NLFF</i> (from F.V. Morely): TWO TALES &hellip; the long delay in arranging for this book is partly my fault for not having a copy of the original. As to proofs I have arranged to have them collated with the Black Sun edition, word for word, by two separate readers, and plan to check them also word for word myself. Will that be all right? Simultaneously and at the same price (2/6) we plan to publish Eliot&apos;s fragments of SWEENEY AGONISTES &hellip; for Christmas. </div>
