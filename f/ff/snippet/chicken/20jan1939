<div class="nbunit" id="20Jan1939"><font color="red">20 January 1939</font> <i>NLFF</i> (from Faber and Faber to Paul L&eacute;on):  There is a further point you will see that I have marked on the typewritten sheet of corrections accompanying the proofs three instances in which the sheet differs from the corrections marked on the proofs. Will you please check whether the proper alterations have been made by the printer? [corrections for p621, p616 on verso in Paul L&eacute;on hand] </div>
