<div class="nbunit" id="26Jan1927"><font color="red">26 January 1927</font> <i>BLHW</i> (to Harriet Weaver): I read <font face="wake">A</font> on Sunday (23 January 1927) to a small circle of Miss Monnier&apos;s friends at her request. It had a deep affect &mdash; especially on me for I went home at once (it was 6 pm) and fell sound asleep for 11/2 hours. I can get no news of Lewis. Goodness knows what he is doing or where my typescript is. I had a day or two ago a letter from Pound which perturbed me very much. He does not mention the protest but says he is bringing out a review. This I knew and offered him something. It is unfit, he said, and adds that it is all a bad stunt. Very good. Perhaps so. </div>
