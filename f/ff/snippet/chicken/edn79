<div class="nbunit" id="edn79">  79  What the parcel contains, assuming it is a parcel, is nowhere unambiguously stated. It is at one point the stolen coffin of 53.27 (66.27). At 50.33 (63.07) the assailant calls it a fender. By 65.26 (82.06) it has become a distillery worm, and by 67.08 (84.04), when the attacker picks it up, a &lsquo;humoral hurlbat or other uncertain weapon of <i>lignum vitae</i> (but so evermore rhumanasant of a toboggan poop)&rsquo;. It is thus a dream-formed composite of weapon, bone, hurley stick, bat, staff, tobacco pipe, and pouch. At 67.33 (84.34) it is re-described as a &lsquo;pierced paraflamme and claptrap fireguard.&rsquo; When at 403.01 (518.15) the four annalists question Shaun about the encounter, they put this question to him: <i>The illegal-looking range or fender, alias turfing iron, a product of Hostages and Co, Engineers, changed feet several times as briars revalvered during the weaponswap?</i> Shaun replies that it was an &lsquo;ersatz lottheringcan.&rsquo; At 411.34 (529.22) Luke calls it &lsquo;an ark, of eggshaped fuselage and made in Fredborg into the bullgine&rsquo; (a bomb). Finally, it reappears in Book IV as the hot-water bottle Juva lends to Muta.  </div>
