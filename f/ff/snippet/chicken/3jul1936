<div class="nbunit" id="3Jul1936"><font color="red">3 July 1936</font> <i>NLFF</i> (from Paul L&eacute;on to T.S. Eliot): I beg to inform you that the typing of Parts I and III is progressing with success and I think I will be able to have it sent over to you very soon. Part III with which I started because I knew it better is already finished. It has costed Frs 376. Part I I had to entrust for copy and about half of it is already done. I am taking it up since yesterday with the typist who did Part III, and hope to be through with it in time for Mrs L&eacute;on to take it over to London when she goes there on the 12th inst. The first half costed Frcs 200. I am afraid that the whole brunt of Part I is now lying on him and in order to spare time and expense I would be very thankful if you could have sent over to me 4 copies of the cheap edition of ANNA LIVIA PLURABELLE &hellip; and 2 copies of the TALES TOLD. I have been able to use HAVETH CHILDERS EVERYWHERE as there are all told but three corrections on it which could be easily done in ink. The corrections on  ANNA LIVIA PLURABELLE are however much greater in number and I will have to cut out pages and paste them in their order. </div>
