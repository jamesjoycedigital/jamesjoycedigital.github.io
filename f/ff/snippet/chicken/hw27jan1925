<div class="nbunit" id="hw27Jan1925"><font color="red">27 January 1925</font> <i>Selected Letters</i>(to Harriet Weaver): Tomorrow I shall send you MS and typescript of the first two watches of Mr Shaun (what I read, slightly revised) and the day after MS and typescript of the rest [III.3, the third watch]. There is an interruption near the middle (indicated in the MS). I shall be anxious to hear what you think of it. I don&apos;t know how I managed to do so much with the operation and convalescence and holiday. I hope you will write to me about it. </div>
