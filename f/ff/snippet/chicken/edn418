<div class="nbunit" id="edn418">  418  Much can be read into this extraordinarily complex metaphor. The &lsquo;urogynal pan&rsquo; refers to Original Sin and to bread baked using woman's urine (lant). &lsquo;Adam&rsquo; and &lsquo;Finn&rsquo; relate to the continuity of the paradigm of paternity. The &lsquo;crossmess parzel&rsquo; is both Christmas parcel and crossword puzzle. Finally, the term unifies the allusions in the Letter to Christmas and its pantomimes, to Paradise, to Eve who was tempted by the serpent, provoking the Fall, and the enmity put by God between snake and woman and between its seed and her seed. ALP in writing the Letter combines the roles of Eve and Mary (the &lsquo;second Eve&rsquo; destined to crush the serpent's head underfoot). She (Mary) accomplished this by presenting to mankind its Christmas parcel, Jesus Christ, so that her seed by his crucifixion (the &lsquo;crossmess&rsquo;) and resurrection could undo the evil of Original Sin. Anna's overriding emotion is &lsquo;thanks&rsquo; (gratitude, akin to Augustine's <i>O felix culpa</i>, Happy the fault!) that the event occurred, as it alone made possible glorious and uncertain future events.  </div>
