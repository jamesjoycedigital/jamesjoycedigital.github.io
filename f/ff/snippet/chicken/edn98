<div class="nbunit" id="edn98">  98  The true story of another Pat, &lsquo;Pat the Pedlar,&rsquo; is instructive and could have been lifted out of (or dropped into) the pages of the <cite>Wake</cite>. Pat, a gentle old soul, earned a small living by selling bootlaces, polishes, pencils and hair-combs to passers-by from his pitch on Rory O'Moore (alias Bloody/Barrack/Victoria and Albert/Watling Street) Bridge in Dublin. Pat was also known for his cures for rheumatism, coughs, skin diseases and such like. Where he came from in the morning and where he retired to at night, when not at his stall on the bridge, was never discovered. Pat came to a tragic end in the late 1860's, being quite horrifically murdered one dark winter's night as he started to make his way home after a particularly profitable day. He put up a stiff resistance but was left in a savagely beaten-up state on the roadside, where he was found by some local women who raised the alarm. He was taken to Steven's Hospital and passed away the following morning, but not before he gave a description of his assailant to the police. Little headway was made in solving the crime until one year later when a man closely answering the description of the attacker stumbled, badly shaken, into Chancery Police Station with the extraordinary story that, as he was crossing Watling Street Bridge, he was chased by the ghost of the pedlar. He was convicted of Pat's murder and locked up in a madhouse.  </div>
