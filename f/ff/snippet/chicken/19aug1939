<div class="nbunit" id="19Aug1939"><font color="red">19 August 1939</font> <i>NLPL</i> (to Paul L&eacute;on): Saturday. (19 August 1939) Please tell F and F to send me the unbound sheets of F.W. so that I may begin to correct before it&apos;s too late. It&apos;s a pity to spoil a bound book. Tell L.G. to keep the press copy also but suggest he send to some literary colleague. </div>
