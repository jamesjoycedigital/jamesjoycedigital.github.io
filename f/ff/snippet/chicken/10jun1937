<div class="nbunit" id="10Jun1937"><font color="red">10 June 1937</font> <i>Letters III</i> (to C.P. Curran): Maria Jolas left with my concierge for my perusal a copy of <i>A Page of Irish History</i>, a book about U.C. On p 338 I read that in 1897 I opposed Skeffington for the auditorship of the L. & H. Society. This is incorrect. In 1897 I was still in the Senior Grade at Belvedere. I never opposed Skeffington. My contest was some years later against Kennedy. He won by ca 22 to 16 all the U.C. staff voting for him. </div>
