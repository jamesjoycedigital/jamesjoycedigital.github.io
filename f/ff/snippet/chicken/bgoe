Gilbert&apos;s village book, which Henkes suggests the author presented to Joyce in January 1923, is the first instalment of a projected series of no less than twelve full-length books (never completed) describing a single moment in time in an imaginary village in an imaginary county in the north of England (though one can assume it to be Gilbert&apos;s native Lincolnshire), possibly written as a reaction against and an intellectual replacement for the urban <cite>Ulysses</cite>. Henkes suggests Joyce was wryly inspired by Gilbert&apos;s concept and may well have formed certain ideas about a new novel in response to it. </li></ul> </dd> </dl>
