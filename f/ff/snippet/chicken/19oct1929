<div class="nbunit" id="19Oct1929"><font color="red">19 October 1929</font> <i>Letters I</i> (to Harriet Weaver, typed):  Do you think you could stand reading another sentence about my eye, because I don&apos;t think I could write it this evening having just knocked off work on the city piece &hellip; now that I have practically finished for the moment my work in progress (?) I am doubly disinclined to go [to lecture at Oxford] &hellip; I shall feel rather pleasantly stupid eight or ten days from now. The disc hasn&apos;t appeared yet. </div>
