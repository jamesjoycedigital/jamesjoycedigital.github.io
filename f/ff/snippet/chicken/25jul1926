<div class="nbunit" id="25Jul1926"><font color="red">25 July 1926</font> <i>Letters I</i> (to Harriet Weaver): The Dial telegraphed it would pay &frac12;d a word for <b><font face="wake">D</font></b>abcd but must see my text first. It has gone and I feel about as diffident as a young lady of 19 &hellip; I finished the Euclid lesson but will not attempt anything more for the present &hellip; By the way the pieces in <b><font face="wake">D</font></b>abcd connected with the Roderick O&apos;Conor passage are respectively pp. 52, 53, 82, 83, 102. If I turned to anything it would be to them now. I certainly have a capacity for work but I wish I had more agility and imagination.  </div>
