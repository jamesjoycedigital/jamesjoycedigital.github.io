<div id="stitle" style="display:none;">Chicken Note</div>
<div class="nbunit" id="edn6">  6  As we read on, we quickly appreciate that our topical hero, HCE, whose name alters from state to state, consistently changes his appearance. One could say of him that he never appears but in a new suit of clothes. He always wears headgear of some sort and carries a stick or other implement. When we meet him later as &lsquo;the Willingdone&rsquo; his mitre turns up as the &lsquo;Lipoleumhat&rsquo; and his hod and trowel as a telescope. In episode I.2, he is again a new man. Hastening out in an extraordinary and heterogeneous get-up to greet the King, who happens to have paused outside his humble abode, he carries with him a long pole with a flower-pot stuck on one end. On encountering the cad in the park, he carries a briar (a pipe) and a walking-stick. And so on right through the book, everything changing into something else all of the time, modifying itself as conditions change, turning into something quite distinct yet withal with still a trace of its former instantiations.  </div>
