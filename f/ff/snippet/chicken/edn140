<div class="nbunit" id="edn140">  140  The Mookse's arguments in demonstration of the non-tenability of the Gripes' theological and philosophical outlook on life proved more difficult to put together than Joyce had hoped. Writing about this episode, he had this to say: &lsquo;The old catholics Augustiner Kirche are a good example of a Mookse gone Gripes. They separated from Rome in '71 when the infallibility of the pope was proclaimed a dogma but they have since gone much more apart. &hellip; But most important of all they have abolished the <i>Filioque</i> clause in the Creed concerning which there has been a schism between western and eastern Christendom for over a thousand years, Rome saying that the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father and the Son, Greece and Russia and the East Orthodox Churches that the procession is from the Father alone, <i>ex patre</i> without <i>filioque</i>. Of course the dogmas subsequently proclaimed by Rome after the split are not recognised by the east such as the Immaculate Conception. See the Mookse and the Gripes that are West and East, paragraph beginning &lsquo;When that Mooksius&rsquo; and ending &lsquo;Philioquus.&rsquo; All the grotesque words in this are Russian or Greek for the three principal dogmas which separate Shem from Shaun. When he gets A and B on to his lap, C slips off, and when he has C and A, he loses hold of B.&rsquo; (<cite>Letters</cite> III, 3 September 1933) Translating and simplifying the relevant paragraph (156.08-18), Joyce seems to be saying that, while the Mookse with great equivocation was promulgating this and that before the schismatic Gripes he had all but succeeded in co-ordinating his points; but no sooner had be managed to reconcile their respective ideas about the Immaculate Conception and to unify their concepts of the Procession of the Holy Ghost than the logothetes of his ecclesiastical dignitaries were found at variance with the members of his own synods; so his papal infallibility got the hoof along with his <i>filioque</i>.  </div>
