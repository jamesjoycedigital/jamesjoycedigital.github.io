I askes him to try to do a sketch of mother from photographs. He managed to get two faded ones. Has Eileen any? If so it would be advisable to send copies of any or all at once to him (Prof. P. J. Tuohy, Metropolitan School of Art, Kildare Street, Dublin), as he is thinking of going to Spain. &hellip; The English printer of <i>The Calendar</i> refuses to set up a piece of my new book. It comes out therefore complete (the piece) on Wednesday (30 September 1925) in a Paris review </div>
