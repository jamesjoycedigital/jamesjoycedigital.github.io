<div class="nbunit" id="a20May1927"><font color="red">20 May 1927</font> <i>Letters I</i> (to Harriet Weaver): I am afraid you will find it tedious but I think you ought to read the proofs of instalment 4. I send you herewith the final MS additions, and the proof should be read with <i>both</i>, my handwriting will be more familiar than my son&apos;s, the final additions are in <i>green</i> ink. I shall correct the proof from the perhaps faulty copy in Eliot Paul&apos;s possession at the same time. It will be sent to you in a few days. Also if any of my additions have not appeared in instalments 1, 2 and 3 I should be glad if you would indicate page and line, referring to transition.  </div>
