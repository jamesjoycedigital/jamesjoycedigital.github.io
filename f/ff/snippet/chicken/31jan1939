<div class="nbunit" id="31Jan1939"><font color="red">31 January 1939</font> <i>NLFF</i> (from Richard de la Mere to Paul L&eacute;on): We want to persuade Mr Joyce to our way of thinking with regard to the jacket and not to adopt his own suggestion of making its layour similar to the layout of the title-page. The point really is this: the jacket of a book is something ephemeral that is intended partly for protecting it from dust while it is in the bookshops, but nowadays much more importantly as a piece of advertising matter &mdash; It is a poster in miniature that has to proclaim the title of the book &hellip; and the author&apos;s name as promiently as it can from the bookshop window &hellip; Mr Joyce&apos;s name should be printed really big. </div>
