<div class="nbunit" id="a6Jan1938"><font color="red">6 January 1938</font> <i>NLFF</i> (from T.S. Eliot to Paul L&eacute;on):  In one of the sections you have recently sent there are side notes. There were no side notes to any of the previous sections of the book, and we had not been warned that side notes might be required in later sections. We had therefore not allowed for this possibility in arranging the format of the page. Does Mr Joyce wish these side notes to be printed in our edition, and if so, will it be satisfactory to him if these notes are indented into the page? </div>
