<div class="nbunit" id="b26Nov1938"><font color="red">[?26] November 1938</font> <i>NLFF</i> (from Paul L&eacute;on to Richard de la Mere):  In this connection and in view of the length of the final paragraph Mr Joyce would like to introduce an alteration on Page 1 of the book. It would consist in the addition of a paragraph after the words &ldquo;Howth castle and environs&rdquo;. I don&apos;t think the printers have yet started the final paging and I hope this is still possible without too great trouble. </div>
