Harriet Shaw Weaver writes in her notes: &ldquo;these two pages were sent to me later (see Letters, NLHW, <a name="24Jun1935" href="../../FF/fbiog/fwlett.htm#24Jun1935">24 June</a> 1935) and do not appear in the typescript [<a name="lad6" href="#lad6">II.2&sect;1.6/2.4/3.6</a>)] made for <cite>transition</cite> (no. 23, published July 1935). But they follow straight on after the 13th page of the fair copy and must have been inserted before <cite>transition</cite> was printed.&rdquo; <ul><li>MS: BL 47478, fols. 235r, 236r </li><li>JJA: 52 (II.2 vol. i): 124-125 </li><li>Notebooks used:  <a name="c02" href="../../FF/fdra/fnbdetails.htm#c02">VI.C.2</a>&deg;,  <a name="c10" href="../../FF/fdra/fnbdetails.htm#c10">VI.C.10</a> </li></ul> </dd> </dl>
