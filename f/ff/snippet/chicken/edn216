<div id="stitle" style="display:none;">Chicken Note</div>
<div class="nbunit" id="edn216">  216  At this point <font face="wake">H</font> (HCE) resembles the dissembling sailor that Stephen and Bloom encounter in the cabman's shelter in the &lsquo;Ithaca&rsquo; episode of <cite>Ulysses</cite> who goes outside at one point to spring a leak (take a piss). HCE's actions here as Norwegian captain mimic those in the Phoenix Park where he exposes himself to the two girls while showing his buttocks to the three privates. As elsewhere in the <cite>Wake</cite>, the (re)narration carries overtones of its earlier expression(s), and the deep-structural core persists.  </div>
