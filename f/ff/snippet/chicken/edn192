<div class="nbunit" id="edn192">  192  The notes (scribbles) on the left on pages 205&ndash;221 (260&ndash;287) are attributable to Shem, those more pedantic notes on the right to Shaun; for pages 226&ndash;236 (293&ndash;308) this arrangement is reversed. The section in between &mdash; a bibliographic <font face="wake">C</font> (Shem) piece &mdash; is free of marginalia. The footnotes, of which there are two hundred and twenty nine, can be ascribed throughout to Issy. There is only a very loose connection between the children's commentary and the text, with the exception of the concatenation between the proposed essay titles and historical figures.  </div>
