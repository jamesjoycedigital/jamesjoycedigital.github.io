<div class="nbunit" id="4Feb1924"><font color="red">4 February 1924</font> <i>STA</i> (to Lily Bollach): I am leaving some MS for you which I hope you will not find too difficult. I wrote out three of the pages again even after the last revise as I thought they were really too impossible to send you. I hope your work will allow you time to do them if you are not overfatigued (as I am) with this miserable weather. </div>
