<div class="nbunit" id="24Aug1926"><font color="red">24 August 1926</font> <i>Letters I</i> (to Sylvia Beach): Do not do anything till you return to Paris and till the Dial replies. I think we shall stay here till 1 or 2 prox and then go to Ghent for a few days. In any case we shall remain in Leopoldland &hellip; A curious thing. I was sitting on a rock under the phare a few sunsets ago when a child, a barefoot girl of about four, clambered up the slope and insisted in filling my pockets with tiny shells from her apron. I told her in Flemish (I have now taken 43 lessons in it!) that I did not want them but she went on all the same. It was only after I had given her a coin and she had gone that I remembered the lighthouse of Patrick&apos;s papa in Boulogne and Caligula&apos;s order to his soldiers at the tower to gather up the seashells. </div>
