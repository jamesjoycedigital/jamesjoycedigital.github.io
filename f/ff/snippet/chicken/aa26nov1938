<div class="nbunit" id="aa26Nov1938"><font color="red">[?26] November 1938</font> <i>NLFF</i> (from Paul L&eacute;on to Richard de la Mere):  On &hellip; Thanksgiving day [24 November] a dinner was given in honour of Mr Joyce in which his daughter in law was selected to read aloud the last pages of his book, Mr Joyce therefore interrupted his work on the final corrections of Part III to introduce corrections on these pages with the result that I have now a revised text containing corrections which could normally have been introduced on the galleys. Should the printers not have reached them yet I think it would save them time if they had this text instead of setting what they have. If you agree will you please let me know and I will send you the text immediately, asking you to return again the previous one in order to exclude all possibilities of mistakes.  </div>
