<div class="nbunit" id="edn115">  115  This section opens with a fox hunt, as did I.2. HCE is the fox. His clothing of coat and boots is suitably transformed into fur. As well as fox, he is here associated with other animals: badger, bear, hare, hound, and so on. His &lsquo;holt&rsquo; is yet another form of the shack (<big><font face="wake">N</font></big>). Later in the chapter it enlarges itself into a tower and/or ziggurat. By the episode's close, it reverts to a simple grave. How HCE manages to survive in the holes he inhabits is much at issue. Here it is on syllabub (milk, port, sherry, and cinnamon mixed) and, later, on grass (compare the living tissue he consumes in section one).  </div>
