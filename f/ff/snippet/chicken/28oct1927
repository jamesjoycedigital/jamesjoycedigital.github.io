I did not really finish with <font face="wake">A</font> till 6 yesterday evening. The final proofreading took me five hours. I do not know what to think of it. Hundreds of river names are woven into the text. I think it moves. I hope you will like it and will write me about it as I am considerably wound up. </div>
