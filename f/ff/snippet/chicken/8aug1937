<div class="nbunit" id="8Aug1937"><font color="red">8 August 1937</font> <i>Selected Letters</i> (to David Fleischmann): I have sent you registered a book &hellip; I need to know something about it. I never read it and have nobody to read it to me and it takes too much time with all I am doing. Could you perhaps refresh your memory &hellip; and then dictate to your mother (whom I hope will buy me a bunch of new ribbons to spry up &mdash; her typewriter) an account of the plot in general as if it were a new book the tale of which you had to narrate in a book review. After that I should like you to mark with blue pencil in the margin the most important pasages of the plot itself and in red pencil here and there wherever the words or dialogue see to call for the special attention of a European. Don&apos;t care about spoiling the book. It is a cheap edition. If you can then return it to me soon I shall try to use whatever bears upon what I am doing. </div>
