<div class="nbunit" id="6Aug1936"><font color="red">6 August 1936</font> <i>NLCV</i> (from Paul L&eacute;on to Viscount Carlow): I am sending you enclosed the two lettrines of Miss Lucia Joyce destined for the illumination of the first letter of the text and of the first letter of the notes for Mr Joyce&apos;s fragment which you intend to publish. Under separate cover I am sending you the text of the fragment in Transition with corrections &hellip; You will see that the printing of the fragment presents considerable difficulties from the point of view of typography. The &ldquo;captions&rdquo; on the left margin should be aligned with certain words of the text. They are not quite right in the Transition text and I have therefore undelined the word to which the caption refers and hope you will be able to find them. The large type captions on the right are aligned with the beginning of each paragraph. Two corrections will be sent to you subsequently: (1) A caption on the right margin for the second paragraph. (2) An addition to the caption on the left margin of page 127 reading &ldquo;Pompeius Magnus&rdquo;. </div>
