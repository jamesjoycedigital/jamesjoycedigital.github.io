<div class="nbunit" id="edn296">  296  Shaun's drinking champagne suggests St. John 19.28-30: &lsquo;After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst. Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a sponge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth. When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, <i>It is finished</i>: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.&rsquo; Shaun's cherished drink is clearly a chaliced one. His body (in the liturgical sense) or, rather, that of his proxy is the host. The proxy, Shaun claims, will arrive &lsquo;incessantly&rsquo; (instantly/unceasingly) in the &lsquo;fraction of a crust&rsquo; (breaking of host/fraction of second). He is Shaun's &lsquo;altar's ego in miniature,&rsquo; that is, Shem. Interestingly, the proxy is also strongly associated with Jonathan Swift.  </div>
