<div class="nbunit" id="1Sep1936"><font color="red">1 September 1936</font> <i>Letters III</i> (to Viscount Carlow): I am very glad you liked the two <i>lettrines</i>. Three things are lacking in the piece you have, a rubric for paragraph 2, a marginal insertion on the right of the second last page and a title. I shall attend to this when we return to Paris in a week or so and then write to you. I have not the text here. </div>
