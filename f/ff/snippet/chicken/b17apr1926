<div class="nbunit" id="b17Apr1926"><font color="red">III and UP 17 April 1926</font> (to Harriet Weaver): The passage in [Lewis&apos;s] book runs from pp390 or so to 410, roughly. You will notice a grotesque version of it in <b><font face="wake">D</font></b>b when I send it. &hellip;  Have you read <i>Le Culte des H&eacute;ros</i> yet? What do you think of it? Every time I read a piece I go round with the hat after begging those  present to remember it and help me by finding things for me. They all seem to forget about it as quickly except Miss Beach who knows how to whistle books out of the air. </div>
