<div class="nbunit" id="b14Aug1927"><font color="red">14 August 1927</font> <i>Selected Letters</i> (to Harriet Weaver):  I am more and more aware of the indignant hostility shown to my experiment in interpreting &lsquo;the dark night of the soul&rsquo;. The personal rancours of disappointed artists who have wasted their talents or perhaps even their genius while I with poorer gifts and a dreadful lot of physical and mental hardship have or seem to have done something would not apply in your case. And this is one of the chief reasons why, being unable to change, [I] proposed to discontinue my way of writing. The first and third parts being done (5 years work) I could perhaps do the second and the short fourth, but I need rest, and a lot of it. Any duffer ought to be able to pick the threads for part 2 out of the immense sombre <i>melop&eacute;es</i> of I and 3 &hellip; As to &lsquo;Phoenix&rsquo;. A viceroy who knew no Irish thought this was the word the Dublin people used and put up a monument of a phoenix in the park. The Irish was: fionn u&iacute;sge (pron. finn ishghe = clear water) from a well of bright water there. </div>
