<div class="nbunit" id="22Dec1930"><font color="red">22 December 1930</font> <i>Letters III</i> (to Harriet Weaver, large type): Mrs Colm has started a scheme with an American publisher for the issue of a Joyce anthology &hellip; I had no end of trouble betweeen Faber and Faber and Babou and Kahane. By an oversight on Miss Beach&apos;s part I signed over to the latter the exclusive rights for H.C.E. so that I had to hold F and F&apos;s book due this week but got permission to bring it out in April by giving B and K an option on the next fragment. I am still suffering from insomnia which is a dreadful bore and I will not be able to complete the first draft before the end of the year if even then. Gorman is engaged on a biography of me for which I have to supply copiously with information and I am also trying to explain to Miss Monnier&apos;s sister who knows no English the text of Chapelle D&apos;Izzied (the next fragment) for which she is to do a hieroglyph [sic] preface &hellip; This machine is my new toy and that&apos;s my weakness now but the big one I gave Miss Monnier for it is the bane of her life &hellip; good wishes of a crispness nice </div>
