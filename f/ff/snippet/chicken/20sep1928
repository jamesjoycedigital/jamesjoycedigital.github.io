<div class="nbunit" id="20Sep1928"><font color="red">20 September 1928</font> <i>Selected Letters</i> (to Harriet Weaver, typed): We got back here a few days ago &hellip; (Stuart Gilbert and article on t.13) &hellip; He also read to me in Salzburg several chapters or rather sketches of chapters, of his exposition of Ulysses &hellip; I suggested to him to link it up here and there with Berard&apos;s book on the Phoenician origin of the Odyssey and also with the work in progress &hellip; I am most uncommonly fatigued and it is a physical impossibility for me to attempt revision of the piece for T-14 which therefore will have to come out without me &hellip; A.L.P. has not yet arrived &hellip; I even thought of proposing to Gage that he ask Edgar Wallace to do [a preface for a new fragment], the tortoise and the hare &hellip; About fifty pages of Rebecca West&apos;s book were read out for me yesterday </div>
