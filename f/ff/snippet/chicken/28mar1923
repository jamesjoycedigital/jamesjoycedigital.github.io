<div class="nbunit" id="28Mar1923"><font color="red">28 March 1923</font> <i>Letters III</i> (to Harriet Weaver): These few lines will let you know the conjunctivitis ended yesterday &hellip; and so on Tuesday next (3 April 1923) I go into hospital &hellip; The first dental operation will take place on Wednesday, the second on Thursday. (3 and 4 April 1923) In spite of my eye attack I got on with another passage by using a charcoal pencil (<i>fusain</i>) which broke every three minutes and a large sheet of paper. I have now covered various large sheets in a handwriting resembling that of the late Napoleon Bonaparte when irritated by reverses. </div>
