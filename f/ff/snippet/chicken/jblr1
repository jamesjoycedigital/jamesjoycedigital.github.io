In 1908 This work was translated into English in 1908, with new illustrations by Maurice Lalau, by Florence Simmonds [<cite>The Romance of Tristram and Iseult</cite> (Philadelphia: J.B. Lippincott, 1910; London: W. Heinemann, 1910)]. Joyce had a copy of this translation in his Trieste library. </li> <li>Jorn Barger has demonstrated that almost all of the notes from B&eacute;dier entered under <i>Exiles 2</i> in notebook VI.A derive from the first nine chapters of <cite>Le roman</cite> and that the notes here continue on from the tenth. Both sets of notes, however, seem ultimately to derive from now lost worksheets. </li></ul> </dd> </dl>
