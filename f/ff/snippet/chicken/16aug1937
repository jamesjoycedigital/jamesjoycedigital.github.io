Curran): Before leaving for Switzerland Mr Joyce sent me the following list of Irish songs he would like you to get for him &hellip; please send them to my address where I have already some &mdash; because I will have them all bound together. I have just received from Mr Joyce a letter and a card where he asks to add to the list a song to the name of what I cannot decipher. I think it is The Soldier&apos;s Song In case it is unobtainable he would like it to be copied. Mr Joyce&apos;s address is Hotel Krone, Rheinfelden Argau, Switzerland. (on envelope by C. P. Curran. Percy French: Mulligan&apos;s Masquerade; Ashcroft: Quartet to two, McGinty the Swell of the Sea, Mind you that now; Vousden: Time and Tide. </div>
