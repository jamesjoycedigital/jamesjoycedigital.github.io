<div class="nbunit" id="19Nov1923"><font color="red">19 November 1923</font> <i>Letters III</i> (to Harriet Weaver):  Thanks also for <i>Arabia Deserta</i> &hellip; I wish I could get away somewhere and read [it] for my own pleasure but alas in spite of it all I am working overtime again &hellip; I cannot stop now but must try to block out (roughly, at least) certain parts of the book before my next holiday. The passages typed represent twice or three times as much, the rest being already written in the sense that additions will be made all over the present text from notes to which I have now no access &hellip; I shall send on the typescript of the next piece as soon as it is done </div>
