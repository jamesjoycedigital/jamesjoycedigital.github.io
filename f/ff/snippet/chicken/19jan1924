<div class="nbunit" id="19Jan1924"><font color="red">19 January 1924</font> <i>STA</i> (to Lily Bollach): Many thanks for your kind letter. Of course I ought not to have given you such short notice. I shall come on Monday (21 Jan) as you suggest at 6.30 but if you are too busy or feel tired I hope you will not bother as another day will do quite as well </div>
