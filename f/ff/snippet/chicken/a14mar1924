However, as it seemed to me almost impossible that you could revise such a tricky proof I went to Clarke&apos;s. The foreman had gone and the clerk could not find my proof. He thought it might be on the machine. I asked him to telephone to me tomorrow morning and then drove to Quai d&apos;Anjou but, not finding you, left my name. My checking of the proof would mean a delay of about an hour and much relief to myself. I hope it is still possible. I explained in a letter to Mrs Ashworth that I could not go to the printer&apos;s on Thursday but would go on Friday. (13 and 14 March 1924) </div>
