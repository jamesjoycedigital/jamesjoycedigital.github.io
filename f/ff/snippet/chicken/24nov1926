<div class="nbunit" id="24Nov1926"><font color="red">24 November 1926</font> <i>Selected Letters</i> (to Harriet Weaver): The phrase about the Waterworld&apos;s face is mine own. Please correct &lsquo;Sir Tristram, violer d&apos;amores, fr&apos;over the short sea, has passencore rearrived fra North Armorica on the scraggy isthmus of Europe Minor&rsquo; etc. I sent <b><font face="wake">D</font></b>abcd to Pound at his request and he has written turning it down altogether, can make nothing of it, wading through it for a possible joke etc. &hellip; I have been greatly overworked and overworried these last few weeks and yesterday took to the sofa again. Today I restarted. One great part of every human existence is passed in a state which cannot be rendered sensible by the use of wideawake language, cutandry grammar and goahead plot. I think you will like this piece better than sample. </div>
