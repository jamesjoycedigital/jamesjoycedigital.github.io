<div class="nbunit" id="bff18Dec1937"><font color="red">18 December 1937</font> <i>NLFF</i> (from Paul L&eacute;on to T.S. Eliot):  Parts I and III have been all corrected, the corrections checked by Mr Joyce and [?Beckett]. The main text is being read now by an expert rough-reader of the New York Herald. I take it this work will be finished before the end of the year. All this will constitute by far the greatest body of the text which is to be followed by an epilogue to complete the whole work. In my last letter, I was telling you that as against &hellip; Parts I and III, it would be better to compose Part II, Section by Section, as it simplifies the reading </div>
