<div class="nbunit" id="12May1927"><font color="red">12 May 1927</font> <i>Letters I</i> (to Harriet Weaver): My verses have gone to the printer and last night I finished correcting proofs of my new book which will be published in a day or two. I mean instalment 3 &hellip; I shall use some of your suggestions about <font face="wake">N</font> of which you have a right idea. The title is very simple and as commonplace as can be. It is not Kitty O&apos;shea as some wit suggested, though it is in two words. I want to think over it more as I propose to make some experiments with it also. Will you please send back Lewis&apos;s <i>The Enemy</i> as no answer can be got from  him either to return my MS (which he was so anxious to have to the exclusion of all other creative artists etc) or to send on the copies I persuaded Miss Beach to order. My remarks about the engine were not meant as a hint about the title. I meant that I wanted to take up several other arts and crafts and teach everybody how to do everything properly so as to be in the fashion &hellip; I lay down my pen anyhow and if I knew anyone who I thought had the patience and the wish  and the power to write Part II on the lines indicated I think I would leave the chair too and come back in a few years to indicate briefly how Part IV should be done. But who is the person?  There is no such absurd person as could replace me except the incorrigible god of sleep and no waster quite so wasteful though there is one much more so. Peer Gynt says at least: <i>Han er faderligt syndet imod min Person / Men &oslash;konom! &mdash; nej, det er han ikke!</i> P.S. I want to see as a test if you can read these 2 lines of Norwegian? It is when the ship stolen from Peer Gynt blows up at sea with all his goods. He is on the strand, stranded. </div>
