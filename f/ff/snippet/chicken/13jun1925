<div class="nbunit" id="13Jun1925"><font color="red">13 June 1925</font> <i>Letters I</i> (to Harriet Weaver): There has been so much hammering and moving going on here that I could scarcely hear my thoughts &hellip; I hope you have the <i>Contact</i> book. I put in a few puzzles more into my piece. &hellip; Tuohy &hellip; wants to come here to paint me &hellip; Did Fossett change those words? They was two. Doesn&apos;t matter. &lsquo;Gromwelling&rsquo; I said and what? O, ah! Bisexycle that was the bunch. Hope he does, anyhow. O rats! It&apos;s just a fool thing, style. I just shoot it off like: If he ain&apos;t done it, where&apos;s the use? Guess I&apos;m through with that bunch. (With apologies to Robert McAlmon) </div>
