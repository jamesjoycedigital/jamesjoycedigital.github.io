<div class="nbunit" id="5Mar1926"><font color="red">III and UP 5 March 1926</font> (to Harriet Weaver): I think there is a very slight improvement of vision &hellip; Mr Roth sent a cheque for $100 for the Contact and Criterion pieces. It was sent in, dishonoured at first but later on (2 or 3 days) paid. He is printing <font face="wake">A</font> in March and <font face="wake">C</font> in June and says he will pay something. He offers $300 for <b><font face="wake">D</font></b>abcd which took me twelve months hard labour. Hemingway saw him in New York and says he made a very bad impression on him. He admitted that the edition was not confined to 450 copies, that he had 5000 or 10,000 subscribers, that he had successfully used my name as a draw and that he did not think he needed me any more now as my book was too difficult for his public and that he did not believe in paying his contributors much though he admired my work personally &hellip; many thanks for Dowland&apos;s songs &hellip; I hope something I have written may bear comparison with <i>Come silent night</i> for instance. I used the rhythm of William Bird&apos;s <i>Woods so Wild</i> in describing Isolde in the last piece. This, completed and revised, I read a week ago to a small audience, Miss Beach. Morel, the Wallaces and Nuttings. It produced stupefaction, I think. That evening I was exhausted to the point of idiocy and since then, though I wanted to revise <b><font face="wake">D</font></b>abc for Mr Roth, could not do so. Instead I read a few books and plays, the Life of Sims Reeves, Juno and the Paycock, Figgis&apos;s book on Blake ((VI.B.13 216f, 229)) </div>
