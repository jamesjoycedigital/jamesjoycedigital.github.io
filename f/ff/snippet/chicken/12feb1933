<div class="nbunit" id="12Feb1933"><font color="red">12 February 1933</font> <i>NLSP</i> (from Paul L&eacute;on to Carolus Verhulst of the Servire Press): Would you kindly on publication of the coming number of Transition send two copies of it with exact date of publication to Mr Joyce &hellip; and also a tirage &agrave; part of his fragment which he needs to keep for his work and for which it would be a pity to spoil a complete number. I cannot yet give you a definite answer about a separate publication of the fragment. </div>
