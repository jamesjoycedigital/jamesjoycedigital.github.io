<div class="nbunit" id="edn68">  68  This unsolicited self-defence, accompanied with a pronounced stammer, is according to certain psychologists indicative of guilt. As cited here, Earwicker's words are <i>as cited by Webster</i> and we can compare this version with that recounted by the cad. The hero's <i>actual</i> spoken defence is quoted at 281.13 (363.20), slightly transposed in time and space, when he openly admits his guilt but in self-exoneration reminds us that, in fairness, all men are sinners and again at 413.34 (532.06) where he flatly repudiates the accusations (trite!) and boasts rather of his impressive civic achievements.  </div>
