<div class="nbunit" id="edn304">  304  Writing to Harriet Weaver, Joyce explained: &lsquo;The Maronite (Roman Catholic) liturgy, the language of which is Syrian, is at the back of it. On Good Friday the body of Jesus is unscrewed from the cross, placed in a sheet and carried to the sepulchre while girls dressed in white throw flowers at it and a great deal of incense is used. The Maronite ritual is used in Mount Lebanon. <font face="wake">D</font>b departs like Osiris, the body of the young god being pelted and incensed. He is seen as already a Yesterday (Gestern, turning back his glance amid wails of &lsquo;Today!&rsquo; from To Morrow (to-maronite's wail etc). The apostrophe balances the hyphen Guesturn's, Tomaronites.&rsquo; (<cite>Letters</cite> I, <a name="8Aug1928" href="../../flett.fwlett.htm#a8Aug1928">8 August 1928</a>). </p><p> Joyce was inordinately fond of this verse (from Matins of the Little Office of the Blessed Virgin Mary and the third Lesson (Ecclus. 24, 17-20), followed directly by the Te Deum, read at the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, on 15 August) for its lyricism, and cites it in the Belvedere chapter in A Portrait, where he writes of young Stephen &lsquo;when it fell to him to read the lesson towards the close of the office&rsquo; reading it &lsquo;in a veiled voice, luring his conscience to its music.&rsquo;  </div>
