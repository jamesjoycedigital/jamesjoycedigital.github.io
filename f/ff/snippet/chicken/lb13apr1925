<div class="nbunit" id="lb13Apr1925"><font color="red">13 April 1925</font> <i>STA</i> (to Lily Bollach, large hand): I am sorry you could not come the other evening but I am enclosing 100 francs in settlement of my account. If you have not time here perhaps you could drop me a line from London (address: 12, rue de l&apos;Odeon, Paris) to say if you received it safely &hellip; I shall be in London probably before you leave and if I have any MS perhaps I might inflict it on you?? I go into the clinic tomorrow night or Wednesday morning for what I hope will be the very last operation. </div>
