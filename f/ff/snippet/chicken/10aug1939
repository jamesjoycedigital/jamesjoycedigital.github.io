<div class="nbunit" id="10Aug1939"><font color="red">10 August 1939</font> <i>NLPL</i> (to Paul L&eacute;on): If the Viking Press will do a cheaper edition at once what about the corrections? Could they at least add a sheet or so of corrigenda? If L.G. has not sent back the old sheets wire him to do so. To you. I&apos;ll start the correcting at once. </div>
