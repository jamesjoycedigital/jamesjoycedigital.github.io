<div class="nbunit" id="edn63">  63  Joyce allegedly claimed that an anecdote of his father about a tramp who accosted him in the Phoenix Park (a &lsquo;young man&rsquo; whom he described as a &lsquo;cad with a bicycle&rsquo;) with a request for a match with which to light his pipe was the basis of his book. While this is true only in a very limited sense, the cad story is certainly pivotal and in retelling it Joyce casts his father as HCE.  </div>
