<div class="nbunit" id="16Aug1924"><font color="red">16 August 1924</font> <i>Letters I</i> (to Harriet Weaver): For the last ten days I have proofreading &mdash; the revise of <i>A Portrait</i> &hellip; for Mr Cape. Thank goodness it went off today! &hellip; Can you call at the <i>Freeman&apos;s Journal</i> or <i>Irish Times</i> office in London and get a copy of their paper for Monday 11 August? You will find in it &hellip; a rather startling reference to me made by Mr Yeats in crowning with bay the spiritual victors of the Irish Olympic Games &hellip; (In this connection you may refer to the closing paragraph of Shem the Penman piece beginning <i>Pariah</i> &hellip; and ending &hellip; <i>Anna Livia</i>.) &hellip; But it is true that I have been thinking and thinking how and how and how can I and how can it &mdash; all about the fusion of two parts of the book &mdash; while my one bedazzled eye searched the sea like Cain &mdash; Shem &mdash; Tristan &mdash; Patrick from his lighthouse in Boulogne. I hope the solution will presently appear &hellip; We leave for Quimper &mdash; H&ocirc;tel de l&apos;Ep&eacute;e &mdash; on Monday. (18 August 1924) After a short stay there I have to go to Paris to see Dr Borsch </div>
