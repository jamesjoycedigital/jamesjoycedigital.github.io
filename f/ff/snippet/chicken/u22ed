<div class="nbunit" id="u22ed"><h4><cite>Ulysses</cite> by James Joyce, first edition (Paris: Shakespeare and Company, 2 February 1922).</h4> <p>The first edition of <cite>Ulysses</cite> was published by Sylvia Beach, an expatriate American who ran an English-language bookshop and lending library in Paris. She named her publishing company, which was created specifically for that purpose of bringing out <cite>Ulysses</cite>, after the name of her shop: Shakespeare &amp; Company.</p> <p>Despite containing numerous errors, the first edition is an attractive volume, letterpress-printed in Dijon by master-printer Maurice Darantiere. The book is large and is eminently readable.</p> <p>Several facsimile editions of the first edition have been published. At least two of these are still in print:  <ul> <li><a href="http://store.doverpublications.com/0486474704.html" target="_blank">Dover Publications</a>: <cite>Ulysses</cite></a>, a reproduction of the 1922 first edition (New York: Dover, 2002);  <li><a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/ulysses-9780199535675?cc=ie&lang=en&" target="_blank">Oxford University Press</a>: <cite>Ulysses</cite>, edited with an introduction by Jeri Johnson (New York and London: Oxford University press, 1992). This edition, though it has additional useful scholarly information, comes in a much smaller format  than the 1922 that, while easier to carry around, is less so to read. </ul></p> </div>
