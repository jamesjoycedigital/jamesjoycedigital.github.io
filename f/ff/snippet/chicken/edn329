<div class="nbunit" id="edn329">  329  The Four are attempting to ascertain, as they did earlier in I.4, the exact details of the alleged assault(s) upon HCE. The place Yawn describes as the scene of the crime is, clearly, Kate's midden with its partly putrefied parsnips. As it is out in the park, it is, naturally, open and unprotected and generally wind-swept. The Wellington Memorial is re-described here as a huge, magical tree: the legendary triple-rooted Yggdrasil. The signpost really indicates topographical distances, though Yawn argues that it was a sign to warn trespassers off.  </div>
