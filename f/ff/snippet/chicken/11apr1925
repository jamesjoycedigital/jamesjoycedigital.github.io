It came back from the typist (to whom I was too blind to explain its labyrinths) in a dreadful muddle. Yesterday with 3 magnifying glasses and the help of my son we chopped it up and today Mr Morel will come and sew it up on his sewing machine. I want to send it off before I go into the clinic. I shall send you a copy, I hope, by Monday. (13 April 1925) </div>
