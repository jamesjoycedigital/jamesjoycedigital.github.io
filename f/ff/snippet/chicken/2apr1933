<div class="nbunit" id="2Apr1933"><font color="red">2 April 1933</font> <i>NLHW</i> (from Paul L&eacute;on to Harriet Weaver): Messrs Monro Saw sent in their account yesterday &hellip; his monthly income will be reduced as from next month by more than a third i.e. it will be &pound;45 &hellip; This has dealt a very serious blow at Mr Joyce &hellip; very pessimistic giving up any hope to go to Zurich at all or even continuing to write, and work on his book &hellip; The voyage to Zurich is indispensable Mr Joyce will not bring himself to work until and unless he has taken Dr Vogt&apos;s opinion. Secondly you know as well as I do the character of his work the difficulties of it the repeated lapses into loss of confidence which they provoke in him. Considering all this I am afraid that he does not get not only sufficient but even enough encouragement from his immediate surroundings. </div>
