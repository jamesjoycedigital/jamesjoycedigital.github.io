<div class="nbunit" id="edn207">  207  The intersecting spheres of the figure are graphic and symbolic, as well as representative; they comprehend among other things a word (&lsquo;zoo&rsquo;), a map of heaven, hell and earth, a map of Dublin, a drawing of the pudendum and one of buttocks, a letter, a mystic symbol of the harmony of contraries, Yeats's mad gyres (in his <i>A Vision</i>), a bicycle, an egg-beater, and so on. Cf. N33.233: &lsquo;<font face="wake">G</font> study plan of Dublin.&rsquo; </p><p> Clive Hart considers the diagram in his <cite>Structure and Motif</cite>, pages 248f, illustrating his argument with a map. He writes, &lsquo;While the diagram on page 226 (293) is intended to be a symbol of the cosmos, its two cardinal points, A and L, are situated in Ireland as shown in Figure IV, following. The more important of these points, the &lsquo;prisme O&rsquo; (221.30 [287.10]), is identical with the <i>omphalos</i> of III.3, Shaun's navel in the centre of Ireland. This point is defined as &lsquo;the Great Elm with Mearingstone in Foreground&rsquo; (226.32 [293.14]); that is &lsquo;the Great Elm with the Mooring-stone in the foreground.&rsquo; That the centre of Ireland and the Stone of Divisions are intended is clear from the sentence which follows: &lsquo;Given now ann linch you take enn all.&rsquo; The words &lsquo;enn all&rsquo; include an allusion to Lough Ennell, which is just south of Mullingar in Central Ireland, and only a few miles from the Stone of Divisions. Point L is reached when a horizontal &lsquo;copyink strayed line&rsquo; (227.03) [294.02]) is drawn east from Point A, until it reaches &lsquo;Lambday,&rsquo; or Lambay Island, which is three miles off shore, just north of Dublin and on precisely the same latitude as Lough Ennell. Clearly the first, wholly Irish, circle is Shaun's while the other, half in Ireland and half outside it, is Shem's.&rsquo; </p><p> &lsquo;Mearingstone&rsquo; in the above, we may add, also suggests the Mearing stone, a stone situated in a wall immediately south of Dublin Castle; the elm suggests the tree mentioned by LeFanu as long standing in Chapelizod, on the left bank of the Liffey. Further allusions to topography may be found in L.O. Mink, <cite>A &lsquo;Finnegan Wake&rsquo; Gazetteer</cite>. We may note in particular the Leix-Lusk reference, that to Lucan and Allen at 228.01 (295.19), and that to the two Dublin Circular roads at 228.08 (295.31): &lsquo;bicirculars.&rsquo; This last allusion includes yet another candidate for the figure: <i>binoculars</i>, to peer up skirts and behind fig (<i>fig</i>.) leaves with!  </div>
