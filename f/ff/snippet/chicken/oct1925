<div class="nbunit" id="?Oct1925"><font color="red">?October 1925</font> LUND (to Eric Pinker): A few weeks ago there appeared in the <i>Nation</i> (London), <i>New Republic</i> (New York), Nation (N.Y.) and other papers a fullpage advertisement of a quarterly <i>Two Worlds</i> (15 September, no 1) published by Mr Samuel Roth, 500 Fifth Avenue, N.Y., editors, Mr Ford, Mr Pound, and Mr Arthur Symons. It announced in no 1 a first instalment of a new book by me and for no 2 a second instalment. Mr Ford says he knows nothing of the review beyond the advertisement. I never gave Mr Roth anything or even wrote to him. I had a letter from him about four years ago which I did not answer. A second letter, dated 25 September last (ten days later than no 1) arrived asking for a contribution, long or short. I did not answer the letter which on the other hand expressed great admiration and made some extraordinary suggestions about buying up forests for paper in order to secure a great publicity. I can make nothing of the affair and I believe neither Mr Pound nor Mr Symons know anything of this use of their names. Can you find out something about it? &hellip; I am going into hospital for a (seventh) operation on my eye so am notifying you of these few points now as I shall not be able to attend to my correspondence for some time after Thursday next. (26 November 1925) </div>
