<div class="nbunit" id="14Nov1927"><font color="red">14 November 1927</font> <i>BLHW</i> (Sylvia Beach to Harriet Weaver): Mr Joyce asked me to send you his copy of the November No of Transition and to ask if you will please make the additions and corrections on your copy and to return his whenever it is convenient for you. He has also been staying in bed for the last day or two, quite worn out after the terrific labours of rewriting <i>Anna Livia</i>. He seems to be very unhappy because the new work doesn&apos;t please you for whom it is being written. He wouldn&apos;t mind about anybody else not liking it. He often says to me bitterly &ldquo;Miss Weaver doesn&apos;t care for it&rdquo; and yet he feels that some parts of his new work are the best work that he has done and that he can do. </div>
