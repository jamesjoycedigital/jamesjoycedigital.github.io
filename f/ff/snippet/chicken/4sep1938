<div class="nbunit" id="4Sep1938"><font color="red">4 September 1938</font> <i>Letters I</i> (to P.Ruggiero): Again I have to ask you for your help. How do you begin and end a fairy tale or a little story for children in Greek? &hellip; in English you begin: Once upon  a time and a very good time it was; and you end like this: So they put on the kettle and they made tea and they lived happily ever after. The Germans say &lsquo;Es war einmal&rsquo; and they end &lsquo;Und wenn sie nicht gestorben sind, so leben sie noch heute!&rsquo;  Of course I do not want the Greek translation of these sentences but something typically Greek (with the Italian translation underneath). Each country has its own expressions for this purpose. I have finished my long book. Thanks to the Almighty &hellip; We shall be at Zurich by the end of October, I think, but for heaven&apos;s sake don&apos;t wait until then to send me your reply. </div>
