<div class="nbunit" id="edn382">  382  This curious list at 464.31 (595.10), written formulaically in the form &lsquo;for X,&rsquo; is repeated thirty-two times (the precise number of counties in Ireland). The first seven items (&lsquo;For korfs, for streamfish, for confects, for bullyoungs, for smearsassage, for patates, for steaked pig&rsquo;), enumerated in distorted Swedish, are foodstuffs: sausages (<i>korv</i>), herring (<i>stromming</i>), candy (<i>konfekt</i>), clear soup (<i>buljong</i>), sauce made with butter (<i>smorsas</i>), potatoes, and roasted (<i>stekt</i>) pig. These are followed by &lsquo;for men&rsquo; (which remains obscure) and this in turn by twenty-one puns yielding twenty-two names of counties: Limerick, Waterford, Wexford, Louth, Kildare, Leitrim, Kerry, Carlow, Laois, Offaly, Donegal, Clare/Galway, Longford, Monaghan, Fermanagh, Cavan, Antrim, Armagh, Wicklow, Roscommon, and Sligo. Finally, three versions of &lsquo;Meath&rsquo; are listed (though there are in Ireland actually only two, Meath and Westmeath): &lsquo;for larksmathes, for homdsmeethes, for quailsmeathes&rsquo; (the last of these brings us back to the beginning with supper (<i>kvallsmat</i>). The county names omitted from the list are: Dublin, Cork, Kilkenny, Mayo, Derry, Tyrone, Down, and Tipperary. Tipperary has been known as Ireland's &lsquo;premier county&rsquo; and this is reflected in &lsquo;It's a long long ray to Newirelands premier.&rsquo;  </div>
