<div class="nbunit" id="a16May1939"><font color="red">16 May 1939</font> <i>NLFF</i> (from Paul L&eacute;on to Richard de la Mere) the error on Page 34 line 11/12 from foot &hellip; is of course a mistake and the lines need transposing. But I must add that having looked carefully through the page of the revise I find that the mistake must have occurred after the second revise the copy of the first being quite correct. </div>
