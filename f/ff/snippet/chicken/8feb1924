<div class="nbunit" id="8Feb1924"><font color="red">8 February 1924</font> <i>Letters I</i> (to Harriet Weaver): I send you some new MS, a piece I had omitted, a page to replace one typed and a fresh batch of typescript. I hope it will reach you safely. The fresh text follows after the words &lsquo;Shem the penman&rsquo;. I continue to work on, hopeless as the situation seems &hellip; I have consented to give [Ford] for the next issue the Mamalujo episode, the only sidepiece I could detach. The correspondent of the <i>Times</i> here was appealed to and, having examined it, gave his opinion that it would not lead to prosecution for blasphemy &hellip; Perhaps the nightman sketch I send may produce by allopathy a mood of contentment &hellip; P.S. Of course I cannot find the earlier MS. If I look for it any more I shall be unable to do anything for the day. I saw it yesterday. When I see it again I will shoot it at sight. </div>
