<div class="nbunit" id="edn381">  381  <cite>FinnegansWake</cite> 463ff (594-595) and, to a lesser extent, 469 (601) are replete with allusions to New Ireland, an island in Melanesia, a place chosen not alone for its name or for its geographical location &mdash; it is very nearly antipodal to Ireland &mdash; but also because its primitive inhabitants were at the time of Joyce's writing at the stage of development which might optimistically be designated the &lsquo;dawn of civilisation.&rsquo; Cannibalism, for example, had only recently been suppressed. Most of the references, which derive from lists in notebooks N53 (VI.B.46) and N56 (VI.B.41, pages 118-11), are to placenames (see ***), but not all: &lsquo;from the picalava present in the maramara melma&rsquo; at 465.05 (595.27) derives from &lsquo;Maramara&rsquo; and &lsquo;Pikalaba&rsquo; two terms specifying the &lsquo;classes&rsquo; into which the islanders (and all of their possessions) are divided: a <i>maramara</i> man must marry a <i>pikalaba</i> woman and vice versa, and their children will be <i>pikalaba</i> who cannot inherit <i>maramara</i> property, and so on.  </div>
