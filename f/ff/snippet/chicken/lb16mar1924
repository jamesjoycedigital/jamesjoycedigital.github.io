<div class="nbunit" id="lb16Mar1924"><font color="red">16 March 1924</font> <i>STA</i> (to Lily Bollach): I have been so illmannered in not thanking you or writing that I am almost ashamed to ask you to do me a great favour. I should like to have the pages marked with a red cross done again and reinserted, perhaps more spaced but that does not matter. There are only  a few (I am speaking of the last piece you were kind enough to do) and, as tomorrow is S. Patrick&apos;s day and I want the folder back, I wonder could you steal time to type them in. I shall call in any case &hellip; I have been dreadfully overworked &hellip; P.S. I shall make a green cross in honour of S. Patrick instead of a red one. </div>
