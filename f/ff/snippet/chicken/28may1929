<div class="nbunit" id="28May1929"><font color="red">28 May 1929</font> <i>Selected Letters</i> (to Harriet Weaver): I have had too much to do, being up sometimes till 1.30 fooling over old books of Euclid and algebra. Faktorovich &hellip; is a Russian (a bolshevik too and possibly a semi-official one) but I don&apos;t mind as we never talk politics and he is most obliging but chiefly he represents a class of my readers &hellip; the foreignborn admirers. To succeed O I am planning X that is a book of 4 <i>long</i> essays by 4 contributors (as yet I have found only one &mdash; Crosbye &mdash; who has a huge illustrated edition of the <i>Book of the Dead</i>, bequeathed to him by his uncle) &mdash; the subjects to be the treatment of night (cf <i>B</i> of <i>D</i> and S. John of the Cross &lsquo;Dark Night of the Soul&rsquo;), the mechanics and chemistry, the humour and I have not yet fixed on the fourth subject. This for 1930, when I shall also, I hope, send out another fragment, this time about <font face="wake">w</font> with another preface, <font face="wake">A</font> and $.ss having by that time passed into currency &hellip; I have also proposed to a young Dublin artist to do an illustration of the old earwig&apos;s funeral (Time, Saturn) which, as you will see, I introduced into the <i>Ondt and Gracehoper</i>. And that, I think, ends my activities for the moment (UP enclosure on Trobridge and Swedenborg (Divine Wisdom)) </div>
