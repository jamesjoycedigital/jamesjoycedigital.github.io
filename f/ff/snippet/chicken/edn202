<div class="nbunit" id="edn202">  202  These figures (just to be awkward) are given in <i>Finnish</i> at 220.21 (285.17-21): kaksitoista volts yksitoista etc. Curiously, Joyce errs twice in this simple computation (remember how he &lsquo;caught allmeals dullmarks for his nucleuds and alegobrew&rsquo;); in the first instance he ignores the duplication of the letter &lsquo;p&rsquo; in the sample word, thereby miscalculating the actual factorialization required, and, secondly, in listing the result as 497,001,000 he disguises the true result: 479,001,600, same as one from five (4), two to five ones (5), one from five twos (9) millamills (millions), with (= plus) a mill (1000) and (= plus) half a mill (500) and (= plus) two twos fives fives (100).  </div>
