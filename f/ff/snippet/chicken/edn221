<div class="nbunit" id="edn221">  221  In his instantiation as the Norwegian sailor, <font face="wake">H</font> (now distinct from his role as waiting barman) drinks (and eats) quite a lot. His eating, indeed feasting, has about it something of a reverse Last Supper resonance, and regressively reconnects us to his earlier role (in I.1) as the meal itself &mdash; a nice fat salmon on a platter &mdash; and his other role (in I.4) as a self-consuming entity. He eats, is eaten, and eats himself, and is ultimately reduced to molecules and reassembled (in Book IV) as a Humpty Dumpty egg for the reader's breakfast.  </div>
