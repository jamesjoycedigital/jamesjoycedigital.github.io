<div class="nbunit" id="a21Aug1925"><font color="red">ca. 21 August 1925</font> <i>Letters III</i> (to Sylvia Beach): My sight is getting so bad in the good eye even that I am beginning to think I have an incipient cataract in it too. I want to correct both proofs as soon as possible. Hold <font face="wake">A</font> till my next letter arrives &mdash; probably Saturday morning &mdash; with last corrections and then send it off registered please. You will see by Walsh&apos;s letter that <i>This Quarter</i> may not appear for months yet and I cannot hold up the <i>Calendar</i> indefinitely. Walsh&apos;s review <i>may</i> come out on time. In any case please suggest that the Editor of <i>Calendar</i> add a footnote at the beginning of the piece to the effect (v. <i>The Criterion</i>, (July 1925), <i>This Quarter</i>, September, 1925) That is all I can do </div>
