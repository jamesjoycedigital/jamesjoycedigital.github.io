<div class="nbunit" id="17Apr1926"><font color="red">17 April 1926</font> <i>Letters III</i> (to Harriet Weaver): I finished the revision of <b><font face="wake">D</font></b>abcd yesterday. Today I copied out the sheets of <b><font face="wake">D</font></b>a which were unreadable to have them retyped. Tomorrow and Monday (18 and 19 April 1926) I shall do, I hope, the same for <b><font face="wake">D</font></b>b. Then <b><font face="wake">D</font></b>c will take three or four days. Then the typing of these and the &lsquo;man of four watches&rsquo; is complete. I am not sure for the moment how much I have done. I shall know when I read it. I am to read <b><font face="wake">D</font></b>ab, interval, and <b><font face="wake">D</font></b>c to a small group, this time including Antheil and a young American [Lewis] Galanti&egrave;re who is preparing a course of lectures on <i>U</i>. I think I have done a great deal. My brother says that having done the longest day in literature I am now conjuring up the darkest night. I will send you <b><font face="wake">D</font></b>d complete in typescript and the necessary new pages to insert into <b><font face="wake">D</font></b>abc. </div>
