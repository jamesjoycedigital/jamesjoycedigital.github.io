<div class="nbunit" id="edn41">  41  This business about wild flowers outlasting the conflicts of mortals is a re-expression of Quinet's famous statement to the same effect. Joyce uses this theme several times in the <cite>Wake</cite> and quotes it almost verbatim (in French) at 218.08ff. (281.04-13). For an analysis of Quinet's sentence as <i>leitmotif</i> see Clive Hart, <cite>Structure and Motif in Finnegans Wake</cite> (1962), pages l82ff.  </div>
