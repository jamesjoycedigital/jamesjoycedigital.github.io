<div class="nbunit" id="22Aug1925"><font color="red">22 August 1925</font> <i>Beach Letters</i> (to Sylvia Beach): I wrote to Walsh to send &hellip; me the proofs &hellip; I also wrote to Moulder to send me two books he has. No answer. Can you ring him up on the telephone. He sent them to the concierge &hellip; But the concierge is gone! And has sent me the keys of the flat by slow mail and lord knows what he did with the books, perhaps lock them up in the flat. I wanted to add in an allusion or two from these books but it is hopeless. I never was in such a muddle about hotel, proofs, cheques, eyes, concierges etc. Please send off <font face="wake">A</font> with these new changes ((I.8:1.5' B.8 pp.70-83)) and ask the <i>Calendar</i> to set it as quickly as possible as I am going to take a holiday in hospital </div>
