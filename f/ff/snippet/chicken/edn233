<div class="nbunit" id="edn233">  233  The <cite>Wake</cite> version is more elaborate. The basic conflict is extended to encompass a wide spectrum of antipathies: soldier against general, juvex against senex, son against father, plebeian against aristocrat, rebel against conservative, communist against fascist, and so on. Some commentators read in Joyce's retelling the ritual slaying of a (divine) king (<font face="wake">H</font>) by a tribal conspiracy (<font face="wake">C</font> <font face="wake">G</font> <font face="wake">D</font>); others find in it the cannibalistic immolation of a totemic primal father. Yet another sees the General as the Biblical Saul, with Butt as David and Taff as Abishai. (David twice has the opportunity to kill Saul: first, when on going into a cave to shit in privacy he finds him asleep; but, in compassion, rather than do him in as he snores there helplessly, he removes a piece of his clothing in token. On a second occasion, he again stumbles across Saul as Saul sleeps; and, though egged on to kill him, he again refuses.) Another interpretation describes the general ornithomorphically as lusty Cock Robin. At the point of assassination, Butt, the sparrow (that ill-bred plebeian of the gutters), kills the General, the robin (the king of birds) with a bow and arrow: </p><p> At that instullt to Igorlands! Prronto! I gave one dobblenotch and I ups with my crozzier. Mirrdo! With my how on armer and hits leg an arrow cockshock rockrogn. Sparro! (273.21ff). </p><p> Ellmann writes that Joyce told the story to Samuel Beckett, explaining that he was having difficulty in fitting it into the <cite>Wake</cite>, &lsquo;If somebody could tell me what to do, I would do it.&rsquo; Beckett's alleged droll remark, when Joyce brought up the piece of turf &mdash; <i>another insult to Ireland</i> &mdash; seems to have given Joyce a way fully to &lsquo;localise&rsquo; the story. The comment is echoed in the <cite>Wake</cite> at the culmination of the tale (see above) and also earlier at 8.31 in the I.1 Waterloo episode (&lsquo;waggling his tailoscrupp to insoult on the hinndoo seeboy&rsquo;). These two episodes should be explored for further correlations.  </div>
