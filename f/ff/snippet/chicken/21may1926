<div class="nbunit" id="21May1926"><font color="red">I and SL 21 May 1926</font> (to Harriet Weaver): <b><font face="wake">D</font></b>abc came back typed and <b><font face="wake">D</font></b>d will be here on Sunday or Monday. (23 or 24 May 1926) To what address can I send them and is the post safe &hellip; I wish you would read through <b><font face="wake">D</font></b>abcd and tell me how thay interact &hellip; Wyndham Lewis rang me up twice last week &hellip; he is to bring out a critical review (6 times yearly) <i>The Tyrocritic</i> (I hope he will correct the misspelling). It is to be all critical and philosophic and contain no creative work. But he wanted to make an exception in my case and asked me would I give him something. I said I would with great pleasure &hellip; If I have not filled in a gap in my typescript before sending it it means that I could not think of the question to insert there. It has bothered me for some time. I have the book now fairly well planned out in my head. I am as yet uncertain whether I shall start on the twilight games of <font face="wake">C</font> <b><font face="wake">D</font></b> and <font face="wake">I</font> which will follow immediately after <font face="wake">A</font> or on K&apos;s orisons, to follow <b><font face="wake">D</font></b>d. But my mind is rather exhausted for the moment. Have you read Saint Patrice? There is a book on Bruno (though not on Nolan) by Lewis McIntyre (Macmillan) I do not know if Vico has been translated. I would not pay overmuch attention to these theories, beyond using them for all they are worth, but they have gradually forced themselves on me through circumstances of my own life. I wonder where Vico got his fear of thunderstorms. </div>
