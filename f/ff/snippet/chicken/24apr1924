<div class="nbunit" id="24Apr1924"><font color="red">24(27) April 1924</font> <i>Letters III</i> (to Lily Bollach STA): I wanted to write to you several days ago but I have had a rather bad nervous collapse from overwork &hellip; Mr Valery Larbaud asked me to let him have a copy of the Anna Livia piece (enclosed) and I have also promised one to a relative in Ireland who has done a good deal of research for me. So could you make three fresh copies of it without the blanks in the paging? </div>
