<div class="nbunit" id="14Sep1927"><font color="red">14 September 1927</font> <i>Letters I</i> (to Harriet Weaver): I was besides working on a revision of <font face="wake">C</font> which I finished Monday (12 September 1927) &hellip; I feel you do not think the work I am engaged in at present worth the sacrifice and even then in view of the general and particular opposition &mdash; I do not guarantee to write it &hellip; My sight is not good, many more operations have made me more diffident than ever. Some of the hostile criticisms of my new work seem to me imbecile but I would agree to sacrifice 1/4 if the rest is read or printed to be read and there is no other way &hellip; I suppose I spent a good 10,000 hours writing Pts 1 and 3 but I could not undertake even to sketch part 2 and the end unless my mind during the time is completely freed from strain. </div>
