<div class="nbunit" id="19Jul1923"><font color="red">19 July 1923</font> <i>Letters I</i> (to Harriet Weaver): <i>Pur commencer</i> may I have recourse to your offered aid and ask you to type the enclosed (2 copies)? I shall send you the original sheet (now quite illegible) when I have transcribed what is on the back of it. I think it would give me pleasure to see the first page of type. I hope it is legible. </div>
