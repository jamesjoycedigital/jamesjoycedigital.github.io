<div class="nbunit" id="edn163">  163  The washerwoman is combining several answers in one. HCE was born at sea (he has blue in his eye) and came to Ireland as a plunderer. He may have raped ALP before carting her round with him in a parrot-cage (she was very small) that doubled as a lantern. As for getting some money by marrying her, it isn't explained how he did (see <a name="n11110c" href="../fnbs/n11all.htm#n11110c">N11 (VI.B.5):110(c)</a> and <a name="n18037d" href="../fnbs/n18all.htm#n18037d">N18 (VI.B.8):037(d)</a>). His initial taking of ALP, it seems, is the only marriage ceremony she ever got. The physical act of copulation (penetration) is portrayed in the text as a barque barging its way into Dublin Bay and on into the virginal Liffey waters past its labial North and South <i>Bulls</i> (these are sandbanks), so-called after the roaring of surf against them.  </div>
