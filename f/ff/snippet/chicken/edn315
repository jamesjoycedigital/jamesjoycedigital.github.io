<div class="nbunit" id="edn315">  315  The boat under discussion is variously described: as a &lsquo;burial battell; as the &lsquo;boat of millions of years&rsquo; that ferried the souls of the blessed through the darkness of death; as the Boat of Hennu; as an &lsquo;orange boat;&rsquo; as a longboat, the <i>Dragon of Denmark</i>; as a French boat, the <i>Pourquoi Pas</i> (a French polar research vessel of this name sank off Iceland in 1936); but it is principally the boats in which Saint Patrick sailed in his coming to Ireland, first as a slave and, again, as teacher. Patrick had to put up with some wolfhounds while on board, hence Shaun's terror of wolves. <i>The wolves of Fochlut! By Whydoyoucallme? Do not flingamejig to the wolves!</i> This also echoes Patrick's statement in his <i>Confessions</i> that while reading the beginning of a letter containing the Voice of the Irish, as he put it, he seemed in that moment to hear the voices of those &lsquo;who were beside the Wood of Foclut, which is near the Western Sea.&rsquo; Parnell, of course, is also comprehended in the wolf allusion.  </div>
