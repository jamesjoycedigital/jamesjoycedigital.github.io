<div class="nbunit" id="16Jan1927"><font color="red">16 January 1927</font> <i>Letters III</i> (to Harriet Weaver): It is impossible to get  a reply from Lewis (who was so anxious to have something of mine for his new review) so I have sent the piece to New York to try to get American copyright. I am plunged again in work. I want to try to finish Part 1 before 2 February or very soon after and, if possible, get away for some weeks. I cannot work at Part 3 in this way. It is too much. I must take it easier. Nobody else does it or a tithe of it </div>
