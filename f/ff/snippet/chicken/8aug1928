On Good Friday the body of Jesus is unscrewed from the cross, placed in a sheet and carried to the sepulchre while girls dressed in white throw flowers at it and a great deal of incense is used. The Maronite ritual is used in Mount Lebanon. <font face="wake">D</font>b departs like Osiris the body of the young god being pelted and incensed. He is seen as already a Yesterday (Gestern, turning back his glance amid wails of &lsquo;Today!&rsquo; from To Morrow (to-maronite&apos;s wail etc). The apostrophe balances the hyphen Guesturn&apos;s, Tomaronites.) </p><p>This censing scene is led up by <br>licet ut lebanos (p.12) = this may be used as incense (libanos is Greek for incense) <br>The words &lsquo;at my frank incentive&rsquo;. &lsquo;Idos be&rsquo; (idos is also Greek for incense and the name of an &lsquo;artificial tongue&rsquo; &lsquo;thurily&rsquo; (for thoroughly)&mdash;t(h)us&mdash;t(h)uris is Latin for incense &lsquo;Weih?&mdash;Up the Shameeroaugh!&rsquo; Weihrauch is German for incense. Here it sounds also shamrock but means a cloudscreen or shamescreen &lsquo;licensed and censered&rsquo; p.13 etc, also &lsquo;sedro&rsquo; Syriac for [prayer]. </p><p>The choir of girls splits in two: those who pronounce Oahsis and those who pronounce Oeyesis (cf Our Father who/which art etc). The Latin is &lsquo;Quasi cedrus exaltata sum in Lebanon etc&rsquo; see A.P.T.A.A.A.Y.M. Belvedere College chapter. There are in all 29 words in the threnody 6 &times; 4 = 24 and the final 5 = 29 (Tu autem, Domine, misereree nobis!). </div>
