<div class="nbunit" id="24May1924"><font color="red">24 May 1924</font> <i>Letters I</i> (to Harriet Weaver): The weather became very hot a few days ago &hellip; I went out, bought another case, packed and put to storage all my books, gathered my MSS including Shawn (30 pages of my large notebook, foolscap size) which I could not write out again, made a parcel of them and telephoned to Miss Beach who came and removed them hastily so that there is as much literature in my room as in your office. I was to have gone on with the writing a little longer but the nine months&apos; labour was quite enough for me. I found my vision, power of attention all gradually getting worse yet I knew that if the books or even the MSS were left here I would go on. So I stopped. Hence this fountain pen which I bought when I had left off writing. I am sorry I could not face the writing out of Shawn which is  a description of a postman travelling backwards in the night through the events already narrated. It is written in the form of a <i>via crucis</i> of 14 stations but in reality it is only a barrel rolling down the river Liffey. To write a book like this I should have a study of my own where I could quickly get at my books and papers. Otherwise it is impossible. </div>
