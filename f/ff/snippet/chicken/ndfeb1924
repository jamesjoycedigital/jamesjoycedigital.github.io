<div class="nbunit" id="ndfeb1924"><font color="red">N.D. (probably February) 1924</font> <i>Letters I</i> (to Robert McAlmon): Ford has come so often to the well and talked about support given me in the past that I have consented to give him the four masters bit (which is only a sidepiece) for his next number. The review is very shabby in my opinion. </div>
