<div class="nbunit" id="b10Oct1925"><font color="red">10 October 1925</font> <i>Letters I</i> (to Harriet Weaver): I began <font face="wake">D</font>d (otherwise the last watch of Shaun) a few days ago and have produced about three foolscapes of hammer and tongs stratification lit up by a fervant prayer to the divinity which shapes our roads in favour of my ponderous protagonist and his miniscule consort. Shall I send you the corrected typescript of <font face="wake">A</font> there or wait till you return? I composed some wondrous sequences for <font face="wake">D</font>d during the night and wrote them out in the dark very carefully only to discover that I had made a mosaic on top of my other notes so I am now going to bring the astronomical telescope into play. </div>
