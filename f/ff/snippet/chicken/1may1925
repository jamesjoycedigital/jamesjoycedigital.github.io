<div class="nbunit" id="1May1925"><font color="red">1 May 1925</font> <i>Letters III</i> (to Harriet Weaver, large hand): I am no worse, possibly a little better &hellip; I am reluctant to go away an &lsquo;unfinished job&rsquo;. I can write this and even see a few of the letters! It is the first of December today (winter time) and the light is dazzling &hellip; The day is awfully long and boring and all I can do is to listen to a few records and scribble an odd note &hellip; a London shop sent me a disk lately (the de Reszke quartet in an English foursome part &mdash; cf. Mr Earwicker&apos;s speech p.1. &lsquo;our fourposter singing etc&rsquo; &mdash; which gave my ear and brain great pleasure) in three days! I &lsquo;wrasted the page redhanded&rsquo; from the Sunday Times but I hope you will be able to join the fragments </div>
