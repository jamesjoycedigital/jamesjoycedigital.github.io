<div class="nbunit" id="edn142">  142  Joyce's description of Shem may owe something to Francis William Newman's description of a young man he calls the Irish clergyman, an indefatigable curate in the mountains of Wicklow. In chapter 2 (&lsquo;Strivings after a More Primitive Christianity&rsquo;) of his <cite>Phases of Faith</cite>, he writes: </p><p> His bodily presence was indeed weak. A fallen cheek, a bloodshot eye, crippled limbs resting on crutches, a seldom-shaved beard, a shabby suit of clothes and a generally neglected person He did not fast on purpose, but his long walks through wild country and indigent people inflicted on him such severe deprivation: moreover, as he ate whatever food offered itself, food often impalatable and indigestible to him, his whole frame might have vied in emaciation with a monk of La Trappe. </p><p> So holy was this man, Newman contends, he &lsquo;had practically given up all reading except that of the Bible.&rsquo; When Shem reads, or tries to read, given the fading light and disorder of his cell, is not the Bible, but his useless, unreadable, blue book of Eccles ( <cite>Ulysses</cite>).  </div>
