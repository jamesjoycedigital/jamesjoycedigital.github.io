<div class="nbunit" id="11Apr1930"><font color="red">11 April 1930</font> <i>Tulsa</i> (from Paul L&eacute;on): Many thanks for your letter in French (I think it better this way than to use an adjective) &mdash; I have found 6 of the corrections &mdash; cannot find &ldquo;the peak of Pims&rdquo; or &ldquo;the Noksat&rdquo; (or so it seems to me) after which &ldquo;the Peeler and Pawr&rdquo; have to come in &mdash; I am getting the third proofs tomorrow and promised them to Babou for &ldquo;Mundai&rdquo;. Further I found &ldquo;Peace perfect peace&rdquo; and &ldquo;for Amiens peace sake&rdquo; on the next page &mdash; what to do? would &ldquo;pax&apos;s sake&rdquo; do? </div>
