<div class="nbunit" id="22Dec1931"><font color="red">22 December 1931</font> <i>BLHW</i> (to Harriet Weaver): Your letter and a violent tirade over the telephone came about the same time while I was trying to write out a funny piece of verse about those insurance people to the lilt of &lsquo;Sing a Song of Sixpence&rsquo;. Such is life. You will see I have used up some things that you told me about your aunt in the additions but this was not meant mockingly. We are all, <i>au fond</i>, foolish in one way or another </div>
