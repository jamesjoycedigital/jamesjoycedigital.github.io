<div class="nbunit" id="edn410">  410  Throughout the letter HCE appears as a grocer (as does his arch-enemy) and not as a publican. It is true of course that in times past it was quite common in Ireland to find pubs combined with groceries (indeed pubs combined with funeral shops), the same premises selling food by day and drink by night. More relevant is the fact that as a &lsquo;spiritual breakfast&rsquo; the letter should be full of allusions to HCE's morning fare (milk, bacon, butter, sausages, pudding, mushrooms, cups of tea, followed by a drink and a smoke and even, perhaps, a purgative: a kingly meal indeed!).  </div>
