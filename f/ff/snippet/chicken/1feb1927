I conclude you do not like the piece I did? I have been thinking over it. It is all right I think &mdash; the best I could do. I will gladly do another but it must be for the second part or the fourth and not till after the first week in March or so, as the editors of <i>transition</i> liked the piece so well that they asked me to follow it up &hellip; I am rather discouraged about this as in such a vast and difficult enterprise I need encouragement. It is possible Pound is right but I cannot go back. </div>
