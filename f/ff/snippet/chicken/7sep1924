Patrick &hellip; She gave me a pocket breast-plate in the new Irish colours with part of his famous prayer on it cut in the form of a shield. At the top is a cross and at the end are the words: all rights reserved. This must be the first case of copyright in the history of humanity &hellip; I hope that in a day or two I shall have fixed up something about a flat so that we can leave for London &hellip; I see less than before. </div>
