<div class="nbunit" id="22Dec1938"><font color="red">22 December 1938</font> <i>NLFF</i> (from Paul L&eacute;on to Richard de la Mere): Further to my letter of today: I have now spoken with Mr Joyce regarding the title. His desire for secrecy is mainly meant for America and has a particular American Irish element in view. We have received information concerning the powerful pressure which was brought to bear &hellip; in America by these elements during &hellip; Ulysses case &hellip; this influence &hellip; was not favourable. This confirmed Mr Joyce in his original reluctance to make known the title of his new book. The title itself is a form somewhat changed of the title of a song of the comic Irishman musichall type, popular some sixty years ago. The changed form is meant to cover the Nordic Celtic sagas continually suggested in the book. It offers however a very good opportunity for advance attacks at the present time when so much hectic national spirit is abroad. It is not easy for me not knowing English equivalents to suggest a parallel in English but perhaps some song lampooning the present English Royal Family might serve the case. If you know the French music-hall song made so popular by Georgius called &ldquo;Les Noces &agrave; Rebecca&rdquo;, it might give you an idea of what, I think, he means, if you substitute for another &hellip; susceptible Jewish sentiment an equally susceptible Celtic one. </div>
