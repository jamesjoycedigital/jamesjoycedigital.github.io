<div class="nbunit" id="29Jul1923"><font color="red">29 July 1923</font> <i>BLHW</i> (to Harriet Weaver): I have catalogued another fifty pages or so and am drafting out another part which I may send on tomorrow as a final affliction &hellip; If I could leave on Wednesday (1 August 1923) I could see you before you go away for next weekend and in that case you could give me the typescript instead of posting it &hellip; my attempt to debolshevise my notes. Time, I suppose is necessary. Of course I accumulated more notes and papers and books here. However on the other hand I have sifted out several square feet of material. I was very pleased to get that first page of typescript not that it is <i>definitif</i> but for the pleasure of seeing it. </div>
