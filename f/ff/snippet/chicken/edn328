<div class="nbunit" id="edn328">  328  Immediately prior to the period of silence the interrogators are busily trying to re-establish direct contact with Yawn's <i>pneuma</i>. They are picking up a lot of interference: mainly fragments of a lovers' dialogue. The lover, like Parnell, begs that if he is to be sold, let the sellers at least get his price. The Four cannot identify the speakers (the lines being crossed as it were) and call down into Yawn, by now transformed into a radio receiver or transceiver, to let them know the <i>title</i> (the name) of the speakers, seemingly here as elsewhere their primary concern. The last words they manage to wedge in before finally losing connection is <i>Tit! What is the ti?</i> This is of course a pun on <i>time</i>, recalling the cad's asking for the right time that set everything in motion.  </div>
