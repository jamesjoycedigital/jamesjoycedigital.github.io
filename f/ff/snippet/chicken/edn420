<div class="nbunit" id="edn420">  420  Rollo (historically) was the leader of a gang of Northmen who, in return for accepting the rite of baptism, were granted land in Northern France. This resulted in the formation of Normandy, the Normans, and, ultimately, the conquests of England (in 1066) and Ireland (in 1172). Rollo is a Shaun/HCE figure.  </div>
