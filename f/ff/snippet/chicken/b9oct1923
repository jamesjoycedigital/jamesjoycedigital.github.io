Today I send you the rough sheets with a plan of the verse and a forgotten page of H.C.E. But please don&apos;t read them yet &mdash; in fact, they are illegible. On Saturday [13 October 1923] I shall send the typed copy and the fair copy. I am glad to get rid of them as they gave me a lot of trouble  </div>
