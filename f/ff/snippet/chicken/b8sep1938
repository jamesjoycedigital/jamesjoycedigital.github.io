<div class="nbunit" id="b8Sep1938"><font color="red">8 September 1938</font> <i>Letters I</i> (to Louis Gillet): These are the merry circumstances in which I work on my nocturnal comedy &mdash; or, at least, what some are pleased to term the purgatory &hellip; A strange parallel has occurred in the case of Ulysses &mdash; Victor B&eacute;rard. His study on Homer came to collaborate my theory of the semitic nature of the Odyssey when I had already written three-quarters of the book. Now I find my theory of the Scandinavian nature of my hero Finn MacCool (the Fingal of Macpherson, father of Ossian and grandfather of Oscar) confirmed by the researches of a German scholar, Zimmer, with whose work I was unfamiliar. It was a young student in Paris who brought my attention to these studies, and it is curious to see, in the resum&eacute; which Professor Zimmer of Heidelberg prepared for me of the work of his father, the boldness with which I dared to put the big Norwegian H C E in the skin of a hero of pure Celtic mythology &hellip; justified in the Teutonic doctrine with chapter and verse. </div>
