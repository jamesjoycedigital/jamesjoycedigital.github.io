<div class="nbunit" id="andMay1925"><font color="red">N.D. May 1925</font> (to M. Darantiere): If it is not too late would you  make the following change in the piece of my new book that you are publishing for Mr McAlmon? At the end instead of: Saint Martin&apos;s summer read Saint Swithin&apos;s summer. I publish in the <i>criterion</i> of the end of June another fragment where there is a word of acknowledgement to yourself. Miss Beach will send you a copy. P.S. Excuse these scribblings. I am ill. </div>
