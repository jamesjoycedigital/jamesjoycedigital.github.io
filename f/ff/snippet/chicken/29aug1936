<div class="nbunit" id="29Aug1936"><font color="red">29 August 1936</font> <i>NLCV</i> (from Viscount Carlow to Paul L&eacute;on): I would have written to you before to acknowledge the corrected copy of Transition and the two initials, but not only have I been away, but I wished to read and examine the material before writing. I am now ready to start setting as soon as I have cleared away two short stories which should be finished within the week. A certain amount of experimental work will have to be done to see the best way of arranging the page, but that should not take long, and as soon as I have sorted the thing out in my own mind, I shall come to Paris and interview the people who are to reproduce the initials. </div>
