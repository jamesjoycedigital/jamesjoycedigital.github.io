<div class="nbunit" id="bff18Nov1938"><font color="red">18 November 1938</font> <i>NLFF</i> (from Richard de la Mere to Paul L&eacute;on): Thank you for &hellip; pages 1-216 of the proofs with all Mr Joyce&apos;s press corrections. I see from your last letter that Mr Joyce would like to see the final revised proofs of those pages on which verbal corrections have been made, but that he does not think it necessary to see any further revised proofs of those pages where merely literal corrections have been made or changes in punctuation. I am glad of that, because there is no time to be spared if spring publication is to be achieved.  </div>
