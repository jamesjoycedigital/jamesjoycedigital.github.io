Gregory XV in 1622 extended it to all Franciscans between Vespers and sunset on August 2nd. Innocent XI in 1678 extended it in favour of the same church to the souls in Purgatory. Finally the Indulgence of Portjuncula can be gained in all churches in which the order of Franciscans is canonically established. The question of the origin is still doubtful. Early biographers are silent about it.  <br> Fjaell means board &mdash; but in the little norwegian-english dictionary it does not give the com. or any other indication.  <br> Porkbarrel. Mencken does not give its meaning &mdash; he refers to another book &mdash; I will go to Galignani to find out what I can. The origin given by Mencken is the pre-civil war bugaboo or humourous metaphor established during the campaign won by Jefferson against Adam.  <br> The six B and C names of Greek and Roman mythology are: Bacchus / Bellerophon / Boreas / Briseis / Ceres ?cybele / Cassiopea ? Castor ? Clio ? Charites / Cecrops / Centaurus / Cassandra etc etc  <br> [in Paul L&eacute;on hand] (1) fjaell en/er fjelg-ag fjael &mdash; board (2) Catholic encyclop. date and orig of feast portjuncula (3) mythology 6 or 7 B.
