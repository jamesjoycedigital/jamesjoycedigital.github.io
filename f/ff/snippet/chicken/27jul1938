<div class="nbunit" id="27Jul1938"><font color="red">27 July 1938</font> <i>NLHW</i> (from Harriet Weaver to Paul L&eacute;on): I have found, copied and am posting to Mr Joyce tonight the bit on St Patrick that I typed for him when he was at Bognor. You say he has found two of the other bits. There were four. If he finds he wants the fourth I could send it if you would let me know which it is. </div>
