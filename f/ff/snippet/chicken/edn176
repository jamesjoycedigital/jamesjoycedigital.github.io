The games came first and were simply games played on the streets of Chapelizod by the children. In the middle of developing the episode, Joyce turned aside and dealt with <cite>Haveth Childers Everywhere</cite> (III&sect;3B) material before revisiting the <i>Mime</i> in the period 1930&ndash;1932. The parts of notebook N34 (VI.B.27) that were not already dedicated to III&sect;3B and, later, N41 (VI.B.33) were compiled with II.1 in mind.  </div>
