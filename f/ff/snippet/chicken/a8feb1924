<div class="nbunit" id="a8Feb1924"><font color="red">8 February 1924</font> <i>Letters I</i> (to Harriet Weaver): I send you some new MS, a piece I had omitted, a page to replace one typed and a fresh batch of typescript. I hope it will reach you safely. The fresh text follows after the words &lsquo;Shem the penman&rsquo;. I continue to work on, hopeless as the situation seems &hellip;  Perhaps the nightman sketch I send may produce by allopathy a mood of contentment &hellip; </div>
