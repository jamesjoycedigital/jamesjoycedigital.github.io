<div class="nbunit" id="23Jan1938"><font color="red">23 January 1938</font> <i>NLFF</i> (JJ draft of Paul L&eacute;on to T.S. Eliot) I spoke with Mr Joyce this morning over the telephone when I rang him up to inform him that I had received 15 short galleys of &ldquo;Viscount Carlow&apos;s printed version corrected&rdquo;. He asked me to point out for the third time that Viscount Carlow never had anything whatever to do with the version in question which was printed in The Hague and distributed by Faber and Faber in England &hellip; Mr H considered publication in July unreasonable &hellip; Mr Joyce is perfectly well aware that 4th July is the American National holiday (five members of his family owe their Christian names to this fact, including his son) and it is precisely for this reason, among others, that he wishes his book to be published in England on that day and in the U.S.A. on the eve of that day, his father&apos;s birthday. If no intelligent effort will be made to comply with his wishes he sees no use in continuing to work night and day as he has done and plans to leave for Switzerland after his own birthday (2 February) for a holiday of several months, resuming work on his book in the autumn. </div>
