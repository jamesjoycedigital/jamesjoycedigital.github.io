I hope all your little storiellas have been safely disposed of by now and are off the market for their mighty mother is now at last making ready to slide into the unsuspecting sea. I am making a brief holiday here but return to Paris in a few days to hammer on the last plates and paint her title before the skippereen father gives her his blessing </div>
