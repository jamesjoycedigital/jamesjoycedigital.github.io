<div class="nbunit" id="1Jan1938"><font color="red">1 January 1938</font> <i>NLFF</i> (from Paul L&eacute;on to T.S. Eliot): Mr Joyce &hellip; has been working &hellip; for the last six months with a tremendous energy and is sparing no effort for the corrected galleys to be in the hands of the printers by February the 2nd. The eventual alterations and additions which will be made on the revise will be final and not numerous. But if the book is actually not to appear before Autumn it seems useless to work at such top speed at the expense of his health &hellip; get into communication with the Viking Press &hellip; find out whether it would not be still possible to bring out the book late in spring and if so what earliest date should the final revise be in your possession &hellip; Mr Joyce does not intend to give the title of the book, which he has withheld for so long, until the last moment. As to the question of a photographic reproduction of his book in America, barring the question of safeguarding his copyright, he takes no interest whatsoever in it &hellip; request &hellip; the date when the proofs of the first section of Part II are likely to be back for correction in Paris. Could you when sending these galleys send Mr Joyce also a specimen page, not necessarily printed, of the size you intend to publish the book in. </div>
