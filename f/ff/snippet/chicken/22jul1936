<div class="nbunit" id="22Jul1936"><font color="red">22 July 1936</font> <i>Letters III</i> (to Viscount Carlow): Would the piece in this issue of <i>transition</i> with this initial suit you? You may keep the review in any case but I would ask you to return the <i>lettrine</i> if you decide that it is unsuitable for your purpose. I fear it is. The copy I showed you of the Chaucer book was an advance one and as the book itself will not be out till the 10 August I enclose a proof of Louis Gillet&apos;s preface </div>
