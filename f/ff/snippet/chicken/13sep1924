[Dr Borsch] said that it may take three or six months but that he undertakes it will come back &hellip; I have taken a furnished flat here for six months &hellip; We leave for London on Tuesday morning (15 September 1924) &hellip; possible holdup at the coast if the sea is rough. I know that Equinox rages hereabouts but hope to skip across his path like Macintosh before the viceroy&apos;s coach and four. My son is coming with us </div>
