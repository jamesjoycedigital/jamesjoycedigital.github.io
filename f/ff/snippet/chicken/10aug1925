I want to correct the proofs of these two pieces while I can &hellip; The editor of <i>The Calendar</i> wants to publish his piece on 1 October. Can you let me have a proof of your piece early in September and fix the date of appearance before the 1 October? In that case he will set his piece now and I can check both and be finished with them </div>
