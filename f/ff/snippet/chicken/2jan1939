<div class="nbunit" id="2Jan1939"><font color="red">2 January 1939</font> <i>NLFF</i> (from Richard de la Mere to Paul L&eacute;on): I have just been looking through the corrected galley proofs of episode 3 of Part III that you sent me with your letter of January 31st &hellip; puzzled &hellip; episode 3 begins at the top of galley 173, but there is no indication in the first line at the top of that galley &hellip; that line begins with a small letter and without any indentation. Is that intended &hellip;? &hellip; telegraph to me to let me know &hellip; I am rather worried by the vast number of corrections for these galley proofs. How on earth we are going to get through by February 2nd I really don&apos;t know &hellip;  </div>
