<div class="nbunit" id="edn196">  196  In this small part of the text where we sojourn, we find embedded numerous references to placenames in or adjacent to the historical village of Chapelizod, lying a few miles outside Dublin and boasting an origin even older than the metropolis itself. Other than those historical places mentioned in the synopsis above are the following: Riverside, Sunnybank, Buona Vista, Santa Rosa, Mayfield House, Springvale, Orchard Lodge, S. Laurence Lodge, Glenmaroon, Ashview house, Glenthorn, Belgrove, Mulberry House, Boundary Villa, the <i>Wren's Nest</i> (a fine old pub still going strong, where this annotator once drank), the <i>Tap</i> (long gone), the <i>Tavern</i> (a distant memory) and others. Joyce rifled <i>Thom's</i> directory for his information. </p><p> The tavern run by HCE and ALP, with his tobacco-stained hands and her floppy hair, is specified as being precisely two million, two hundred and eighty thousand, nine hundred and sixty &lsquo;lines&rsquo; west of the G.P.O. in Dublin. One can arrive at this number by the multiplication of 1760, 3, 12, and 36: that is, thirty six times the number of inches in a mile. If by a &lsquo;radiolumin line&rsquo; Joyce implies one twelfth of an inch, the figure correlates with an actual measurement of the distance from Chapelizod to the G.P.O.  </div>
