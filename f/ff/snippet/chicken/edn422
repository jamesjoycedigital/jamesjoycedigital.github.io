<div class="nbunit" id="edn422">  422  <i>I am leafy, your goolden, so you called me, may me life, yea your goolden.</i> What Anna is referring to here is the scene mentioned in the letter where HCE woke up beside her in a sweat and called her &lsquo;goldylocks.&rsquo; One can discern in this Joyce's sole direct use of the name May Goulding, the maiden name of Mrs Simon Dedalus (representing Joyce's own mother). It is perhaps appropriate that old Joyce remembers his mother in old ALP remembering her father.  </div>
