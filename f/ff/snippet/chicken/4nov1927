An offer was made to me by a man who called on me a few weeks ago to give me &pound;300 &hellip; for permission to publish a part of my new book in an edition de luxe of 600 copies at &pound;2 each &hellip; So I am trying to put on to <font face="wake">A</font> of t8 the revisions which in the usual course I should have left till the coming out of the whole in book form. t.8 has not yet arrived. I read from an advance copy </div>
