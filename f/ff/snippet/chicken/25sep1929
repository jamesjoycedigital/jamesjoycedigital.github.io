<div class="nbunit" id="25Sep1929"><font color="red">25 September 1929</font> <i>UP</i> (NL MS 5754; to District Justice Flood): On coming back here after a three months&apos; holiday in the south of England I found your letter and books. It was very good of you to remember me and no books could be more useful or interesting. My sight is so bad that they must be read to me but it will be a pleasure to hear them. You must allow me, however, upon occasion to return your courtesy. </div>
