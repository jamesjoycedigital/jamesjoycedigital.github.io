I am afraid I cannot confine this person to private circulation. It is out of my power since you yourself put him in currency. Perhaps I ought to explain that Shemus is the Irish for James, that Anna Livia (Eve) means mother of all the living, that Dublin is built on the river Anna Liffey, (a stream only 50 miles long but with great windings, shallow, and darkred brown in colour (her hair)) and that what the Norwegian constable says is: Hvorledes hav De det idag, min sort Herre? (How are you today, my black gentleman) just as in the piece I am now doing Madam Earwicker&apos;s poetical composition which begins touchingly: High Hellsker gone ladies hen smake a lily pigger is in old Danish form Jeg elske jaalades en smukke lille Pige (I love so much a pretty little girl)  </div>
