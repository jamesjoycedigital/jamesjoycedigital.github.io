<div class="nbunit" id="c28Nov1938"><font color="red">28 November 1938</font> <i>NLFF</i> (from Richard de la Mere to Paul L&eacute;on): I have just received those final revised proofs of pages 1-64 &hellip; printers have not sent single pages only in revised form &hellip; So I am proposing &hellip; to send you a final revised proof of the whole book so that Mr Joyce&apos;s last corrections may be checked carefully before we go to press. The rest of the proofs of the parts that you have already returned will be coming to you in revised form in daily batches. I am also sending you galley proofs of the end of Part II. </div>
