<div class="nbunit" id="28Nov1940"><font color="red">28 November 1940</font> <i>Letters III</i> (to Carola Giedion-Welcker): I received this morning the two letters attached. &hellip; The Germans granted the exit permit for Lucia three months ago &hellip; Now the permit arrives and the exit permit is revoked! &hellip; in Switzerland I would be able to do more than here. I telephoned the Irish Legation and the minister is giving me a letter of introduction to Mr Sean Lester at Geneva. I think he could  intervene effectively with the help of the International Red Cross. I do not find his address. If you know it you can send him one of these copies and explain the matter to him. If you can let me have his address by wire before we leave I shall go see him with the minister&apos;s letter when I am in Lausanne &hellip; The name of the charg&eacute; d&apos;affaires at the Irish Legation at Berne is Mr Frank Cremins. Keep the other copies for him but do not send them on for the moment. The other man, Lester, will be more useful, I think. There is also Count O&apos;Kelly, charg&eacute; d&apos;affaires of Ireland in Paris whom I know </div>
