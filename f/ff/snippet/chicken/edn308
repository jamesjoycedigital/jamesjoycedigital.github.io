<div class="nbunit" id="edn308">  308  This end to Jaun-Shaun, strongly suggestive of Christ's descent into Hell, is given a religious tone by the oblique use of two quotations from Saint John: &lsquo;Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth&rsquo; (12.35) and &lsquo;I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work&rsquo; (9.4). The reader will also detect use of that fine liberating ballad, <i>The West's Awake</i>.  </div>
