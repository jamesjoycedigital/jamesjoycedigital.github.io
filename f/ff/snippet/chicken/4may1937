<div class="nbunit" id="4May1937"><font color="red">4 May 1937</font> <i>NLVP</i> (from Ben Huebsch to Paul L&eacute;on): I am ordering Gogarty&apos;s memoirs to be sent to Mr Joyce. As to &ldquo;Wild Apples&rdquo;, it appears to have been published here in 1929 by Cape who at that time had a New York house. It has long been closed and I am sure that it will be much easier for you to obtain the book from Cape in London than to find it here &hellip; I am glad to know that Part I in corrected proof will soon come to us. As to the remainder, we have no course but to wait, and I shall hope to get favourable news when I am in Paris in the early Summer if not before. </div>
