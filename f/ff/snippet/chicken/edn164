<div class="nbunit" id="edn164">  164  One of the women is better educated than the other and calls <ALP a proxenete (prostitute). Her companion is too dim-witted to understand: <i>proxenete</i>? And &lsquo;phwhat is phthat?&rsquo; Can't she tell her in plain words? But the speaker, who has already called the other a born idiot and nothing short of one, can't see how she can be plainer than she is. Did the other one never learn anything at school? &lsquo;It's just the same as if I was to go par examplum now in conservancy's cause out of telekinesis and proxenete you.&rsquo; The other one catches on now and whistles, <i>Is that what she is!</i> It's little she thought she'd sink that low.  </div>
