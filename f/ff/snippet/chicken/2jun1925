<div class="nbunit" id="2Jun1925"><font color="red">2 June 1925</font> <i>BLHW</i> (to Harriet Weaver): I want to direct my bleareyed attention to the piece for Mr Walsh and another for <i>The Calendar</i>. I thought of repaying &hellip; my study and the slowness of my wit and sight in writing and revising have dissuaded me &hellip; I notice that things by Mr Eliot appear simultaneously in <i>Dial</i> and <i>Criterion</i> and others do the same &hellip; I could not stipulate this as I am &lsquo;wanted&rsquo; exclusively and moreover I cannot make conditions when I write as I do </div>
