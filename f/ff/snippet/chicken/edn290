<div class="nbunit" id="edn290">  290  The twenty-nine girls paddle in concert with Sigurdsson's snores. Shaun is in the barrel, &lsquo;propped up, restant, against a butterblond warden of the peace, one comestabulish Sigurdsen,&rsquo; buried upright in the silt having &lsquo;tumbled slumbersomely on sleep at night duty behind the curing station, equilebriated amid the embracings of a monopolised bottle.&rsquo; That is, Sigurdsson appears here as a log that snores (repelling the girls) &lsquo;stuck to the sod as ever and oft.&rsquo; He &lsquo;murmoaned abasourdly in his Dutchener's native over his treasure trove for the crown&rsquo; (he has fallen asleep while embracing a bottle, a bottle he stows in III.4 in a tree-bole): <i>dette er det bedste, min smukke flaske</i> &mdash; this is the best, my beautiful bottle. Sigurdsson is dormant throughout Shaun's lecture but reappears at the end of the chapter, woken up by Shaun's barrel-motions, to exclaim in Danish: <i>Hvor meget har vi knibet tilbage?</i> How much have we withheld? To alter course &mdash; and so, farewell!  </div>
