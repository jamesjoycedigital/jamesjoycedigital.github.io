<div class="nbunit" id="2Feb1938"><font color="red">2 February 1938</font> <i>NLHW</i> (from Paul L&eacute;on to Harriet Weaver): As I will probably leave Paris for a few days &hellip; to visit my brother in law who has been operated in Lausanne a few days ago &hellip; write to you at greater length than &hellip; lately or &hellip; over the &apos;phone &hellip; Mr Joyce&apos;s visit to doctor Collinson yesterday was due to the fact that he had been unable for an hour or so to read anything at all. The doctor found a retinal congestion and advised breaking off immediately all work and go and see Vogt in Z&uuml;rich &hellip; I hope I will be able to persuade him to accompany me to Lausanne from where I will put him on a train to Z&uuml;rich which is only two hours away &hellip; The state of exhaustion which has overwhelmed him is terrible &hellip; need &hellip; a couple of days complete rest. Part of it is due to the state of exasperation he was in all during last week on account both of his publishers in England and in the U.S.A. They cannot and wish not to accept the date of the 4th of July for the publication of the book. We had sent them the typescript of the greater part of Part II before the New Year and we have just got the proof galleys back. Thus it took them five weeks to do half of what they had received and what was in an absolutely clear typescript without many corrections. They have not done yet a part of some 6000 words also in absolute complete form without corrections and additions and the completion of which must have cost Mr Joyce surely more than he has received as advance payment &hellip; They also demand the communication of the title &hellip; for the approval of Messrs Boots the Chemist. Mr Joyce is decided to give them the title just before the book is sent to the binder. I sent the other day under Mr Joyce&apos;s dictation an extremely curt and frank letter to Mr Eliot. Of course Mr Eliot diplomatically retired from the scene and handed the pen to &hellip; Mr Geoffrey Faber who sent a reply couched in very Baldwinian complicatedness. Mr Joyce attaches so little importance to this letter that he has not even answered it yet but in point of fact it may involve an entire change of plans which he had communicated to me in the beginning of the year. For the moment he has spent yesterday and today in his bed where I found him this morning but his does not prejudice his state tonight as from my observations the Irish temperament has some infinite resources which escape my comprehension. I gave Mr Joyce the O&apos;Reilly clan paper which he was glad to have &hellip; object was to avoid any application to the Irish Times Office in Dublin &hellip; he is reluctant to ask Mr Curran in Dublin to do this kind of thing for him in connection with his book as he is to ask yourself &hellip; Nevertheless both your cable and Mr Curran&apos;s were on the table beside his bed together with the usual six or seven others, prominent among them being that from a friend an obscure Greek bankclerk without which the feast would not be complete. I have seen these now year after year and in view of the way in which his reputation as a great poet increases in the world it is surprising to find what a minute circle of friends surrounds him &hellip; two absentees &hellip; his daughter &hellip; his son who had to leave suddenly for America a fortnight ago accompanying his wife. Mr Joyce was also sorry as the little volume brought out by Viscount Carlow was not ready for the appointed date &hellip; The English binders. </div>
