I answered him. He arrived here this morning &hellip; His address is Villa Elisol, Pr&egrave;chy, Lausanne. He promised me to see the Irish minister at Vichy, Mr S. Murphy (who, you will recall, intervened successfully with the occupying authorities in Paris for the departure of my daughter) and also to speak to the Swiss minister to Vichy, Mr Struck [Walter Stucki] </div>
