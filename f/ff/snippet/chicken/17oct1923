It is finished but I am filing  the edges off it. The wild hunt continues in the Paris jungle &hellip; I compose ridiculous prose writing on a green suitcase which I bought in Bognor. I want to get as many sketches done or get as many boring parties at work as possible before removal somewhere &hellip; let me know any impression you may have of the passages sent. </div>
