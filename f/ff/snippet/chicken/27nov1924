Interior monologue would not do nor the growl of the cyclops nor the sirens so I read the late J.F. Taylor&apos;s speech from <i>Eolus</i>. That&apos;s done &hellip; operation tomorrow &hellip; I have been working very hard and am tempted to put off the operation because I feel so tired and because I am so deep in the ether of Shaun. <i>Johannes Epistolifera, ora pro me!</i> &hellip; What would you like me to give Mr McAlmon for his book? He wrote to me about it. It is a very good idea, I think. </div>
