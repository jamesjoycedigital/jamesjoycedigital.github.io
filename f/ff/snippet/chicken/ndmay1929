<div class="nbunit" id="ndMay1929"><font color="red">N.D. May 1929</font> <i>UP</i> (to Caresse Crosbie) The printer did not yet give me proof of the triangle piece so I could do nothing this weekend. I hope the enclosed O amd G is quite legible. If you can revise it I do not want to see it again. </div>
