<div class="nbunit" id="a29Jan1939"><font color="red">29 January 1939</font> <i>NLFF</i> (from Paul L&eacute;on to Richard de la Mere): &hellip; there are two final corrections to be introduced in the book. One is quite simple &hellip; On page 614 line 21 from top after the end of the paragraph finishing with the word &ldquo;word&rdquo; please insert the following new sentence in the same paragraph: Today&apos;s truth, tomorrow&apos;s trend. But to balance this a corresponding sentence has to be introduced previously. And the best place for it is the heavily corrected page 526. As it now stands the corrections should be introduced on line 15 from foot. After the sentence &ldquo;And the maid of folley will go where glory&rdquo; and before the sentence beginning with the words &ldquo;Sure, I thought&rdquo;, a new sentence should be added as follows: Trothed today, trenned tomorrow. </div>
