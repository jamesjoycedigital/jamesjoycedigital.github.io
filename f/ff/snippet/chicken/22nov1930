<div class="nbunit" id="22Nov1930"><font color="red">22 November 1930</font> <i>Selected Letters and BLHW</i> (to Harriet Weaver, typed): (<a name="kbd0" href="../../FF/fdra/kda.htm#kbd0">II.1&sect;2.0</a>; 47477:6-21) I enclose the final sheet of the first draft of about two thirds of the first section of Part II (2.200 words) which came out like drops of blood &hellip; I had to put off my journey to Z&uuml;rich five different times but am leaving to-morrow with the Gormans and my wife &hellip; I think the piece I sent you is the gayest and lightest thing I have done in spite of the circumstances &hellip; The scheme of the piece I sent you is the game we used to call Angels and Devils or colours. The Angels, girls, are grouped behind the Angel, Shawn, and the Devil has to come over three times and ask for a colour, if the colour he asks for has been chosen by any girl she has to run and he tries to catch her. As far as I have written he has come twice and been twice baffled. The pice [sic] is full of rythms [sic] taken from English singing games. When first baffled vindictively he thinks of publishing blackmail stuff about his father, mother etc etc etc. The second time he maunders off into sentimental poetry of what I actually wrote at the age of none: &ldquo;My cot alas that dear old shady home where oft in youthful sport I played, upon thy verdant grassy fields all day or lingered for a moment in thy bosom shade etc etc etc etc.&rdquo; [47477:15] This is interrupted by a violent pang of tooth acke after which he throws a fit. When he is baffled a second time the girl angels sing a hymn of liberation round Shawn. The page enclosed [47477:21] is still another version of a beautiful sentence from Edgar Quinet which I already refashioned in Transition part one beginning since the days of Hiber and Hairyman etc. E.Q. says that the wild flowers on the ruins of Carthage Numancia etc. have survived the political rises and downfall of Empires. In this case the wild flowers are the lilts of children. Note especially the treatment of the double rainbow in which the iritic colours are first normal and then reversed. </div>
