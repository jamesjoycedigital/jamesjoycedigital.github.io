<div class="nbunit" id="edn358">  358  This is the Irish expression for Christ's staff. Shaun will become a bode (postman). This staff reappears many times and in many forms in the text, for example at 123.34 (155.23) as the &lsquo;jewelled pederect&rsquo; the Mookse uplifts &lsquo;to the allmysty cielung.&rsquo; By the time we reach 368.03 (474.01) it has become a mere walking stick, a &lsquo;staff of citron briar, tradition stick-pass-on,&rsquo; lying by Yawn's side.  </div>
