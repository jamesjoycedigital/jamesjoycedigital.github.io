<div class="nbunit" id="9Apr1925"><font color="red">?9 April 1925</font> <i>STA</i> (to Lily Bollach &mdash; large hand): Many thanks indeed. Can you meet me tomorrow (Friday) at 6 pm? I do not know what other time or place to suggest. One of my operations is over, thank goodness. I am afraid you had a terrible job with this MS but hope you will pardon it in the circumstances. I hope you may be able to come tomorrow evening as I should like to arrange about the reat of the MS. </div>
