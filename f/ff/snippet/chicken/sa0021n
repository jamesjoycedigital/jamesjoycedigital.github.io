The first point to remark is the peculiarly happy framework of the Recueil <font color="green">[anthology]</font>, which I cannot but suspect set an example to the <mark>Decamerone</mark> and its host of successors. [Footnote: Boccaccio (ob. Dec. 2, 1375), may easily have heard of <cite>The Thousand Nights and a Night</cite> or of its archetype the Haz&aacute;r Afs&aacute;nah. He was followed by the Piacevoli Notti of Giovan Francisco Straparola (<year>A.D.</year> 1550)) translated into almost all European languages but English: the original Italian is now rare. Then came the Heptameron ou Histoire des amans fortunez of Marguerite d&apos;Angoul&ecirc;me, Reyne de Navarre and only sister of Francis I. She died in 1549 before the days were finished: in 1558 Pierre Boaistuan published the Histoire des amans fortunez and in 1559 Claude Guiget the &ldquo;Heptameron.&rdquo; Next is the Hexameron of A. de Torquemada, Rouen, 1610; and, lastly, the Pentamerone or El Cunto de li Cunte of Giambattista Basile (Naples 1637), known by the meagre abstract of J. E. Taylor and the caricatures of George Cruikshank (London 1847-50). I propose to translate this Pentamerone direct from the Neapolitan and have already finished half the work. <small> Richard Burton, &ldquo;Terminal Essay&rdquo; in <a name="RB01" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#RB01"><cite title="source">1000 Nights and 1 Night</cite></a> (Denver, 1919) x.160 [B. THE MANNER OF THE NIGHTS.]</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: The <cite>Decameron</cite> [or <cite>Decamerone</cite>], subtitled <i>Prince Galehaut</i> and written in the vernacular of the Florentine language, is a masterful collection of novellas by Giovanni Boccaccio (1313-1375). The book is structured as a frame story containing 100 tales told by a group of seven young women and three young men sheltering from the Black Death in a secluded villa close to the disease-afflicted city of Florence. The various tales of love in the book range from the erotic to the tragic. In addition to its literary value and widespread influence (for example on Chaucer&apos;s <cite>The Canterbury Tales</cite>), it provides a document of life at the time. </mm> </dd></dl>
