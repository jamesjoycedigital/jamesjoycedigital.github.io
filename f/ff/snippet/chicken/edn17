<div class="nbunit" id="edn17">  17  Throughout the <cite>Wake</cite> we come upon clusters of words having a common factor, such as the names of rivers of insects or words in some particular language, or from a particular source. These extend the narrative vertically in a kind of reference axis, as a kind of supra-narrative. Where they appear they are always apposite. In the case of the Waterloo episode the text carries a strong secondary axis of reference to place names where historically noted battles took place (Salo, Loos, Magenta, and so on). The reader need not necessarily be aware of these individually in order to follow the story line. For example, HCE wears &lsquo;goldtin spurs,&rsquo; clearly golden/tin spurs, yet &lsquo;<i>Golden Spurs</i>&rsquo; is a historical battle reference. Joyce may have at one stage intended to include in the final text a more polished version of the map used in the early draft, after seeing examples of such maps in one of his major source books, Sir Edward Creasy's <cite>Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World: from Marathon to Waterloo</cite>.  </div>
