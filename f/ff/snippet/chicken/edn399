<div class="nbunit" id="edn399">  399  Patrick employs the rainbow and not the shamrock to get his point across to the Gaels. His practicality remains the same. The sage professes a form of mysticism candidly incomprehensible to the common folk whereas he, the saint, provides them with an immediate and sensible concept.
