<div class="nbunit" id="10Jun1932"><font color="red">10 June 1932</font> <i>NLGC</i> (Paul L&eacute;on to Alf Bergan): Mr Joyce whose eyesight during the last few days has grown steadily worse &hellip; he would like to know if you could give him any more details about the matter you mention in the letter you addressed to him. I mean did his father desire only his and his wife&apos;s name to be engraved on the tombstone or those of the other members of his family which are buried in the same grave? What character is the tombstone to have religious or otherwise? </div>
