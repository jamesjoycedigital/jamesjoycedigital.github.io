Le Vice of course prevails more in the cities and towns of Asiatic Turkey than in the villages; yet even these are infected; while the nomad <mark>Turcomans</mark> contrast badly in this point with the Gypsies, those Badawin of India. The Kurd population is of Iranian origin, which means that the evil is deeply rooted: I have noted in The Nights that the great and glorious Saladin was a habitual pederast. <small> Richard Burton, &ldquo;Terminal Essay&rdquo; in <a name="RB01" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#RB01"><cite title="source">1000 Nights and 1 Night</cite></a> (Denver, 1919) x.232-3</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
