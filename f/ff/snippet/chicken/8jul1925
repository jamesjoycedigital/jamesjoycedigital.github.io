<div class="nbunit" id="8Jul1925"><font color="red">8 July 1925</font> <i>Letters III</i> (to Harriet Weaver): I could not write till now (not even now) as I have been getting into ever deeper Liffey water. I want to leave the piece with Miss Beach for the September <i>Calendar</i>. I have taken immense pains with these three pieces. I hope they justify it. The richer they are the less hard will be the other parts of the book if &hellip; and when &hellip; I still have several days more to work on Anna Livia and then I need to go away for a rest &hellip; I wish I had finished this piece and was sitting in a railway carriage &hellip; Do you want me to send on the typescript. I should prefer not for a reason which I shall explain later. </div>
