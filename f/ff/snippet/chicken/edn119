<div class="nbunit" id="edn119">  119  The identity of the current narrator is open to question. It is clearly a bibliographer commenting on a document (Sullivan on the <cite>Book of Kells</cite>) but in <cite>Wake</cite> terms his or her identity is uncertain. Bernard Benstock, writing in <cite>A Conceptual Guide to Finnegans Wake</cite> says, &lsquo;If it is a pedagogical Shem that began the explanations, it is then a hard-headed Shaun that demanded direct information without frills. The Shem who answers remains patronising, but he does modulate his vocabulary to a degree and gets down to a more fundamental level of inquiry, identifying the father figure of the remote past, the surname-less Earwicker of the closing pages of the first and opening pages of the second chapter of the <cite>Wake</cite>.&rsquo; Benstock interprets the chapter as the work of two alternating narrators. This view is supported perhaps by 90.15ff (113.23ff): &lsquo;Let us now drop this jiggerypokery and talk straight turkey as meet to mate,&rsquo; though this may simply be the narrator addressing the reader. It is not really clear that either of the two brothers &mdash; let alone both &mdash; is delivering this lecture. At 88.09ff the narrator refers to Kevin (Shaun) as the sole observer of the hen unearthing the buried letter and proceeds to discuss the fowl's behaviour. This <i>may</i> indicate that the current narrator is one and the same Kevin, now of course many years older. Also, at the close of the episode Shem is described in hostile terms in typical Shaun-fashion. The most likely scenario is that the speaker throughout is Shaun and the silent listener is Shem. This hypothesis is corroborated in I.7, in which what we can presume is the same speaker reappears and is there unambiguously Shaun. Finally, we can note that Shaun, being the postman carrrying the letter, is in the best position to examine it.  </div>
