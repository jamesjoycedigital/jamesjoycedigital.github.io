<div class="nbunit" id="16Mar1924"><font color="red">N.D. 16 March 1924</font> <i>Letters III</i> (to Ford Madox Ford): The proof (sent me without the former one to check it by!) is quite impossible. I glanced over it. Not only has it not been read but many of the most glaring blunders are still in it. I gave the typescript to you, as you remember, under pressure and on the distinct understanding that I could write in notes to which I had not then access. I think it is due to me to hold the piece over for your next issue as the printer seems to be still learning his trade </div>
