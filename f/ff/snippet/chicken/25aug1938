He was bringing the dialogue between Patrick (Padraic in Irish) and the Druid to a close &hellip; &ldquo;Among the pages I was to recopy, one had been written that same morning; a page composed 15 years before was supposed to follow it. He was still working at II, though III was already at the printers.&rdquo; </div>
