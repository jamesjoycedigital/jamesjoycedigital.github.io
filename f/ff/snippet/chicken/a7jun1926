I shall be writing to hear how you like it &mdash; if you like it. While reading it could you make a complete list of words misspelt. Some, of course, are intentional, most, but there must be others overlooked by my dim sight. Will you let me know if the &lsquo;plot&rsquo; begins to emerge from it at all?  </div>
