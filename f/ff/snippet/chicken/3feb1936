<div class="nbunit" id="3Feb1936"><font color="red">3 February 1936</font> <i>NLFF</i> (from T.S. Eliot): Mrs Jolas brought in the manuscript of Part III last week. I gave her a receipt for it &hellip; I showed the manuscript to our Director of Production, Richard de la Mare, and he felt confident that MacLehose, who are quite at the top of their profession as printers, would be able to handle it as it is. Should there be any difficulty they have expert typists of their own to set it right. But I think the simplest thing will be to have them set up a difficult specimen page. The manuscript, however, seems perfectly orderly, although complicated, and I think it will require great care, but not genius, in composition. </div>
