<div class="nbunit" id="6Sep1932"><font color="red">6 September 1932</font> <i>Letters I</i> (to Harriet Weaver): We leave for Z&apos;ch tomorrow &hellip; I have been working all day since I came here. It is a risk to present myself to the writing public (for those are my readers) after some years and in such a whirl. But I will do it. By the next post you will get the first proof (unfinished) which please read and return to Mrs Jolas. As regards blame every young writer in the world blames me for having written <i>U</i>. So  Jolas says, anyhow </div>
