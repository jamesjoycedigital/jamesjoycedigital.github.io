And I am writing in duplicate both to Paris and Rouen so you know as quickly as possible that the proofs are not ready yet. We are printing the next number of THIS QUARTER in Milan and that means a delay. &hellip; I will forward the proofs to you the moment they are ready &hellip; As for the proofs when they are ready we must get around the difficulty in case your sight is not good at the moment. If your manuscript is correct we might manage the proofreading ourselves. </div>
