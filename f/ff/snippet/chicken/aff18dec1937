<div class="nbunit" id="aff18Dec1937"><font color="red">18 December 1937</font> <i>NLFF</i> (from Paul L&eacute;on to T.S. Eliot): My covering letter got lost &hellip; Here are the facts: Part II of W.I.P. is to consist of 4 sections; Section I went with my first letter. It is the revise text of the Mime of Mick etc &hellip; which was printed several years ago in Holland and distributed in England by <i>yourselves</i>; it has nothing to do with Viscount Carlow. Section II went with my letter of December the 11th. It consists of two portions (beginning and end) printed by Viscount Carlow with your permission and an remaniated text of the Muddest etc &hellip; plus several entirely new pages. </div>
