A rather funny idea struck me that you might &lsquo;order&rsquo; a piece and I would do it. The gentlemen of the brush and hammer seem to have worked that way. Dear Sir. I should like to have an oil painting of Mr Tristan carving raw pork for Cornish countrymen or anicebust of Herr Ham contemplating his cold shoulder &hellip; I hope you are well after your absence from London and looking forward to the favour of your esteemed orders which will meet with our promptest execution </div>
