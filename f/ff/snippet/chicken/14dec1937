<div class="nbunit" id="14Dec1937"><font color="red">14 December 1937</font> <i>NLFF</i> (from T.S. Eliot to Paul L&eacute;on): I thank you for your letter of 11 December with enclosures. Another section of Part 2, printed evidently by Viscount Carlow, arrived several days ago, but without any covering letter &hellip; This portion is the one which formed the subject of conversations between Viscount Carlow and myself some time ago, in consequence of which we gave him a license to publish this section. I take it that I am to understand that the section above-mentioned is the beginning of Part 2, and that the parts enclosed with your letter of 11 December constitute the next section of Part 2. I should be interested to know how much more matter there will be before the book is complete. You speak of a Section 3 to come. Am I to understand that Section 3 will complete Part 2, or will there be further sections? Furthermore I take it that the printed pages which you enclose with your letter of 11 December will make another book &hellip; to be published by the Corvinus Press </div>
