<div class="nbunit" id="22Jul1939"><font color="red">22 July 1939</font> <i>NLFF</i> (from Paul L&eacute;on to Richard de la Mere): Mr Joyce has been looking at FINNEGANS WAKE several times lately and every time he finds some misprints. In view of the possible necesity of a second edition of the book I think it will be well to start making the corrections right away. May I submit to you the following suggestion. You will remember that the sewn sheets sent to Monsieur Gillet were not the very best thing possible. Could not the correction be made on them and his copy substituted by a regular presscopy &hellip; Mr Joyce would then make the necessary corrections on them and return them to you. He says to me that he is sure the misprints must have crept in after his reading of the first proofs as he did not pass a single letter. </div>
