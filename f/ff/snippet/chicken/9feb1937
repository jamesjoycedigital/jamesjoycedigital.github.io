I posted to him yesterday Ralph Fox&apos;s <i>The Novel and the People</i>. I can hear of no book by <i>A</i>. Henderson with a title something like &ldquo;Communism and the Novel&rdquo; but there is a book by <i>Philip</i> Henderson <i>The Novel Today</i> which apparently has a communistic tinge about it. </div>
