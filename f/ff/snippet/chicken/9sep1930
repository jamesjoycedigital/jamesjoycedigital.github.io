Eliot at Faber and Faber&apos;s &hellip; about his plan of publishing H.C.E. in the same miscellany. This should appear before the end of February 1931 as the fourth and final fragment is to be published in an <i>edition de luxe</i> as usual first in Paris here in April next, These fragments from what reviewers call <i>Work in Progress</i> really have no title but for convenience&apos; sake a few words taken from the text have been put on the title page &hellip; I wrote all this letter with my own hand </div>
