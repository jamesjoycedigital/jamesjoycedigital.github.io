<div class="nbunit" id="11dec1909"><font color="red">11 December 1909</font> <i>Selected Letters</i> (to Nora Joyce): The four Italians have left Finn&apos;s Hotel and live now over the show [the Volta cinema in Mary steet]. I paid about &pound;20 to your late mistress, returning good for evil. Before I left I told the waitress who I was and asked her to let me see the room you slept in. She brought me upstairs and took me to it. You can imagine my excited appearance and manner. I saw my love&apos;s room, her bed, the four little walls within which she dreamed of my eyes and voice, the little curtains she pulled aside in the morning to look out at the grey sky of Dublin, the poor modest silly things on the walls over which her glance travelled while she undressed her fair young body at night. </div>
