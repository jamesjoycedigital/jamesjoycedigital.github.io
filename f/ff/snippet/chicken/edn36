<div class="nbunit" id="edn36">  36  The <cite>Wake</cite> Annals are parodies of those printed in Thom's <cite>Dublin Directory</cite>. The first event listed would seem to derive from Thom's notes for 1331: &lsquo;A great famine relieved by a prodigious shoal of fish, called <i>Turlehydes</i>, being cast on shore at the mouth of the Dodder. They were from 30 to 40 feet long and so thick that men standing on each side of one of them could not see those on the other.&rsquo; Stephen Dedalus recalls this same history in <cite>Ulysses</cite>.  </div>
