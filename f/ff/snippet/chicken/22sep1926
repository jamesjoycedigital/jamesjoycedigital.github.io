<div class="nbunit" id="22Sep1926"><font color="red">22 September 1926</font> <i>Beach Letters</i> (to Sylvia Beach): Wyndham Lewis writes that he will call on you. I suppose he wants his piece. I have been working at it for the past few weeks again. Here it is. Can you have it typed for me in very legible type, double spaced, original and three copies? (My typist is on vacation in Italy) and sent to me to check. Lewis can have it then &hellip; I spent a great deal of time on the piece for Lewis. </div>
