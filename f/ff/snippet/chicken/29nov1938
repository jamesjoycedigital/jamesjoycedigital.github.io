<div class="nbunit" id="29Nov1938"><font color="red">29 November 1938</font> <i>NLFF</i> (from Richard de la Mere to Paul L&eacute;on):  Thank you also for telling me about Mr Joyce&apos;s final corrections to part II. Yes, do please let me have them and I will send them on to the printers straightaway, so that they may include all these corrections, if possible, before they send out any further proofs. I will ask them to return the duplicate copy that they have already, when I send them the new copy &hellip; With regard to the corrections that Mr Joyce wants to make on page 1 of the book: perhaps you would be kind enough to note this on those final revised proofs that I sent you yesterday before you return them to me for press. I very much hope that Mr Joyce won&apos;t want to make any other corrections of this nature in the final proofs &hellip; since the book is now completely made up into its final pages up to page 350 approximately. </div>
