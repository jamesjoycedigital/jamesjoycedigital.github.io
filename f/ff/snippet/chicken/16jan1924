<div class="nbunit" id="16Jan1924"><font color="red">16 January 1924</font> <i>Letters I</i> (to Harriet Weaver): Did you get the MS and typescript sent you a week or so ago? I am sending you more enclosed, also the pages to replace the faulty ones. The passage &lsquo;Let us now &hellip; Shem the penman&rsquo; follows the words &lsquo;the hen saw&rsquo;. Between the words &lsquo;penman&rsquo; and &lsquo;Revered&rsquo; are three further passages, a description of Shem-Ham-Cain-Egan etc and his penmanship, Anna Livia&apos;s visits and collaboration and delivery of the memorial by Shawn the post. I finished the calligraphy <i>expertise</i> a day or two ago but have felt so tired since that I have scarcely energy enough to hold a pen. </div>
