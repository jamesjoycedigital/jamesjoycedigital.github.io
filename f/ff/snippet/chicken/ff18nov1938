<div class="nbunit" id="ff18Nov1938"><font color="red">18 November 1938</font> <i>NLFF</i> (from Richard de la Mere to Paul L&eacute;on): Thank you for your two letters of November 12 and November 15, with which you sent me the typescript of the end of Part II (the end of episode 3 and the whole of episode 4), and pages 1-216 of the proofs with all Mr Joyce&apos;s press corrections. I see from your last letter that Mr Joyce would like to see the final revised proofs of those pages on which verbal corrections have been made, but that he does not think it necessary to see any further revised proofs of those pages where merely literal corrections have been made or changes in punctuation. I am glad of that, because there is no time to be spared if spring publication is to be achieved. I see from your letter that we are to expect the typescript of Part IV early next week and that that completes everything. In the meantime our printers are setting up those final episodes of Part II and I am hoping to be able to send you galleys before long &hellip; date of publication &hellip; anxious &hellip; soon as possible &hellip; impossible for me even to begin to estimate &hellip; consult further with Mr Huebsch &hellip; advisable that we know the title of the book fairly soon. </div>
