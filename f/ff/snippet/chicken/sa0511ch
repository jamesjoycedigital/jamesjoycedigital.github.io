Ancient scholars proposed alternative etymologies. The first connected the word with the staff (<i>rhabdos</i>) on which the singer leaned during his performance. On this view, the rhapsode is a &ldquo;singer with a staff.&rdquo; The second connected the word with the poetic act of sewing (<i>rhaptein</i>) the poem (<i>oide</i>). Thus, the rhapsode is a &ldquo;stitcher of songs.&rdquo; Modern scholars prefer the second etymology, which is attested in a fragment of Hesiod (7th century BC) and in Pindar&apos;s Nemean Ode 2, lines 1-3. Both passages use the word <i>rhaptein</i> to describe the act of poetic composition. The noun <i>rhapsoidosis</i> is first found in 5th-century-BC inscriptions and literary sources, including Herodotus (<cite>History</cite>, Book V, part 67) and Sophocles (<cite>Oedipus Tyrannus</cite>, line 391). </mm> </dd></dl>
