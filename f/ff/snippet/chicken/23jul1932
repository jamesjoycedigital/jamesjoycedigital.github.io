<div class="nbunit" id="23Jul1932"><font color="red">23 July 1932</font> <i>BLHW</i> (to Harriet Weaver): Also from F and F who ask me to postpone for 6 months. To attempt to write in present (or future?) circumstances would mean writing for money. The only writing for money I can do is letters to you or MS and Co </div>
