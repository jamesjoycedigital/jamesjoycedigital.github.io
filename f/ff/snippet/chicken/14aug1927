<div class="nbunit" id="14Aug1927"><font color="red">14 August 1927</font> <i>Beach Letters</i> (to Sylvia Beach): I sent you the first draft of the questionnaire with a letter a week ago but I fear I sent it to Savoie not H.S. Yesterday I sent you draft 3, now finished. It has been terrible work in the circumstances. In question 11 I have allowed Shaun to speak with the voice of The Enemy. The opposition to my book is now so acute and general (even Miss Weaver in a letter yesterday speaks of &lsquo;wallowing in its verbiage&rsquo;) that it would seem to me almost a good policy to take 6 months holiday and rest. </div>
