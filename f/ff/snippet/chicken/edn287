<div class="nbunit" id="edn287">  287  This numerological balance was discussed by Ian MacArthur, &lsquo;Structure and Motif in Jaun,&rsquo; (<cite>AWN</cite> 15 (1978), 67-73), where he also argues that the structure of the chapter follows a sexual tumescence-detumescence pattern. The &lsquo;rise&rsquo; extends from the beginning to 345.05 (444.25), the &lsquo;penetration&rsquo; from 345.06 &mdash; 352.20 (444.26 to 454.07), the &lsquo;climax&rsquo; from 352.21 &mdash; 354.30 (454.08 to 457.04), the &lsquo;ejaculation&rsquo; from 354.31 &mdash; 364.34 (457.05 to 470.10), and the &lsquo;withdrawal&rsquo; from 364.35 &mdash; close (470.11 to the end). MacArthur suggests that the phallic and religious themes (Shaun as cross-bearing Christ) run parallel throughout the piece and that these can be reconciled if we apply the notion of Augustus, &lsquo;Like a bridegroom Christ went forth from his chamber and came to the marriage bed of the cross and there, in mounting it, He consummated his marriage.&rsquo;  </div>
