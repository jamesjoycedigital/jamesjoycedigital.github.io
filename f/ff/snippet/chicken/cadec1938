<div class="nbunit" id="caDec1938"><font color="red">ca. December 1938</font> <i>NLPL</i> (to Paul L&eacute;on): [draft of letter to be sent to Harriet Weaver] Say that the flat is given up &hellip; The book was finished in its structure on the 13th November but there are about 1000 pp of proofs to be carefully read &hellip; As regards the book itself it is now for all practical purposes finished. Thousands, hundreds of thousands of its words have passed through my typewriter and I can easily understand how any person who is concerned with the very grave social, political and economic problems of this oppressive period will be painfully affected by its colossal triviality, its colossal accumulations of words meaningless, I suppose, for the ordinary intelligent reader of today. For I cannot see anywhere the slightest attempt in it to focus or still less to solve these pressing problems.  <br> But it is impossible to deny that he has acted according to his conscience and that he has actually consumed almost all his substance, physical and spiritual, moral and material, in the writing of a work &hellip; likely to be received with derision by his illwishers and with pained displeasure by his true friends.  <br><center>Ha! Ha!</center></p>  <p class="spbr"> P.S. I have seen Mrs Joyce. She suspected, it seems, that something was wrong but I did not tell h[er] or his son the facts as they were. She told me that he was in a state of exhaustion over the closing pages of the book which he had written in a state of the greatest tension. It deals with the mixing of the fresh water of the Liffey and the salt water of the Irish Sea at the Dublin estuary!!!  <br><center>Ha! Ha! Ha!</center></p>  <p class="spbr"> During the recent crisis in this country &mdash; a crisis which I suppose you followed with the closest attention &mdash; he seemed to be much more excited by the gramophone record of a Greek song he used to sing which he had unexpectedly discovered than by the seething conflicts which were raging around him, so fascinating to students of constitutional development but so trying, as we all know, in actual fact. </div>
