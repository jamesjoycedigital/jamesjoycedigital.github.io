<div class="nbunit" id="pl17Oct1932"><font color="red">17 October 1932</font> <i>NLPL</i> (from Paul L&eacute;on to JJ): I am trying to append what is supposed to be the gist of the <i>Anzeige</i> of Goethe&apos;s Farbenlehre. I am under the impression that grosso modo it will do except a few addition as for instance the one about the Regenbogen. Anyhow your edition is not complete it contains merely the DIDAKTISCHEN TEIL. The POLEMISHER Teil and the Historischer Teil both lack. </div>
