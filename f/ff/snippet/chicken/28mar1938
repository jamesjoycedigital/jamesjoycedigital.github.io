Transition, of course, is not yet out. I send you a copy of <i>Verve</i> [Paris I.2 March-June 1938, p.26]. There are several mistakes in my text &mdash; misprints. But I am so tired I can&apos;t correct them. It&apos;s a pity you didn&apos;t quote the sentences about Sihl amd Limmat in your article on me? They are in <i>Anna Livia Plurabelle</i> &hellip; my son intends to return now as planned on the  20 April </div>
