<div class="nbunit" id="9Oct1923"><font color="red">9 October 1923</font> <i>Letters I</i> (to Harriet Weaver): I sent those four fellows out of the house yesterday and when they come back from the vast I shall send them on. Today I send you the rough sheets with a plan of the verse and a forgotten page of H.C.E. But please don&apos;t read them yet &mdash; in fact, they are illegible. On Saturday (13 October 1923) I shall send the typed copy and the fair copy. I am glad to get rid of them as they gave me a lot of trouble &hellip; Mr Hueffer has been made editor of a new Paris review [<i>The Transatlantic Review</i>] Mr Pound (to whom I had shown the pieces I have written) came round to say that the front pages of the first issue were to be reserved for me with a trumpet blast &hellip; I felt (as I tried to explain to him) that I could not allow them to be printed yet. The construction is quite different from <i>Ulysses</i> where at least the ports of call were known beforehand. I am sorry that Patrick and Luchru-Berkeley are unsuccessful in explaining themselves. The answer, I suppose, is that given by Paddy Dignam&apos;s apparition: metempsychosis. Or perhaps the theory of history so well set forth (after Hegel and Giambattista Vico) by the four eminent annalists who are even now treading the typepress in sorrow will explain part of my meaning. I work as much as I can because these are not fragments but active elements and when they are more and a little older they will begin to fuse of themselves &hellip; I shall do nothing for a couple of days </div>
