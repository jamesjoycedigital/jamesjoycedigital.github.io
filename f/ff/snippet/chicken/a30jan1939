<div class="nbunit" id="a30Jan1939"><font color="red">30 January 1939</font> <i>NLFF</i> (from Richard de la Mere to Paul L&eacute;on): I am sorry to say that your letter of January 29th with a further correction for page 526 as well as for page 614 came too late. It is still possible to make the correction on page 614 before those final sheets are printed off, but the printing of page 526 had already been completed when your letter came. What is to be done? I am not giving the printers any instructions about the correction on p.614 until I hear from you again, as I gather &hellip; that the correction on that page depends upon the earlier one on p.526. The pages of the book that still remain to be printed are as follows: pp.481-512 and 577-628 &mdash; and the preliminary pages of course. So if you have any final corrections for those pages, they will still be on time &mdash; but please don&apos;t take this as an invitation! And may I please have them at once. The advance copy of the book will definitely be sent off to you today by air mail. </div>
