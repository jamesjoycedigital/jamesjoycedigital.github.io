<div class="nbunit" id="17Aug1938"><font color="red">17 August 1938</font> <i>NLHW</i> (from Paul L&eacute;on to Harriet Weaver): On the eve of my departure for a short vacation I feel I ought to write to you in some detail &hellip; it is now some eighteen months since he has been working on Work in Progress night and day &hellip; I believe that the work will be finished by October, necessitating later only a revise of pages. Part I is practically already completely set in pageform. Part II is in galleys as far as Mr has finished it i.e. there remain some thirty or forty pages to terminate it of which more than half is already in typescript. Part III is complete in galleys and of the short epilogue-prologue &hellip; Part IV well over &hellip; half is also ready and typewritten &hellip; I fear a collapse when the work will be finished &hellip; [will be attacked from the left and the right] &hellip; His daughter &hellip; his daughter in law &hellip; It is with these two dramatic figures in front of his mental eyes that he goes on bringing to a conclusion his huge nocturnal comedy &hellip; I did forget enclosing parts of the manuscript in my last letter to you but the very next day I had to consult for corrections some of the pages hence I did not send them on. I am enclosing therefore this lot but I have a new one for you ready which I prefer to keep for the moment. In your letter you mention four lots copied in Bognor. I spoke with Mr Joyce about them he does not seem to remember four. As it is he has the O&apos;Connor, the Kevin and the St Patrick&apos;s parts, if you have a fourth please send it. </div>
