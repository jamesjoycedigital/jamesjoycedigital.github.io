<div class="nbunit" id="hw14Feb1939"><font color="red">14 February 1939</font> <i>NLHW</i> (from Paul L&eacute;on to Harriet Weaver): I have stopped from sending you the revise in page form as after page 355 we ceased receiving the second revise (as there was not time to be wasted if the book was to come out on the 2nd of February) and the first one was being sent only in two copies direct from the printers of which one went back corrected to Messrs Faber and Faber and the second is still with Mr Joyce. No doubt at some later date he will give it to me for you but as it is it must have hardly any corrections by him and whatever writing there is on it must be in either Mr Gilbert&apos;s his son&apos;s or Mr Jolas&apos;s or finally my hands &hellip; One completely ready and bound volume did reach him for his birthday. </div>
