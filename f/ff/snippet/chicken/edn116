<div class="nbunit" id="edn116">  116  Through HCE's mangled frame one can discern the escutcheon of the East Breifne branch of the O'Reilly family: quarterly, 1 and 4, <i>vert</i>, a dexter hand apaumee couped at the wrist proper, dropping blood, supported by two lions combatant <i>or</i>. The remaining quarters 2 and 3, <i>argent</i>, on a mount an oak tree with a snake descending its trunk proper, can be found at 79.31 (100.11). This is a most irregular image of the encounter. Things are getting progressively more serious. In I.2, no-one is struck; in I.3, manslaughter is suggested; here we have a full-blown murder.  </div>
