<div class="nbunit" id="edn306">  306  The text offers us a second leave-taking, in which we see <font face="wake">D</font> take off in his barrel-boat, a bucket, follow the tide and pass under a bridge &lsquo;a stadion beyond Ladycastle&rsquo; (probably Island Bridge) where, narrowly avoiding fouling its buttress, he ducks. The barrel is here seen as the &lsquo;funnel of his fanmail shrimpnet&rsquo; at 365.39 (471.26). He is ultimately lost to sight as he floats &lsquo;through the statuemen.&rsquo;  </div>
