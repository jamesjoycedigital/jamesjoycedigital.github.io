<div class="nbunit" id="edn389">  389  A brilliant example of Joyce's method &mdash; the superimposition of multiple interwoven allusions upon a structural matrix to form a dense yet comprehensible whole &mdash; the Saint Kevin episode is especially delightful because it is so short, so concise, so self-contained and so (relatively) easy to unravel. This is because the allusions fall into groups of twos, threes, fives, sevens, and nines of associated elements. If all these pattern-words are removed from the text nothing is left behind. The basic storyline itself is a nine-fold series of concentric circles specifying the location of Kevin in much the same multifocal, obsessive manner as young Stephen is positioned at the start of <i>A Portrait</i>: </p><p class="set"> 1. Irish ocean - The Universe <br> 2. Ireland - The World <br> 3. Lough Glendalough - Europe <br> 4. Island - Ireland <br> 5. Pond - Kildare <br> 6. Little island - Sallins <br> 7. Pool inside hut - Clongowes Wood <br> 8. Tub inside pool - Class of Elements <br> 9. Kevin immersed in tub - Stephen Dedalus </p><p> Of the remaining patterns, many of which can be found written down on the torn pages of notebook N4 (VI.B.25), most have been detailed by Jack P. Dalton in &lsquo;Advertisement for the Restoration,&rsquo; <i>Twelve and a Tilly</i> (London, 1966), 119-37. Having restored the words lost in transcription and therefore absent from the 1939 edition (&ldquo;the lustral domination contained within&rdquo;), the most important of the symmetries are as follows: </p><p class="set"> <i>Orders of angels</i> (ascending): angels, archangels, principalities, powers, virtues, dominations, thrones, cherubim and seraphim. <br> <i>Holy Orders</i> (descending): priest, deacon, sub-deacon, acolyte, lector, exorcist and doorkeeper. <br> <i>Canonical hours</i> (chronological): matins with lauds (&lsquo;at matin chime&rsquo; and &lsquo;lawding&rsquo;), prime (&lsquo;by prime&rsquo;), terce (&lsquo;till the third morn hour&rsquo;), sext (&lsquo;at sextnoon&rsquo;), nones (&lsquo;ninthly&rsquo;), vespers (&lsquo;when violet vesper vailed&rsquo;) and compline (&lsquo;at solemn compline&rsquo;). <br> <i>Sacraments</i> (in random order): matrimony, holy orders (&lsquo;of orders hibernian&rsquo;), extreme unction (&lsquo;with oil extremely anointed&rsquo;), penance, communion (&lsquo;eucharistic&rsquo;), confirmation (&lsquo;confirmed a strong and perfect christian&rsquo;) and baptism. <br> <i>Gifts of the Holy Ghost</i> (in reverse order): fear of the Lord (&lsquo;of the Lord a filial fearer&rsquo;), piety (&lsquo;piously Kevin&rsquo;), knowledge (&lsquo;powerful in knowledge&rsquo;), fortitude (&lsquo;to live in fortitude&rsquo;), counsel (&lsquo;taking counsel&rsquo;), understanding (&lsquo;well understanding&rsquo;) and wisdom (&lsquo;in his sate of wisdom&rsquo;). <br> <i>States of beatification</i> (ascending): holy, most holy, venerable, most venerable, blessed, most blessed and saint. <br> <i>Liturgical colours</i>: white (&lsquo;whiteclad&rsquo;), green (&lsquo;Glendalough-le-vert&rsquo;), red (&lsquo;rubric&rsquo;), violet (&lsquo;when violet vesper vailed&rsquo;) and black (&lsquo;sable <i>cappa magna</i>&rsquo;). <br> <i>Monkish vows</i>: voluntary poverty, perpetual chastity and entire obedience. <br> <i>Feasts of the True Cross</i>: the Invention (May 3) and the Exaltation (September 14). <br> <i>Vestments</i>: Kevin arrives clad in a simple tunic (&lsquo;in alb of cloth of gold&rsquo;), yet by the end of the fable he has donned a bishop's great-cloak (&lsquo;sable <i>cappa magna</i>&rsquo;). </p><p> To the above can be added references to the Blessed Trinity (&lsquo;lawding the triune trishagion&rsquo;), the feast of the Holy Angels, church music (&lsquo;Gregorian&rsquo; and &lsquo;Ambrosian,&rsquo; respectively the recent and the ancient), the special privilege of carrying a portable altar, and that wonderful invention: a tub that can be used as a boat or upturned to form an altar to provide Mass after Baptism and described seven times by Joyce (&lsquo;<i>altar cum balneo</i>,&rsquo; &lsquo;altar <i>super</i> bath,&rsquo; &lsquo;bath <i>propter</i> altar,&rsquo; &lsquo;altar <i>unacumque</i> bath,&rsquo; &lsquo;tubbathaltar,&rsquo; &lsquo;handbathtub,&rsquo; and &lsquo;hipbathtub&rsquo;). </p><p> Joyce's own wordplay completes the mosaic: seven forms of creation (increate, creator, procreated, pre-created, post-created, con-created, recreated), five versions of concentricity (centripetally, epicentre, centrifugal, centre, inter-concentric centre), twin rivers (&lsquo;Yssia&rsquo; and &lsquo;Essia&rsquo;), clearly forms of Issy but in the first draft were the Slaney and the Liffey, which rise in the Wicklow Mountains just south and north (respectively) of Glendalough.  </div>
