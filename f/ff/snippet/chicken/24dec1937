<div class="nbunit" id="24Dec1937"><font color="red">24 December 1937</font> <i>NLVP</i> (from Ben Huebsch to JJ): &hellip; all of the Spring books are in work and are being sold to the trade. Thus, from an editorial point of view, our interest is already centred on the Autumn, and if &ldquo;Work in Progress&rdquo; is to appear then, we wish to build our list around it. To that end it is desirable that we be informed about certain details and decide our procedure. I should like to know when the manuscript will finally be in Faber&apos;s hands so that we may be able to arrange with them as to a common publication date, and possibly to our reproducing their edition by photography. </div>
