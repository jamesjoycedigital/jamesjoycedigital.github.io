<div class="nbunit" id="fw10ed"><h4><cite>Finnegans Wake</cite></a> by James Joyce, edited by Danis Rose and John O'Hanlon (Mousehole, Cornwall: Houyhnhnm Press, 2010).</h4> </p><p>This is the first, and so far only, critically edited text of <cite>Finnegans Wake</cite>. It closely approximates what used to be called a &lsquo;definitive&rsquo; edition in that a conservative rationale has been painstakingly applied over many years in tracing the textual history of each word, phrase and sentence in the novel back to its root form, and beyond that, where possible, to its counterpart in one or other of the 60-odd notebooks that Joyce filled over the period 1922-1939. The notebook counterparts usually consist of a word or two only, copied from the books, journals and newspapers that he found himself reading or that he had friends or assistants read out aloud to him. </p><p> Some copies of the first, limited edition are still available directly from the <a href="http://www.houyhnhnmpress.com" target="_blank">Houyhnhnm Press</a>. </p><p>A cheaper hardback reproduction, in a smaller format and entitled &ldquo;The Restored Finnegans Wake&rdquo; was published by <a href="https://www.penguin.com.au/books/the-restored-finnegans-wake-9780141960456" target="_blank">Penguin</a> in 2012. Unfortunately, it is now out of print and can only be bought second-hand. It boasts a cover designed by <a href="https://www.eoinryanart.com/finnegans-wake-1/" target="_blank">Eoin Ryan</a>. </p><p>A de luxe reprint, illustrated by John Vernon Lord, was published by <a href="../../FF/fbiog/Finnegans Wake Folio.htm" target="_blank">The Folio Society</a> in 2014. Unfortunately, this edition has been sold out and is only available second-hand.
