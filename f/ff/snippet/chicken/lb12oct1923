<div class="nbunit" id="lb12Oct1923"><font color="red">12 October 1923</font> <i>STA</i> (to Lily Bollach): Many thanks indeed for your kind letter and your great promptness in typing the whole of my MS so quickly. &hellip; It is all right and I have already sent it off. I wish my MS were a little more interesting so that your work might be less dull, especially after your long office hours. I am very grateful to you for offering to continue but I hope you will at once let me know whenever you feel unequal to the task. Perhaps you can meet me at the usual place on Tuesday [16 October 1923] at 6.15? </div>
