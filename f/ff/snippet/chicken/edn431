<div class="nbunit" id="edn431">  431  Discussing the conclusion of his book, Joyce told Louis Gillet: </p><p> In <cite>Ulysses</cite>, to depict the babbling of a woman going to sleep, I had sought to end with the least forceful word I could possibly find. I had found the word &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, which is barely pronounced, which denotes acquiescence, self-abandon, relaxation, the end of all resistance. In <cite>Work in Progress</cite> I've tried to do better if I could.

Markow-Totevy [Abelard-Schuman, London and New York, 1958], page 111].) </p><p> We might add that the large blank space on the last page (which, perhaps symbolises moisture-laden air and reflects the large black flea-sized dot of &lsquo;Ithaca&rsquo;, another sleep symbol) between &lsquo;the<i>&rsquo;</i> and &lsquo;Paris, 1922-1939,&rsquo; <i>also forms part of the book</i>. The very <i>last</i> correction he made to his exhaustingly corrected text before it was published concerned it: </p><p> Page 628: Please print the Place and Date much lower approximately where I indicated or lower (BL Add. MS 47488 240).  </div>
