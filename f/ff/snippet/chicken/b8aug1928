The girls do nothing really but turn to one another, exclaiming one another&apos;s name joyfully (Frida! Freda! etc). These are 29 words for &ldquo;Peace&rsquo; taken from or modelled on the following tongues and variations (German, Dano-Norwegian, Proven&ccedil;al, French, Greek, French variations, Malay, Echo, Gipsy, Magyar, childrens, Armenian, Senegalese, Latin variation, Irish, Diminutive, N. Breton, S. Breton, Chinese, Pidgin, Arabic, Hebrew, Sanskrit, Hindustani and English = O for goodness sake leave off!). This word was actually sighed around the world in that way in 1918. </div>
