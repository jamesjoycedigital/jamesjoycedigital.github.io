<div class="nbunit" id="3Sep1933"><font color="red">3 September 1933</font> <i>Selected Letters</i> (Lucia Joyce to Frank Budgen): The frase of the latin mass which you could not read is on Ulysses page I. The old catholics Augustiner Kirche are a good example of a Mooks gone Gripes. They separated from Rome in 71 when the infallibility of the pope was proclaimed a Dogma but they have since gone much more apart. They have abolished auricular confession they have the eucarist under two species but the faithful received the cup only at Whitsun. I see no prayers to the B V M or the saints in their prayer book and no image of her or them around the church. But most important of all they have abolished the Filioque clause in the creed concerning which there has been a schism between western and eastern christendom for over a thousand years, Rome saying the Holy Ghost proceeds from the father and the son. Greece and Russia and the East Orthodox churches that the procession is from the father alone, ex patre without Filioque. Of course the dogmas proclaimed by Rome after the split are not recognised by the east such as the Immaculate conception. See the Mooks and the Gripes that is West and east, paragraph beginning when that Mooksius and ending Phioquus. All the grotesque words in this are russian or greek for the three principal dogmas which separate Shem from Shaun. When he gets A and B on to his lap C slides off and when he has C and A he loses hold of B. </div>
