<div class="nbunit" id="a18Mar1930"><font color="red">18 March 1930</font> <i>Selected Letters</i> (to Harriet Weaver, typed): I finished the revision of the fragment for publication last night at seven, and, I suspect, my literary career at the same time &hellip; A.L.P. is announced to appear on May 1st. I offered H.C.E. to the Fountain Press, successors to Crosby Gaige. They declined to pay the price asked, whereupon I gave it to Babou and Kahane of Paris, who will bring it out on the 12th of April. &hellip; When I ceased contributing to Transition I felt a sudden kind of drop as I was determined not to attack the second part in such an ill-equipped state (the revision of this last fragment has been a frightful job, extending over two months day and night sometimes till one in the morning, with seven different people helping me to do seven different parts of the labour, but of course such a condition of affairs could not continue) </div>
