I have undergone two more eye operations &mdash; the latter very severe &mdash; and could not write &hellip;  Can you meet me &hellip; next Tuesday (4 May 1926) &hellip; I hope so as I have some work which I would ask you to type if you have any free time. I have written it out very clearly and large. </div>
