<div class="nbunit" id="5April1925"><font color="red">5 April 1925</font> <i>STA</i> (to Lily Bollach; large hand; incomplete): to me. I should like 3 copies (original and 2), very black type. The part with all the accents is to remain as it is. I hope to see you about the middle of the week and beg you if this work is too absurdly difficult not to have any hesitation in telling me so. I shall risk sending it in any case. </div>
