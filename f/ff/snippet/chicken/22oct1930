<div class="nbunit" id="22Oct1930"><font color="red">22 October 1930</font> <i>Letters III</i> (to Harriet Weaver): I began to write the 2nd part on Sunday last &mdash; but with what labours! It is always like this when I start a fresh bout. I have exchanged my old machine for  a Remington portable and hope to learn how to use it myself. </div>
