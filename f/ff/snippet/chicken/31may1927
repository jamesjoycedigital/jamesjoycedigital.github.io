<div class="nbunit" id="31May1927"><font color="red">31 May 1927</font> <i>Letters I</i> (to Harriet Weaver): I have no news about the MS but I hope you got it. I got your letter with your guess at the translation &hellip; Archer&apos;s literal &hellip; &mdash; <i>He (God) is fatherly toward me in person</i> / <i>But economical</i> &mdash; <i>that he is not!</i> the racier version, more in the lilt, would be &mdash; <i>He feels like a father for yours truly P.G.</i> / <i>But a stickler for thrift</i> &mdash; <i>Holy Paul, that he isn&apos;t!</i> As regards the title, &lsquo;one squared&rsquo; can be used in the &lsquo;math&rsquo; lesson by the writer of Part II if he, or she, is so &lsquo;dispoged&rsquo;. The title I projected is much more commonplace and accords with the J J &amp; S and A.G.S. &amp; Co sign and it ought to be fairly plain from a reading of <font face="wake">w</font>. The sign in this form means H.C.E. interred in the landscape &hellip; I discovered yesterday that [James Stephens] was born in Dublin on 2 February 1882. As regards <font face="wake">w</font> it seems to be rolling round the globe over all kinds of toes &hellip; A writer in a review of it in Laurens County, Georgia, says: We and the Oconee river of all places are in it too &hellip; </div>
