<div class="nbunit" id="a5Feb1924"><font color="red">5 February 1924</font> <i>STA</i> (to Lily Bollach): In my usual hasty fashion I left over some MS for you last night. I fear some of the pages are really dreadful but do not know what to do with them. I do hope they are not too difficult and that the so-called Latin is at least legible. I have one favour to ask. My sight is not the best and I find it hard to read type at night. The ink on the last sheets were to me rather faint. Can this be remedied in the future I mean? If not, it does not matter. I hope the MS will not give you too much trouble and that you may have time to do it when (and if) your work is lighter than it was. </div>
