<div class="nbunit" id="alb24Mar1924"><font color="red">24 March 1924</font> <i>Letters III</i> (to Lily Bollach STA):  My excuse for my discourtesy is that  I have been revising proof after proof of a passage which will appear next week in the Transatlantic Review &mdash; the piece about the four old men typed by you some months &hellip; I shall of course send you a copy of the review immediately it comes out. I hope I may be able to see you this week as there is another small matter I want to bother you about. </div>
