I enclose proofs of <i>The Giant&apos;s Howe</i> which I hope will please you better in print. Two curious things. Huddleston told me he is of Scandinavian stock and was born in Barrow-in Furness, where there is a giant&apos;s mound. A chinese student sent some letterwords I had asked for. The last one is <font face="wake">w</font>. It means &lsquo;mountain&rsquo; and is pronounced &lsquo;Chin&rsquo;, the common people&apos;s way of pronouncing Hin or Fin.  </div>
