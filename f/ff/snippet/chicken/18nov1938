It is called &lsquo;Un R&egrave;ve&rsquo; &hellip; I have finished my book. Next Thursday, (24 November 1938) on the American Thanksgiving Day, <i>Eucharistia</i>, some friends are giving a little supper for me. I should like to sing your song in French and also in Greek. Could you let me have the words in time, clearly written out, with a translation? &hellip; By the way, the words are different in the Franch text. There is nothing about the sea in it, no laughter and no blonde, but great sadness &hellip; Hurray! I have finished this blasted book. </div>
