<div class="nbunit" id="edn52">  52  Joyce based this episode on an incident in the life of Grace O'Malley (&lsquo;her grace&rsquo;), the Princess of Connacht (Joyce's &lsquo;westerness&rsquo;) or, as the Irish called her, Granuaile (&lsquo;brannewail&rsquo;/&lsquo;grannewail&rsquo;). On returning from England and landing at Howth, she called to the castle of the St Lawrence's in expectation of the hospitality that was then universally afforded to travellers, only to find the doors shut, as the family was at dinner. In retaliation at the perceived slight she kidnapped the young heir and took him to her stronghold in Mayo (&lsquo;Erio&rsquo;). Eventually she returned the boy on the family promising always to leave the castle door open at mealtimes. The <cite>Wake</cite> version is more complicated. The Prankquean calls three times to kidnap not one heir but two, if not three. A great deal of doubling and tripling is going on, encompassing actions, states of warmth, verbs, type of domicile, part of body, colours, speech, and so forth. The reader can pick out these patterns easily enough in a careful reading. One perhaps less obvious pattern is a reference to Saint Patrick's prophetic vision of the three orders of Irish saints when he saw at first all Ireland ablaze, and afterwards only the mountains on fire, and at last only lamps lit in the valleys. Thus, on the three days of her visits: &lsquo;fireland was ablaze&rsquo; at 17.10 (21.16), &lsquo;redcocks flew flackering from the hillcombs&rsquo; at 17.29 (22.03), and &lsquo;valleys lay twinkling&rsquo; at 18.11 (22.27). The first image recurs at 389.29 (501.22): &lsquo;There were fires on every bald hill in holy Ireland that night.&rsquo;  </div>
