<div class="nbunit" id="9Aug1937"><font color="red">9 August 1937</font> <i>Letters III</i> (to Frank Budgen): &hellip; could you make for me a <i>pr&eacute;cis</i> of the plot of the book I sent you, marking the margins wherever you like in <i>blue</i> when the marked passage is noteworthy and bears on the plot &hellip; and in <i>red</i> when there is some attraction in the style or better in the dialogue? In this way I can get an idea of the book in an hour or so. Terribly overworked on proofs of W i P. which I should finish by end of year. </div>
