<div class="nbunit" id="4Jun1924"><font color="red">4 June 1924</font> <i>BLHW</i> (to Harriet Weaver): The postponement of the operation is very boring to me &hellip; I do not know what I shall do when I come out of the clinic. Perhaps I shall go for a rest to Britanny first. I should like to see the Wembley Exhibition and collect several hundred sacks of savage newspapers &hellip; I asked [my son&apos;s teacher] to look for a place [in Nice] where we could stay for a few months about the end of the year &hellip; Perhaps I could take one case of books and do some work but I will think of that later on &hellip; It must be very exasperating for you &hellip; to see me floundering about like a half blind seal, giving forth plaintive yelps of distress. Perhaps I was wrong to begin such a difficult book after having ended <i>Ulysses</i>. I began to see very clearly this morning the fusion of the second and third parts. How often in the day have I to resist the temptation to go down to Miss Beach&apos;s shop and get out, at least, the typescript or even the unfinished MS of Shaun? </div>
