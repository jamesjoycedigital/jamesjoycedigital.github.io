<div class="nbunit" id="18Jan1938"><font color="red">18 January 1938</font> <i>NLFF</i> (from T.S. Eliot to Paul L&eacute;on): I am enclosing two more specimen pages for Mr Joyce &hellip; the last galleys of the remaining matter which we have in hand will be ready by the end of the first week in February. Viscount Carlow came in to see me, and gave me the dummy for the page arrangement of the book, which I have handed to Mr de la Mare. Viscount Carlow also intimated that Mr Joyce would like to have the book published on 4 July. I am afraid that this date also is much too soon to be possible &hellip; public holiday in America, and therefore no books can be published there on that day. </div>
