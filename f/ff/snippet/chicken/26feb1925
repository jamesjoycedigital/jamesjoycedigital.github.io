<div class="nbunit" id="26Feb1925"><font color="red">26 February 1925</font> <i>Letters III</i> (from Lucia Joyce): I came back here yesterday fairly well to have a rest before the operation and to try to revise the piece for Mr Eliot &hellip; With this attack in the good eye I am practically helpless but I managed to do some revision even in the dark as I want to send off the piece before I go back &hellip; I will try to send you MS by Mr McAlmon if I see him. I should be glad to hear Mr Muir&apos;s article read to me before I send off the piece which is an indirect reply to criticisms </div>
