<div class="nbunit" id="a3Dec1926"><font color="red">3 December 1926</font> <i>TCD</i> (to Tuohy): Dear Tuohy; Excuse my long silence. The death of my sister&apos;s husband in Trieste in most tragic circumstances (please do not allude to it in writing as I have not yet told my wife the whole story) and a big lawsuit and agitation which I have to arrange against a &lsquo;crook&rsquo; American who is pirating and imitating [?] <u>Ulysses</u> and after writing it. My own new book takes up all my time. Yes, I will try to give you a few more sittings though, as I told you, I am not greatly interested in the [visage in question]. I don&apos;t think you quite understand what I wanted in the case of my mother. The portrait of my father is still in the douane and I have asked an expert to reduce the duty. This is pending. It would be tedious to send it back [end of letter torn off] </div>
