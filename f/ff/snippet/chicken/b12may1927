<div class="nbunit" id="b12May1927"><font color="red">12 May 1927</font> <i>Letters I</i> (to Harriet Weaver):  I shall use some of your suggestions about <font face="wake">N</font> of which you have a right idea. The title is very simple and as commonplace as can be. It is not Kitty O&apos;shea as some wit suggested, though it is in two words. I want to think over it more as I propose to make some experiments with it also. Will you please send back Lewis&apos;s <i>The Enemy</i> as no answer can be got from  him either to return my MS (which he was so anxious to have to the exclusion of all other creative artists etc) or to send on the copies I persuaded Miss Beach to order. &hellip; Peer Gynt says at least: <i>Han er faderligt syndet imod min Person / Men &oslash;konom! &mdash; nej, det er han ikke!</i> P.S. I want to see as a test if you can read these 2 lines of Norwegian? It is when the ship stolen from Peer Gynt blows up at sea with all his goods. He is on the strand, stranded. </div>
