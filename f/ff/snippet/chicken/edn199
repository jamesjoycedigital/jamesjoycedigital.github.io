<div class="nbunit" id="edn199">  199  The passage is associated with a second, mixed-up version of the Maggy letter from Boston. Like the prototype it is incomplete. It reads: <i>Dear A&ndash; N&ndash;, Well, hoping the funeral was a happy one and please accept condolences Poor F.M</i>. [Father Michael] <i>Well, how are all at home and how are you? And thanks for the lovely present of cakes Well, Maggy, hoping soon to hear, must now close With fondest from sender.</i> </p><p> Issy's reading is of the Quinet passage of which Joyce was so inordinately fond of. It originates in Quinet's <i>Introduction a la philosophie de l'histoire de l'humanite</i> (see the <i>Oeuvres Completes</i> (Paris, 1857), volume II, 367-8; see also James Atherton, <i>Books at the Wake</i>, 34 and 276, and Clive Hart, <i>Structure and Motif in Finnegans Wake</i>, l82-200). The sentence, which is slightly altered in Joyce's version translates: </p><p class="set"> Today, as in the days of Pliny and Columella, the hyacinth takes its pleasures in Gaul, the periwinkle in Illyria, the daisy in the ruins of Numancia; and while around them cities have changed masters and names, and many have returned into nothingness, and while civilisations have collided each with each and broken, the peaceful generations of these flowers have continued across the ages following one another down to us, fresh and laughing as on the days of the battles. </p><p> In her second footnote on page 218 (281), Issy asks Teague (Shaun) to translate this &lsquo;gaswind&rsquo; into Turkish, like a good chap, and asks Thady (Shem) to put it into Polish, like a nice boy, on his blotting-paper. Distorted versions of the Quinet motif recur periodically throughout the text. It is in a sense, a central motif of the book.  </div>
