Morely): Miss Weaver has most probably handed to you the MS of the first part of Work in Progress and Mr Joyce asks me to write to you to forward the enclosed sample of an edition of Mr R&eacute;my de Gourmont&apos;s work the type of which pleases him especially. It is I believe a type of Elzevir or some derivation of it and I am sure that should you be able to obtain some similar character it would please Mr Joyce very much indeed. </div>
