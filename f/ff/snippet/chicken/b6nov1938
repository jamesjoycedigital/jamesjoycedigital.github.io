<div class="nbunit" id="b6Nov1938"><font color="red">6 November 1938</font> <i>NLFF</i> (from Paul L&eacute;on to Richard de la Mere): As the repaging of the episode in Part II where the marginal notes appear is a delicate thing, I think it wiser to send you the galleys from which the paging was done as they contain the indications of the exact places where these notes should be placed. May I also remind that both the notes as well as on the right hand side of the text should be aligned to the left.  </div>
