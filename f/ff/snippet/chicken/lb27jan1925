<div class="nbunit" id="lb27Jan1925"><font color="red">27 January 1925</font> <i>STA</i> (to Lily Bollach): Please excuse me for the oddlooking parcel I left last night. Here is the rest of the MS. The typescript you kindly left for me so promptly is excellently done and very clear and legible. Many thanks. I have not yet heard from London but expect a letter by any post. When I do I shall let you know. </div>
