<div class="nbunit" id="a14Oct1940"><font color="red">14 October 1940</font> <i>BLHW</i> (from Harriet Weaver): I am informed that there is now a likelihood of letters from this country getting through to persons in most parts of unoccupied France whether sent by ordinary post or by air mail, the latter being recommended for speed. &hellip; After protracted enquiry and negotiation Messrs Monro, Saw succeeded a short time ago in securing the dispatch to you of a sum of &pound;50 in francs. It had at first been stated that the money would go through the Bank of England and that no notification of its safe delivery to you could be given. Later the Irish High Commission was brought in and in a letter to Messrs Monro, Saw written on October 30th his secretary says that &ldquo;it is learned from the home department that the Irish Minister at Vichy has been requested by cable to pay to Mr Joyce the equivalent in French francs of the sum of &pound;50, as arranged. The cost of the cables exchanged with the Minister at Vichy in regard to this matter amounted to &pound;2.11.0 &hellip; In regard to future remittances I am to state that it is anticipated that it will be possible to have such remittances made to Mr Joyce provided that the amounts involved are not at a rate in excess of &pound;30 per month&rdquo;. If possible will you please let either me or your solicitors know if the money reached you safely. </div>
