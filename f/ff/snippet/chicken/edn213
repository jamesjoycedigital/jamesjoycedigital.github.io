<div class="nbunit" id="edn213">  213  The sailor's perplexing question identifies him with his I.1 counterpart, the Prankquean, who asks the Jarl: <i>Mark the Wans, who do I am alook alike a poss of porterpease?</i> In the I.1 story, the woman comes and goes from afar, visiting the male in his keep three times and each time confounds him with her riddle. In contrast, in II.3 the male comes and goes, returning (as does the Prankquean) on three occasions and, as she is, looking for something (the suit in his case; soup in hers). In this transformation of the primordial encounter between the sexes, the ship's husband replaces the Jarl. On being shouted at (stop!) as they flee, both of the fugitives flatly refuse (<i>not likely!</i>). The female-male role reversal is accompanied with a shift in the underlying numerology: the Prankquean's <i>forty</i> is re-instantiated as the sailor's <i>seven</i>. These two tales should be read (appropriately enough) in tandem to appreciate the proliferating intertextuality.  </div>
