<div class="nbunit" id="edn218">  218  This is one of a series of allusions running through the story to that of <i>Gideon</i> in the Bible. Joyce posits a correspondence between the fleece of wool and the apparition of the dew, on the one hand, and the suit of clothes and the celebration of the captain's wedding on the other. The Captain, Pukkelsen, alias Horace, plays Gideon to the ship's husband's God. Joyce compounds the sailor-tailor confusion at this stage by re-naming the tailor &lsquo;Ashe Junior.&rsquo; Gideon was the son of Joash.  </div>
