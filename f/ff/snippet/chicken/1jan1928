<div class="nbunit" id="1Jan1928"><font color="red">1 January 1928</font> <i>BLHW</i> (to Harriet Weaver): A week or so ago I sent you copies of the <i>Paris Times</i> with <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i> references (one, I suppose to my visit to James Stephens and a lot of other gossip) to my &lsquo;recantation&rsquo; of my work in deference to the opinion of a valued friend. In reply you say you suppose I am well and hard at work. I am neither. I have done no work for over two months and the doctor refuses to allow me even to revise proof at present &hellip; I have been aware of the untenability of my position more or less for fifteen months, since my return here from Brussels but it has now reached an acute state. I have neither the mind nor the heart any more to continue to &lsquo;waste my genius on a mere curiosity of literature&rsquo; </div>
