<div class="nbunit" id="10Sep1923"><font color="red">10 September 1923</font> <i>BLHW</i> (to Harriet Weaver): We chase flats very much in the style of the animals in the piece enclosed &hellip; I enclose another piece a description of Isolde&apos;s first parent. I had it typed at once in order to read it. I think it would be monstrous to inflict the typing of the book on you. You would get no pleasure from the text. The type after all is a dress rehearsal of print. I am working at another piece which I shall send on. I have now paged the pieces (unnumbered, of course) into a folder &hellip; if what I am doing here shapes itself &hellip; difficult for me to explain what I am at and I hate saying anything which is not clear &mdash; to myself at least. I hope my extract of earwigs may give you some mildly comic relief. If not perhaps the next one &mdash; another part of the Tristan part &mdash; will. </div>
