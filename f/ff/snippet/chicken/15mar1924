<div class="nbunit" id="15Mar1924"><font color="red">15 March 1924</font> <i>Letters III</i> (to Harriet Weaver): I hope none of the MS was lost. It is eleven pages [actually, 12]. The first words are &lsquo;O tell me&rsquo; the last &lsquo;waters of. Night!&rsquo; I shall send you two pages which have been written again to replace. But they do not change the piece. It should be read in successive runs.  </div>
