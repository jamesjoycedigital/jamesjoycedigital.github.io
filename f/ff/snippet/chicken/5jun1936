<div class="nbunit" id="5Jun1936"><font color="red">5 June 1936</font> <i>Claybook</i> (to Louis Gillet): Yes, I have worked all this time on a chapter which is perhaps the most complacently absurd thing that I ever did till now. I gave it up during these last weeks. I was too depressed to continue the buffoonery. But starting tomorrow I shall set to work again. It is a story of a captain &hellip; and a Dublin tailor which my god-father told me forty years ago, trying to explain the arrival of my Viking in Dublin, his marriage, and a lot of things I don&apos;t care to mention here </div>
