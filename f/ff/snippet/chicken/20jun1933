<div class="nbunit" id="20Jun1933"><font color="red">20 June 1933</font> <i>NLPK</i> (from Paul L&eacute;on to J. Ralph Pinker): As far as the title is concerned since all the fragments have really no titles but merely quotations of several words I think Mr Joyce has made up his mind to choose a quotation for this one too. The title will then be &ldquo;THE MIME OF MICK, NICK AND THE MAGGIES&rdquo;. </div>
