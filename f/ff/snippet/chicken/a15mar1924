<div class="nbunit" id="a15Mar1924"><font color="red">15 March 1924</font> <i>Letters III</i> (to Harriet Weaver):  On Monday (17 March 1924) I shall try to start Shaun the Post. This would make the second part of my book fairly complete with the letter. The first part is not written yet. You did not say if you liked the piece? I read it to Mr Larbaud who was  enthusiastic about it. I think I shall fall all of a heap after the Shaun piece. It has been such a struggle. </div>
