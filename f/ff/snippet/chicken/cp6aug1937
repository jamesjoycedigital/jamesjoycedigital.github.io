Many thanks for all safely received. I miss [Val Vousden&apos;s] <i>Let it Pass</i> and [Percy French&apos;s] <i>Andy McElroe</i>. I may send you a further &pound;1 when I look at the catalogue again. I want the music more than the words (those I had already made large use of) as I want to bind the lot into a volume for Giorgio &hellip; When you come to Paris bring the P.F. book with you &hellip; As for <i>Who&apos;s Who</i> and <i>Thom&apos;s</i> I really don&apos;t need these at all, certainly not at all urgently. They can wait &hellip; We shall therefore meet on Oct 1 &hellip; Now it seems we may leave on Monday (9 August 1937) for Le Touquet. &hellip; Thanks too for the <i>libretto</i> and the Chancellor&apos;s verses on J.L.T. [Toole] </div>
