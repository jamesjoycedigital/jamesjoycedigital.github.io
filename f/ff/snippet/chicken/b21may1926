There is a book on Bruno (though not on Nolan) by Lewis McIntyre (Macmillan) I do not know if Vico has been translated. I would not pay overmuch attention to these theories, beyond using them for all they are worth, but they have gradually forced themselves on me through circumstances of my own life. I wonder where Vico got his fear of thunderstorms. </div>
