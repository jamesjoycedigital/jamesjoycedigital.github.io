<div class="nbunit" id="edn53">  53  Joyce provided a key to 18.32?40 (23.16?26), see <cite>Selected Letters</cite>, <a name="8Aug1928" href="../../flett.fwlett.htm#13May1927">13 May</a> 1927. The reader is urged to read this to appreciate how seriously Joyce strived to introduce real depth into his text. Take, for example, &lsquo;O foenix culprit! Ex nickylow malo comes mickelmassed bonum.&rsquo; One can see in this <font face="wake">H</font> as foe, or snake, the culprit of the park; Augustine's &lsquo;<i>O felix culpa!</i>,&rsquo; the phoenix, a symbol used by Michelet to explain Vico's theory of a quadripartite cyclic pattern in history (the squared circle) and used by Joyce to illustrate Bruno's identity of opposites (here, birth and death); Satan (Lucifer or Nick) and the archangel Michael; the Latin phrases <i>Ex nihilo nihil fit</i> and <i>Ex malo bonum fit</i>; as well as an elegant pun on the Latin word <i>malum</i> (apple).  </div>
