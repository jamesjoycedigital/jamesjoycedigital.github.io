<div class="nbunit" id="a27May1929"><font color="red">27 May 1929</font> <i>Letters I</i> (to Harriet Weaver): Aldington came to see me. <cite>Des Imagistes</cite> the collection of poems published about 1500 years ago is to come out in a new form, i.e. contributions of today by the three more or less unknown contributors. I, not having any verse and not wishing to seem un-colleaguelike proposed giving him Kevin&apos;s page from Pt II. I have looked for it but can&apos;t find it, high or low. So could you please make me a copy when you have time therefor. </div>
