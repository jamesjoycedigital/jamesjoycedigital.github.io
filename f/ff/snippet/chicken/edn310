<div class="nbunit" id="edn310">  310  Yawn achieves this remarkable circumposition by virtue of the ancient geographical divisions of Ireland into halves/quarters/fifths and so on. Because he lies at the exact centre of Ireland, where all the provinces meet, and is spread-eagled he has (in one division) one arm in Connacht, a leg in West Munster, the other leg in East Munster, an arm in Leinster, and his head in Ulster. His upper moiety lies in <i>Leth Cuinn</i> (the &lsquo;Half of Conn&rsquo;) and the lower in <i>Leth Moga</i> (the &lsquo;Half of Mug&rsquo;) after an even earlier division of the country into two parts by a ridge known as <i>Eiscir Riada</i>. </p><p> The geographical and mystical centre of Ireland &mdash; called <i>Uisneach</i> &mdash; was located in county Meath. It was there, reputedly, that Mide lit the first fire &mdash; it blazed for seven years. There also was set the Stone of Divisions, a five-ridged pillar stone marking the locus of the coming together of the five partitions of Ireland (there are now only four). Legend associates Uisneach with the tongues of druids (hence, perhaps, Yawn's many voices) and with a huge ash tree (corresponding to Joyce's Wellington Monument/Yggradrasil [the three-rooted evergreen ash tree of Scandinavian mythology that binds together Asgard, Midgard, and Niflheim]).  </div>
