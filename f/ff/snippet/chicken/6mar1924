<div class="nbunit" id="6Mar1924"><font color="red">6 March 1924</font> <i>Letters III</i> (to Ford Madox Ford): It is now 5.30 and there is no sign of the proof promised me for Tuesday evening. (4 March 1924) As arranged I must revise this proof again and be sure that my revisions are made even if the piece has to be held over for another number. Will you please see that I get it at once. </div>
