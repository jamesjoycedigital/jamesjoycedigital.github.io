Morely to Paul L&eacute;on): I promised Mr Joyce to send him the enclosed original page specimen for WORK IN PROGRESS. I believe he approved it the time it was set up. If he still approves, and if we can be told the total length of the book, we can begin setting the part of the text we have. </div>
