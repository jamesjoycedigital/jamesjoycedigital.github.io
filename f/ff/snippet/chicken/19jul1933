<div class="nbunit" id="19Jul1933"><font color="red">19 July 1933</font> <i>NLGC</i> (from Budgen to JJ): To the last chapter W.i.P. I am adding a page or two on Chapelizod where I bring in Shem and Shaun and the Maggies and the twelve as well as the bigman landlord of the Mullingar Inn. Mr Kernan, by the way, is a Scowegian looking man. One never knows whether he is scowling or laughing. I have read Lefanu&apos;s &ldquo;The House by the Churchyard&rdquo;. I shall bring in somehow the &rdquo;<i>Stalworth</i> Elm&rdquo;. There&apos;s a good bit too by Devereux on the river but I shall leave that out. How to end it I don&apos;t quite know but I must know before Saturday. (22 July 1933) </div>
