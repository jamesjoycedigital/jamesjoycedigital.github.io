<div class="nbunit" id="25Nov1932"><font color="red">25 November 1932</font> <i>BLHW</i> (to Harriet Weaver, typed): The MS never turned up. However I set to work on the notes you kindly sent over and patched it all up again. I fired them off in envelopes which I hope you got safely. I have also written an intervening passage and hope to complete the whole fragment tomorrow or next day. Faber and Faber do not want the dutch press to bring it out in a deluxe edition as they want to have an option on it first. It may be possible as Leon suggests to combine the two firms&apos; offers though personally I doubt whether an English publishing firm would agree to put its imprint on types set up on the continent. I am rather puzzlled by the evident anxiety of F. &amp; F. to bring out chunks of my gibberish but evidently there is some demand for it. We moved into the above address a few days ago &hellip; I made it a condition with either F. &amp; F. and the Dutch firm that in case of the editing of the fragment there should be an initial and a tail piece </div>
