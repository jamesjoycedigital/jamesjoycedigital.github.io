<div class="nbunit" id="11Sep1937"><font color="red">11 September 1937</font> <i>NLPL</i> (to Paul L&eacute;on): Here is a cheque. Please pay Galignani 150 frs first. I want from him (1) Macpherson&apos;s <i>Ossian</i> in any edition (it was in the old Tauchnitz) or on loan (2) <i>The Lost Leader</i>, a play by Lennox Robinson written about 5 years ago (3) <i>Tom Sawyer</i> by Mark Twain, any cheap edition. This, if it can be had at once, should go to Jolas with a letter asking him to make a digest of the plot with especial attention to the book&apos;s sequel <i>Huckleberry Finn</i> and also marking in blue in the margin the chief points bearing on the plot and in red the chief highlights of the speech used. They plan to return on the 20th &hellip; it is useless to send it later than say the 13th or 15th &hellip; I am still not well &hellip; I have not been able to do more than 20 hours work since I left. Yet I try to stay on here on account of the fresh air &hellip; You will receive a book from Budgen. Keep it for me. </div>
