<div class="nbunit" id="30Jul1924"><font color="red">30 July 1924</font> <i>BLHW</i> (to Harriet Weaver): I wanted to visit Dinan and Renan&apos;s birthplace. I am not sure now whether I shall do so or not. When the weather is bad I read a little in the town library &hellip; Though I came here to rest and wait for second sight I wish I could add to my meagre thanks something more definite concerning my mental wrestlings with the next part of my book (Messrs Earwicker and family having been left to fight it out between them &mdash; the French academy would condemn the preposition but he is one against more than one &mdash;) nevertheless I hope that by the time I reach London I shall have gone through the first round or so &hellip; I have reached nearly the end of the Wembley dinnerparty </div>
