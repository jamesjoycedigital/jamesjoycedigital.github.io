<div class="nbunit" id="31Jan1930"><font color="red">31 January 1930</font> (Stuart Gilbert diary): At last J.J. has recommenced work on <i>W. in P.</i> The de luxe edition by ? soon to come out &mdash; about the old lady A.L.P., I think. Another about the City (<i>H.C.E.</i> building Dublin). Five volumes of the Encyclopedia Brit. on his sofa. He has made a list of 30 towns, New York, Vienna, Budapest, etc. Mrs Fleischmann has read out the articles on some of these. I &ldquo;finish&rdquo; Vienna and read Christiania and Budapest, etc. When ever I come to a name (of a street, suburb, park, etc.) I pause. J. thinks. If he can Anglicise the the word, i.e. make a pun on it, Mrs F. records the name or its deformation in the notebook. Thus &ldquo;Slotspark&rdquo; (I think) at Christiania becomes Sluts&apos; park. He collects all queer names, in this way and will soon have anotebook full of them &hellip; He is curled on his sofa, while I struggle with Danish or Rumanian names, pondering puns. </div>
