<div class="nbunit" id="17Jan1939"><font color="red">17 January 1939</font> <i>NLFF</i> (from Richard de la Mere to Paul L&eacute;on): I have to acknowledge your two letters of the 14th and of the 16th of January, with which you returned to me for press three further quires of the page proofs. Our printers &hellip; found those additional corrections for the last galleys, which you have sent me from time to time, most troublesome. To tell you the truth, I think they are reaching the end of their tether &mdash; they have had an appalling job getting through all these revised proofs at such high speed, and they have only done so by working constant overtime at night &hellip;with regard to the title-page: I am sending you first proofs with this letter &hellip; a preliminary proof of the jacket of the book within a day or two &hellip; The price &hellip; is 25/- &hellip; not before April &hellip; I have no suggestion to make in explanation of the enquiries you have been getting for the words of <i>Tim Finnegan&apos;s Wake</i> &mdash; I am quite sure that no-one outside this office, except our printer, yet knows of the title, and I have not yet told Mr Huebsch. P.S. Our printers found it quite impossible to change the style of the dialogue in the way you had suggested, because at the time you wrote all the earlier pages of the book had been printed and to have changed the style of the latter pages would have overrun the text right to the end of the part that was then made up, which would not only have been prohibitively expensive &hellip; this is a point that should have been raised at the time the galley proofs were sent to me </div>
