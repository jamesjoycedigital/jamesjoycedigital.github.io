<div class="nbunit" id="hw24May1938"><font color="red">24 May 1938</font> <i>NLHW</i> (from Harriet Weaver to Paul L&eacute;on): Not knowing of anyone to whom I could entrust the corrections of the new fragment of <i>W.i.P.</i> in <i>Transition</i> I have been through it myself as carefully as I could, letter by letter, comparing it with the latest corrected typescript sent to me, together with the only three pages of corrected proofs sent. I have made in the two copies of <i>transition</i> sent by Mrs Jolas what corrections I found and am posting one of these to Mr Joyce today. In several cases insertions had been made in the wrong places, upsetting the sequence of the sentences. These were the worst errors I found, though there were also several &ldquo;literals&rdquo;, as the printers say. </div>
