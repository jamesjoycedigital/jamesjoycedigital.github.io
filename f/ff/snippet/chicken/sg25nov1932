Lucanhof.&rdquo;] it comes between the words &ldquo;stop&rdquo; [and the paragraph beginning &ldquo;Was he Pitssched&rdquo;. <br>Also in this same paragraph after the words &ldquo;Was he&rdquo;; please insert &ldquo;as certain have dognosed of him&rdquo; and in the sentence which ends with the words &ldquo;Clio&apos;s clippings&rdquo; insert at a suitable place the words &ldquo;as might occur to anyone&rdquo;. This brings the piece down to the unfinished sentence ending with the words &ldquo;Our river&rdquo; [255.11] I hope to finish it tomorrow and to add another paragraph which will link up the final two pages. After which may the devil take me and it. </div>
