<div class="nbunit" id="a3Jan1933"><font color="red">3 January 1933</font> <i>NLPK</i> (from Paul L&eacute;on to J. Ralph Pinker): I am also enclosing the final proofs of the new fragment of which I am sending a copy to Mr Morley as he requested me to do so &hellip; I have heard nothing from the Servire Press for the moment, have you? &hellip; Please kindly note that two of your copies of proofs are corrected. The copy I sent to Messrs Faber and Faber is not. Will you please therefore communicate to them the corrected text as in your possession should they decide on a publication. </div>
