<div class="nbunit" id="edn44">  44  The coins are variously described, as &lsquo;bisons&rsquo; (nickels), &lsquo;trink gelt&rsquo; (trinkets, gold), &lsquo;sylvan coyne&rsquo; (slivers of wood, silver coin), &lsquo;piece of oak&rsquo; (wood, piece-of-eight), and &lsquo;ghinees&rsquo; (guineas). When Jute tells Mutt that &lsquo;Ghinees his good for you&rsquo; (Guinness is good for you), he associates the coins with drink, a big issue in their next encounter.  </div>
