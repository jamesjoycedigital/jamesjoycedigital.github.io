<div class="nbunit" id="ff16Jun1938"><font color="red">16 June 1938</font> <i>NLFF</i> (from Richard de la Mere to Paul L&eacute;on): Our printers have written to us in some uncertainty about the corrections that have to be made in galleys 14 to 17 &hellip; They write &hellip; &ldquo;&hellip; the corrections on slips 15, 16 and 17 were so complicated that we were sent a typescript in addition to the corrected proof for final checking purposes. We have finished the correction of these slips and on checking them up with the typescript we were surprised to find that there are a considerable number of differences. We enclose herewith slips 15A, 16A and 17A. The letterpress shows the galleys with all the corrections carried out on the type. The manuscript corrections in black ink show the discrepancies between these corrected galleys and the typescript. Would you very kindly settle which of these corrections are to be carried out as it would obviously be dangerous for us to continue with the paging beyond this point if the missing sentences are to be inserted. The paragraphs are so terribly long that the amount of over-running which is caused by each addition is simply appalling.&rdquo; I am sending you the original corrected galleys, also that new typescript of them that you sent me later, and thirdly, the revised galleys showing the queries that the printers raise in consequence of inconsistencies between the two sets of corrections &hellip; consult Mr Joyce about this. </div>
