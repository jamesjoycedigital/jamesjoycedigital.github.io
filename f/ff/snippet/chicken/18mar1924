Lest the envelope open or be opened I shall send them registered &hellip; There is a review in the Literary Supplement of New York Times of a book on me by Mr Herbert Gorham, I think. There is also an essay in a book called <i>On Strange Altars</i> &hellip; Now that those two riverines are sound asleep I shall go out for a few minutes&apos; walk. </div>
