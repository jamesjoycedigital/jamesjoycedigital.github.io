Before you go can you make the few more changes enclosed [long list follows, mostly from N18 (VI.B.8) pp. 21-36] and also order that interesting book [<i>Queer Fish</i>] for me. Will you leave <font face="wake">A</font> with Miss Moschos in case I think of anything else? &hellip; Did you send Criterion to Pound and Larbaud &hellip;  </div>
