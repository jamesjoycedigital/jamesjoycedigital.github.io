But this morning I started off afresh. I am putting the piece in the place of honour, namely the first pages of the book. Will try to deliver same punctual by Xmas. But cd send sample, viz. page 1, if customer so desires. The book really has no beginning or end. (Trade secret, registered at Stationers Hall) It ends in the middle of a sentence and begins in the middle of the same sentence. Your piece is the prelude to the <i>Contact</i> piece which is continued by the manuscript you have, the <i>Criterion</i>, <i>This Quarter</i> and <i>Navire d&apos;Argent</i> where the first part of the book ends. The third part you have also <b><font face="wake">D</font></b>abcd. I have written only  a small part of the second ending with Roderick O&apos;C. The fourth will be shorter than the others &hellip; I gave <b><font face="wake">D</font></b>abcd to [Lewis] Galanti&egrave;re to sell in the U.S.A. &hellip; Pound &hellip; asked me to send him <b><font face="wake">D</font></b>abcd to read &hellip; You may perhaps see me disguised as an Italian organist grinding out this prosepoem under you window maugre the prohibition on the corner &hellip; respeakfolly yours / M.M. Inkpen &amp; Paperasses / (Writers to the Signet) </div>
