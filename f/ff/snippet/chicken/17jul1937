<div class="nbunit" id="17Jul1937"><font color="red">17 July 1937</font> <i>NLCV</i> (from Paul L&eacute;on to Viscount Carlow): The letter just received &hellip; disquietens me as both the corrected proofs and the number of Transition have been returned a good month ago. I sent them myself: the corrections by letter post, the Transition number by printed matter. </div>
