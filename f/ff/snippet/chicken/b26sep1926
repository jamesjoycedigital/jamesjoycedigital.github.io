Please let me know what you think of it, when read? The <i>Dial</i> proposed to delete one third of <b><font face="wake">D</font></b>abcd! Lewis, it seems, has been to Paris and asked for the MS and is coming here as he wants to see me. &lsquo;And I have done with you too, Mrs Delta&rsquo; &mdash; for the moment. She will babble anon. </div>
