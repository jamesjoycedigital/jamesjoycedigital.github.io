<div class="nbunit" id="edn28">  28  ALP's sack is also a mailbag, since it contains the Boston Letter <big><font face="wake">N</font></big> (about which we are later to read much). We can already make out its principal elements: Father Michael, a lovely present of cakes, Maggy, and, at 9.33 (11.27), the crosses listed in signing off: &lsquo;With Kiss. Kiss Criss. Cross Criss. Kiss Cross.&rsquo; The I.1 version ends &lsquo;Slain.&rsquo; That is, <i>sl&acute;n</i> (Irish, goodbye) and stain (the tea-stain of 88.30 [111.20]). We learn in chapter I.8 that ALP's sack and lamp have been borrowed from her postman son Shaun.  </div>
