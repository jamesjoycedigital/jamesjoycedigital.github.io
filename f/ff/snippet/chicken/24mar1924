I am very glad you like Anna Livia &hellip; All Pandora&apos;s gifts are not maladies. Shaun&apos;s map: for this see any postage stamp of the Irish Free State. It is a philatelic curiosity. A territorial stamp it includes the territory of another state, Northern Ireland. In making notes I used signs for the various characters. It may amuse you to see them so I shall write them on the back of this. I have been very busy revising over and over the proofs of the four old men, <i>Mamalujo</i>. It comes out this week. They have now taken a lamp out of my room &hellip; Shaun is going to give me a very great deal of trouble. / <b><font face="wake">H</font></b> (Earwicker, H C E by moving letter round) / <b><font face="wake">A</font></b> Anna Livia / <b><font face="wake">C</font></b> Shem-Cain / <b><font face="wake">D</font></b> Shaun / <b><font face="wake">W</font></b> Snake / <b><font face="wake">P</font></b> S.
