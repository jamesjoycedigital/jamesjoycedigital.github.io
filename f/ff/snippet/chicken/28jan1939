The person who is in charge of the book there is Mr de la Mare. The book is to be sent from the Glasgow printers or binders on Monday (29 January 1939) &hellip; I am still very exhausted but will try to be better by Thursday &hellip; Incidentally you will discover the title of the book which my wife has kept secret for seventeen years, being the only one who knew it </div>
