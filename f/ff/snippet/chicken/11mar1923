I am sure you are blaming me for my cowardice and procrastination &hellip; my sight has slowly improved &hellip; Yesterday I wrote two pages &mdash; the first I have written since the final <i>Yes</i> of Ulysses. Having found a pen with some difficulty I copied them out in a large handwriting on a double sheet of foolscap so that I could read them. </div>
