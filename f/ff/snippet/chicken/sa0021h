Once upon a time a king named Shahryar, on learning that his first wife was unfaithful to him, chose to marry a fresh virgin each day, as well as to behead the previous day&apos;s wife, so that she would have no opportunity to be unfaithful. The 1001st virgin encountered in this murderous way was Shahrazad, the extraordinarily literate, erudite and beautiful daughter of the grand vizier. Against her father&apos;s wishes, she schemed to spend one night with the king, and, once in his chambers, asked if she might bid a last farewell to her sister, Dunyazade (Donyazad), who had secretly been prepared to ask Shahrazad to tell a story during the long night. The king lay awake and listened as Scheherazade told her first story. The night passed by, and Scheherazade stopped in the middle. The king asked her to finish, but Scheherazade said that she could not, as dawn was breaking. AT this, the king spared her life for a day so she could finish the story the folllowing night. That night, Shahrazad finished the first story and then began a second, even more exciting tale, which she again stopped halfway through on the day dawning. And once again the king spared her life for another day so that she could finish the second story. Annd so it continued, without seam, for 1,001 nights, and 1,000 stories. Over the course of the tale-telling, the king had fallen in love with Shahrazad, and, in the end, he took her as wife. And they all lived happily thereafter. </mm> </dd></dl>
