<div class="nbunit" id="4Jan1938"><font color="red">4 January 1938</font> <i>NLVP</i> (from Paul L&eacute;on to Ben Huebsch): But the date of publication is a matter of grave concern to him. He has been working on his book now for the last six months with a tremendous energy keeping awake working till five, six or even seven o&apos;clock in the morning in order that it be brought out this summer &hellip; fourth of july &hellip; Technically the matter stands thus. The book is to consist of four parts. Three large ones and an Epilogue which is at the same time a Prologue. Parts I and III have been here in galleys corrected and all the additions made by Mr Joyce, the text itself being verified by two expert proofreaders. They will go back to the London publishers within the next few days, after which the proofs in page will come and be revised quickly. Whatever additions and corrections there might be will neither be numerous nor important in size. Some three fourths of Part II are in London being printed on galleys and we shall probably receive these very soon. The last portion of Part II is being worked on by Mr Joyce at top speed. Would you therefore let Mr Joyce know by <i>return mail</i> what would be the latest date for you to receive the galleys in New York for the book to come out on the date desired. </div>
