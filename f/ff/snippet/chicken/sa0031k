He could not tell one tune from another, but he loved to talk of that &ldquo;<mark>scarlet thing of Dvorak</mark>,&rdquo; hoping in this way to be accepted as a real critic of music, when he knew nothing about it and cared even less. His eulogies of music and painting betrayed him continually though he did not know it. <small> George Bernard Shaw, &ldquo;Memories of Oscar Wilde&rdquo; in Frank Harris, <a name="GBSM" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#GBSM"><cite title="source">Oscar Wilde</cite></a> (New York, 1918) 20</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
