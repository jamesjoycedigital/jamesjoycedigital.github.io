Needless to say, the production will be a slow task. Besides, in order to secure adequate distribution and to play the work up in all its importance, our travellers, who set out early in June, would require dummies, i.e., specimens of binding with title page, contents and some pages of text. We would want a month or more in which to plan and produce these dummies, hence we should be fully informed during April of the prospects. </div>
