And I will not send it back to the printer as I do not trust his brains. So I wrote for Ford&apos;s secretary to come round. No reply. It is grotesque, I think. And I was promised a proof a fortnight ago and told I could revise it twice and tomorrow will be the 1 March &hellip; P.S. It&apos;s all right &hellip; My piece is put off till April so I shall have time to repair the breakages. </div>
