The Italian libretto was written by Francesco Maria Piave based on Victor Hugo&apos;s play <i>Le roi s&apos;amuse</i>. In the face of initial problems with the Austrian censors who had control over northern Italian theatres at the time, the opera had a triumphant premiere at La Fenice in Venice on 11 March 1851. <br>The opera is considered by many to be the first of the masterpieces of Verdi&apos;s middle-to-late career. Its tragic story revolves around the licentious Duke of Mantua, his hunch-backed court jester Rigoletto, and Rigoletto&apos;s beautiful daughter Gilda. The opera&apos;s original title, <i>La maledizione</i> (&ldquo;The Curse&rdquo;), refers to the curse laid on the Duke and on Rigoletto by a courtier whose daughter had been seduced by the Duke with Rigoletto&apos;s encouragement. The curse works when Gilda falls in love with the Duke, and ultimately sacrifices her life to save him from the assassins hired by Rigoletto. </mm> </dd></dl>
