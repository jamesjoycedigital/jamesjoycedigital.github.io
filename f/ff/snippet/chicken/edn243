<div class="nbunit" id="edn243">  243  The book seems to be Oscar Wilde's <cite>Salome</cite>, illustrated by Aubrey Beardsley, though HCE confuses it with other books: <cite>The Arabian Nights</cite>, for example. He identifies himself with Herod, Issy with Salome, and his detractor(s) with the John the Baptist. At another level the book may be no more than a tattered copy of <cite>Titbits</cite> (perhaps the one Leopold Bloom perused and misused in <cite>Ulysses</cite>), some pages of which he is glancing at prior to using them as toilet-paper. In conformity with the Middle Eastern theme the text at this point is heavily impregnated with words in the Farsi (Persian) language. See in this connection Bernard Benstock, <cite>Phil. Quart</cite>. 44 (1965) 100-109, and Danis Rose, <cite>AWN</cite> 12 (1975) 12. HCE's praise is taken almost verbatim from the &lsquo;Approbations&rsquo; in Kinane's <cite>Saint Patrick: His Life &amp;c.</cite>  </div>
