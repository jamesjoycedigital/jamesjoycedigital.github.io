<div class="nbunit" id="edn101">  101  The accused speaks &lsquo;in the vermicular.&rsquo; Joyce may have in mind a parody of a trial he expressed interest in, of a namesake, Myles Joyce, in Irish, Maolra Seoigh, a hirsute native of Galway who was convicted of the murder of five persons (all members of the same family, also called Joyce) in the townland of Maamtrasna on the Galway-Mayo border. Two of his co-accused admitted their guilt, but insisted Myles was innocent of any involvement. Their admissions, however, were deemed insufficient to revoke the execution order. </p><p> The trial was troubling. Myles was a native Irish speaker, speaking not a word of English, the language in which his trial was conducted. No interpreter was admitted and his evidence in his defence was accordingly unheard. Moreover, alleged witnesses in the case were awarded compensation under the direction of the Lord Lieutenant. Myles, alongside his alleged fellow conspirators, was hanged by the British authorities in December of 1882 (James Joyce's birth-year). Two of his co-accused admitted their guilt but insisted Myles was innocent of any involvement. Their admissions, however, were deemed insufficient to revoke the execution order. </p><p> Redress was long delayed but on 4 April 2018 the unfortunate man was granted a posthumous pardon by the President of Ireland, Michael D. Higgins. Descendants of both the murdered men and the hanged man attended a special ceremony at &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in (formerly the Lord Lieutenant's residence) in the Phoenix Park.  </div>
