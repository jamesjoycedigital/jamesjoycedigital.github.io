<div class="nbunit" id="28Apr1930"><font color="red">28 April 1930</font> (Stuart Gilbert diary): Two months [since last entry] &hellip; At the beginning of the month J.J. went first to Zurich then to Wiesbaden to &ldquo;see&rdquo; oculists. (Not back yet, I think) &hellip; For the latest fragment <i>Haveth Childers Everywhere</i>, J.J. had as volunteer workers Colum, L&eacute;on (a Russian lawyer) &hellip; and in  less degree myself &hellip; Copenhagen, Budapest, Oslo, Rio I read to him. Unfortunately he made the entries in his black notebook himself and when he wanted to use them, the reader found them illegible.
