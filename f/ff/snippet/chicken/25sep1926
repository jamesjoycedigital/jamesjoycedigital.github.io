<div class="nbunit" id="25Sep1926"><font color="red">25? September 1926</font> <i>Beach Letters</i> (to Sylvia Beach): All safely arrived. Thanks. Here are three copies, for you, for Lewis and my own (all of them initialled) I have not corrected it. Perhaps if you have time these next days and are reading the piece again you could do it as it strains my eyes. Goodbye now, Geometry! </div>
