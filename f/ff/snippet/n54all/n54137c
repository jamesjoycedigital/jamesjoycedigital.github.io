These districts stand in clear contrast to the strongly manorialised southern counties and they were not feudalised to any appreciable extent before the Norman conquest. When that system was imposed we often find single knight&apos;s fees having to be taken over by entire communities of sokemen. The &lsquo;<mark>holds</mark>&rsquo; of Northumbria, who rank next after the <mark>earls</mark>, and the &lsquo;drengs&rsquo; of Cumberland, Westmorland, Lancashire, Northumberland and Durham, are also of Scandinavian origin. The &lsquo;dreng&rsquo; was &lsquo;a free servant of the king endowed with lands&lsquo; and the name still survives in the Yorkshire place-name Dringhouses. <small> Allen Mawers, <a name="VIK2" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#VIK2"><cite title="source">The Vikings</cite></a> (1913) 135-6</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: Hold: in OE times, an officer of rank in the Danelaw, corresponding to the High Reeve of the English.
