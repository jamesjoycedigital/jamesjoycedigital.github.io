Thou comest forth in loveliness. The stars attend thy blue course in the east. The clouds rejoice in thy presence, O moon! &hellip; But thou thyself shalt fail one night; and <mark>leave thy blue path in heaven</mark>. The stars will then lift their heads: they, who were ashamed in thy presence, will rejoice. Thou art now clothed with thy brightness. Look from thy gates in the sky. <small> James MacPherson, <a name="JMPO2" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#JMPO2"><cite title="source">The Poems of Ossian</cite></a> (1806), Vol. II, <font size="-1">DAR-THULA</font>, 121</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
