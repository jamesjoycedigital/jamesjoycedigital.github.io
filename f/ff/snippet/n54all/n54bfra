Not only have we the evidence given above but also the very names &lsquo;Rus&rsquo; and &lsquo;Varangian&rsquo; can be satisfactorily explained only on this theory. The name &lsquo;Rus&rsquo; is the Slavonic, &lsquo;<mark>Rh&ocirc;s</mark>&rsquo; the Greek, and &lsquo;R&ucirc;s&rsquo; the Arabic form of the Finnish name for Sweden, viz. <mark>Ruotsi</mark>. This name was originally derived from Ro&thorn;r or Ro&thorn;in, the name of certain districts of Upland and &Ouml;sterg&ouml;tland, whose inhabitants were known as Rods-karlar or Rods-m&oelig;n. <small> Allen Mawers, <a name="VIK2" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#VIK2"><cite title="source">The Vikings</cite></a> (1913) 77</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: See also <a name="n14149b" href="n14all.htm#n14149b">N14 (VI.B.7):149(b)</a>. </mm> </dd></dl>
