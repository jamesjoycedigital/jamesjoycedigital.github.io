This balance between animal and vegetable life is well illustrated by the <mark>Vivaria</mark>, now so common, in which small water-animals and water-plants grow in a globe shut off from the air; the carbon contained in the carbonic acid evolved by the animals is set free by the plants, and is just sufficient for their growth, whilst the oxygen at the same time liberated serves for the respiration of the animals. <small> H.
