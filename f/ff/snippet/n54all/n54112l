She left <mark>the hall of her secret sigh</mark>! She came in all her beauty, like the moon from the cloud of the east. Loveliness was around her as light. Her steps were the music of songs.

Her blue eye rolled on him in secret: she blest the chief of resounding Morven. <small> James MacPherson, <a name="JMPO2" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#JMPO2"><cite title="source">The Poems of Ossian</cite></a> (1806), Vol. II, <font size="-1">FINGAL</font> Book III, 45</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
