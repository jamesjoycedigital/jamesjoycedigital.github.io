Later observations by Eduard Heis and Friedrich Wilhelm Argelander reinforced Fritsch&apos;s initial suspicions and attracted attention to the star. Hans Ludendorff, however, was the first to study it in great detail. His work revealed that the system was an eclipsing binary variable, a star that dims when its partner obscures its light.</mm> </dd></dl>
