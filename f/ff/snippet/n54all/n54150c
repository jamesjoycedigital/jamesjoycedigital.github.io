Each player in this game has what are called three &ldquo;lives,&rdquo; or chances. When the company is seated in a circle, the first player mentions a letter as the beginning of a word. The game is for each of the company, in turn, to add a letter to it, keeping the word unfinished as long as possible. When a letter is added to the former letters and it makes a complete word, the person who completed it loses a &ldquo;life.&rdquo; The next player then begins again. </mm> </dd></dl>
