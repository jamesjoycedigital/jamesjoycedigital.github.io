Earl Sigurd pacified popular clamour by saying that the king had made the sign of the hammer and consecrated the cup to Thor. The next day the king would not eat the horse-flesh used in their offerings nor drink the blood from it: the people were angry and the king compromised by <mark>inhaling the steam from the offering through a linen cloth</mark> placed over the sacrificial kettle, but no one was satisfied and at the next winter-feast the king had to eat some bits of horse-liver and to drink crossless all the cups of memory. <small> Allen Mawers, <a name="VIK2" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#VIK2"><cite title="source">The Vikings</cite></a> (1913) 88</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
