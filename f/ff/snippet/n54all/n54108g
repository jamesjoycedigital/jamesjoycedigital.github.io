Mohammed, crouching within, blessed the pigeons, which had been of such service to him. To this day the birds are regarded as sacred in the territory of Meccah; flocks of them are always to be seen around the Kaabah, and <mark>no one would ever think of hurting them</mark>. <small> Edith Holland, <a name="EHSM" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#EHSM"><cite title="source">The Story of Mohammed</cite></a> (1914) 82-83</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
