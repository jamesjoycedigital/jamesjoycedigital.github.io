She saw, fell in love, and fled with Nathos; but, a storm rising at sea, they were unfortunately driven back on that part of the coast of Ulster where Cairtbar was encamped with his army. The three brothers <font color="green">[Nathos, Althos, and Ardan]</font>, after having defended themselves for some time with great bravery, were overpowered and slain, and the unfortunate Dar-thula killed herself upon the body of her beloved Nathos. <small> James MacPherson, <a name="JMPO2" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#JMPO2"><cite title="source">The Poems of Ossian</cite></a> (1806), Vol. II, <font size="-1">DAR-THULA</font>, 120</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
