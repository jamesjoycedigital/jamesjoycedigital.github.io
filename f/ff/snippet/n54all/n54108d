The side of Mount Thaur is rocky and precipitous, and must have been difficult to climb in the darkness; but those who are flying for their lives are not easily hindered, and the Prophet and his companion accomplished the ascent in safety. Near the summit of Mount Thaur is a deep cave with a very narrow entrance, and here the fugitives took shelter. <small> Edith Holland, <a name="EHSM" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#EHSM"><cite title="source">The Story of Mohammed</cite></a> (1914) 81</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
