He lies forgot on earth; the hall of shells is silent. Sad is the spouse of Crugal! <mark>She is a stranger in the hall of her grief</mark>. But who is she that, like a sun-beam, flies before the ranks of the foe? It is Dagrena, lovely fair, the spouse of the fallen Crugal. Her hair is on the wind behind. Her eye is red; her voice is shrill. Pale, empty is thy Crugal now! His form is in the cave of the hill.&rdquo; <br>32n: Crugal had married Dagrena but a little time before the battle. <small> James MacPherson, <a name="JMPO2" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#JMPO2"><cite title="source">The Poems of Ossian</cite></a> (1806), Vol. II, <font size="-1">FINGAL</font> Book II, 31f</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
