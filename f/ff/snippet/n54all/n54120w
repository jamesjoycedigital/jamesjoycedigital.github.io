Equally, of Master Kung&apos;s offspring little is recorded. He had one son, whose birth was acknowledged by the Duke of Lu with the present of a carp, a symbol of courage and achievement. Impressed by this gift of a fish, Master Kung named the infant <mark>Carp Primus</mark>, anticipating other sons who would in turn be called Carp Secundus, Carp Tertius, and so on, as the lineage lengthened. But Carp Primus was fated to the sole Carp. The little lad was said to have related of his father, later on, how he had given him no special lessons as a child, only those in the rules of propriety.]</font> <small> Carl Crow, <a name="CCMK" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#CCMK"><cite title="source">Master Kung.
