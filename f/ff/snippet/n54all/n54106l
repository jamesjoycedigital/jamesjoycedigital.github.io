Looking backward, the prospect is desolate in the extreme, but, where the road descends on the other side of the mountain chain, a very different picture meets the eye. Several streams flow from the summit of Mount Korah, fertilizing the lower ground, and here large sycamores, springing up between the granite rocks, give a pleasant shade, while figs, vines, apricots, peaches and pomegranates grow in abundance. <small> Edith Holland, <a name="EHSM" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#EHSM"><cite title="source">The Story of Mohammed</cite></a> (1914) 67</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
