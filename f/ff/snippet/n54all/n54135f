It was usually oval in shape and the concave surface was covered with a framework of knobs and connecting bands, which divided it into a series of &lsquo;fields&rsquo; (to use a heraldic term), which could themselves be decorated with the characteristic ornamentation of the period. The commonest form of oval brooch was that with nine knobs on a single plate, but in the later examples the plate is often doubled. The brooches themselves were of bronze, the knobs usually of silver with silver wire along the edge of the brooch. These knobs have now often disappeared and the bronze has become dull with verdigris, so that it is difficult to form an idea of their original magnificence. The oval brooches were used to fasten the outer mantle and were usually worn in pairs, either on the breast or on the shoulders, and examples of them have been found from Russia in the East to Ireland on the West. Other types of brooch are also found&mdash;straight-armed, <mark>trilobed</mark> and round. Such brooches were often worn in the middle of the bosom a little below the oval ones. <small> Allen Mawers, <a name="VIK2" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#VIK2"><cite title="source">The Vikings</cite></a> (1913) 105</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
