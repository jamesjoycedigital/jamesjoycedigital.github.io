At this zenith, the husband sought a divorce. Shortly before this, he slept with a concubine. She gave birth to the desired male, but he was sickly and crippled. Kung, now seventy years old, was bitterly disappointed, but after some delicate negotiations he took to wife the fifteen-year old daughter of a friend, with better bearing prospects. </mm> </dd></dl>
