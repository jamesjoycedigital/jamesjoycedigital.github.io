Smiling, on its own blue wave, Reldurath half-sinks its western light. The red eye of Berthin looks, through a grove, on the hunter, as he returns, by night, with the spoils of the bounding roe. Wide, in the midst, arose the cloudless beams of Tonth&eacute;na, that star which looked by night on the course of the sea-tossed Larthon: Larthon ,the first of Bolga&apos;s race, who travelled on the wind. <small> James MacPherson, <a name="JMPO2" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#JMPO2"><cite title="source">The Poems of Ossian</cite></a> (1806), Vol. II, <font size="-1">TEMORA</font> Book VII, 281f</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
