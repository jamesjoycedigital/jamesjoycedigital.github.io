Melissus, king of Crete, had two daughters Amalthea and Melissa who fed the infant Jupiter with goat&apos;s milk and honey. Some say that the name of the goat was Amalthea, and feign that when she was dead Jupiter flayed her and made his Aegis of her skin. Jupiter afterwards made her a star and gave one of her horns to his two nurses; imparting to it this virtue: that the horn should supply every thing they wished for.</mm> </dd></dl>
