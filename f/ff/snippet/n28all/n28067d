The battles, which were attended by men of the first quality, youths with more money than brains, and a concourse of the city rabble, usually began at noon. The greatest excitement was felt by all witnesses, and the betting generally ran for about forty guineas a battle, and five hundred guineas for the main, or odd battle; but at times thousands of guineas changed hands in consequence of the triumph or defeat of a cock. <small> J.
