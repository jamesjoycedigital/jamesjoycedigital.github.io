The host was a King and his guests were Kings. The place selected for the entertainment was a little outside the Dublin of that period, though now in the centre of the metropolis, College Green. When <mark>King Henry the Second</mark> issued his invitations he had first to erect a place of reception; so he ordered to be built a Royal Palace constructed of peeled osiers, and it grew into being by royal direction close to the Church of St. Andrew, at that time somewhat nearer the Castle than the present sacred edifice which bears that name. The company invited were the numerous chieftains or <mark>Kings</mark> of Ireland, and never before, we may be sure, had these monarchs feasted so well, though perhaps accustomed to do so more wisely, for tradition, if not history, tells us that the act of friendly hospitality accepted by them, resulted in <mark>oaths</mark> of allegiance to their host. Be that as it may, they enjoyed themselves hugely, notwithstanding that one half the party understood not the language of the other. <small> A.
