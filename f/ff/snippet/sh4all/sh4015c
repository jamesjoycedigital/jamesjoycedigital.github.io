Capt &amp; Kersse the tailor / (he enters 3 times) </h4><mm class="note">Note: This is a reference to McCann&apos;s story, a favourite of John Joyce&apos;s, of a hunchbacked Norwegian captain who ordered a suit from a Dublin tailor, J.H. Kerse of 34 Upper Sackville Street. The finished suit did not fit the sailor, and he berated the tailor for being unable to sew, whereupon the tailor denounced him for being impossible to fit. The story forms one of the principal motifs of the opening section of II.3. </mm> <mm class="note">Original notebook: <a name="n22021b" href="n22all.htm#n22021b">N22 (VI.B.17):021(b)</a> </dd> </dd></dl>
