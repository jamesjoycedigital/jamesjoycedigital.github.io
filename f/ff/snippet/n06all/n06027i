Kirby, who was sitting by the fire, his pistols on a table beside him, sprang to his feet, and seizing them, cried, &ldquo;At any rate, I&apos;ll have the life of one of them before I&apos;m taken.&rdquo; &ldquo;Whisht! you fool,&rdquo; said his mother. &ldquo;Here, be quick! put on Mary&apos;s cap, take your pistols with you, jump into bed, turn your face to the wall, and lave the rest to me.&rdquo; <p>He was scarcely in bed when there was a loud knocking at the door, which his mother, having <mark>lit a rush</mark>, opened as quickly as possible. In came Major Vokes and the constables. &ldquo;Where is your son?&rdquo; said Vokes. &ldquo;Plaze God, he&apos;s far enough from ye. It&apos;s welcome yez are this night,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And thanks to the Lord it wasn&apos;t yesterday ye came, for it&apos;s me and Mary <i>there</i> that strove to make him stop the night wid us; but, thank God, he was afraid.&rdquo; They searched the house, but did not like to disturb the young girl in bed, and finding nothing, went, sadly disappointed, back to Limerick. The news of Kirby&apos;s escape soon spread through the country. Vokes was much chaffed, but Kirby never slept another night in his mother&apos;s house.</p> <small> Alfred Perceval Graves, <a name="ILMS2" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#ILMS2"><cite title="source">Irish Literary and Musical Studies</cite></a>, (1913) 67</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
