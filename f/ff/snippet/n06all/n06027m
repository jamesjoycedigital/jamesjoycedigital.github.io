This taste for the supernatural seems to have grown upon him after his wife&apos;s death, and influenced him so deeply that, had he not been possessed of a deal of shrewd common sense, there might have been danger of his embracing some of the visionary doctrines in which he was so learned. But no! even Spiritualism, to which not a few of his brother novelists succumbed, whilst affording congenial material for our artist of the superhuman to work upon, did not escape his severest satire. <small> Alfred Perceval Graves, <a name="ILMS2" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#ILMS2"><cite title="source">Irish Literary and Musical Studies</cite></a>, (1913) 69</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
