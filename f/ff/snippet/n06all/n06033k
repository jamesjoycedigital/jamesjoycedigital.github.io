In this latter office, like Charles Lamb, in whose &ldquo;dry drollery&rdquo; he took a congenial delight, he was a late-comer if not an early-goer, varying in his moods between long spells of dejected silence and brief outbursts of what Mitchell well describes as &ldquo;fictitious jollity.&rdquo; For although then more comfortably off than he had ever been, and in the midst of considerate friends, his will was becoming gradually weakened by some form of stimulant, to which he declares his wretched health and slavish work had first driven him. Was this stimulant opium, or &ldquo;<mark>red rum</mark>,&rdquo; or both? <small> Alfred Perceval Graves, <a name="ILMS2" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#ILMS2"><cite title="source">Irish Literary and Musical Studies</cite></a>, (1913) 27</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
