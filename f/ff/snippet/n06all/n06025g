On one of these, then, the parents placed the little girl Mary. And when they were putting off the clothes which they had worn on the journey, and were putting on, as was usual, others that were neater and cleaner, the virgin of the Lord, without the help of any one leading her or lifting her, and not looking back at all, went swiftly up all the steps one after the other, in such a manner that, in this respect at least, one would think that she had already attained full age. <small> James DeQincy Donehoo, <a name="APOCD" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#APOCD"><cite title="source">Les The Apocryphal Life of Christ</cite></a> (1903) 17</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
