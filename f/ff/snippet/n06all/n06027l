Sometimes, too, he was to be encountered in an old, out-of-the-way bookshop, poring over some rare black letter Astrology or Demonology. <small> Alfred Perceval Graves, <a name="ILMS2" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#ILMS2"><cite title="source">Irish Literary and Musical Studies</cite></a>, (1913) 68-9</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
