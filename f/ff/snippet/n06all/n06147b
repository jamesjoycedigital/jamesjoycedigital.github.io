It was stated by P.C. Sutton that he and another constable saw the three prisoners at the gate of the store. Hannon was pushing the gate with his shoulder and the others were standing by. When they saw witness they moved to a dark doorway. Whitely was carrying a fender. When witness asked where he got the fender one of the men said &ldquo;that is for you to find out.&rdquo; Whitely speaking from the dock, said they were only trying to open a bottle of stout by hammering it against the gate. <br> <i>Drawing a Cork</i> <br>The Lord Chief Justice (to the police witness) <br>&mdash; I suppose you know how to draw the cork out of a bottle of stout (a laugh). <br>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the witness. <br>The Lord Chief Justice: Was the sound you heard like trying to get the cork out of a bottle? <br>Witness: <mark>Nothing like it</mark> (laughter). <small> <a name="FJ21nov23" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#FJ21nov23"><cite title="source">Freeman's Journal</cite></a> (21 November 1923) 9/7</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
