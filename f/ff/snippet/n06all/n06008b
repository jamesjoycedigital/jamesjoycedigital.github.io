This moat is clearly artificial, and, if we are to credit tradition, has a <mark>&ldquo;house&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, a chamber</mark>, within it. It rises to a height of about 60 feet over the level of the adjoining street, and is 32 feet in di-ameter at top. As at Skirke, Portnascully, and elsewhere, it formed the cita-del and part of the ring of a large circular enclosure stretching to the west, and containing the buildings which formed the ancient residence. <small> William Carrigan, <a name="OSSO" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#OSSO"><cite title="source">History and Antiquities of the Diocese of Ossory</cite></a> (1905) [&lsquo;Kells&rsquo;] 52</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
