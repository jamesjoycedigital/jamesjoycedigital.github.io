GALWAY MURDER / Man Found Guilty of Manslaughter. / JUDGE AND POTEEN / At the Commission in Green-street Courthouse, Dublin, on Friday, before the Lord Chief Justice, a man named John Derrane was indicted for the willful murder of Barbara King, an old age pensioner over eighty years of age, on the 9th January last, in her house in Ballinakill, County Galway. Mr. Carrigan, K.C., for the Free State, said the prisoner lived in Ballinakill, in the same village as an old age pensioner named Barbara King, a widow, who had been bedridden since some time before January 9th, and who stopped with her daughter, a Mrs. Cloonan. On the evening in question, Mrs. Cloonan had to leave the house to go for milk. When on the way back home she met one of her children who was in an excited state. She went to the house and there saw the prisoner in the kitchen. The dresser was wrecked and a clock was broken, while the old woman lay bleeding on the ground. Mrs. Cloonan said to the accused, &ldquo;You have killed my mother.&rdquo; He ran at Mrs. Cloonan, caught her by the hair and threw her on the floor. She asked him, &ldquo;<mark>Do you know who is in it?</mark>&rdquo; and before Derrane had time to answer, she added, &ldquo;I will give you &pound;5 for whiskey.&rdquo; At the mention of whiskey Derrane became calm and left the place. <small> <a name="CT24nov23" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#CT24nov23"><cite title="source">Connacht Tribune</cite></a> (24 November 1923) 5/4</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
