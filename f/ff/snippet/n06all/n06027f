To quote William Le Fanu&apos;s account:&mdash;&ldquo;They appeared to be devoted to us. If we had been away for a month or two, on our return they met us in numbers some way from our home, took the horses from the carriage, and drew it to our house amid deafening cheers of welcome, and at night bonfires blazed on all the neighbouring hills. In all their troubles and difficulties the people came to my father for assistance. There was then no dispensary nor doctor near us, and many sick folk or their friends came daily to my mother for medicine and advice; I have often seen more than twenty with her of a morning. Our parish priest also was a special friend of ours, a constant visitor to our home. In the neighbouring parishes the same kindly relations existed between the priest and the flock and the Protestant clergyman. But in 1831 all this was suddenly and sadly changed, when the <mark>Tithe War</mark> came upon us.&rdquo; <small> Alfred Perceval Graves, <a name="ILMS2" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#ILMS2"><cite title="source">Irish Literary and Musical Studies</cite></a>, (1913) 63</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
