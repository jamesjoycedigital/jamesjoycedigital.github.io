And Zelomi said, &ldquo;Salome, Salome, I have a strange sight to relate to thee. A virgin hath brought forth, a thing of which nature admitteth not.&rdquo; But Salome said, &ldquo;As the Lord my God liveth, unless I thrust in my <mark>finger</mark>, and search the parts, I will not believe that a virgin hath brought forth.&rdquo; <br>And Salome went in, and said to Mary, &ldquo;Allow me to handle thee, and prove whether Zeiomi hath spoken the truth, for no small controversy hath arisen about thee.&rdquo; And Mary allowed her to handle her. And when she had withdrawn her hand from handling her, it dried up. And through excess of pain, Salome began to weep bitterly, and to be in great distress, crying out, and saying, &ldquo;Woe is me for my iniquity and unbelief, because I have tempted the living God; and, behold, my hand is dropping off as if burned with fire.&rdquo; <small> James DeQincy Donehoo, <a name="APOCD" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#APOCD"><cite title="source">Les The Apocryphal Life of Christ</cite></a> (1903) 55</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
