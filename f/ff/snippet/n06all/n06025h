And oftentimes also, they would bring her the fruits from the tree of life, that she might eat of them with cheerfulness. Nor did she eat as though nourishing a body, but only because of the necessities of her nature, lest she should die before her time. <small> James DeQincy Donehoo, <a name="APOCD" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#APOCD"><cite title="source">Les The Apocryphal Life of Christ</cite></a> (1903) 21</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
