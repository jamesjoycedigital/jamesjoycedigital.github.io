T. told me that he had planned out his <i><mark>Arthuriad</mark></i>, and could have written it all off without any trouble. But in 1842 he published, with other poems, the <i>Morte d&apos;Arthur</i>, which was one book of his Epic (though not really the eleventh), and the review in the <cite>Quarterly</cite> disheartened him, so that he put the scheme aside. He afterwards took it up again, but not as with the first inspiration. <small> Alfred Perceval Graves, <a name="ILMS2" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#ILMS2"><cite title="source">Irish Literary and Musical Studies</cite></a>, (1913) 88</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
