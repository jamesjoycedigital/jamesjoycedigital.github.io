Since then its remains have disappeared so completely that its exact site is now a matter of uncertainty. It may have stood either (<i>a</i>) in the small green field beside the ford, to the west of the road, where black earth, such as is always to be found on the sites of ancient graveyards, has been dug up, also old horse shoes &c.; or (<i>b</i>) on the very brink of the ford, where a forge till lately occupied the site of an ancient mound composed for a great part of <mark>black, graveyard earth</mark>, and removed about 1820; or&nbsp;(c) within the old <mark>&ldquo;raw&rdquo; (rath)</mark>, in the furze, about 20 perches east of the ford. <small> William Carrigan, <a name="OSSO" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#OSSO"><cite title="source">History and Antiquities of the Diocese of Ossory</cite></a> (1905) [&lsquo;Killossory&rsquo;] 51</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
