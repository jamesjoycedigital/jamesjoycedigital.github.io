Kilkenny, when using the native tongue, invariably call it <mark><i>K&aacute;nn&aacute;n&aacute;s</i></mark> (accent on first syllable), its original Irish form, beyond any doubt, is <mark>Ceanannus</mark> <font color="green">[in Irish script]</font>, which is also the Irish original of Kells in the Co. Meath. The name <font color="green">[Ceanannus]</font> signifies, according to O&apos;Donovan, the head seat or residence, and in this he is well borne out by the <cite>Four Mas-ters</cite>, whose Annals, under the year of the World, 3991, have the en-try:&mdash;&ldquo;&mdash;&ldquo;After Fiacha Finnailches had been twenty years in the sovereignty of Erin, he fell in the battle of Breagh, by Bearnghal, son of Gedhe Ollghothach. It was by Fiacha Finnailches that Dun-cuile-Sibrinne <i>i.e.</i>, Ceanannus <font color="green">[in Meath]</font> was erected. <i>Wherever his habitation was <font color="green">[placed]</font> Ceanannus was its name</i>.&rdquo; From this Dr. Joyce justly concludes that each of these structures, erected by King Fiacha for a residence, and designated in the first instance by the name of Ceanannus, was a <i>dun</i> or circular earthen fort. <small> William Carrigan, <a name="OSSO" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#OSSO"><cite title="source">History and Antiquities of the Diocese of Ossory</cite></a> (1905) [&lsquo;Kells&rsquo;] 51-2</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
