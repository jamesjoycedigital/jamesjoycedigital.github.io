And the priests remembered the child Mary, that she was of the family of David, and undefiled before God. And the officers went away and brought her. And they brought them into the <mark>temple</mark> of the Lord. And the priests said, &ldquo;Choose by lot who shall spin the gold, and the green, and the fine linen, and the silk, and the hyacinth, and the scarlet, and the true purple.&rdquo; And they cast lots among themselves what each virgin should do. And the true purple and the scarlet fell to the lot of Mary, And when Mary had got it, those virgins said to her, &ldquo;Since thou art the last, and humble, and younger than all, thou hast deserved to receive and obtain <mark>the purple and scarlet</mark>.&rdquo; And thus saying, as it were in words of annoyance, they began to call her queen of virgins. <small> James DeQincy Donehoo, <a name="APOCD" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#APOCD"><cite title="source">Les The Apocryphal Life of Christ</cite></a> (1903) 32</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c01097h" href="c01all.htm#c01097h">VI.C.01:097(h)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
