Ho, blessed one, come hither, and enter a cave wherein is a woman nigh to childbirth.&rdquo; And she said to him, &ldquo;Art thou of Israel?&rdquo; And he said to her, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; And she said, &ldquo;And who is it that is bringing forth in the cave?&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;A woman betrothed to me.&rdquo; And she said, &ldquo;Is she not thy wife?&rdquo; And he said to her, &ldquo;It is Mary that was reared in the temple of the Lord, and I obtained her by lot as my wife. And yet she is not my wife, but hath conceived of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; And the midwife said to him, &ldquo;Is this true?&rdquo; And Joseph said to her, &ldquo;Come, and thou shalt see.&rdquo; And the midwife Zelomi went away with Joseph. <br>And the twain, going, stood in the place of the cave, and, behold, <mark>a luminous cloud</mark> overshadowed it. Then Zelomi said, &ldquo;My soul hath been magnified this day, because mine eyes have seen strange things, and salvation hath been brought forth to Israel.&rdquo; And immediately the cloud disappeared from the cave, and a great light shone therein, more beautiful than the gleaming of lamps and candles, and more splendid than the light of the sun, so that the eyes could not bear it. But in a little while the light gradually decreased, until the infant which Mary had brought forth appeared unto Joseph, enwrapped in swaddling clothes, and sucking the breast of his mother, who was placed in a stall. <small> James DeQincy Donehoo, <a name="APOCD" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#APOCD"><cite title="source">Les The Apocryphal Life of Christ</cite></a> (1903) 54f.</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c01097k" href="c01all.htm#c01097k">VI.C.01:097(k)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
