The <cite>Protevangelium</cite> [otherwise, Protevangel or <mark>Protevangelion</mark>) of James is generally supposed to be the oldest of the Apocryphal Gospels of the Infancy, its only possible rival in this respect being the Thomas Gospel. It was certainly used by the compilers of all other Gospels of the Infancy, and its influence on all legends concerning this subject has been marked. The probability is that it was originally written in Greek, possibly by a Jewish convert to Christianity, and without special theological bias, although some have ascribed to it a Gnostic origin. It may be as old, in its original form, as the middle of the second century, but the present version does not date earlier than the fourth. Origen, at the end of the second century, mentions a Gospel of Peter or Book of James, which was probably, but not certainly, this work. The James of the title is usually referred to St. James the Less, the Lord&apos;s brother; the name <i>Protevangelium</i> is modern, and was first applied to the book by Postel, in 1552. </mm> </dd></dl>
