It was followed by the cholera, and by this, in the course of one of his numerous disappearances from all knowledge of his friends, Mangan was stricken. He recovered, and was too soon allowed to leave one of the temporary <mark>cholera-sheds at Kilmainham</mark> to which he had been removed; for collapse followed, and he was finally carried from a wretched cellar in Bride Street to the Meath Hospital, where he died seven days after admission. <small> Alfred Perceval Graves, <a name="ILMS2" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#ILMS2"><cite title="source">Irish Literary and Musical Studies</cite></a>, (1913) 30</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
