In evening walks at Ballyshannon he would hear the Irish girls at their cottage doors singing old ballads which he would pick up. If they were broken or incomplete he would add to them or finish them; if they were improper he would refine them. He could not get them sung till he got the Dublin Catnach of that day to print them on long <mark>strips of blue paper</mark>, like old songs; and if about the sea, with the old rough woodcut of a ship at the top. He either gave them away or they were sold in the neighbourhood. Then, in his evening walks, he had at last the pleasure of hearing some of his own ballads sung at the cottage doors by the crooning lasses, who were quite unaware that it was the author who was passing by. This is exactly what Oliver Goldsmith had done a century before, when a student of Trinity College, Dublin, though the lanes in which he listened to his ballads were very other from those at beautiful Ballyshannon. <small> Alfred Perceval Graves, <a name="ILMS2" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#ILMS2"><cite title="source">Irish Literary and Musical Studies</cite></a>, (1913) 76-7</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
