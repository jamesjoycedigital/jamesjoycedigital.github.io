His eye is inexpressibly deep and beautiful, his forehead unwrinkled and white. Pressed closely over his brows is <mark>a hat with such a quaint-shaped crown, such a high, wide-boated leaf</mark> as has rarely been seen off the stage; his little coat, tightly buttoned, is covered with a shabby cloak that once has been blue, the tightest to the form that can be imagined. He moves seemingly with pain&mdash;his last hour is not far off. <small> Alfred Perceval Graves, <a name="ILMS2" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#ILMS2"><cite title="source">Irish Literary and Musical Studies</cite></a>, (1913) 29</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
