To readers of the class to whom Mr. Gwynn has addressed his delightful <i><mark>Highways and Byways</mark> in Donegal and Antrim</i> this is doubtless true, but the beautiful ballad has reached the hearts of the Irish people, wedded to the haunting old air to which it is set. <small> Alfred Perceval Graves, <a name="ILMS2" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#ILMS2"><cite title="source">Irish Literary and Musical Studies</cite></a>, (1913) 78</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
