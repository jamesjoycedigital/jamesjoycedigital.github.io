He remembered the fair day at Kilkerrin. He met Festy King senr., and Festy King junr., while he was talking to them he heard a shot and saw O&apos;Donnell arrested. Crossexamined by Mr. Ward: Did you hear that Festy King was arrested? <br>&mdash; I did. <br>&mdash; Did you hear for what reason? <br>&mdash; No. <br>&mdash; Is it not a wonder you did not find out or look after your uncle? <br>&mdash; I had a bullock to look after (laughter). <br>Festy King deposed that he saw O&apos;Donnell arrested.
