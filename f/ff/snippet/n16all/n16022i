And yet (as I have seen and elsewhere described) a slender defenceless Redshank may forage amid the seaweed alongside his powerful companion without the least fear of being attacked. It is true that the Crow confines his attacks to nestlings and cripples albeit, considering the Crow&apos;s strength and opportunities of attack, it is remarkable with what amicableness the two species forage together to satisfy a common want. <small> C.J.
