The Greek could only advise &ldquo;Take off your clothes and be nice and natural.&rdquo; The Roman had no objection to watching a Greek exhibit himself, but he remained wrapped in his toga. The Greek, as Juvenal remarked, could turn himself into anything, changing even his sex, but the Roman felt he was a more stable type and was proud of his inadaptability. The <mark>toga</mark> does evolve a little: it becomes &lsquo;contabulated,&rdquo; it is true, but too soon it was the garment for official receptions&mdash;indeed many provincials only wore it at funerals. When something more active was required, you could always get into military dress. Augustus adopted that as his ordinary costume. A military court always feels that it is rather bad taste to be seen about <mark>in mufti</mark>. <small> D.
