The most prominent question which emerged in attempting to define further the person of Christ was whether the will belonged to the nature or the person, or, as it came to be stated, whether Christ had two wills or only one. The church in the sixth oecumenical council at Constantinople (680) declared that Christ had two wills.

The Maronites, however, were reconciled to Rome in the 12th century, and are reckoned as Roman Catholics of the Oriental Rite. <small> &ldquo;ORTHODOX EASTERN CHURCH&rdquo; <a name="EBOEC" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#EBOEC"><cite title="source">Encyclopaedia Britannica</cite></a>, 11th edit.
