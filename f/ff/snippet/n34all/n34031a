When two ratios are equal, the four quantities composing them are said to be <b>proportionals</b>. Thus if a&frasl;b = c&frasl;d then a, b, c, d are proportionals. This is expressed by saying that a is to b as c is to d, and the proportion is written a:b::c:d or a:b = c:d. The terms a and d are called the <i>extremes</i>, b and c the <i>means</i>. <small> Hall &amp; Knight, <a name="HSHK" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#HSHK"><cite title="source">Elementary Algebra for Schools</cite></a> (n.d) 275</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
