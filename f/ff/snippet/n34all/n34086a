One specimen commonly given to visitors to Greenland may suffice: <i>Savigiksiniariartokassuaromaryotittogog</i>, which is equivalent to &ldquo;He says that you also will go away quickly in like manner and buy a pretty knife.&rdquo; Here is one word serving in the place of 17. It is made up as follows: <i>Savig</i> a knife, <i>ik</i> pretty, <i>sini</i> buy, <i>ariartok</i> go away, <i>asuar</i> hasten, <i>omar</i> wilt, <i>y</i> in like manner, <i>otit</i> thou, <i>tog</i> also, <i>og</i> he says. <small> &ldquo;ESKIMO&rdquo; <a name="EBESK" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#EBESK"><cite title="source">Encyclopaedia Britannica</cite></a>, 11th edit.
