At the death of Pope Zosimus, the Roman clergy were divided into two factions, one of which elected the deacon <mark>Eulalius</mark>, and the other the priest <mark>Boniface</mark>. The imperial government, in the interests of public order, commanded the two competitors to leave the town, reserving the decision of the case to a council. Eulalius having broken his ban, the emperor Honorius decided to recognize Boniface, and the council was countermanded. But the faction of Eulalius long continued to foment disorders, and the secular authority was compelled to intervene. </mm> </dd></dl>
