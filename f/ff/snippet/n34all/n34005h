Besides Wednesdays and Fridays, there are four fasting seasons, Lent, Pentecost to SS. Peter and Paul, August 1-15 preceding the Feast of the <mark>Sleep of the Theotokos</mark>, and the six weeks before Christmas. Indulgences are not recognized; an intermediate and purificatory state of the dead is held but not systematized into a doctrine of purgatory. The Virgin receives homage, but the dogma of her Immaculate Conception is not admitted. While ikons of the saints are found in the churches there is no &ldquo;graven image&rdquo; apart from the crucifix. There is plenty of singing but no instrumental music. Prayer is offered standing towards the East; at Pentecost, kneeling. The celebration of the Eucharist is an elaborate symbolical representation of the Passion. The consecrated bread is broken into the wine, and both elements are given together in a spoon. <small> &ldquo;ORTHODOX EASTERN CHURCH&rdquo; <a name="EBOEC" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#EBOEC"><cite title="source">Encyclopaedia Britannica</cite></a>, 11th edit.
