The Greek fathers succeeded the Sophists, the Latin theologians succeeded the Roman advocates. This gave rise to misunderstandings, and at last led to two widely separate ways of regarding and defining one important doctrine&mdash;the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father or from the Father and the Son. Political jealousies and interests intensified the disputes, and at last, after many premonitory symptoms, the final break came in 1054, when Pope Leo IX. smote <mark>Michael Cerularius</mark> and the whole of the Eastern Church with an excommunication &hellip; the separation was final, and the ostensible cause of its finality was the introduction by the Latins of two words <i>Filioque</i> into the creed. <font color="green">[After the words &ldquo;and in the Holy Ghost&rdquo; of the Apostles&apos; Creed the Constantinopolitan creed added &ldquo;who proceedeth from the Father.&rdquo; The Roman Church, without the sanction of an oecumenical council and without consulting the Easterns, added &ldquo;and the Son.&rdquo; The addition was first made at Toledo (589) in opposition to Arianism, The Easterns also resented the Roman enforcement of clerical celibacy, the limitation of the right of confirmation to the bishop and the use of unleavened bread in the Eucharist.]</font> It is this addition which was and which still remains the permanent cause of separation. <small> &ldquo;ORTHODOX EASTERN CHURCH&rdquo; <a name="EBOEC" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#EBOEC"><cite title="source">Encyclopaedia Britannica</cite></a>, 11th edit.
