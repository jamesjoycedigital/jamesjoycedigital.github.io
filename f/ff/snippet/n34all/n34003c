Cyril contrived the plan of reforming the Eastern Church by bringing its doctrines into harmony with those of Calvinism, and by sending able young Greek theologians to Switzerland, Holland and England to study Protestant theology. His scheme of reform was opposed chiefly by the intrigues of the Jesuits, who in the end brought about his death. The church anathematized his doctrines, and in its later testimonies repudiated his confession on the one hand and Jesuit ideas on the other. The most important of these testimonies are (1) the Orthodox confession or catechism of Peter Mogilas &hellip; and (2) the decree of the <mark>synod</mark> of Jerusalem or the confession of Dositheus (1672). Besides these, the catechism of the Russian Church should be consulted, especially the catechism of Philaret, which since 1839 has been used in all the churches and schools in Russia. Founding on these doctrinal sources the teaching of the Orthodox Eastern Church is: Christianity is a Divine revelation communicated to mankind through Christ; its saving truths are to be learned from the Bible <i>and tradition</i>. the former having been written, <i>and the latter maintained uncorrupted</i> through the influence of the Holy Spirit; <i>the interpretation of the Bible belongs to the Church, which is taught by the Holy Spirit</i>, but every believer may read the Scriptures. <small> &ldquo;ORTHODOX EASTERN CHURCH&rdquo; <a name="EBOEC" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#EBOEC"><cite title="source">Encyclopaedia Britannica</cite></a>, 11th edit.
