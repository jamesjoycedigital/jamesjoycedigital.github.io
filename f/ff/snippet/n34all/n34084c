It seems that Vortigern made use of the Saxons to protect his kingdom against the Picts and Scots, and that he rewarded them with a grant of land. Later we find the Britons at war with the newcomers, now established in Kent, and four battles are fought. One authority attests the marriage of Vortigern with the daughter of Hengest before the war; it also records the massacre of the British nobles after the death of Vortemir, the king&apos;s son, and the subsequent grant of Essex and Sussex to the invaders by Vortigern. </mm> </dd></dl>
