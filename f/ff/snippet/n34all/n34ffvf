Constantine introduced a new partition of the empire into <mark>dioceses</mark>, and the church adopted a similar division. The bishop of the chief city in each diocese naturally rose to a preeminence, and was commonly called <i>exarch</i>&mdash;a title borrowed from the civil jurisdiction. In process of time the common title <i>patriarch</i> was restricted to the most eminent of these exarchs, and councils decided who were worthy of the dignity. <small> &ldquo;ORTHODOX EASTERN CHURCH&rdquo; <a name="EBOEC" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#EBOEC"><cite title="source">Encyclopaedia Britannica</cite></a>, 11th edit.
