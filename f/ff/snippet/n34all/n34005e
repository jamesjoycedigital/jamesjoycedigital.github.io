It is used in two forms, a shorter revised by Chrysostom, and a longer called the liturgy of St. Basil. This liturgy and the service generally are either in Old Greek or in Old Slavonic, and frequent disputes have arisen in particular districts about the language to be employed. <small> &ldquo;ORTHODOX EASTERN CHURCH&rdquo; <a name="EBOEC" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#EBOEC"><cite title="source">Encyclopaedia Britannica</cite></a>, 11th edit.
