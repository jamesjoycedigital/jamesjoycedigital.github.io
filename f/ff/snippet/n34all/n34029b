This describes the essential stasis in the great Mookse-Gripes debate, drawing on the controversies that raged between the Greek [Gripos] and Roman [Mooksius] Churches over the inclusion or exclusion of the <i>Filioque</i> element in the Apostle&apos;s Creed (see above). Regarding it, Joyce dictated the following in a letter to Frank Budgen (<i>Selected Letters</i>, pp.366f.; 3 September 1933): &ldquo;The frase of the Latin mass which you could not read is on Ulysses page 1. The old catholics Augustioner Kirche are a good example of a Mooks gone Gripes. They separated from Rome in 71 when the infallibility of the pope was proclaimed a dogma but they have since gone much more apart. They have abolished auricular confession they give the eucharist under two species but the faithful received the cup only at Whitsun. I see no prayers to the BVM or the saints in their prayer book and no images of her or them around the church. But most important of all they have abolished the Filioque clause in the creed concerning which there has been a schism between western and eastern christendom for over a thousand years, Rome saying that the Holy Ghost proceeds from the father and the son. Greece and Russia and the East Orthodox churches that the procession is from the father alone, ex patre without Filioque. Of course the dogmas subsequently proclaimed by Rome after the split are not recognised by the east such as the Immaculate conception. See the Mooks and the Gripes that is West and east, paragraph beginning when that Moosius and ending Philioquus. All the grotesque words in this are russian or greek for the three principle dogmas which separate Shem from Shaun. When he gets A and B on to his lap C slips off and when he has C and A he looses hold of B.&rdquo; The passage above incorporates <i>inter alia</i> the following terms and phrases.
