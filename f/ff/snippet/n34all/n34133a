He made a name for himself in London as a designer of beautiful houses; but his chief claim to fame was his conception and promotion of the system of " daylight saving." Though scoffed.at in his lifetime, his idea was taken up and put into practice in 1916, and honour has been paid to Willett&apos;s memory, which was denied to him in life. He died at Chislehurst March 4 1915. </mm> </dd></dl>
