The <i>Bulgarian Church</i>: &hellip; The revival of Bulgarian national feeling near the middle of the 19th century led to a movement for religious independence, the leaders of which were the archimandrite Neophit Bozveli and the bishop Harion Mikhailovsky. The Porte espoused the cause of the Bulgarians, partly to pacify them, but still more to strengthen its hold on all the Christians of Turkey by fostering their differences. Ultimately, on 28th February 1870, the sultan issued a firman constituting a new church, including all Bulgarians who desired to join it within the <mark>vilayet</mark> of the Danube (<i>i.e.</i> the subsequently-formed principality of Bulgaria), and those of Adrianople, Salonica, Kossovo and Monastir (<i>i.e.</i> part of Macedonia, Eastern Rumelia and a tract further south). The members of this church were to constitute a <i>millet</i> or community, enjoying equal rights with the Greeks and Armenians; and its head, the Bulgarian exarch, was to reside at Constantinople. Naturally, this was resented by the patriarch Anthimus, who stigmatized the racial basis of the Bulgarian Church as the heresy of Phyletism. <small> &ldquo;ORTHODOX EASTERN CHURCH&rdquo; <a name="EBOEC" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#EBOEC"><cite title="source">Encyclopaedia Britannica</cite></a>, 11th edit.
