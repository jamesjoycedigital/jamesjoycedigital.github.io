Finlay, in his <cite>History of Greece</cite>, has shown that there has been always a very close relationship between the church and national life. Christianity from the first connected itself with the social organization of the people, and therefore in every province assumed the language and the usages of the locality. In this way it was able to command at once individual attachment and universal power. This feeling died down to some extent when Constantine made use of the church to consolidate his empire. But it revived under the persecution of the Arian emperors. The struggle against <mark>Arianism</mark> was not merely a struggle for orthodoxy. <mark>Athanasius</mark> was really at the head of a national Greek party resisting the domination of a Latin-speaking court. From this time onwards Greek patriotism and Greek orthodoxy have ben almost convertible terms, and this led naturally to revolts against Greek supremacy in the days of Justinian and other emperors. <small> &ldquo;ORTHODOX EASTERN CHURCH&rdquo; <a name="EBOEC" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#EBOEC"><cite title="source">Encyclopaedia Britannica</cite></a>, 11th edit.
