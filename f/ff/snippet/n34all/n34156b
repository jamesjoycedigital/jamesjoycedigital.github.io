It is so named from a cave (Le Mousier), on the right bank of the VV&eacute;z&egrave;re, an affluent of the Dordogne. The epoch was characterised by cold wet climate, by the supposed existence of man of the Olom type (that is, nearly as dolichocephalous as the Neanderthal type, but with superciliary ridges flat, and front bones high), and by the occurence of the musk-ox, the horse, the cave-bear, <i>Rhinoceros tichorhinus</i> and the mammoth. The epoch was succeeded by the Solutrian and Madelenian epochs. (NOTE. In <cite>FW</cite> + &lsquo;mister&rsquo;.) </mm> </dd></dl>
