Herbert Gorman. His <cite>James Joyce: His First Forty Years</cite> appeared in 1924. The list of names that follows may well be reminders for a discussion with Gorman, as suggested by David Hayman (see his introduction to the <li>JJA facsimile of VI.B.5, xii). Joyce had enquired about additions to a second edition of Gorman&apos;s book in a letter to Sylvia Beach on 17 July 1924. Curran and Dujardin are not mentioned, and Gorman&apos;s bibliography does not have Boyd&apos;s article and neither is the article in <cite>Who&apos;s Who</cite>. </mm> </dd></dl>
