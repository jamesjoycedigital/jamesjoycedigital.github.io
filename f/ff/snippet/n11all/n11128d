Supposed Ku Klux Klan Outrage&mdash;A Battle Creek, Michigan, message reports that the Rev. Oren Vanloon, pastor of the Berkeley Community Church near Detroit, who disappeared a fortnight ago, and was found wandering in the streets of Battle Creek on Saturday in a dazed condition, with the letters <mark>&ldquo;K.K.K.&rdquo; branded on his back</mark>, is unable to give any account of how he came by this serious branding. He admits that he preached against burning fiery crosses, and might have incurred the displeasure of the Ku Klux Klan, but he has no memory of anything that occurred after he left home by appointment to preach at another church. <small> <a name="IT15jul24" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#IT15jul24"><cite title="source">Irish Times</cite></a> (15 July 1924) 5/6</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
