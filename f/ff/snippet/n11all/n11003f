No! we talked the sun up. Sitting inside the snug bastions of the Fort, the soldiers bring a pile of faggots, and there we splice the two ends of our East and West cables, comparing notes. Only representative of his Queen, there he is, day by day, looking off into our wild unknown Interior, two big <mark>business-looking</mark> revolvers ever lying on his table, and full of forebodings. Gazing moodily over at our <i>terra incognita</i>, little does he guess I am &ldquo;boring out&rdquo; to join him. <small> Daniel Crawford, <a name="DCTB2" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#DCTB2"><cite title="source">Thinking Black</cite></a> (1912) 406</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c04029j" href="c4all.htm#c04029j">VI.C.04:029(j)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
