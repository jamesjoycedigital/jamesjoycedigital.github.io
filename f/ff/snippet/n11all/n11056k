She held to consortion &lsquo;for creation only&rsquo; and that did not suffice me.&rdquo; Then he felt that he had been transubstantiated from good to beautiful, and he could no longer live with Mary and Jane. Before leaving them, however, he must open their eyes: make the former realise her past, the latter her future. Instead of going about it in a straightforward way and saying to Mary (in a quiet conversational tone): &ldquo;It is not my intention to continue living in this house. My trunk is packed and in and how it will be called for. I have only come to say that I will not live near you any longer&rdquo;; because he lacked the courage, or knew full well that Mary would not remain silent long enough for him to speak these words, or give him time to get a lawyer to make an appropriate settlement, Mr. Anderson makes his hero adopt a unique plan, one that both he and his admirers undoubtedly believe is deeply significant and symbolic. Meanwhile, puffed with passion, John Webster is <mark>euphoric</mark> and ecstatic. <small> Joseph Collins, <a name="JCTT" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#JCTT"><cite title="source">Taking the Literary Pulse</cite></a> (1924) 40-41</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
