Their confession was published in the U.S. papers in full on 6 June 1924. On the morning of July 23, Leopold and Loeb spoke with reporters. &ldquo;I hear you fellows had a hard time discussing our clothes the other day,&rdquo; Leopold said. &ldquo;I don&apos;t want you to make any mistakes this time. Remember this is an important day. Now look at me. What am I wearing? If I walked away this minute not one of you could tell, accurately. So I&apos;m going to help you out. Dick&apos;s hat is a soft fedora, as you can see. It&apos;s dull grey. Mine is slate grey,&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;Now, did you get that straight?&rdquo; &ldquo;Uh shut up, Babe,&rdquo; said Loeb. </mm> </dd></dl>
