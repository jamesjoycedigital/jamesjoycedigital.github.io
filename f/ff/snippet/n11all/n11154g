The revival of the ancient Irish games held at Teltown, Co. Meath. The first of the new series was held in Croke Park in 1924 and included artistic as well as athletic competitions. The portrait of Joyce&apos;s father by Patrick Tuohy failed to win the Gold Trophy at the Tailteann Games, as Joyce reported to Miss Beach on 17 August 1924: &ldquo;Did I tell you that in giving his awards at Dublin Sir John Lavery passed over the portrait of my father (second prize) and gave the first prize to a painting by Mr Keating. The press says the award was &lsquo;keenly criticised&rsquo;.&rdquo;</mm> </dd></dl>
