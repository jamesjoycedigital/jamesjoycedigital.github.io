Moreover, he had a message from the spirit which he had been whispering at night into a telephone: &ldquo;Build temples to yourself; worship the god sex therein; it is the only sure means of salvation.&rdquo; But he did not succeed in broadcasting it. To deliver it lie had to do some house-wrecking, some seed-scattering in alleyways. <small> Joseph Collins, <a name="JCTT" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#JCTT"><cite title="source">Taking the Literary Pulse</cite></a> (1924) 32-33</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
