Francis II, the duke of Brittany from 1458, fought against the French and was defeated in 1488 and forced to sign the Treaty of Verger, in which he agreed that his daughters Anne and Isabelle could be married only with the approval of the French king, thereby removing the danger of non-French rule in Brittany. 1488 was also the year of the death of Francis II. </mm> </dd></dl>
