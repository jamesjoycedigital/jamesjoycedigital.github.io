In view of the fact that the river is already spanned by ten bridges and also possesses efficient ferry services, the need of a tunnel is not very obvious; on the other hand, the existence of a tunnel might later on be found to constitute an obstruction to the evolution of Dublin from a ferry station into a port. &hellip;&rdquo;&rdquo; <small> <a name="FJ21may24" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#FJ21may24"><cite title="source">Freeman's Journal</cite></a> (21 May 1924) 7/5</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: There were ten bridges in 1924. Proceeding from the mouth of the river, these were: 1. Butt Bridge; 2. O&apos;Connell Bridge; 3. Liffey Bridge, (formerly Wellington Bridge and popularly known as The Halfpenny Bridge); 4.
