Woolworth&apos;s, stated that on the day of the raid she was standing between the back entrance and the office when she saw a man with goggles walk in by the back entrance. He went straight to the office where he whipped out a revolver and commanded the manager, who was in the shop, to put up his hands. The man stood at the door of the office for about a minute. She could not exactly hear what he said, but she saw the manager and the assistant-manager put up their hands. She saw a second man coming down the back entrance steps and <mark>take up a position</mark> between the back entrance and the office. He shouted to her &ldquo;get back.&rdquo; Witness stood when she was staring at him. <small> <a name="FJ24may24" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#FJ24may24"><cite title="source">Freeman's Journal</cite></a> (24 May 1924) 8/5</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
