At all these feasts ale was the predominant liquor, and it is held to be highly probable that from this the metonymy arose. The word itself is of Saxon origin. <small> <a name="FJ9jun24" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#FJ9jun24"><cite title="source">Freeman's Journal</cite></a> (9 June 1924) 7/2</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
