A Galway House Sale.</b> / Sir,&mdash; There are sometimes clauses, covenants or provisions in leases, and other legal instruments by virtue of which tenants, etc., conserve a priority in the way of purchase, etc. But that blockade which was staged last week at the sale of a house in William-street is as grossly unfair as it is illogical and absurd. ... If a man pays a year&apos;s rent for a house, or for anything else, and he gets the best value procurable, through its utility, the argument is squared right there. / If he pays twenty years&apos; rent or hire, he gets twenty years devilish good value, and he knows it. ... But some folks, as soon as they get that <mark>fourth foot in the trough</mark>, they try to hog it, and squeal if they cannot hang on to the whole spread out, or if anyone else tries to get a look in, even edgeways. ... <small> <a name="CT24may24" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#CT24may24"><cite title="source">Connacht Tribune</cite></a> (24 May 1924) 7/4</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
