Tugdual, bishop and founder of the bishopric of Tr&eacute;guier, in Brittany, was his brother. When St Lunaire was travelling by ship to Crevelin with his altar, a violent storm arose and the altar had to be cast into the sea. When he landed, two doves appeared carrying the altar and put it down at his feet. Abb&eacute; Roze&eacute; does not connect the doves with St Lunaire&apos;s sisters. </mm> </dd></dl>
