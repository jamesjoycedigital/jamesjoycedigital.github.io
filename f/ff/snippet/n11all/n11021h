Wicklow, in a fight between Irregulars and troops. / Plunkett was interred in his native district of Kincasslough, Tirconnall on Sunday last, and a great throng accompanied by bands assembled at the graveside, where an oration was delivered by Mr. Joseph Green. / Then a volley was fired over the grave, but immediately afterwards a military officer, who was present in charge of a party of soldiers, rushed forward to seize the men who fired the shots. In doing so he stepped upon the grave and then the mother of the dead man dashed after him, caught him and flung him to the ground. A soldier went to the rescue of the officer and fired a shot over the woman&apos;s head. / <mark>Pandemonium followed, but order was soon restored</mark> and the crowd departed peacefully. <small> <a name="FJ23may24" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#FJ23may24"><cite title="source">Freeman's Journal</cite></a> (23 May 1924) 5/6</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c04041c" href="c4all.htm#c04041c">VI.C.04:041(c)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
