Squire Martin said he was not so sure about all that, and that he could find a man on his estate in Ireland, who could eat as much as any that he could find on his estate in England. An eating contest was thereupon arranged to take place in the English gentleman&apos;s kitchen. Squire Martin sent home to Connemara for a certain hungry ploughman, and the two started to eat in the kitchen. After a few rounds (courses) the Connemara man said to the old Squire Martin: <mark>&ldquo;<i>Thaw may leenthee go gee an skornach</i>;&rdquo;</mark> (I am full to the throttle), but the old Squire Martin, who understood Irish well told him to &ldquo;stick it,&rdquo; to hang on. The English gentleman enquired what he said and old Squire Martin told him that he was asking for more of the other turkey. <br>The English glutton, hearing this, jumped up from the table and said he could have the whole lot of it if he wanted to&mdash;that he had his bellyfull. <small> <a name="CT19jul24" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#CT19jul24"><cite title="source">Connacht Tribune</cite></a> (19 July 1924) Letter from &lsquo;Ned O&apos;The Hill&rsquo;</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
