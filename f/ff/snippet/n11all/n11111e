Moore, Patrick St., summoned A. Field, Monkstown, for assault on the East Pier. There was also a cross-case. Plaintiff stated that defendant was &ldquo;taking the dummy&apos;s photo.&rdquo; When it was finished the dummy would not pay and defendant would not give him the photo. Witness asked defendant to give him a chance, but he rushed at him and struck him several times. Defendant, however, denied he struck Moore, saying he was taking photos when &ldquo;<mark>a gang of ruffians came along</mark>.&rdquo; Plaintiff and those with him wanted to spoil his (defendant&apos;s) trade. Station-Sergt. Walsh stated he knew defendant for many years. He was a quiet, inoffensive man. <small> <a name="II4jul24" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#II4jul24"><cite title="source">Irish Independent</cite></a> (4 July 1924) 7/8</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
