There lived about a century ago an old fisherman there named Tugg&mdash;appropriately&mdash;who, one June evening, between 7 and 8 o&apos;clock, hooked a salmon a little above the bridge <font color="green">[at Banagher]</font>. Till eleven <font color="green">[...]</font> the battle went on near the centre of the river, which here is about half a mile wide, during which <mark>the salmon was played</mark> up stream as far as Bird&apos;s Island, more than a mile. Twelve o&apos;clock struck, and <mark>three hours</mark> more rolled by, with neither willing to give up the fight, which Tugg in the end won by unsportsmanlike trickery. <small> <a name="FJ18jun24" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#FJ18jun24"><cite title="source">Freeman's Journal</cite></a> (18 June 1924) 8/5</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
