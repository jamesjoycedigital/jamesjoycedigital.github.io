She reproached me on several occasions as being cold, and told me quite plainly that she wished my affection, and was determined to win it, if possible. / Later she gave him a &pound;200 note, and this surprised him. After losing her berth with the financier in Bond Street she became thoroughly unsettled, and begged me to give up everything and go abroad with her. She informed me of her great love and affection for me, but I plainly told her that I could not agree to such a course. / They saw an advertisement regarding a bungalow at Eastbourne, and Miss Kaye suggested he should take it in an assumed name, and <mark>haphazardly</mark> fixed on the name of Wallers. <small> <a name="FJ23may24" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#FJ23may24"><cite title="source">Freeman's Journal</cite></a> (23 May 1924) 7/2</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
