Pierre Veber mocked good-naturedly the pretensions of the teachings of heredity, and the fatalism it carries with it. At the end of a good dinner, the Prince of Thune, a queer old chap, says: &ldquo;It cannot be denied that atavism, this modern form of fatality, weighs heavily on our life. Personally, I feel myself at the mercy of a group of influences that I should qualify as ancestral, if the French Academy had not recently condemned that adjective. I know I have not a bad nature, but I know also that <mark>I am a battlefield</mark> where a number of my forebears are in a murderous combat, and I am powerless. Temperance would have been my dominant quality, had not one of my antecedents, and a most recent one at that, opposed it with all his might. This man, a Captain in the Gendarmerie in 1826, was a ferocious tyrant, and now, every time I pass a glass of cognac, he shoots out my hand to grasp it, and then he compels me to drink the beastly alcohol. <small> Joseph Collins, <a name="JCTT" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#JCTT"><cite title="source">Taking the Literary Pulse</cite></a> (1924) 93</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
