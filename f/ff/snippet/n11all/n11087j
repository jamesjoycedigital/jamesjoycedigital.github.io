French anthropologist, best known for his studies of primitive thinking. His <cite>La mentalit&eacute; primitive</cite> appeared in 1922 and was translated as <cite>Primitive Mentality</cite> in 1923. Joyce seems to have made some use of his theories in the <i>Wake</i>, citing him as Professor Loewy-Brueller at 150.15. Joyce later met him in Copenhagen in 1936, when L&eacute;vy-Bruhl expressed his enthusiasm for <cite>Ulysses</cite> (Ellmann, cite>James Joyce</i>, 2nd ed., p. 696). </mm> </dd></dl>
