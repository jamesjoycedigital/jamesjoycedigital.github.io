That is, he began to experience sensations associated with <mark>&ldquo;change of life,&rdquo;</mark> an epoch which was once believed to occur only in women, but which occurs in men as well, though usually not in such bizarre fashion. It hit Webster hard and some thought him insane. &ldquo;Perhaps I am becoming for some reason a little insane,&rdquo; he thought. Many a woman going through the same experience has a similar thought. &ldquo;It was a little hard to describe the feeling he had. Down within his body something began to affect him like an illness. It was as though something was being born. Had he been a woman he might have suspected he had suddenly become pregnant.&rdquo; This description would fit many involuting individuals. It is not unlikely that the tree has a similar sensation when the sap goes up, and when it goes out to the twigs. <small> Joseph Collins, <a name="JCTT" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#JCTT"><cite title="source">Taking the Literary Pulse</cite></a> (1924) 39</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: Right margin </mm> </dd></dl>
