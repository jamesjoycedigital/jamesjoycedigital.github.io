The recent heavy rains had interfered somewhat with the sport, but the gradual subsidence of the waters of the Corrib is making for excellent sport, and it is no uncommon sight&mdash;and what a sight&mdash;to watch the anglers play with the kingly salmon. The green drake fly has already risen, and has been followed by the olive quill, <mark>the yellow hawk</mark>, and the black quill. <small> <a name="CT7jun24" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#CT7jun24"><cite title="source">Connacht Tribune</cite></a> (7 June 1924) 4/8</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
