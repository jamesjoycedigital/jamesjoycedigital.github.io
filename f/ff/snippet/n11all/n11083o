The observance of &ldquo;Bonfire Night&rdquo; is a relic of the Druidical feast of <mark>Beltein</mark>, of which there used to be two celebrations in Ireland, one on May 1st and the other on June 21st, while in some parts of the West of Scotland &ldquo;Beltein&rdquo; was not observed until June 29th, the feast of Saints Peter and Paul. Beltein signifies &ldquo;the fire of Baal,&rdquo; the Ph&oelig;nician name for the God of the Sun, in whose honour fires were lighted at this time in recognition of his visible influence on the crops of the earth. <small> <a name="FJ24jun24" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#FJ24jun24"><cite title="source">Freeman's Journal</cite></a> (24 June 1924) 4/6</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: Entered in right margin.
