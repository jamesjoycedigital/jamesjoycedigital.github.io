The story of the phrase is to be found in many tourist guides: Anne of Brittany, who was twice queen of France, had the Duchy of Brittany annexed to the Kingdom of France. When the people of St Malo objected, she had her castle fortified with a new tower, on which was inscribed the motto noted by Joyce. The castle still stands in St Malo, on the northern side of what is now the Place Chateaubriand. The tower is known as the Tour de Quiquengrogne. </mm> </dd></dl>
