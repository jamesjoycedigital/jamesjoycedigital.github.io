One islander climbs on another&apos;s shoulder, another climbs upon his, and so on. And when a tussle takes place between the men so burdened down with their fellows, the man who gets clear&mdash;in other words, falls off the top&mdash;and utters the magic triangle of words before he has fallen, is accounted to have won. <small> <a name="CT19jul24" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#CT19jul24"><cite title="source">Connacht Tribune</cite></a> (19 July 1924) 6/5</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
