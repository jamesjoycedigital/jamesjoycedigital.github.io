He also had the forethought to weave into its text a restricted and entirely dogmatic programme by which alone creative writers may hope to fulfill the mission. To ignore his creed in attempting an estimate of his work is to refuse the aid of a navigator&apos;s chart in a sea studded with islands and sown with shoals, or the aid of a <mark>blueprint</mark> in exploring a garden full of labyrinthine paths, high hedges, deep shadows, where rare flowers and rank weeds grow in apparently purposeless proximity, and blind lanes and long vistas are often veiled in fog or mist. <small> Joseph Collins, <a name="JCTT" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#JCTT"><cite title="source">Taking the Literary Pulse</cite></a> (1924) 33</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: Right margin </mm> </dd></dl>
