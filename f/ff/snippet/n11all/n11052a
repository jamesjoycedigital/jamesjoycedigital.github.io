But as only the Old Law was not a figure of the New, so in to-day&apos;s ceremony we are reminded that the splendour must be sought, not in the external garment but in the shining brightness of a virtuous soul. The form used in handing the new bishop his cozier is worthy of note: &ldquo;Receive the staff of the pastoral office that you may be <mark>piously fierce</mark> in correcting vices, tempering justice with meekness and not neglecting strictness of discipline through love of tranquility.&rdquo; <small> <a name="CT7jun24" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#CT7jun24"><cite title="source">Connacht Tribune</cite></a> (7 June 1924) 6/3</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
