As far as cold ink can do it, let me tell you what I saw&mdash;a theme this for blinding tears. There, leaping about from tree to tree, exactly like a monkey, was a horrible human being stark naked. A poor woman this who had lived nearly all her days as an animal <font color="green">[383]</font> amongst animals, the bony fingers like talons of a hawk being all the weapons of her forest warfare. The body cunningly coloured like the grey bark of the trees in which she lived, you can scarcely for a moment locate her, until you catch sight of the black eyes gleaming like coals of fire. Then comes a shriek followed by a fierce cataract of what the natives call &ldquo;monkey curses&rdquo; (<i>Mafinge akorowe</i>), and off she springs from tree to tree, twisting her face into a grotesque sneer. She has forgotten how to speak with human modulation and can only screech, a literal proof this of the Spanish saying, <mark>&ldquo;Live with wolves and you will learn to howl.&rdquo;</mark> <small> Daniel Crawford, <a name="DCTB2" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#DCTB2"><cite title="source">Thinking Black</cite></a> (1912) 383-4</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
