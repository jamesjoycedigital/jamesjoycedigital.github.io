Monica is endowed with her father&apos;s artistic disposition, his charm, and his gifts. She neither understood her mother nor had any understanding from her. She took after her aunt Beth. Her <mark>gonadal</mark> reflex was high, and she was the mistress of her fianc&eacute;, killed in the war. She married Shane Mostyn, selfish, unattractive, fond of women, and ambitious to a fault, who made a success of his literary life. <small> Joseph Collins, <a name="JCTT" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#JCTT"><cite title="source">Taking the Literary Pulse</cite></a> (1924) 84</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
