<div class="nbunit" id="c12Jan1939"><font color="red">12 January 1939</font> <i>NLFF</i> (from Richard de la Mere to Paul L&eacute;on): Thank you for your letter of January 10th, with which you returned to me for press pages 257-288 and 385-416, and sent me additional corrections for &lsquo;new matter galleys 48 to 53&rsquo; &mdash; I telephoned to the printers this morning asking them not to send out the page proofs made up from these last galleys until they received the further corrections. I very much hope there won&apos;t be any more late corrections &hellip; I have asked our printers to send you 3 sets in future of all the proofs that they send you direct, and I have asked them also to send you a further set of all the proofs they have sent you direct up till now. </div>
