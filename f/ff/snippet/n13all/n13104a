Such was the fury with which they advanced that there was not left a <mark>spear on a rack nor a shield on a spike nor a sword in an armoury</mark> in Tara-Luachra that did not <mark>fall down</mark>. From every house on which was <mark>thatch</mark> in Tara-Luachra it <mark>fell</mark> in immense flakes. One would think that it was the sea that had come over the walls and over the corners of the world upon them. The forms of countenances were changed, and there was chattering of teeth in Tara-Luachra within. The two <mark>druids fell in fits</mark> and in faintings and in paroxysms, one of them out <mark>over the wall</mark>, and the other over the wall inside.&rdquo; <small> Douglas Hyde, <a name="SEGL" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#SEGL"><cite title="source">The Story of Early Gaelic Literature</cite></a> (1920) 47</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c05043a" href="c5all.htm#c05043a">VI.C.05:043(a)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
