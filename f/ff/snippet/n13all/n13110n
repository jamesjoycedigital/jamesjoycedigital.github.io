His reign was <mark>not thunder-producing</mark> or stormy. It was little but the trees bent under the greatness of their fruit.&rdquo; This notion of connecting good seasons with good rulers was very common in Ireland. We find traces pf it as late as the sixteenth century. <small> Douglas Hyde, <a name="SEGL" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#SEGL"><cite title="source">The Story of Early Gaelic Literature</cite></a> (1920) 108n</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c05049n" href="c5all.htm#c05049n">VI.C.05:049(n)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
