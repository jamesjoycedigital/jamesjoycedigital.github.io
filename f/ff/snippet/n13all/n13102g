This is the &ldquo;Teagasg Flatha,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Instructions to a Prince,&rdquo; alleged to have been written by <mark>Cormac mac Art for his son, Cairbre of the Liffey</mark>. Both Cormac and his son Cairbre are very great personages indeed in the romantic history of Ireland. Cormac was the son of <mark>Art the Lonely</mark>, and the grandson of <mark>Con of the Hundred Battles</mark>, and it was he who made still wider the breach with Finn mac Cool and the Fenians, which finally ended in a death struggle between them and the monarchy, in which Cairbre, &mdash; for whose instruction this book was written &mdash; was slain, and the Fenians, on the other side, almost exterminated to a man. <small> Douglas Hyde, <a name="SEGL" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#SEGL"><cite title="source">The Story of Early Gaelic Literature</cite></a> (1920) 35</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c05041g" href="c5all.htm#c05041g">VI.C.05:041(g)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
