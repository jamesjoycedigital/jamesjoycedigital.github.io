The charioteer was more than a mere servant. Cuchulain sometimes called his charioteer &ldquo;friend&rdquo; or <mark>&ldquo;master&rdquo; (popa)</mark>, and, on the occasion of his fight with Ferdia, desires him, in case he (Cuchulain) should show signs of yielding, to &ldquo;excite, reproach, and speak evil to me, so that the ire of my rage and anger shall grow the more on me; but if he give ground before me, thou shalt laud me and praise me and speak good words to me, that my courage may be the greater,&rdquo; and this command his friend and charioteer punctually executed. <small> Douglas Hyde, <a name="SEGL" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#SEGL"><cite title="source">The Story of Early Gaelic Literature</cite></a> (1920) 47</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c05042j" href="c5all.htm#c05042j">VI.C.05:042(j)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
