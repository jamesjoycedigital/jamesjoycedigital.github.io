For if, as D&apos;Arbois de Jubainville has I think proved, the list of one hundred and eighty-seven historic tales contained in the <i>Book of Leinster</i>, was really drawn up at the end of the seventh or beginning of the eighth century, we find that even then Finn or his contemporaries were the subjects of or figure in several of them, as in the story of the <mark>Courtship of Ailbhe, daughter of King Cormac mac Art</mark>, by Finn; the Battle of Moy Muchruime, where King Art, Cormac&apos;s father, was slain; the Cave of Bin Edair, where Diarmuid and Grdinne took shelter when pursued by Finn; the Adventures of Finn in Derc Fearna (the Cave of Dunmore) a lost tale; the Elopement of Grainne with Diarmuid, and perhaps one or two more. <small> Douglas Hyde, <a name="SEGL" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#SEGL"><cite title="source">The Story of Early Gaelic Literature</cite></a> (1920) 105</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c05048b" href="c5all.htm#c05048b">VI.C.05:048(b)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
