Hence, one of two things must be the case; the story must either have originated <i>before</i> that date to account for the sticking together of the tablets, or else some one must have invented it long afterwards, that is, must, without any apparent cause, have invented a story out of his own head, as to how there were <i>once on a time</i> two tablets made of trees which <i>once</i> grew on two tombs, which were <i>once</i> fastened together before Art, son of Conn, and which were soon afterwards unfortunately burnt&mdash; supposition, which, considering there were then, <i>ex hypothesis</i> no <mark>adhering tablets</mark> to prompt the invention, appears to be in the highest degree improbable. <small> Douglas Hyde, <a name="SEGL" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#SEGL"><cite title="source">The Story of Early Gaelic Literature</cite></a> (1920) 11</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c05020d" href="c5all.htm#c05020d">VI.C.05:020(d)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
