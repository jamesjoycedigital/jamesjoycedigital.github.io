Their counsel is foolish, they are forgetful of love, most headstrong in their desires, fond of folly, prone to enter rashly into engagements, <mark>given to swearing</mark>, proud to be asked in marriage, tenacious of enmity, cheerless at the banquet, rejectors of reconciliation, prone to strife, of much garrulity &mdash; until evil be good, until hell be heaven, until the sun hide his light, until the stars of heaven fall, women will remain as we have stated. <small> Douglas Hyde, <a name="SEGL" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#SEGL"><cite title="source">The Story of Early Gaelic Literature</cite></a> (1920) 39</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c05042a" href="c5all.htm#c05042a">VI.C.05:042(a)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
