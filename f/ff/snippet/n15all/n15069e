Thus there is <mark>Cunina who guards the child&apos;s cradle, Edulia and Potina who teach him to eat and drink, Statilinus who makes him stand up</mark> and so on. In fact the <i>numen</i> is only the image of an activity, he is never a personality though he may be the first stage to impersonation. <small> J.E.
