Among others they added the words, <mark>Kal or Gil</mark>, that is to say &ldquo;man&rdquo; or &ldquo;servant of,&rdquo; as Thorkel or Thorgil the man or servant of Thor. We therefore venture to suggest, that not only is the term Gille, of Scandinavian origin, but that it was introduced into Ireland by the Scandinavian worshippers of Thor. <small> Charles Haliday, <a name="SKD2" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#SKD2"><cite title="source">The Scandinavian Kingdom of Dublin</cite></a>, 2nd ed.
