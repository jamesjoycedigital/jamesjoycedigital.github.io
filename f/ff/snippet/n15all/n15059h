The most ancient vellum was that which is now called <cite>Kringla</cite>. It was written in Iceland about twenty years after Snorre&apos;s death. It contained a supplement, &ldquo;Skaldatal,&rdquo; which gave a list of all the court scalds of historic times, with information regarding the Norwegian kings and princes for whom they wrote. The list of scalds stopped at Snorre&apos;s nephews, Olaf Kvitaskald, who died in 1259, and Sturla Thordson, who lived till 1284; and doubtless one of these had given instructions for the copy of the original to be made. Sturla Thordson probably took the book with him to Norway on his visit thither in 1263. At any rate <cite>Kringla</cite> reached Norway at an early date and was preserved in or near Bergen until the close of the sixteenth century, after which it found its way to the University Library at Copenhagen. It had then lost the first page which contained Snorre&apos;s preface, and <mark>at the top of the second page, which had become the first, stood the words, <i>Kringla heimsins</i></mark>, i.e., &ldquo;the world&apos;s round ball.&rdquo; And so the vellum received the name <cite>Kringla Heimsins</cite> or <cite>Heimskringla</cite> or simply <cite>Kringla</cite>. <small> Snorri Sturluson, <a name="SSHK" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#SSHK"><cite title="source">Heimskringla: the Olaf Sagas</cite></a>, (1915) xxv</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c15235h" href="c15all.htm#c15235h">VI.C.15:235(h)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
