About the year 1200, Theobald Walter, <mark>pincerna (or butler)</mark> to Henry II., and ancestor of the Butlers of Ormond, exercised ownership by granting to Radulf and Richard Glut &ldquo;all his land of Stayn, except what the canons of All Saints ought to have.&rdquo;</p> <small> Charles Haliday, <a name="SKD2" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#SKD2"><cite title="source">The Scandinavian Kingdom of Dublin</cite></a>, 2nd ed.
