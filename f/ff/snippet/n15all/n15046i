His grandfather, Thord Gilsson, had married a descendant of Haldor Snorreson of Hjardarholt, and, with her, inherited the title of <i>gode</i> or chieftain. Thord&apos;s son, Sturia of Hvamm, married Gudny, the daughter of Bodvar Thordson. On her father&apos;s side, she sprang from the famous family of bards or scalds, the Myremen, the family of Egil Skallagrimson and Einar Skuleson; and, through her grandmother, from the renowned justiciary and scald, Markus Skjeggeson. Sturla Thordson is said to have been clever and ambitious, aggressive and unscrupulous. <font color="green">[viii]</font> He was constantly at variance with other chieftains in connection with public or private affairs; but he never failed to stand up for his subordinate thing-men, in order thereby to increase his status and influence. In his later days he had a dispute with Paal Solveson of Reykjaholt; but he lost his cause, for Jon <mark>Loftson</mark> of Odde, the most powerful man in the land, took the side of Paal and secured justice for him. In order to appease him for the defeat, Jon offered to foster Sturla&apos;s three-year-old son Snorre. This was a magnanimous and flattering proposal, and Sturla willingly accepted it. This led to a very close connection between the Odde family and the Sturlungs, as the descendants of Sturla came to be called. <small> Snorri Sturluson, <a name="SSHK" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#SSHK"><cite title="source">Heimskringla: the Olaf Sagas</cite></a>, (1915) viii-ix</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c15222i" href="c15all.htm#c15222i">VI.C.15:222(i)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
