Indeed he seems to have had in his possession almost everything the Icelandic literature had produced up to his own day; for only thus can we explain his frequent and apt quotations from the earlier and later scalds. Apart from some laudatory poems, we know of no important work of Snorre&apos;s until 1222-23, when the <i>Edda</i> was completed.
