It contained only a portion of Snorre&apos;s work, namely, the Sagas from Magnus the Good onward, and it included the Sagas from Sverre to the death of Haakon Haakonson. It reached Norway prior to 1570 and it was purchased by Arne Magnusson, in whose great collection it may yet be seen. <small> Snorri Sturluson, <a name="SSHK" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#SSHK"><cite title="source">Heimskringla: the Olaf Sagas</cite></a>, (1915) xxvi</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c03228j" href="c03all.htm#c03228j">VI.C.03:228(j)</a>; <a name="c15235i" href="c15all.htm#c15235i">VI.C.15:235(i)</a></mm></dd> </dd></dl>
