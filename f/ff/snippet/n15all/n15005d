James / pilgrims</blockquote> <dd class="well"> <blockquote class="sources">On this elevated ridge, about the year 1220, an hospital is said to have been founded for pilgrims intending to embark for the shrine of St. James of Compostella, the patron saint of lepers, and from which the termination of Townsend-street received the name of Lazar&apos;s-hill. Pope Innocent III., when confirming the union of Glendalough with the See of Dublin, enjoined an appropriation of revenues to the support of an hospital, and Archbishop De Loundres, therefore, with the assent of the chapters of the Holy Trinity and St. Patrick&apos;s, assigned the lands of Killmohghenoc and other lands, with the church of Delgany, &c., to maintain this hospital &ldquo;on the sea shore outside Dublin, called Steyn, where <mark>pilgrims to St. James&apos; shrine</mark> awaited an opportunity to embark,&rdquo; Theobald Fitz waiter granting two acres of &ldquo;his land of Stein&rdquo; as a further endowment. But if this hospital were ever built no remains of it can now be discovered, the Lepers&apos; hospital of Dublin, which was dedicated to <mark>St. Stephen</mark>, having been built on another part of the Stein, between Stephen&apos;s-street and Stephen&apos;s-green. <small> Charles Haliday, <a name="SKD2" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#SKD2"><cite title="source">The Scandinavian Kingdom of Dublin</cite></a>, 2nd ed.
