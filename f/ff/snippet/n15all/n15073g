Fortunately we know from the evidence of countless vases exactly how he was figured. He was a man with a bull&apos;s head and bull&apos;s hooves. Now there is no such thing as a man, an actual living man with a bull&apos;s head and hooves. Is the Minotaur then a fancy monster or what is the reality behind? What is the Minotaur in terms of his worshippers? The answer is clear, certain, illuminating. The Minotaur is one of his own worshippers, a royal worshipper, wearing a ritual <mark>mask, a bull&apos;s head and horns</mark> and possibly though not certainly, a bull&apos;s hide. <small> J.E.
