You must know because you are married. We were arguing about it yesterday, and we want to know the truth. We have nobody else to ask. When are you coming to Salzburg? You know, Aunt Mali, we simply can&apos;t imagine how the <mark>stork</mark> brings babies. Trudel thought the stork brings them in a shirt. Then we want to know, too, how the stork gets them out of the pond, and why one never sees babies in ponds. And please will you tell me, too, how you know beforehand when you are going to have one. Please write and tell me <i>all</i> about it. Thousands of kisses from all of us.&mdash;Your inquiring niece, LILY&rsquo;</p> <small> Sigmund Freud, <a name="SFCP" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#SFCP"><cite title="source">Collected Papers II</cite></a> (1924) 41</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c15178e" href="c15all.htm#c15178e">VI.C.15:178(e)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
