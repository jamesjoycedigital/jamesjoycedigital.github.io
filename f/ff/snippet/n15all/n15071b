Hermes is at first just a Herm, a stone or pillar set up to commemorate the dead. Into that pillar the mourner outpours, &ldquo;projects&rdquo; all his sorrow for the dead protector, all his passionate hope that the ghost will protect him still. When in the autumn he sows his seed, he buries it in the ground as he buried his dead father or grandfather, and he believes that the dead man takes care of it, fosters it in the underworld and sends it up to blossom in spring and to fruit in autumn. So the Herm became the guardian of his buried wealth and Hermes is <mark>Charidotes</mark>, Giver of Grace or Increase of all Good Luck. <small> J.E.
