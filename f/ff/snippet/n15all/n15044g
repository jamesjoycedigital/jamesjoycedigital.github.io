His character is drawn by various writers in the darkest colours; he was rapacious, fierce, cruel, vindictive, and of violent passions; though to gain popularity he endeavoured to conciliate the lower classes of the people. It appears he was a man of great stature and strength of body, and possessed of much personal bravery. <small> Owen Connellan, <a name="TAOI" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#TAOI"><cite title="source">The Annals of Ireland</cite></a>, (1846) 2 fn6</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c15220g" href="c15all.htm#c15220g">VI.C.15:220(g)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
