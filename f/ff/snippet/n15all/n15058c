A Swedish king, Gylve, set out to visit the Aeser, who by necromancy received him in a magnificent palace. Their chiefs discussed with him the most important legends regarding the origin and maintenance of the world, the mightiest gods and their destiny, and Ragnarok, the death of the gods and the end of the universe. Thereafter everything disappeared and Gylve found himself standing out on <font color="green">[xx]</font> the open plain. He returned home and told his experiences, repeating the many stories he had heard. The introduction is wholly the work of Snorre, who makes admirable use of the conversational form so characteristic of the instruction books of ancient times. But the most of the myths were borrowed from the old pagan poems, especially <i>Voluspa</i>, which is now known from the so-called <i>Elder Edda</i>, copies of which Snorre probably possessed. <small> Snorri Sturluson, <a name="SSHK" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#SSHK"><cite title="source">Heimskringla: the Olaf Sagas</cite></a>, (1915) xx-xxi</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c15234d" href="c15all.htm#c15234d">VI.C.15:234(d)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
