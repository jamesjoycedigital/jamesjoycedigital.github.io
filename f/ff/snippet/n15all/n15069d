He has not even sex, or at least his sex is indeterminate. How indefinite the numen is, is seen in the old prayer formula in which appeal is made to spirits, <mark><i>sive mas sive femina</i></mark> &ldquo;whether he be male or female.&rdquo; These vague spirits or <i>numina</i> were associated with particular places and were regarded with vague feelings of awe inclining towards fear rather than love. <small> J.E.
