When only three years old he asked his mother, &lsquo;Mamma, have you got a weewee-maker, too?&rsquo; His mother answered, &lsquo;Of course, what did you think?&rsquo; He also asked his father the same question repeatedly. At about the same age he was taken to a barn and saw a cow milked for the first time. &lsquo;Look, milk is coming out of the weewee-maker!&rsquo; he called in surprise. <mark>At the age of three and three-quarters</mark> he was well on the way to establish correct categories by means of his own independent observation. He saw how water is run off from a locomotive and said, &lsquo;See, the engine is making weewee, but where is its weewee-maker?&rsquo; Later on he added thoughtfully, &lsquo;Dogs and horses have weewee-makers, but tables and chairs don&apos;t have them&rsquo;. Recently he was watching his little sister of one week old being bathed, and remarked, &lsquo;Her weewee-maker is still tiny; it will get bigger when she grows&rsquo;. (I have heard of this attitude towards the problem of sex difference in other boys of the same age.) I must expressly assert that Herbert is not a sensual child nor even morbidly disposed; in my opinion, since he has never been frightened or oppressed with a sense of guilt, he gives expression quite ingeniously to what he thinks. <small> Sigmund Freud, <a name="SFCP" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#SFCP"><cite title="source">Collected Papers II</cite></a> (1924) 39-40</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c15179f" href="c15all.htm#c15179f">VI.C.15:179(f)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
