God ordered it to be submerged and allowed it to return to the surface if split in two, so that Satan could no longer live there. During the fourteenth century, Honorat, a monk in search of solitude in order to pray, chose to settle with some companions on the smallest of the two islands. The island inspired fear as it was a refuge for snakes, but Honorat exterminated them in one day. Having rid the island of serpents, Honorat founded the first monastery of the Occident. Marguerite, Honorat&apos;s sister, built a convent on a neighboring island. The rules of monastic life prohibited the cohabitation of the monks and the nuns. But Marguerite could not endure the idea of being separated from her beloved brother so he promised to meet with her every time the almond trees flowered. Despairing, Marguerite prayed to the heavens to come to her aid. God heard her call and miraculously made the almond trees flower each month, forcing Honorat to visit her more often.&rdquo; (France Monthly.com/n/0404)  <br>Raphael transcription: <a name="c03230h" href="c03all.htm#c03230h">VI.C.03:230(h)</a>, <a name="c03230i" href="c03all.htm#c03230i">VI.C.03:230(i)</a>; <a name="c15239a" href="c15all.htm#c15239a">VI.C.15:239(a)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
