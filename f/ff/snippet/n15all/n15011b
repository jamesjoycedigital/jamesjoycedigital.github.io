And the <mark>third was the age of interment</mark> or Christian burial. Hence the name of Hogges so frequent in all the settlements of the pagan North- men. Their descendants, the Anglo-Normans, in whose records we first find the name of St. Mary del Hogges, were not ignorant of its meaning. <small> Charles Haliday, <a name="SKD2" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#SKD2"><cite title="source">The Scandinavian Kingdom of Dublin</cite></a>, 2nd ed.
