Gunnar, who had also taken a part in the burning, was seated on a chair in front of King Bigtrygg of Dublin, and all the seats in the hall were filled with hearers. As K&aacute;ri and the others stood listening outside, <mark>King</mark> Sigtrygg asked, &ldquo;How did Skarp-he&eth;in stand the burning?&rdquo; &ldquo;Well at first,&rdquo; said Gunnar, &ldquo;but in the end he wept,&rdquo; and all through the story <mark>he told much both unfairly and falsely</mark>. K&aacute;ri could not stand this, sprang in with drawn sword, and swept off Gunnar&apos;s head in a moment. <small> W. A.
