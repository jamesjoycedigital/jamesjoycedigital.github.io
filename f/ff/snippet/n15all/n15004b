Originally ecclesiastical jurisdiction was concurrent with that of the civil ruler. We have seen that the Scandinavian chief was both priest and king; in this case, however, we find two bishops in the one territory. This originated in the decrees of the Irish Synod of Rath Breasail, by which dioceses were defined, in <year>A.D.</year> 1110. For the Ostman bishops, not being consecrated as Irish bishops were, but consecrated according to the Roman ritual by the archbishops of Canterbury or York, the Irish clergy refused to recognize their authority, and part of this Ostman territory being inhabited by Irish Christians, the synod decreed that the whole should be placed under the Irish bishop of Glendalough; the Ostman bishopric of Dublin not being even named, and when subsequently mentioned, only mentioned as being in the diocese of Glendalough. <p>The diocese remained until <year>A.D.</year> 1151 in this state, when it was certified to Pope Innocent III., that &ldquo;Master John Papiron, the legate of the Roman church, coming into Ireland, found a bishop dwelling in Dublin, who at that time exercised his episcopal office within the walls. He found <i>in the same diocese</i> another church in the mountains, which likewise had the name of a city, and had a certain Chorepiscopus.&rdquo; But the legate delivered the Pall to Dublin, &ldquo;which was the best city,&rdquo; and doubtless, also, because its bishop was already in connexion with Rome. &ldquo;And he appointed that <i>that diocese in which both cities were</i>, <mark>should be divided</mark>; that one part thereof should fall to the metropolis.&rdquo; &ldquo;And this he would have immediately carried into execution, had he not been obstructed by the insolence of the Irish, who were then powerful in that part of the country,&rdquo; and who denied the authority of the Roman legate.</p> <small> Charles Haliday, <a name="SKD2" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#SKD2"><cite title="source">The Scandinavian Kingdom of Dublin</cite></a>, 2nd ed.
