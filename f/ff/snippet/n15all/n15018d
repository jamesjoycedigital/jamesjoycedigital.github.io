It struck off from the Fan-na-g-carbad, or &ldquo;Slope of the chariots&rdquo;, and led via Ratoath and Dublin into Cualaun, a district extending from <mark>Dalkey</mark>, southwards and westwards, and part of which, including <mark>Powerscourt</mark>, is designated &hellip; as Fercullen, or &ldquo;the territory of the men of Cualaun&rdquo;. This road, consequently, must have crossed the Liffey, and that it did so near Dublin is confirmed by the fact that the passage across the river there is frequently termed &ldquo;Ath Cliath Cualaun&rdquo;. <small> Charles Haliday, <a name="SKD2" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#SKD2"><cite title="source">The Scandinavian Kingdom of Dublin</cite></a>, 2nd ed.
