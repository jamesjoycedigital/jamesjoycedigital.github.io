Particulars about his boyhood days are lacking, but it is evident from his writings that he received a good classical education. In his early man hood he travelled through France, Belgium, Holland, and Switzerland, and acquired a mastery of the Romance languages. His finest artistry is revealed in pictures of foreign scenes, as, for instance, in his description of the return to Venice in the &ldquo;Night on the Lagunes&rdquo;: <br>&ldquo;But lo! the moon is high, <br>And glimmers distantly. <br>Banano&apos;s, Alps, like drifts of withered rose, along the sky; <br>And falls the dim dawn rain, <br>As Venice ward again <br>We speed to sleep and dream the hours <mark>till vespers spark again.&rdquo; <small> <a name="II5may25" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#II5may25"><cite title="source">Irish Independent</cite></a> (5 May 1925) 6/5</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c03230c" href="c03all.htm#c03230c">VI.C.03:230(c)</a>, <a name="c03230d" href="c03all.htm#c03230d">VI.C.03:230(d)</a>; <a name="c15238c" href="c15all.htm#c15238c">VI.C.15:238(c)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
