His first known efforts were historical poems on the Norse kings, Sverre, who died in 1202, and Inge, and on Inge&apos;s half-brother. Earl Haakon. Snorre sent these poems to Norway, but all trace of them has been lost. Earl Haakon greatly appreciated Snorre&apos;s poem, for he sent him valuable gifts and invited the scald to visit him, promising him great honour. <mark>The Earl also begged Snorre to compose a poem on his Swedish wife</mark>, Fru Kristine, and this poem, Andvaka, was in due time prepared and forwarded. <small> Snorri Sturluson, <a name="SSHK" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#SSHK"><cite title="source">Heimskringla: the Olaf Sagas</cite></a>, (1915) xi</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c03217f" href="c03all.htm#c03217f">VI.C.03:217(f)</a>; <a name="c15223c" href="c15all.htm#c15223c">VI.C.15:223(c)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
