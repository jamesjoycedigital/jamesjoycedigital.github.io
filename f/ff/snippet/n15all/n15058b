The <i>Elder Edda</i> is the name applied to a collection of ancient mythological poems attributed erroneously to Saemund the Learned. The <i>Younger</i> or <i><mark>Prose Edda</mark></i> is the composition or compilation of Snorre Sturlason. The term <i>Edda</i> appears for the first time in a fragmentary poem at the end of <i>Codex Wormianus, circa</i> 1200. There it means <mark>great-grandmother</mark>. Some maintain that Edda means &ldquo;<mark>The Odde Book</mark>,&rdquo; but considerable ingenuity is needed to bring such a derivation within the range of probability. The real meaning of the word is unknown; but Edda is now generally understood to mean &ldquo;<mark>poetics</mark>,&rdquo; the art of poetry: and Snorre&apos;s <i>Edda</i> is practically a text-book for young scalds. About the year 1290 the <cite>Upsala Codex</cite> applied the term to Snorre&apos;s compilation, which is a trilogy. The three parts of the <cite>Prose Edda</cite> were probably composed at different times; but together they form a whole. <small> Snorri Sturluson, <a name="SSHK" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#SSHK"><cite title="source">Heimskringla: the Olaf Sagas</cite></a>, (1915) xx</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c15234b" href="c15all.htm#c15234b">VI.C.15:234(b)</a>, <a name="c15234c" href="c15all.htm#c15234c">VI.C.15:234(c)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
