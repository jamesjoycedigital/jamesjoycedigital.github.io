And we have now to add that about 200 perches eastward of the mount was the Hangr Hoeg or <mark>Gallows hill</mark> of Dublin, the usual accompaniment to the Thingmount. Here on a rocky hill, surrounded by a piece of barren ground, the gallows was erected and here criminals were executed until the beginning of the last century, when the gallows was removed farther south to permit the rock to be quarried for building purposes, the city then rapidly extending in this direction. The &ldquo;Gallows hill&rdquo; is marked on the maps of Dublin until after 1756,1 and the quarry is yet to be traced between Bock-lane and Mount-street, both places being very probably named from this rocky gallows mount. <br>1 In the <cite>Survey of the City and Suburbs of Dublin</cite> by Jean Rocque, Folio, London, 1756, the road leading from Stephen&apos;s-green to Ball&apos;s-bridge (now known as <mark>Lower Bagot-street</mark>) is styled &ldquo;<mark>Gallows Road</mark>&rdquo;. On the north side of this Gallows-road near Lower Pembroke-street is shown a Quarry and over it a Windmill; opposite on the south side of the road is the Gallows. <small> Charles Haliday, <a name="SKD2" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#SKD2"><cite title="source">The Scandinavian Kingdom of Dublin</cite></a>, 2nd ed.
