For he was not only ambitious but also grasping, if not avaricious. He had become influential through his marriage connections; but by his closefistedness he failed to bind his relatives and sons-in-law to him, by sharing his power and his wealth with them. Thus, when his eldest son Jon came of age and wanted to marry and to have Stavaholt for a residence, Snorre refused to give it to him and thought that he should be satisfied with his mother&apos;s estate and live at Borg with her. In high dudgeon Jon went off a second time to Norway and there lost his life in a brawl. His brother-in-law, <mark>Gissur</mark> Thorvaldson, who happened to be present, brought back Jon&apos;s belongings to Iceland and explained how the unhappy event had occurred. Since, however, others had previously described the incident to Gissur&apos;s disadvantage, he had to purge himself by oath from any participation in Jon&apos;s death. Snorre then declared himself satisfied; but when Gissur shortly afterwards divorced his wife, Snorre&apos;s daughter, all connection ceased between Snorre and the powerful Haukadal clan. And when Snorre&apos;s younger son <mark>Uro&ouml;kja</mark> had married Kolbein&apos;s sister and desired, as his brother formerly had done, to receive Stavaholt from his father, Snorre again sought for pretexts to keep the property in his own hands. <small> Snorri Sturluson, <a name="SSHK" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#SSHK"><cite title="source">Heimskringla: the Olaf Sagas</cite></a>, (1915) xiv-xv</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c15224a" href="c15all.htm#c15224a">VI.C.15:224(a)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
