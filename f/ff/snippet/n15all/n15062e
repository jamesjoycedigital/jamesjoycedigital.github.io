The inspiration which moves men to better and higher things comes from it. And no one can read Irwin&apos;s poetry without becoming bettered and ennobled. In the anthologies of Anglo-Irish poetry we seldom, if ever, meet with Irwin&apos;s name; yet there are men living in Dublin to-day&mdash;he was carried to rest in Mount Jerome in February, 1893&mdash; who remember the distinguished figure of our poet as he sauntered through the streets <mark>with hunger in his stomach, and gold in his soul</mark>. His own lines provide an appropriate conclusion to this biogram:&mdash; <br>&ldquo;Sing, memories, sing&mdash;the heart that can behold <br>Heaven in the sunset little heeds its gold.&rdquo; <small> <a name="II5may25" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#II5may25"><cite title="source">Irish Independent</cite></a> (5 May 1925) 6/5</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c15238e" href="c15all.htm#c15238e">VI.C.15:238(e)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
