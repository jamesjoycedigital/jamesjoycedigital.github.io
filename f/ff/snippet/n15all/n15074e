A curious seal-impression found at Cnossus shows us a one-masted vessel with rowers beneath a sort of awning. <i>On</i> the vessel, not as we now expect in the hold, but superimposed over the whole design stands a magnificent horse. The superposition must, Sir Arthur Evans observes, be taken as a graphic mode and we have here a contemporary record of the first importation of horses to Crete. The date of the sealing is roughly 1500 <year>B.C.</year> <small> J.E.
