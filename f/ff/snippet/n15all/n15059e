Then the Icelanders began to set down what they saw or experienced in their own day. The first of these was Eirik Oddson who, like Are the Learned, made a point of questioning those who were familiar with the events; and so he became the first historian of contemporary events. He wrote circa 1150-60, &ldquo;about Harald Gille and his two sons Inge and Sigurd, and Magnus the Blind and Sigurd Slembe.&rdquo; <small> Snorri Sturluson, <a name="SSHK" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#SSHK"><cite title="source">Heimskringla: the Olaf Sagas</cite></a>, (1915) xxii</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c15235e" href="c15all.htm#c15235e">VI.C.15:235(e)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
