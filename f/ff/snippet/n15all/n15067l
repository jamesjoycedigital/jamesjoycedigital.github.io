But equally obvious are the differences, some of which are so startling that they make the comparison into a sacrilege: the greater individual variability of neurotic ceremonial in contrast with the stereotyped character of rites (prayer, orientation, etc.); its private nature as opposed to the public and communal character of religious observances; especially, however, the distinction that the little details of religious ceremonies are full of meaning and are understood symbolically, while those of neurotics seem silly <font color="green">[27]</font> and meaningless. In this respect an obsessional neurosis furnishes a tragi-comic travesty of a <mark>private religion</mark>. <small> Sigmund Freud, <a name="SFCP" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#SFCP"><cite title="source">Collected Papers II</cite></a> (1924) 27-8</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: Not copied in VI.C.15. <br>Raphael transcription: <a name="c03235d" href="c03all.htm#c03235d">VI.C.03:235(d)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
