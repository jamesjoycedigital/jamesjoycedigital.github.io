These made a claim on half the joint estate; but Snorre maintained that the chief properties, Reykjaholt and Bessastader, were outside the community of goods. The parties therefore came to a provisional and partial agreement, viz., to divide the movables and the books, the settlement about the remainder being postponed. Kl&ouml;ing and Orm then sought the aid of their uncle Gissur, who joyfully took advantage of this excuse to pick a quarrel with Snorre. He prepared a plan of attack in concert with Kolbein the Young, and then he summoned his supporters and submitted to them King Haakon&apos;s letter. Gissur declared that he meant to obey the King&apos;s injunction to capture Snorre. Kl&ouml;ing said that he would support his uncle; but Orm, his younger brother, who had been brought up with Snorre, refused to take any part in the attack on his stepfather and returned to his own home. Snorre had received warning in a letter written with <mark>secret runes</mark>, which, however, he did not properly understand, although he gathered that he must be on his guard. <small> Snorri Sturluson, <a name="SSHK" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#SSHK"><cite title="source">Heimskringla: the Olaf Sagas</cite></a>, (1915) xviii</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c15224b" href="c15all.htm#c15224b">VI.C.15:224(b)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
