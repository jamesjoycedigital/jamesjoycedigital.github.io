He had a suburban residence adjoining the mount and a fee-farm grant was made to him with the avowed object of clearing the ground. His petition for this grant states that &ldquo;the ground on which the mount stands, being very small and the mount itself being very high the cost of levelling it and carrying it away would be a vast charge.&rdquo; A mass of earth, 40 feet high and 240 feet in circumference, could not be removed without great expense, but the site was valuable and the earth was useful in raising <mark>Nassau-street, then called Saint Patrick&apos;s Well-lane</mark>, the street being elevated 8 to 10 feet above it. Although these documents indisputably fix the position of the mount within the district of Thingmotha, a doubt whether the word Thingmote in 1241 designated a mount, or merely a place of meeting, the want of early records to identify the mount I have described with the ancient Thingmote and the ambiguity of modern descriptions of the vicinity leave room for controversy, which we must endeavour to anticipate. <small> Charles Haliday, <a name="SKD2" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#SKD2"><cite title="source">The Scandinavian Kingdom of Dublin</cite></a>, 2nd ed.
