Snorre also endeavoured to establish the position by a family and marriage policy such as was common enough among the magnates of Iceland, but which had never been carried out on the scale Snorre attempted. Among other alliances he won over to his side Thorvald Gissurson, the head of the Haukadal clan, by proposing a marriage between Thorvald&apos;s youngest son Gissur and his own daughter Ingebjorg. And, with the assistance of Thorvald, Snorre entered into a <mark>community of goods</mark> with Hallveig Ormsdatter, the widow of Snorre&apos;s former foe, Thorvald&apos;s son Bjo&ouml;rn. It was practically a marriage that Snorre thus entered into in 1224, although the ecclesiastical solemnisation could not take place until his wife Herdis died in 1233. <small> Snorri Sturluson, <a name="SSHK" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#SSHK"><cite title="source">Heimskringla: the Olaf Sagas</cite></a>, (1915) xiv</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c15223i" href="c15all.htm#c15223i">VI.C.15:223(i)</a></mm></dd> </dd></dl>
