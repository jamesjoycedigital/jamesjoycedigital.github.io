The historic saga was biography. Snorre&apos;s work is a collection of biographies with remarkable character sketches. The special feature in his work is that everything irrelevant is rejected, and that every detail helps to illumine the whole. His collection of biographies of Norwegian kings has thereby become a history of the race, where every individual member stands out with his own peculiar traits. In contrast to his forerunners, Snorre includes in the sketches of the main personages a great many subsidiary characters, but only when these are a frame round the central figure and do not take away the interest from him. Snorre made a point of describing the character of a king exactly as he understood it; and from that character he worked out the individual&apos;s fate. For this purpose he described <font color="green">[xxiv]</font> the persons as speaking and conversing. Snorre probably borrowed this feature from Abbot Kari and Monk Odd, adopting it deliberately and making opportunities for his chief characters to express themselves or take part in discussions when he wanted to show the motive and effect of some particular act. In these addresses every word was written out of the character of the person in question; <mark>although of course the speeches were composed by Snorre</mark>. <small> Snorri Sturluson, <a name="SSHK" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#SSHK"><cite title="source">Heimskringla: the Olaf Sagas</cite></a>, (1915) xxiv-xxv</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c15235g" href="c15all.htm#c15235g">VI.C.15:235(g)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
