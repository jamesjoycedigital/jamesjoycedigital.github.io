Perhaps it would be better to say that it is not one poem but three, which relate to King Haakon Haakonson, to Earl Skule, and to the two together, respectively. The poem not only sings the exploits and events in the lives of the princes, but also describes the merry life in the King&apos;s hall and the Scald&apos;s relation to the King and the Earl. It is indeed the expression of Snorre&apos;s thanks for the reception he had received when in Norway. It was probably composed during the winter of 1222, and in the spring of 1223 Snorre&apos;s son, Jon, would take it with him to Norway and hand it to the King and the Earl, when they met in Bergen. <cite>Hdttatal</cite> is accompanied by a learned explanation in prose of <mark>the rules for versification and their various modifications</mark>. <small> Snorri Sturluson, <a name="SSHK" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#SSHK"><cite title="source">Heimskringla: the Olaf Sagas</cite></a>, (1915) xxi</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c15235a" href="c15all.htm#c15235a">VI.C.15:235(a)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
