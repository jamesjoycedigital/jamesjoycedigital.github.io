The &ldquo;Dog and Duck&rdquo; inn belonged in the eighteenth century to Francis Magin, and was situated near &ldquo;<mark>Pudding Row</mark>&rdquo;, now Wood Quay. &ldquo;The Old Sots&apos; Hole&rdquo; was at Essex Gate, and the &ldquo;House of Blazes&rdquo; on Aston&apos;s Quay still retained its sinister appellation far on into the nineteenth century. &ldquo;The Salmon&rdquo; was situated in Thomas Street and &ldquo;Bagino&rdquo; could be found in Essex Street. <small> A.
