A hundred years ago a road ran along the beach from here to the point known as &ldquo;<mark>The Whip of the Water</mark>&rdquo;, where the Howth Road descends to the shore, and, although it has long since been obliterated by the action of the tides, some traces of it were visible up to the time the tram line was constructed. <small> Weston St. John Joyce, <a name="WSJ1" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#WSJ1"><cite title="source">The Neighbourhood of Dublin</cite></a> (1921) 254</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
