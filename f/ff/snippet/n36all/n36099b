St. Patrick replies:&mdash;&ldquo;Thou hast not a bed without food, for thou gettest seven cakes of bread, a large roll of butter <font color="green">[<i>miscaun</i>]</font>, and a quarter of beef every day.&rdquo; To which Oisin rejoins:&mdash;&ldquo;I saw a berry on the rowan tree <font color="green">[mountain ash]</font> <mark>larger twice than thy roll</mark>, and I saw an ivy leaf larger and wider than thy cake of bread, and I saw a quarter of a blackbird which was larger than thy quarter of beef. It is this that fills my soul with sadness to be in thy house, <mark>poor-hearted wretch</mark> that thou art!&rdquo; <small> Weston St. John Joyce, <a name="WSJ1" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#WSJ1"><cite title="source">The Neighbourhood of Dublin</cite></a> (1921) 410-411</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: See <cite>FW</cite> 535.19f, where &ldquo;brokenheared villain&rdquo; (later emended) was entered at draft level 2, much too early for this notebook. </mm> </dd></dl>
