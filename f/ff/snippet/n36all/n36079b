Poplin traditionally consisted of a silk wrap with a weft of worsted yarn. In this case, as the weft is in the form of a stout cord the fabric has a ridged structure, like rep. which gave depth and softness to the lustre of the silky surface. The ribs run across the fabric from selvedge to selvedge. The term originates from <i>papelino</i> a fabric made at Avignon in France in the 15th century, named for the papal residence there, and from the French <i>papelaine</i>, a fabric, normally made with silk, of the same period. Common usage of poplin until about the 20th century was to make silk, cotton or heavy weight wool dresses, suitable for winter wear. Poplin was also a popular upholstery fabric. </mm> </dd></dl>
