The sky-line of this range of mountains, as seen by the approaching traveller some miles outside the entrance to the bay, forms the rough outline of a huge reclining figure called &ldquo;the sleeping giant,&rdquo; the facial profile of which is also known as &ldquo;<mark>the Lord Hood&apos;s nose</mark>.&rdquo; <small> &ldquo;RIO DE JANEIRO&rdquo; <a name="EBRO" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#EBRO"><cite title="source">Encyclopaedia Britannica</cite></a>, 11th edit.
