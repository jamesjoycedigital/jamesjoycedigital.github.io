Occasionally it is used by the husband when he has writing to do in connection with friendly or other societies, or by the children when practising music. The real leaving-room is the kitchen, rendered <mark>cheerful and homely by the large open grate and the good oven, unknown in the south, but familiar in the north of England where coal is cheap, and where the thrifty house wife bakes her own bread. The floor of this room is commonly covered with linoleum, although a large homemade</mark> hearthrug may lend an air of solid comfort. A sofa, albeit of horsehair or American cloth, an armchair, polished tins and china ornaments on the high mantelpiece, add the subtle touch of homeliness. Though small, the scullery, which is provided with a sink, water tap, and &ldquo;copper&rdquo; for washing, contributes to the comfort of the house. On washing days, with the door shut between the scullery and the living-room, and the scullery window open, the stream is prevented from penetrating to other parts of the house. Upstairs there are three bedrooms, two of them provided with fireplaces. The third is very small and frequently lacks a fireplace. <small> B.
