The enclosure, formerly known as &ldquo;<mark>Bully&apos;s Acre</mark>&rdquo;, was used for interments up to 1832, when, in the great cholera visitation, five hundred burials took place within ten days, and three thousand two hundred in six months. It was then closed as a burying place by the governors from fear of the spread of the pestilence. <small> Samuel A.
