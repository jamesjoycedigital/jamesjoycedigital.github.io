The Homeless]</font> No. 5. Sawyer by trade, machinery cut him out. Had a job, haymaking near Uxbridge. Had been on same job lately for a month; got 2s. 6d a day. (Probably spent it in drink, seems a very doubtful worker.) Has been odd jobbing a long time, earned 2d. to-day, bought a pen&apos;orth of tea and ditto of sugar (produces same from pocket) but can&apos;t get any place to make the tea; was hoping to get to a lodging house where he could borrow a teapot, but had no money. Earned nothing yesterday, slept at a casual ward; very poor place, get insufficient food, considering the labour. Six ounces of bread and a pint of skilly for breakfast, one ounce of cheese and six or seven ounces of bread for dinner (<mark>bread cut by guess</mark>). Tea same as breakfast,--no supper. For this you have to break 10 cwt. of stones, or pick 4 lbs. of oakum. <small> William Booth, <a name="WBDE" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#WBDE"><cite title="source">In Darkest England and the Way Out</cite></a> (1893) Part 1, Chapter 3</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
