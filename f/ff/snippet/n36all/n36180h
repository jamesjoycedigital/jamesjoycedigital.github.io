The Homeless]</font> No. 10. Been out of work a month. Carman by trade. <mark>Arm withered</mark>, and cannot do work properly. Has slept here all the week; got an awful cold through the wet. Lives at odd jobs (they all do). Got sixpence yesterday for minding a cab and carrying a couple of parcels. Earned nothing to-day, but had one good meal; a lady gave it him. Has been walking about all day looking for work, and is tired out. <small> William Booth, <a name="WBDE" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#WBDE"><cite title="source">In Darkest England and the Way Out</cite></a> (1893) Part 1, Chapter 3</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
