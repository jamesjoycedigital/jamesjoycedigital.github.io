The rain-water which collects in the basin is reputed to be a cure for warts, in consequence of which it is locally known as &ldquo;<mark>The Wart Stone</mark>&rdquo;. <small> Weston St. John Joyce, <a name="WSJ1" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#WSJ1"><cite title="source">The Neighbourhood of Dublin</cite></a> (1921) 238</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
