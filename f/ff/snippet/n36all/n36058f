It is related, in one of the old Irish annals, that in the year of the world 969, there were but three lakes of any consequence in the whole island, namely, <i>Loch-Foirdream</i> &hellip; near Tralee &hellip; <i>Finloch</i> &hellip; in the County of Mayo, and <i>Loch-Lurgan</i>, which is described as a spacious lake between the County of Clare and West Connought, to the south of Galway, and extending a considerable distance towards the east. This lake is supposed to have been the present bay of Galway, which was once, say the annalists, separated from the ocean by strong banks, until the Atlantic bursting over them and uniting them with the water within, formed the bay, leaving the three islands of Arran, the towering remnants of the chain or barrier, which were too high to be overthrown by the billows. <small> James Hardiman, <a name="JHHT" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#JHHT"><cite title="source">The History of the Town and County of the Town of Galway</cite></a> (1820, rpt. 1926) ?4-5</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
