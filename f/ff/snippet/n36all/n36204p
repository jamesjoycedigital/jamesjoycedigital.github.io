If such a body be a very good one, and a chela be waiting for a suitable reincarnation, it will often be watched during the tenancy of the ego for whom it was originally intended with a view to utilizing it when he is done with it; when the life-period of that ego is completed, and he passes into Kamaloka on his way to Devachan, his cast-off body will be taken possession of by the awaiting chela. <small> Charles W.
