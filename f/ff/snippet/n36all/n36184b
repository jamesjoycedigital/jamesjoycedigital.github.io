More Crusades]</font> I do not produce these samples <font color="green">[of reformed prisoners]</font>, which are but a few, taken at random from the many, for the purpose of boasting. The power which has wrought these miracles is not in me nor in my Officers; <mark>it is power which comes down from above</mark>. But I think I may fairly point to these cases, in which our instrumentality has been blessed, to the plucking of these brands from the burning, as affording some justification for the plea to be enabled to go on with this work on a much more extended scale. If any other organisation, religious or secular, can show similar trophies as the result of such limited operations as ours have hitherto been among the criminal population, I am willing to give place to them. All that I want is to have the work done. <small> William Booth, <a name="WBDE" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#WBDE"><cite title="source">In Darkest England and the Way Out</cite></a> (1893) Part 2, Chapter 5</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c09104e" href="c09all.htm#c09104e">VI.C.09:104(e)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
