One error is the omission from the picture of Colonel Careless, who, in honour of his association with Charles II., afterwards changed his name to Carlos, the Spanish for Charles. Careless was with the King in the oak at Boscobel all that 6th of Septeember, 1651, three days after Worcester Field. Nor was the King ever in such immediate jeopardy as is depicted here. But we must remember that John D&apos;Alton in 1838 saw <mark>a Royal Oak sign in Swords representing &ldquo;King Charles blazing in scarlet and gold through its ill-furnished branches</mark>, and a whole regiment bivouacking at its foot.&rdquo; <small> Dillon Cosgrave, <a name="DCND" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#DCND"><cite title="source">North Dublin: City and Environs</cite></a> (1909) 8 (f3)</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
