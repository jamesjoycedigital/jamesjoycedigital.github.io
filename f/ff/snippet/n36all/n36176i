The Vicious]</font> DEPTHS TO WHICH THEY SINK.&mdash;There is scarcely a lower class of girls to be found than the girls of Woolwich &ldquo;Dusthole&rdquo;--where one of our Rescue Slum Homes is established. The women living and following their dreadful business in this neighbourhood are so degraded that even <mark>abandoned men</mark> will refuse to accompany them home. Soldiers are forbidden to enter the place, or to go down the street, on pain of twenty-five days&apos; imprisonment; pickets are stationed at either end to prevent this. The streets are much cleaner than many of the rooms we have seen. <small> William Booth, <a name="WBDE" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#WBDE"><cite title="source">In Darkest England and the Way Out</cite></a> (1893) Part 1, Chapter 6</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
