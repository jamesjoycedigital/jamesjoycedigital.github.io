The Vicious]</font> P. S., aged 20, illegitimate child. Went to consult a doctor one time about some ailment. The doctor <mark>abused his position</mark> and took advantage of his patient, and when she complained, gave her &pound;4 as compensation. When that was spent, having lost her character, she came on the town. We looked the doctor up, and he fled. <small> William Booth, <a name="WBDE" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#WBDE"><cite title="source">In Darkest England and the Way Out</cite></a> (1893) Part 1, Chapter 6</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
