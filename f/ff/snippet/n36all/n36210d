This was nothing less than a wooden leg, which was the only prize he had gained in bravely fighting the battles of his country, but of which he was so proud, that he was often heard to declare he valued it more than all his other limbs together; indeed so highly did he esteem it, that <mark>he had it gallantly enchased</mark> and relieved with silver devices, which caused it to be related in divers histories and legends that he wore a silver leg. <small> Washington Irving, <a name="WINY" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#WINY"><cite title="source">A History of New York, by Diedrich Knickerbocker</cite></a> (ed. unknown) 206</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
