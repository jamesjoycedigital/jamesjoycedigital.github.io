But Joseph Smith didn&apos;t know this. His own explanation was that since &ldquo;mo&rdquo; is the Egyptian word for good, by a simple addition of &ldquo;more&rdquo; or &ldquo;mor&rdquo;, the contraction, we get the word &ldquo;Mormon&rdquo;, which literally means &ldquo;more good&rdquo;. <small> Charles W.
