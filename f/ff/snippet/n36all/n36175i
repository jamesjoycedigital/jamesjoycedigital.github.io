The Vicious]</font> The profession of a prostitute is the only career in which <mark>the maximum income is paid to the newest apprentice</mark>. It is the one calling in which at the beginning the only exertion is that of self-indulgence; all the prizes are at the commencement. It is the ever new embodiment of the old fable of the sale of the soul to the Devil. The tempter offers wealth, comfort, excitement, but in return the victim must sell her soul, nor does the other party forget to exact his due to the uttermost farthing. <small> William Booth, <a name="WBDE" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#WBDE"><cite title="source">In Darkest England and the Way Out</cite></a> (1893) Part 1, Chapter 6</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c09100a" href="c09all.htm#c09100a">VI.C.09:100(a)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
