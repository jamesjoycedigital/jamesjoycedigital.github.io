Eleven of these were valued at one mark each, but the twelfth, who was valued more highly, was purchased by Hoskulld. As money had not yet been coined in Norway, he paid for her from &ldquo;a purse which hung at his girdle&rdquo; three marks of silver,&ldquo;weighed in a scales.&rdquo; <mark>The girl was beautiful, but apparently dumb</mark>, and Hoskulld gave her to his wife as a handmaid, having by her a son, whom he called Olaf, after his grandfather, Olaf the White, and &ldquo;Pa,&rdquo; or Peacock, from his stateliness and beauty. After a lapse of years Hoskulld was surprised by overhearing the supposed dumb mother speaking to her son. The discovery led her to confess that, from a sense of degradation she had remained mute, that her name was Melkorka, and that her father was Miarkartan, King of Ireland, from whence she had been carried captive when fifteen years of age. <small> Charles Haliday, <a name="SKD5" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#SKD5"><cite title="source">The Scandinavian Kingdom of Dublin</cite></a>, 2nd ed.
