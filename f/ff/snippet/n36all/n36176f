Married a soldier; but shortly before the birth of her first child, found that <mark>her deceiver</mark> had a wife and family in a distant part of the country, and she was soon left friendless and alone. She sought an asylum in the Workhouse for a few weeks after which she vainly tried to get honest employment. Failing that, and being on the very verge of starvation, she entered a lodging-house in Westminster and &ldquo;did as other girls.&rdquo; Here our lieutenant found and persuaded her to leave and enter one of our Homes, where she soon gave abundant proof of her conversion by a thoroughly changed life. She is now a faithful and trusted servant in a clergyman&apos;s family. <small> William Booth, <a name="WBDE" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#WBDE"><cite title="source">In Darkest England and the Way Out</cite></a> (1893) Part 1, Chapter 6</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
