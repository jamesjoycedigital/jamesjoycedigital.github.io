M. (&ldquo;Buff&rdquo;).--Born in Deptford, 1864, saved at Clerkenwell, March 31st, 1889. His father was an old Navy man, and earned a decent living as manager. Was sober, respectable, and trustworthy. Mother was a disreputable drunken slattern: a curse and disgrace to husband and family. The home was broken up, and little Buff was given over to the evil influences of his depraved mother. His 7th birthday present from his admiring parent was a &ldquo;quarten o&apos;gin.&rdquo; He got some education at the <mark>One Tun Alley Ragged School</mark>, but when nine years old was caught apple stealing, and sent to the industrial School at Ilford for 7 years. Discharged at the end of his term, he drifted to the streets, the casual wards, and Metropolitan gaols, every one of whose interiors he is familiar with. He became a ringleader of a gang that infested London; a thorough mendicant and ne&apos;er-do-well; a pest to society. Naturally he is a born leader, and one of those spirits that command a following; consequently, when he got Salvation, the major part of his following came after him to the Shelter, and eventually to God. His character since conversion has been altogether satisfactory, and he is now an Orderly at Whitechapel, and to all appearances a &ldquo;true lad.&rdquo; <small> William Booth, <a name="WBDE" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#WBDE"><cite title="source">In Darkest England and the Way Out</cite></a> (1893) Part 2, Chapter 2</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
