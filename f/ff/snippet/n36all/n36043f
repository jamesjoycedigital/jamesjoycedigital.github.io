In the ship with him was a Norwegian from the Hebrides. He brought with him three ravens. The first being let go came back to the ship, also the second, but the third flew from the prow without returning, and Floki and his company following in the same direction they found the land. The spring was a late one, and Floki going up a high mountain and Floki seeing the sea to the northward all covered with ice he named the island&ldquo;Iceland,&rdquo; the name which it has since retained. The next to look for Iceland were two friends, <mark>sworn brothers</mark>, named Ingolf and Leif, and they resolved to sell their lands in Norway and seek the land discovered by Raven Floki, &ldquo;or <mark>Floki of the ravens</mark>.&rdquo; <small> Charles Haliday, <a name="SKD5" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#SKD5"><cite title="source">The Scandinavian Kingdom of Dublin</cite></a>, 2nd ed.
