In 1560 their fort was captured and destroyed by a Portuguese expedition from Bahia under Mem de S&aacute;, and in 1567 another expedition under the same commander again destroyed the French settlements, which had spread to the mainland. The victory was won on the 20th of January, the feast-day of St Sebastian the Martyr</mark>, who became the patron saint of the new settlement and gave it his name&mdash;<mark>S&atilde;o Sebasti&atilde;o do Rio de Janeiro</mark>. <small> &ldquo;RIO DE JANEIRO&rdquo; <a name="EBRO" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#EBRO"><cite title="source">Encyclopaedia Britannica</cite></a>, 11th edit.
