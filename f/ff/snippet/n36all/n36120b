These and other tributary streams have been covered in and built over (in some cases serving as sewers), but it is possible to trace their valleys at various points by the fall and rise of streets crossing them, and their names survive, as will be seen, in various modern applications. <small> &ldquo;LONDON&rdquo; <a name="EBLO" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#EBLO"><cite title="source">Encyclopaedia Britannica</cite></a>, 11th edit.
