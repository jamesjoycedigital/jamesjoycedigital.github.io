The Homeless]</font> No. 7. Good-natured looking man; one who would suffer and say nothing. Clothes shining with age, grease, and dirt; they hang on his joints as on pegs; awful rags! I saw him endeavouring to walk. He lifted his feet very slowly and put them down carefully in evident pain. His legs are bad; been in infirmary several times with them. His uncle and grandfather were clergymen; both dead now. He was once in a good position in a money office, and afterwards in the London and County Bank for nine years. Then he went with an auctioneer who broke, and he was left ill, old, and without any trade. &ldquo;A clerk&apos;s place,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;is never worth having, because there are so many of them, and once out you can only get another place with difficulty. I have a brother-in-law on the Stock Exchange, but <mark>he won&apos;t own me. Look at my clothes? Is it likely?</mark>&rdquo; <small> William Booth, <a name="WBDE" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#WBDE"><cite title="source">In Darkest England and the Way Out</cite></a> (1893) Part 1, Chapter 3</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
