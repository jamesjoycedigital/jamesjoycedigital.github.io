The Vicious]</font> E. A., aged 17, was left an orphan very early in life, and adopted by her godfather, who himself was the means of her ruin at the age of 10. A girl in her teens lived with her mother in the &ldquo;<mark>Dusthole,&rdquo; the lowest part of Woolwich</mark>. This woman forced her out upon the streets, and profited by her prostitution up to the very night of her confinement. The mother had all the time been the receiver of the gains. <small> William Booth, <a name="WBDE" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#WBDE"><cite title="source">In Darkest England and the Way Out</cite></a> (1893) Part 1, Chapter 6</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
