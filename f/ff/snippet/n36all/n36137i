There is reference to it in the New Testament, where the evangelist, describing the Saviour&apos;s condemnation, says &ldquo;in a place called the Pavement&rdquo;, hence I think the name was applied to this part of the city because it was used for the purpose of dispensing justice and punishment. <small> B.
