An old local poet thus describes the scene as it appeared in his day. <br>&ldquo;A downy mattress on the car is laid, <br>The father sits beside the tender maid, <br>Some back to back, some side to side are placed, <br>The children in the centre interlaced. <br>By dozens thus, full many a Sunday morn, <br>With dangling legs the jovial crowd is borne; <br>Clontarf they seek, or <mark>Howth&apos;s aspiring brow</mark>, <br>Or Leixlip smiling on the stream below.&rdquo; <small> D.A.
