Each large division of the service makes its contribution towards the completed edifice; one part lays the foundation, another &mdash; just as though it were done by a construction company in the modern business world &mdash; comes along and does its best, and so on until we have <mark>a creamy Santa Sofia</mark> which no one can see. As Bishop Leadbeater puts it: &ldquo;This gigantic thought-form is gradually built up during the earlier portion of the service &hellip; The edifice swells up from below like a bubble that is being blown. Broadly speaking, it may be said that <mark>the open Canticle provides its pavement and the Introit the material for its walk and roof, while the Kyrie supplies the subsidiary bowls or cupolas, and the gloria the great central dome</mark>. <small> Charles W.
