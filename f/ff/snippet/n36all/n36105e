(at the <mark>point du Jour</mark>, the exit of the Seine from the fortifications) and 420 ft. at the hill of Montmartre in the north of the city; the other chief eminence is the hill of St Genevieve, on the left bank. Since 1840 Paris has been completely surrounded by a wall, which since 1860 has served also as the limit for the collection of municipal customs dues (<i>octroi</i>). Proposals are constantly being brought forward to demolish this wall&mdash;which, with its talus, is encircled by a broad and deep ditch&mdash;either entirely or at least from the Point du Jour, where the Seine intersects the wall below the city, to Pantin, so as to extend the limits of the city as far as the Seine, which runs almost parallel with the wall for that distance. <small> &ldquo;PARIS&rdquo; <a name="EBPS" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#EBPS"><cite title="source">Encyclopaedia Britannica</cite></a>, 11th edit.
