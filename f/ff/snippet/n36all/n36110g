This was, early in the seventeenth century, established as an overflow residence for the undergraduates of the college. But the authorities found it difficult to enforce discipline on these <mark>out-dwellers</mark>. They neglected chapel and lecture, pleading as excuse that they could not hear the summons of the great bell from their distant quarters. It was impossible to keep them from &ldquo;<mark>town-haunting</mark>&rdquo;, a heinous crime in a scholar. <small> D.A.
