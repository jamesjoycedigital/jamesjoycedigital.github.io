The sun, moon, and stars were fixed in it, and worked to and fro like sliding panels. Behind the firmament lived God and his angels. It had windows, through which the &ldquo;waters above the firmament&rdquo; descended. In the story of the Flood we read that &ldquo;the windows of heaven were opened.&rdquo; <small> G.W.
