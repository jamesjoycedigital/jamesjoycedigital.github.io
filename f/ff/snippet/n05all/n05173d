While passing <mark>Luggelaw</mark> they heard a girl near at hand singing a beautiful air. Instantly out came paper and pencil, and Petrie took it down, and then played it on his little flute. His companions were charmed with it; and for the rest of the journey every couple of miles when they sat down to rest, they cried, &ldquo;Here, Petrie, out with your flute and give us that lovely tune.&rdquo; That tune is now known as Luggelaw, and to it Thomas Moore, to whom Petrie gave it, wrote his words (as lovely as the music), <i>No, not more welcome,</i> referring to Grattan&apos;s pleadings for his country. <small> Alfred Perceval Graves, <a name="ILMS" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#ILMS"><cite title="source">Irish Literary and Musical Studies</cite></a>, (1913) (George Petrie) 231</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: See also <a name="n08147l" href="n08all.htm#n08147l">N08 (VI.B.6):147(l)</a> </mm> </dd></dl>
