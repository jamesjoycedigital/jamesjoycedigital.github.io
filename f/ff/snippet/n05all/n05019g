Among them was Nestorius, who was in consequence deposed at the Council of Ephesus (<year>A.D.</year> 431) before he arrived to take part in the proceedings. The orthodox party damned him, and damned everyone else wh0 did not damn him. Such was the peaceful triumph of this curious dogma. From that time there were few who ventured on the least expression of dissent. Such a result would have gladdened the heart of St. Jerome, who persuaded his sweetheart to become a <mark>nun</mark>, addressing her as the spouse of his Lord, and reminding <mark>the mother</mark> of this lady that she had the honour to be <mark><i>God&apos;s mother-in-law</i></mark>. <small> G.W.
