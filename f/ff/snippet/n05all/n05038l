Bk smoke</blockquote> <dd class="well"> <blockquote class="sources"> &ldquo;For five years before his death,&ldquo; observes his late Prior, &ldquo;<mark>Fr. Burke did not smoke</mark>.&ldquo; How much it cost him to relinquish this indulgence may be guessed from a homely illustration which he introduced into one of his moral lectures addressed in 1874 to the Young Men&apos;s Society. Suiting his style to his audience, he said: And as to parting with a sinful habit, with a determination never to return to it, they knew how difficult, almost impossible it became, to give up the most ordinary habit long indulged, though innocent in itself. For instance, let an habitual smoker suddenly lay aside his pipe, and they heard him complaining in tones of great distress, &ldquo;The teeth are falling out of my head for a smoke.&rdquo; <small> William J.
