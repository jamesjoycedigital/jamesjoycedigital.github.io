That was not an age in which miracles were denied. The modern habit of criticism, resulting from long acquaintance with the methods of physical science, scarcely existed then. Miraculous stories were not investigated, but accepted or rejected as they favored or opposed existing beliefs. Gibbon satirically remarks than <mark>an Athanasian is obdurate to the force of an Arian miracle</mark>; and neither the Christians, the Jews, nor the Pagans could succeed in convincing each other by the greatest display of miraculous power. When Tertullian, in the name of the Trinity, challenged the deities of Paganism to a public contest, he was only attesting the universal belief in magic. Jesus himself, as we read in the gospels, was accused by the Jews of casting out devils by the power of Beelzebub; and in reply, he simply retorted the charge on his adversaries. <small> G.W.
