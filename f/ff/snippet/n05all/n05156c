When the Saint at last observed the bird, after his prayer, he remained motionless in pity; and in gentleness and patience he held on till the young ones were hatched and flew away. <small> Alfred Perceval Graves, <a name="ILMS" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#ILMS"><cite title="source">Irish Literary and Musical Studies</cite></a>, (1913) [Dr. Joyce&apos;s Irish Wonder Book] 169-170</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
