To classify things is to name them, and for magic the name of a thing or group of things is its soul; to know their names is to have power over their souls. Nothing, whether human or superhuman, is beyond the power of words. Language itself is a duplicate, a shadow-soul, of the whole structure of reality. Hence the doctrine of the Logos, variously conceived as this supreme reality, the divine soul-substance, as the &lsquo;Meaning&rsquo; or reason of everything, and as the &lsquo;Meaning&rsquo; or essence of a name. <small> C.K.
