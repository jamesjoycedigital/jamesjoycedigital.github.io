M. Robertson</mark> well says, &ldquo;it was strictly a matter of religion.&rdquo; &ldquo;After a captive had been sacrificially slain in ordinary course, his body was delivered to the warrior who captured him, and was by him made the special dish at a formal and decorous public banquet to his friend. It was part of the prescribed worship of the Gods. That the Mexicans were no longer cannibals by taste is shown by the fact that in the great siege by Cortes they died of starvation by thousands. They never ate fellow-citizens: only the sacrificially slain captives (<mark><cite>Pagan Christs</cite></mark>, p. 393).&rdquo; <small> J.T.
