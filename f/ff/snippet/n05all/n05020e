The Lord only knows who this <mark>Simon</mark> was. From the narrative as it stands, without any other light, he appears to have turned up promiscuously, as handy people always do in romances. One of the early Christian sects, the <mark>Basilidians</mark>, made this utility-man play a still more important part in the drama. They denied that Jesus was crucified in person, and asserted that he only suffered by proxy, poor <mark>Simon having been crucified in his stead</mark>. <small> G.W.
