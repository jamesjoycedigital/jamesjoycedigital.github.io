How undecided the attitude even of the foremost linguists may be towards the question is perhaps best seen in the views expressed at different times by Sweet. <mark>In 1882 he reproaches Paul</mark> <font color="green">[Herman Paul, another linguist]</font> with paying attention only to the shiftings going on in the pronunciation of the same individual, and not acknowledging &ldquo;the much more potent cause of change which exists in the fact that one generation can learn the sounds of the preceding one by imitation only. It is an open question whether the modifications made by the individual in a sound he has once learnt, independently of imitation of those around him, are not too infinitesimal to have any appreciable effect&rdquo; (CP 153). <small> Otto Jespersen, <a name="OJLN" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#OJLN"><cite title="source">Language: its Nature, Development and Origin</cite></a> (Jan 1922) 161</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c02051a" href="c02all.htm#c02051a">VI.C.02:051(a)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
