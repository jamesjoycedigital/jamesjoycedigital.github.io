His mother was a descendant of one Patrick Gruana O&apos;Quinn, who had fallen in the Great Irish Rising of 1642. Left unprovided for by his father, he received so good a musical education from his brother Anthony that we find him at the age of eleven acting as deputy to a Belfast organist, Mr. William Ware, and, indeed, so outshining him as a performer that his employer was glad to secure him as a permanent assistant, not only at the organ, but as a <mark>teacher</mark> of the pianoforte to his pupils throughout the neighbouring county. The zeal of the boy-teacher, reinforced by a caustic tongue, from which he suffered through life, were often productive of ludicrous scenes. As an instance, he afterwards reported to Dr. Petrie, that on one occasion <mark>a lady pupil</mark> was so astonished at the audacity of his reproofs that she indignantly turned round upon him and well <mark>boxed his ears</mark>. <small> Alfred Perceval Graves, <a name="ILMS" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#ILMS"><cite title="source">Irish Literary and Musical Studies</cite></a>, (1913) (Edward Bunting) 192</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
