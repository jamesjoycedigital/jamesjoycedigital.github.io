The Saint refused at first. &hellip; but he found himself unable to overcome her persistence and that of the Emperor &hellip;. When his small meal is over, carefully she sweeps the broken bits and crumbs he leaves, preferring them to every Imperial dainty. <small> Margaret Maitland, <a name="MMLL" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#MMLL"><cite title="source">Life and Legends of St. Martin of Tours (316-397)</cite></a> (1908) 61-62</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
