These gods, turned fairies, engage the Fenian heroes in their wars with one another, spirit them off under a spell of magic mist into underground palaces, from which they are released by mortal brother warriors, befriend them when pursued by their enemies, or by the glamour of their fairy women draw them for a while into Tir n&rsquo; an Oge, the land of perpetual youth. <small> Alfred Perceval Graves, <a name="PIIP" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#PIIP"><cite title="source">The Preternatural in Early Irish Poetry</cite></a>, (1912) 119</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
