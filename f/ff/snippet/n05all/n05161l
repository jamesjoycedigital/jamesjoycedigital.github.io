Or how can John of Damascus <font color="green">[<year>A.D.</year> 760]</font> be justified, who is indeed of another opinion, but for all that makes him come into the genealogy of J. Christ? for he maintains that Panthera was great-grandfather to Mary, and Barpanther her grandfather. <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font>&rdquo;x <small> G.W. Foote and J.M.
