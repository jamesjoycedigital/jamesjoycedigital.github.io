He was alone when he approached the Saint, representing himself &hellip; as the loving husband of a dying woman. His wife, he said, implored St. Martin to come to her as her one hope of life, and immediately, if he did not wish to incur the risk of being too late and having to reproach himself with not having done what he could. &hellip; Martin, in his guilelessness, went unsuspiciously into the ambush in wait for him, and was seized and carried off to Tours by Ruricius and his confederates. <small> Margaret Maitland, <a name="MMLL" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#MMLL"><cite title="source">Life and Legends of St. Martin of Tours (316-397)</cite></a> (1908) 38-40</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
