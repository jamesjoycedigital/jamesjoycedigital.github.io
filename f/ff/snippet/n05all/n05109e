His best known works are included in the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book, which contains 52 of his pieces. Notable among them are 11 fantasias, a wonderful and technically demanding set of variations called <i>Woody-Cock</i>, and short but charming descriptive pieces such as <i>Giles Farnabys Dreame</i>, <i>His Rest</i>, <i>Farnabyes Conceit</i> and <i>His Humour</i>. <font color="green">[Henkes/Braslasu]</font> </mm> </dd></dl>
