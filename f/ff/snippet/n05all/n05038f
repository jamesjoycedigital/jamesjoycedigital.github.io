Burke and his companions were crowded; countless conversions were made. Fr. Rooke looks back upon the mission as the hardest work in which he had ever been engaged. Fr. Burke, with his wonted humour, declared that it had the effect of <mark>wearing threadbare two pairs of the best Blarney cloth garments</mark> which he had just bought. How he recuperated his exhausted energies and cheered his fellow-labourer is very characteristic. Some rare intervals of leisure were spent by him in the Zoological Gardens, watching with intent gaze and kindly interest the various animals. <small> William J.
