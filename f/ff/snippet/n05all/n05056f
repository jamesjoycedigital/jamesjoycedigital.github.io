In one place he justifies his standpoint by a reference to a special case, and I will take this as the starting-point of my own consideration of the question. He says: &ldquo;It can be shown by various examples that they <font color="green">[changes in language]</font> are decidedly not due to children. In Ionic, Attic and Lesbian Greek the words for &lsquo;hundreds&rsquo; are formed in -<i>kosioi</i> (<i>diak&oacute;sioi</i>, etc.), while elsewhere (in Doric and Boeotian) they appear as -<i>k&aacute;tioi</i>. How does the o arise in -<i>k&oacute;sioi</i>? It is generally said that it comes from <i>o</i> in the &lsquo;tens&rsquo; in the termination -<i>konta</i>. Can it be children who have formed the words for hundreds on the model of the words for tens, children under six years old, who are just learning to talk? Such children generally have other things to attend to than to practise themselves in numerals above a hundred.&rdquo; Similar formations are adduced from Latin, and it is stated that the personal pronouns are especially subject to change, but children do not use the personal pronouns till an age when they are already in firm possession of the language. Meringer then draws the conclusion that the share which children take in bringing about linguistic change is a very small one. <small> Otto Jespersen, <a name="OJLN" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#OJLN"><cite title="source">Language: its Nature, Development and Origin</cite></a> (Jan 1922) 162f</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
