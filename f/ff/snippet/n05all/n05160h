A telegram from <mark>Chicago</mark> states: &lsquo;The beer spigot in Chicago is &ldquo;wide open.&rdquo; While Federal Prohibition agents and city police are attempting to shut off all alcoholic liquor the beer industry daily grows to more important proportions, and Chicago brewers are making fortunes. Sales of beer in Chicago are now estimated at 30,000,000 dollars a year, and it is said that the city&apos;s breweries are producing 18,000 bottles daily of the amber fluid of a quality which is destined to make the <mark>windy city</mark> more famous than Milwaukee ever was in the days before Mr. Volstead was heard of. </mm> </dd></dl>
