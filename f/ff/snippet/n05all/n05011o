There is the <mark>six-days&apos; creation</mark> in the same order as that of Genesis, and the temptation and the fall of man. And man himself is called Admi, the Assyrian form of Adam. Here, then, is the origin of the Hebrew cosmogony. The Jews learned it during their captivity in Babylon. <small> G.W.
