Perpetual happiness was promised them by Ormuzd, the creator of everylgood gift, if they persevered in their virtue. But an evil demon (<mark>Dev</mark>) was sent to them by Ahriman, the representative of everything noxious and sinful. He appeared unexpectedly in the form of a serpent, and gave them the fruit of a wonderful tree, <i>Hom</i>, which imparted immortality and had the power of restoring the dead to life. Thus evil inclinations entered their hearts; all their moral excellence was destroyed. Ahriman himself appeared under the form of the same reptile, and completed the work of seduction. They acknowledge him instead of Ormuzd as the creator of everything good; and the consequence was they forfeited for ever the eternal happiness for which they were destined.&ldquo; <small> G.W.
