First, he mocks God, creator of heaven and earth, with his son, Jesus Christ, as you may see for yourself if you believe, as a Christian, that Christ is the son of God. Secondly, he mocks all Christendom, because we believe in such a son of God. Thirdly, he mocks his own Jews by giving them such a <mark>scandalous</mark>, foolish, doltish thing about brazen dogs and cabbage-stalks, etc., which would make all dogs bark to death, if they could understand it, at such raving, ranting, senseless, foaming mad fools. Is not this a master of mocking, who can effect three such great mockeries? The <font color="green">[iv]</font> fourth mockery is that herewith he has mocked himself, as we shall one day to our joy see, thank God!&rdquo;&mdash;<cite>Werke</cite>, Wittemberg, 1566, vol. v., p. 515. <small> G.W.
