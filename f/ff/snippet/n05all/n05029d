As a rule, at first, the controlling motives were those of magic and religion. It may be true, as Tylor observes, that the North American Indians were accustomed to eat the flesh and drink the blood of their enemies out of revenge; but it is also to be borne in mind that enemies usually displayed a vast amount of courage on the battle-field, and that when slain they were eaten in the confident hope of acquiring whatever good qualities they possessed. Tylor, in his Early History of Mankind, says: &mdash; &ldquo;An English merchant in Shanghai, during the Taeping siege, met his Chinese servant, carrying <mark>the heart of a rebel, which he was taking home to eat</mark> to make him brave.&rdquo; <small> J.T.
