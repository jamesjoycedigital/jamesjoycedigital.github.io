They habitually fish for them, using the cut-up feelers as bait for conger. The usual method is <mark>to bait the trout (a long line with 40-50 large hooks attached at intervals)</mark> with chucks of spider crab, the octopus&apos;s favourite food, or else with lobster or other shell-fish, and then to pay out the trot from the boat in deep water, generally in the calm of a sandy bay. <small> <a name="GR25aug23" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#GR25aug23"><cite title="source">The Graphic</cite></a> (25 August 1923) [Salmon and Trout in the Hebrides] 282</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
