Alexander of Hales, an Englishman and a noted Schoolman, defended this custom, and the ground on which the defense was based was the preposterous doctrine of <mark>concomitance</mark>, which was invented by that incomparable intellectual acrobat, Thomas Aquinas. By concomitance was meant the presence of the complete Christ&mdash;body and blood&mdash;in each element on the Table, so that to communicate in one kind only was regarded as sufficient. When laymen complained of the refusal of the cup to them, they were assured that they lost nothing inasmuch as after consecration the bread was the <mark>blood as well as the body</mark> of Christ. <small> J.T.
