When, therefore, the &ldquo;virgin&rdquo; was seen to be big with child, the priests accused him of having defiled her, and his protestations of innocence were all in vain. The priests made him drink the &ldquo;water of the Lord,&rdquo; a beastly concoction which is described in the fifth chapter of Numbers. This water was warranted to cause rottenness in certain parts of guilty persons. But nothing happened to poor Joseph, who &ldquo;took Mary, and went home to his house, rejoicing and praising the God of Israel.&rdquo; <small> G.W.
