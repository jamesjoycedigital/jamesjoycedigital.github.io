Martin&apos;s cloak (Tolstoy)</blockquote> <dd class="well"> <blockquote class="sources">The well-known story of the divided cloak belongs to this period of his life. It was a bitter winter; the poor in Amiens, where he was quartered, were perishing form cold and hunger. One day Martin and his troop, as they came clattering through one of the gateways of the town, decked in their armour and floating cloaks, saw cowering against the wall a trembling, half-naked man. Pitiable object as he was, no one seemed to have time to notice him, though he asked persistently for alms, and &lsquo;Martin,&rsquo; says Sulpicius, &lsquo;understood that is was for him that God had reserved the poor man.&rsquo; He must already have drained his pockets of his pay, for they were empty that day; but, with the impulse of a generous heart, he drew his sword, slashed his cloak in two, and gave half of it to the mysterious beggar. <small> Margaret Maitland, <a name="MMLL" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#MMLL"><cite title="source">Life and Legends of St. Martin of Tours (316-397)</cite></a> (1908) 12</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
