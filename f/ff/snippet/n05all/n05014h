Planted outside by her hand, it grew to a great tree, under which Abel was killed; afterwards it was used in building the holy of holies in Solomon&apos;s temple; and finally it yielded the beams of which the Cross was made. Another legend relates that God rooted it out, and flung it over the wall of Paradise. A thousand years afterwards it was found by Abraham in a good state of preservation. He planted it in his garden, and while doing so he was informed by a voice from heaven that this was the tree on whose wood the Redeemer should be crucified. <small> G.W.
