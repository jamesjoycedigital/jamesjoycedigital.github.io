Any attentive observer can testify to the frequency of such mispronunciations in the speech of grown-up people. In many cases they are noticed neither by the speaker nor by the hearer, in many they may be noticed, but are considered too unimportant to be corrected, and finally, in some cases the speaker stops to repeat what he wanted to say in a corrected form. Now it would not obviously do, from their frequency in adult speech, to draw the inference: &ldquo;These changes are not to be ascribed to children,&rdquo; because from their frequent appearance on the lips of the children one could equally well infer: &ldquo;They are not to be ascribed to grown-up people.&rdquo; When we find in Latin <i>impotens</i> and <i>immeritus </i>with m side by side with <i>indignus</i> and <i>insolitus</i> with <i>n</i>, or when English handkerchief is pronounced with <font color="green">[&#331;k]</font> instead of the original <font color="green">[ndk]</font>, the change is not to be charged against children or grown-up people exclusively, but against both parties together: and so when t is lost in waistcoat <font color="green">[wesk&#600;t]</font>, or postman or castle, or <i>k</i> in <i><mark>asked</mark></i> or <font color="green">[when]</font> <i>k</i> <font color="green">[is lost]</font> in <i>asked</i> <small> Otto Jespersen, <a name="OJLN" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#OJLN"><cite title="source">Language: its Nature, Development and Origin</cite></a> (Jan 1922) 168</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
