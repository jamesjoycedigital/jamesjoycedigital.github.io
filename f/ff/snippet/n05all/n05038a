On a certain St. Patrick&apos;s Day the subject of the &ldquo;Defensio&rdquo; was the apostle of Ireland. The conflict went on with much spirit, until, coming near the end, Fr. Burke ventured to say to the austere Father Vicar, that, in honour of the day, the combatants ought to be provided with shillelaghs and potheen. <mark>The &ldquo;Defensio&rdquo; was, of course, all in Latin, and the chief humour of the joke lay in the learned language</mark> in which it was clothed. It does not appear that the Vicar smiled; but the Regent of Studies, like most Italians, loved a joke, and at once led the way for the laugh ready to burst out around. <small> William J.
