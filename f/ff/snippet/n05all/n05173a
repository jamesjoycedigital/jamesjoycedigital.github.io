They had been described as Danish or Phoenician in origin, and had been considered by some to be fire temples; by others, places from which the <mark>Druidical</mark> festivals were proclaimed; by others, again, they were supposed to be astronomical observatories or <mark>phallic emblems</mark> or Buddhist temples. Lastly, to come to supposed Christian uses, some theorists held them to be Anchorite towers; others insisted that they were penitential prisons. &hellip; <font color="green">[Petrie, for his part, argued]</font>&nbsp;(i) that the towers are of Christian and ecclesiastical origin, and were erected at various periods between the fifth and thirteenth centuries; (2) that they were designed to answer at least a two-fold use namely, to serve as belfries and as <mark>keeps</mark> or places of strength in which the sacred utensils, books, relics, and other valuables were deposited, and into which the <mark>ecclesiastics</mark>, to whom they belonged, could retire for security in cases of sudden predatory attack; (3) that they were probably also used when occasion required as <mark>beacons</mark> and watch towers. <small> Alfred Perceval Graves, <a name="ILMS" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#ILMS"><cite title="source">Irish Literary and Musical Studies</cite></a>, (1913) (George Petrie) 219-20</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
