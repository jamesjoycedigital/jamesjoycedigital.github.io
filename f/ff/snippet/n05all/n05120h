They were not members of the clan and consequently had no right of residence, tho&apos; they were permitted by the chief to live within the territory from which they might be expelled at any moment. The Fudirs themselves were again divided into two classes, a higher and a lower, called saer-fudir and daer-fudirs (free and bond). The daer-fudirs, the lowest and most dependent of all, consisted of escaped criminals, captives taken in battle or raids, convicts respited from death, and purchased slaves. The fudirs were nearly all strangers or foreigners, and it was to this class that the English slaves in Ireland belonged. <small> Benedict Fitzpatrick, <a name="IIMB" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#IIMB"><cite title="source">Ireland and the Making of Britain</cite></a> (1922) ?? 302</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: Possibly a reference to the Indian untouchables. </mm> </dd></dl>
