To him it was Bad Friday or <mark>Black Friday</mark>. Yet his followers regard it as the happiest incident in the world&apos;s history. <small> G.W. Foote, <a name="BROM" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#BROM"><cite title="source">Bible Romances</cite></a>, 4th ed. (1922) [The Crucifixion] 304</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: On Good Friday the Church commemorates the Passion of Christ, so that it is the most sad and solemn of all the days in Holy Week. The officiating clergy appear in black vestments, and prostrate themselves before the altar, which still remains stripped. Nor are the candles lighted. When the Prayers are ended, the cross, which has been up to this covered with black, is exposed to view, adored, and kissed. During the adoration the <i>Improperia</i>[reproaches] are sung, each <i>improperium</i> being followed by the Trishagion in Greek and Latin.</mm> </dd></dl>
