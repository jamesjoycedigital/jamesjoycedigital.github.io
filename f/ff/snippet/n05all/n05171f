This wail she carried on as long as we remained; and her voice coming on the ear between the thunder-peals had an effect singularly wild and unearthly; it would be fruitless to attempt a description of it. <small> Alfred Perceval Graves, <a name="ILMS" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#ILMS"><cite title="source">Irish Literary and Musical Studies</cite></a>, (1913) (George Petrie) 208 (quoted from Petrie&apos;s account of Monasterboice in the <cite>Irish Penny Journal</cite></small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: Fr. <i>orage</i>: storm. </mm> </dd></dl>
