Nebuchadnezzar is said to have conveyed it to Babylon, but according to one of the Jewish books it was hidden by Jeremiah in a cave of Mount Pisgah, where it was to remain unknown until the regathering of Israel. The Jews still believe it will come with the Messiah. Let us hope he will bring it in its original state with Jahveh inside. Archaeologists would be delighted to examine such a famous fetish, and the trustees of the British Museum would pay a high price for such a relic of antiquity, unless it should be snatched up by the trustees of the <mark>Guimet Museum of Religions</mark> in Paris, where thousands of bona-fide gods are elegantly arranged in glass-cases. <small> G.W.
