In the common word for &lsquo;water&rsquo; Greek has preserved both stems, nom. <i>hud&omacr;r</i>, gen. <i>hudatos</i>, where a stands for original <font color="green">[&#477; n]</font>. Whatever the origin of this change of stems, it is a phenomenon belonging to the earlier stages of our languages, in which we also sometimes find an alteration between the <i>r</i> stem in the nominative and a combination of the <i>n</i> and the <i>r</i> stems in the other cases, as in Lat. <i>jecur</i> &lsquo;liver,&rsquo; <i>jecinoris</i>; <i>iter</i> &lsquo;voyage,&rsquo; <i>itineris</i>, which is supposed to have supplanted <i>itinis</i>, formed like <i>feminis</i> from <i>femur</i>. <small> Otto Jespersen, <a name="OJLN" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#OJLN"><cite title="source">Language: its Nature, Development and Origin</cite></a> (Jan 1922) 339</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
