Martin&apos;s humility had hitherto kept him from asking for baptism: but the vision enlightened him. He now asked for it, and was admitted to the long and penitential preliminary preparation. The candidate had to abstain from flesh, meat, and wine for many weeks, often confess his sins, be constant in prayer, watchings, and acts of mortification. The Sacrament of Baptism was administered by triple immersion, and only at the festivals of Easter and Pentecost. The newly baptized Christian was arrayed in white garments, typifying the purity of soul, and wore this apparel for eight days. <small> Margaret Maitland, <a name="MMLL" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#MMLL"><cite title="source">Life and Legends of St. Martin of Tours (316-397)</cite></a> (1908) 13-14</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
