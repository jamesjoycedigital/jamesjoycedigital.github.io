Many of the Welsh love songs, I am told, are now used as Welsh hymns, and to restore them to their former use would probably be regarded as desecration. Some of the Welsh rollicking airs, too much associated in the past with the tavern and rowdy revelry, are now altogether discountenanced, while their instrumental use as dances, such as are favoured in Ireland and Scotland, is a thing of the past in Wales; though a whisper reaches me that school children are obtaining permission to use their limbs in a way for which there is good scriptural precedent, and, perhaps, some of the good old Welsh dance measures may yet be revived. <small> Alfred Perceval Graves, <a name="ILMS" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#ILMS"><cite title="source">Irish Literary and Musical Studies</cite></a>, (1913) [Folk Song] 184f</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
