Martin (Elias) lies on dead / young (Kings II)</blockquote> <dd class="well"> <blockquote class="sources">The brethren had already laid him on his bier, and St. Martin found them grouped about it, mourning and performing the last offices. Then followed a repetition of a scene recorded in the Third Book of Kings. Martin dismissed the mourning monks, and, left alone with the dead, he &lsquo;stretched and measured himself&rsquo; on the corpse, like Elias in the Scripture story, and besought God for mercy on the boy&apos;s soul. &hellip; For two hours he stayed alone in the chamber of death, and then he felt a gentle quiver in the stiffened limbs, saw the eyes open and close, and, unable, to contain himself, he burst into a cry of praise that brought the whole community flocking into the chamber, where they found the beloved boy sitting up on the bier, alive and quite well. <small> Margaret Maitland, <a name="MMLL" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#MMLL"><cite title="source">Life and Legends of St. Martin of Tours (316-397)</cite></a> (1908) 33-34</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: <i>Kings I</i> is &ldquo;commonly called the Third Book of the Kings&rdquo; (King James Bible), hence Joyce is mistaken here. </mm> </dd></dl>
