No doubt was entertained of this by St. Jerome and St. Augustine. God spoke Hebrew in Eden, when he conversed with Adam and Eve. Probably it is <mark>spoken in heaven</mark> to this day. For all we know it is <mark>spoken in hell</mark> too, since the Devil and his angels lived in heaven before they were turned into hell, and presumably they took their native language with them. Hebrew was spoken by Adam when he named his wife; by Eve when she gave names to her sons, Cain and Seth; by Lamech, shortly before the Flood, when he explained the name of Noah. Indeed, as Colenso observes, it &ldquo;is obvious that the names of the whole series of Patriarchs from Adam to Noah, and from Noah onwards, are in almost every instance pure Hebrew names.&rdquo; <small> G.W.
