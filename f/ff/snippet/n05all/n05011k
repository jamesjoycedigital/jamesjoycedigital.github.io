It is never alluded to during the rule of the Judges and the reign of the Kings before the captivity in Babylon. Indeed the very language of the fourth commandment is conclusive on this point. The reference to &ldquo;the stranger within thy gates&rdquo; proves that the law was not given to desert nomads, but to a people dwelling in fenced cities. <mark>Nor could the Sabbath have arisen among nomads</mark>. Except when they shift their tents, and travel to fresh pastures, they have only to sit and watch their flocks. <small> G.W.
