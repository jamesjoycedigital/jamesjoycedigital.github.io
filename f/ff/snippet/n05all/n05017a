In that case the Lord did not change his mind. But the sacred text is silent on the point, and Josephus was not inspired. No sooner had Balaam set out on his journey than &ldquo;God&apos;s anger was kindled against him because he went.&rdquo; This Jehovah is a queer God and dreadfully hard to please. If you disobey his orders you run the risk of being damned, and if you obey them you <mark>stand a good chance</mark> of being murdered. The only safe course is to get out of his way and have nothing to do with him. <small> G.W.
