But they are very plentiful. There is a run of bigger fish in some of the lochs in May, but they are few compared with the grilse that arrive in August. The lochs that hold both species are in close proximity to the sea or connected with rivers sufficiently big to induce salmon to run up them. They rise very freely in such places, especially after resting a day or two. But a good stiff breeze which raises a wave on the water is more likely to bring them to the surface. <mark>Jock Scots</mark>, silver doctors, clarets and golden olive rough bodies are flies likely to interest them. They should be tied on No. 3 and 4 hooks, or a size smaller if the breeze is not strong. <small> <a name="GR25aug23" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#GR25aug23"><cite title="source">The Graphic</cite></a> (25 August 1923) 282</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
