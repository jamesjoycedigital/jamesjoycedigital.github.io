For instance, when <font color="green">[&thorn;]</font> as in E. <i>thick</i> becomes <font color="green">[f]</font> and <font color="green">[&eth;]</font> as in E. <i>mother</i> becomes <font color="green">[v]</font>, one can hardly conceive the change taking place in the pronunciation of people who have learnt the right sound as children. It is very natural, on the other hand, that children should imitate the harder sound by giving the easier, which is very like it, and which they have to use in many other words: forms like <i>fru</i> for <i>through</i>, <i>wiv</i>, <i>muvver</i> for <i>with</i>, <i>mother</i>, are frequent in the mouths of children long before they begin to make their appearance in the speech of adults, where they are now beginning to be very frequent in the Cockney dialect. <small> Otto Jespersen, <a name="OJLN" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#OJLN"><cite title="source">Language: its Nature, Development and Origin</cite></a> (Jan 1922) 167</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
