There came a man who pronounced some words to him in the name of Jesus, son of Pandera; and he was healed. When he was going away Rabbi Joses said to him: &lsquo;What word did you use?&rsquo; He answered, such a word. Rabbi Joses said to him: &lsquo;Better had it been for him to die, than to hear such a word.&rsquo; And so it happened that he instantly died.&rdquo; Upon which Lardner remarks: &ldquo;Another proof this of the power of miracles inherent in the disciples of Jesus, and at the same time a mark of the malignity of the Jewish rabbins.&rdquo; <small> G.W.
