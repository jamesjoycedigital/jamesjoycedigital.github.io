The old flexion is an article of luxury, as a modification of the idea belonging properly to the subject is here transferred to the predicate, where it has no business; for when we say &lsquo;<mark>m&aelig;ndene rejse</mark>&rsquo; (die m&auml;nner reisen), <mark>we do not mean to imply that they undertake several journeys</mark> &hellip;. <small> Otto Jespersen, <a name="OJLN" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#OJLN"><cite title="source">Language: its Nature, Development and Origin</cite></a> (Jan 1922) 335</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
