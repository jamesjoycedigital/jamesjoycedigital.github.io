It has scarcely an instrument beyond the measuring <mark>callipers</mark>; its walls are covered not with arrays of bottles or test-tubes, but with charts, <mark>plotted curves</mark>, and photographs. The working instruments of the laboratory are, in fact, the brains of its observers and calculators, and the sole exception to the rule is the machine which has been evolved (still by the brain), to shorten the exertion. In one of the rooms of the laboratory is a plaster cast of Napier, the inventor of logarithms, who is the patron saint of the institution, because the masses of figures with which it has to deal could be conveniently handled by his method. But now for the minor statistical operations calculating machines are used. <small> <a name="GR25aug23" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#GR25aug23"><cite title="source">The Graphic</cite></a> (25 August 1923) [The Laboratory of the S-Ray] 284</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
