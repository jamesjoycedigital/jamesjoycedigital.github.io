The chapel was old and primitive; his audience were rude and unlettered, but he prepared as carefully, and addressed them with as much ardour, as though they were the congregation of a cathedral.

Burke</cite></a>, (1885) I, 184</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: Girolama Savonarola, a religious and political reformer, was born of noble family at Ferrara, 21 September 1452 and in 1475 entered the Dominican order at Bologna. He was unrestrainedly zealous in condemning the sinfulness and apostasy of the time. He soon became recognised as an inspired prophet and attracted fanatical support&mdash;women flocked to the public square to fling down their cosliest ornaments and his followers made a huge &lsquo;bonfire of vanities&rsquo;. Meanwhile his rigorism and assumed supernatural gift of prophecy led to his being cited in 1495 to answer a charge of heresy at Rome; and on his failing to appear he was forbidden to preach. In 1497 he was excommunicated. Insubordinate to the last, this extraordinary man was eventually silenced only by being strangled and burned along with two disciples on 23 May 1498. </mm> </dd></dl>
