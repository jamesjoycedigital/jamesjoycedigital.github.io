The circlets, lunul&aelig;, fibuls, torques, gorgets, tiaras, diadems, necklaces, bracelets, rings, there to be seen, nearly all of solid gold, worn by the ancient Irish, are not only costly in value, but often so singularly beautiful in the working out of minute artistic details, that modern art is not merely unable to imitate them, but is even unable to comprehend how the ancient workers in metals could accomplish works of such delicate, almost microscopic, minuteness of finish. This single Irish collection contains some five hundred ornaments of gold, a scanty remnant, miraculously recovered, of what has been lost, carried out of the country, and melted down: their weight is five hundred and seventy ounces, as compared with a weight of twenty ounces&mdash;much of it considered to be originally Irish also&mdash;in the British Museum from all England, Scotland and Wales. <small> Benedict Fitzpatrick, <a name="IIMB" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#IIMB"><cite title="source">Ireland and the Making of Britain</cite></a> (1922) 90f</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
