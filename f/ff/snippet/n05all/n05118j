It is now preserved at Durham. It bears an Anglian inscription in several lines, six of which are clear enough, written in Irish minuscules and adorned with Irish interlaced ornament. Another example is the cross of St. Oswin at Collingham with Irish interlaced ornament. It bears Oswin&apos;s name and was discovered in 1841. <small> Benedict Fitzpatrick, <a name="IIMB" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#IIMB"><cite title="source">Ireland and the Making of Britain</cite></a> (1922) 282</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
