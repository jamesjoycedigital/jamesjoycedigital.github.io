Having got this woman done he brought her to the man, and they started housekeeping, and a few minutes afterward a snake came through a crack in the fence and commenced to talk with her on the subject of fruit. She was not acquainted in the neighborhood, and she did not know whether snakes talked or not, or whether they knew anything about the apples or not. Well, she was misled, and the husband ate some of those apples and laid it all on his wife; and there is where the mistake was made. God ought to have rubbed him out at once. He might have known that no good could come of starting the world with a man like that. &rdquo;Did you believe that rib story?&rdquo; &rdquo;Ah, bless your soul, yes! I believed all of it, sir; I often used to be sorry that there were not harder stories yet in the Bible, so that I could show what my faith could do.&rdquo; &rdquo;You believed it, did you?&rdquo; &rdquo;Yes, with all my heart.&rdquo; <mark>&rdquo;Give him a harp.&rdquo;</mark> <small> R.G.
