Can any direct connection be set up, as suggested by Petrie, between Persian and Indian lullabies and those of Ireland, and can such early Irish airs as the Plough tunes be proved to have a like connection with the East? <small> Alfred Perceval Graves, <a name="ILMS" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#ILMS"><cite title="source">Irish Literary and Musical Studies</cite></a>, (1913) (Edward Bunting) 198-9</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: Right margin</mm> </dd></dl>
