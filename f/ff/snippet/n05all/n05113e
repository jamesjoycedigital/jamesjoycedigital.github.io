Three volumes of these laws, from the&nbsp;MSS. of O&apos;Curry and O&apos;Donovan, have been published, and they are one of the most remarkable evidences which we possess of the complete Christian conquest of Ireland by St. Patrick. From that time the <mark>Senchus Mor</mark>, or &ldquo;Great Book&rdquo; of the Brehon statutes, was known as the <i>Cain Patraic</i>, or &ldquo;Law of Patrick&rdquo;. If any proof were needed of its great antiquity at the time of its revision by St. Patrick, it would be found in the extraordinary minuteness and subtlety of its provisions. <small> William Bullen Morris, <a name="WBML" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#WBML"><cite title="source">The Life of Saint Patrick Apostle of Ireland</cite></a>, 4th ed.
