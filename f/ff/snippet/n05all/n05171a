He is the reconciler in all differences, the judge in all disputes, the adviser in all enterprises, and the friend in all things. A sound understanding and the kindest of hearts make him competent to be all those; and his decisions are never murmured against or his affection met by ingratitude. Of the love they bear him many instances might be adduced, but the following will be deemed sufficient, and too honourable both to them and him to be omitted. <small> Alfred Perceval Graves, <a name="ILMS" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#ILMS"><cite title="source">Irish Literary and Musical Studies</cite></a>, (1913) ??[George Petrie as an Artist and Man of Letters] 209</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
