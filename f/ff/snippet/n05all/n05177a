To them the words only gave a suggestion of music, and they had therefore unconsciously assimilated the wild and uncommon airs to which the tunes were matched. Like Mr. Berstow, they could not detach the tune from the words, and but for the latter the airs would have been lost. <small> Alfred Perceval Graves, <a name="ILMS" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#ILMS"><cite title="source">Irish Literary and Musical Studies</cite></a>, (1913) [Folk Song] 179</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
