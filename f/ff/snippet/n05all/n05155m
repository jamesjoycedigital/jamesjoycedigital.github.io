Her clergy were trained in its great Colleges, and brought home with them the thoughts, the spirit, and the literature of Roman Catholic Europe during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. This is shown by the numbers of books translated from the Italian, French, and Spanish into Irish. Yet Dr. Hyde maintains that, in spite of what they suffered, the Irish Roman Catholics were not unreasonably embittered against those of the old Gaelic families whom the Penal Laws converted to the new faith, though the bards gave many a blow to &ldquo;Martin&rdquo; or to &ldquo;John,&rdquo; and to &ldquo;<mark>the lot who fatten on Friday</mark>,&rdquo;&mdash;that is to say, the people of the Bearla (the English language). <small> Alfred Perceval Graves, <a name="ILMS" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#ILMS"><cite title="source">Irish Literary and Musical Studies</cite></a>, (1913) [The Religious Songs of Connacht] 124</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
