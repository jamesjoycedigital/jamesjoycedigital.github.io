It is taken up, improved in rhythm, improved in air, and often benefited by an improved instrument&mdash;<mark>a harp of thirty strings, for example, as opposed to one with a dozen</mark>. A consummation is finally reached. A musical genius arises. Under his cultivation the simple rose of the hedgeside blossoms into the perfect garden flower. And to match this beautiful melody, perfect words are needed, if indeed they have not inspired the absolute air. A Thomas Moore or a Robert Burns, with his &ldquo;Minstrel Boy&rdquo; or his &ldquo;Scots wha hae wi&apos; Wallace bled,&rdquo; crystallises the melody for ever. <small> Alfred Perceval Graves, <a name="ILMS" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#ILMS"><cite title="source">Irish Literary and Musical Studies</cite></a>, (1913) [Folk Song] 184</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
