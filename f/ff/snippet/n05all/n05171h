The islanders who, like all the poor Irish, have a deep terror of this frightful disease, fled from him; he was without money or friends, and must have perished but for the courage and humanity of Tom O&apos;Flaherty. Tom first removed him on his back from the infected house to a more airy situation, one of the old Irish stone houses which he had prepared for his reception. <small> Alfred Perceval Graves, <a name="ILMS" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#ILMS"><cite title="source">Irish Literary and Musical Studies</cite></a>, (1913) (George Petrie) 211</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
