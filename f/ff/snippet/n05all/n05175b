The Queen does not appear to be terrified by his appearance in the first instance, and is about to address him passionately, but, like Protesilaus, when permitted to appear to Laodamia, he gravely repels her affection, deplores the madness of their passion, and yet forgives her for her share in it. He proudly tells her of the details of the battle in which hero after hero fell, until he and her husband, King Alill of Munster, encountered one another and perished at each other&apos;s hands. Again growing considerate for her, he warns her of the dangers of the battlefield, and above all cautions her against the haunting spirit of the Morrigan, one of the Battle goddesses or demons of the Gael. Of these there were three weird sisters, Anann or Ana, Bove or Bauv, and Macha, all malignant beings. &ldquo;In an ancient glossary <font color="green">[154]</font> quoted by Stokes,&rdquo; writes Dr. Joyce in his Social History of Ireland, &ldquo;Macha&apos;s mast-food is said to be the heads of men slain in battle.&rdquo; The accounts of these battle furies are somewhat confused, but they were all called Morrigan and Bauv. Morrigan means great queen; <mark>Bauv did not appear, as a rule, in queenly shape, but as a carrion crow</mark> fluttering over the heads of the combatants. Bauv was the war goddess among the ancient Gauls from whom her legend was brought to Ireland. Strangely enough, not many years ago, a small pillar stone was found in France with an interesting votive inscription upon it, addressed to this goddess under the name of Cathu (Irish Cath = battle) bodvae (the Irish Bauv). <small> Alfred Perceval Graves, <a name="PIIP" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#PIIP"><cite title="source">The Preternatural in Early Irish Poetry</cite></a>, (1912) 130</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
