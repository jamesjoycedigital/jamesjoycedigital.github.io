This praise is borne out by extracts from several of his longer poems, including a very remarkable one on the Cholera Morbus and another entitled <i>Raftery&apos;s Repentance</i>. It is only right, in conclusion, to call attention to the interesting series of prayers and invocations, not only of duty and observance, but also concerning such special acts as the covering up of the hearth fire, and even the smoking of tobacco. Dr. Hyde gives many charms against diseases and pains, such as whooping-cough, ague, and toothache. <small> Alfred Perceval Graves, <a name="ILMS" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#ILMS"><cite title="source">Irish Literary and Musical Studies</cite></a>, (1913) 126</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
