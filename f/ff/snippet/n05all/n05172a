In acknowledgment of the generosity and zeal evinced on this occasion by Petrie, the Academy passed a resolution declaring him a member for life. <small> Alfred Perceval Graves, <a name="ILMS" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#ILMS"><cite title="source">Irish Literary and Musical Studies</cite></a>, (1913) (George Petrie) 218</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
