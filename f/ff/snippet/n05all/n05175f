The distinction is essential. Until after the introduction of Christian teaching, the idea of a life after death seems to have been non-existent. It is quite different when we come to the late dialogues between Oisin and St. Patrick, which makes up a large portion of the Ossianic poetical literature. Though anti-Christian in tone, Oisin has so far adopted the standpoint of the Saint that he admits the continued existence of Fionn and his warriors after death, the point of contention between them being where and under what circumstances this existence is carried on. Such a line of argument would have been impossible in pre-Christian times, when the idea of a future existence had not yet been conceived of.&rdquo; <small> Alfred Perceval Graves, <a name="PIIP" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#PIIP"><cite title="source">The Preternatural in Early Irish Poetry</cite></a>, (1912) &lsquo;The Preternatural in Early Irish Poetry&rsquo; 133</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
