One way of studying the inherited attributes of man is to fasten on the abnormal and see how and when that is passed on. So the walls are covered with charts showing how night-blindness, or colour-blindness, or cataract goes down through families, or how dwarfed stature or short-fingeredness passes from one generation to another. Even <mark>a white lock of hair may be a heritage</mark>; certainly albinos run in families. These are striking things. The camera can record them. There are others, not displayed, the records of which fill the library shelves, and are the fruit of even greater minuteness of research, such, for example, as the classic monograph on the inheritance of haemophilia. &hellip; These are part of the materials for the study of inheritance. There are others: there are many which attempt to put the influence of environment into figures. Such, for example, as the curves of the English birth-rate. <small> <a name="GR25aug23" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#GR25aug23"><cite title="source">The Graphic</cite></a> (25 August 1923) [The Laboratory of the S-Ray] 284</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: See also <a name="n48064c" href="n48all.htm#n48064c">N48 (VI.B.38):064(c)</a> </mm> </dd></dl>
