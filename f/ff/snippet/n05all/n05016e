But Jahveh was equal to the emergency. The priests marched boldly along with the ark, and when their feet touched the brim of the water, Jordan disparted the waters that poured down from above standing up in a heap. They held Jahveh in the bed of the river until all Israel had crossed safely, after which they followed suit, and Jordan flowed on as before. <small> G.W.
