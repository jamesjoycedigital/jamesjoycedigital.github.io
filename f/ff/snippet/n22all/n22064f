The Fomorians are always of a superhuman size, their figure is badly proportioned and clumsy, and they are often stupid and easily duped. I am inclined to believe that the Irish have heard from the Norsemen tales of their giants (<i>jotnar</i>), and that the idea of Fomorians has been developed through a confusion of Giants and Vikings. The memory of the old Berserks has perhaps also contributed to the picture. What Zimmer relates from the Book of Leinster about Cuchulinn is namely, that he &ldquo;in der Wutzverzerrum gr&ouml;sser wurde als ein <i>fomor na fer mara</i> (fomor of the sons of the sea)&rdquo;. This &ldquo;Wutzverzerrum&rdquo; is nothing more than the fury of the berserks who in their rage became big and terrible, like trolls and ogres. <small> Alexander Bugge, <a name="ABUG" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#ABUG"><cite title="source">Contributions to the History of the Norsemen in Ireland</cite></a> (1900) II, 15</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
