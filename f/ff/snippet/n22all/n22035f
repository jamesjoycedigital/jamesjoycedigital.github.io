He had many natural obstacles to success in his profession, as weakness of lungs and an inarticulate voice, with a difficulty in pronouncing the letter R, which he showed much ingenuity and perseverance in overcoming. He made Thucydides the model of his style, and is said to have translated that author eight times with his own hand. A singular account is given of his mode of preparing his orations, by shutting himself in a subterranean apartment where he studied by lamplight, day and night, with his beard half shorn off, that he might not be tempted to leave his solitude and come into public. To improve his speech he declaimed as he ran up hill. </mm> </dd></dl>
