Master John! is there no other method by which our abbess can recover her health?&rdquo; &ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;there is no other, and moreover, you must make haste to do as I have bid you, for if the disease is not stopped and takes its course, there is no man living who could cure it.&rdquo; The good nun, though much disconcerted, made haste to announce the news to the Abbess, and by the aid of her stout cob, and the great desire she had to be at home, made such speed that the abbess was astonished to see her returned. <small> Robert B.
