There were also a few Norwegians, probably merchants from the Isle of Man and the Hebrides, and perhaps the Orkney Islands. mdash; They are called <i>Norensis</i>, which can only mean &ldquo;Norwegian&rdquo;. ... Nicholaus Norensis is mentionned together with <i>Henricus Dacus</i>, i. e. Henry the Dane. ... The bulk of the free citizens of Dublin, however, about the year 1200, are Englishmen, and of these many are said to come from the towns upon the Bristol Channel. But it is an interesting fact that the greater part of these citizens form Bristol, Cardiff, Swansea, etc., bear, not English, but Norse names. <small> Alexander Bugge, <a name="ABUG" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#ABUG"><cite title="source">Contributions to the History of the Norsemen in Ireland</cite></a> (1900) II, 7</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
