It is about half a century earlier than the Rosetta Stone and was set up in Canopus in the ninth year of the reign of Ptolemy III. to record a decree made by the priesthood there assembled in honour of the king. It recites acts similar in their beneficent character to those recounted of Ptolemy V., and decrees what honours shall be paid him and his consort Berenice, whose famous hair, dedicated in the temple of Arsiino&euml; at Zephyrium in gratitude for Ptolemy&apos;s safe return from his Syrian expedition, was said to have been metamorphosed into the constellation known as <i>Coma Berenices</i>. <small> Edward Clodd, <a name="ECSA2" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#ECSA2"><cite title="source">The Story of the Alphabet</cite></a>, rev. ed.
