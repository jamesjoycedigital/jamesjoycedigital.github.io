It is nine beads in width, and although imperfect, is still nearly four feet long. On a dark ground of the costly purple wampum there is the device of a council-hearth in what was probably the centre of the belt, flanked on one side by four and on the other by three double calumets, <i>i.e.</i> double-headed peace-pipes, each possessing a bowl at both ends. Of course a pipe of this sort is no use for smoking. It is a creation of the heraldic imagination, like the double-headed eagle of some modern European powers. <small> Edward Clodd, <a name="ECSA2" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#ECSA2"><cite title="source">The Story of the Alphabet</cite></a>, rev. ed.
