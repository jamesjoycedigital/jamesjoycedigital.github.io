Dangerfield is in fact (theatre being the mode of the book) one Charles Archer, allegedly dead, a clever card-player who has amassed a fortune of two hundred thousand pounds. It was he who murdered Beauclerc in cold blood, for his winnings, as he lay asleep at an inn, The Pied Horse, in Newmarket, with the aid of Zekiel Irons and another, Glascock. In Chapelizod he is recognised by Irons, but not betrayed for fear of his villainy, and also by Sturk, who was also in the Newmarket Inn on the night of the murder. Sturk seeks to blackmail Dangerfield/Archer, and is repaid for his threachery with a vicious assault that leaves him with his head smashed, and ready for the grave. A plan to dispatch Sturk by way of a fatal trepanning, allegedly momentarily to revive the comatose Sturk (that he might name his assailant), is paid for by Dangerfield and conducted by the Black Doctor Dillon. Unforeseen by Dangerfield, Sturk <i>is</i> revived (like Tim Finnegan) and before witnesses identifies him as the murderer, thereby sealing Dangerfield&apos;s fate. Ultimately, convicted and sentenced to death by hanging, Dangerfield escapes the halter by a suicide in his prison cell, using the fumes of some charcoal in a burner he has to wearm him. <small> J.
