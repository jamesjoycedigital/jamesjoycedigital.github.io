A pleasure steamer named the <i>John Joyce</i> sailed from D&uacute;n Laoghaire. The <i>Erin&apos;s King</i>, another pleasure steamer, also operated from the harbour (originally named Kingstown after George IV.). Joyce was sent anonymously a throwaway announcing this three-hour coastal cruise, in September 1937. He was highly amused and asked his friend Frank Budgen to check and see if it was true that the old gent was &ldquo;employing his postvital hours transportng Dubliners round the bay&rdquo; (<cite>Letters I</cite>, 397; Ellmann, p.718).</mm> </dd></dl>
