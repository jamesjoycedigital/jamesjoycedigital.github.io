It does not look a day older that it did fifty years ago, <i>I</i> can tell you, There he stands the same; and yet a stranger in the place of his birth, in a new order of things, joyless, busy, transformed Chapelizod, listening, as it seemed to me, always to the unchanged song and prattle of the river, with his reveries and affections far away among by-gone times and a buried race. <small> J.
