There lay the hero of the tragedy, his smashed head strapped together with sticking-plaster, and a great fold of fine linen, like a fantastic turban, surmounting his grim yellow features. <font color="green">[Sturk, who lives in the Grey Stone House, the &lsquo;house by the church-yard&rsquo; itself, is the author of his own undoing, seeking as he does to profit by blackmail through his knowledge of the real identity of the supposedly deceased, villain Chas. <mark>Archer</mark>, Esq. He spends much of the book abed, in a coma, with his head stoved in. On his short-lived resurrection (by virtue of trepanning), he identifies Dangerfield as one and the same as Archer.
