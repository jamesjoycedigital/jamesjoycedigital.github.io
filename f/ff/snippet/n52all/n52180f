Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, harken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt. <font color="green">[24]</font> If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold. <font color="green">[25]</font> And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth.
