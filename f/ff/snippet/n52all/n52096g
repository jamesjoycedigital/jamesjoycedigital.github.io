(d. 125 <year>B.C.</year>), surnamed Nicator, son of Demetrius I., fled to Crete after the death of his father, but about 147 <year>B.C.</year> he returned to Syria, and with the help of Ptolemy VII. Philometor, king of Egypt, regained his father&apos;s throne. In 140 <year>B.C.</year> he marched against Mithradates, king of Parthia, but was taken prisoner by treachery, and remained in captivity for ten years, regaining his throne about 129 <year>B.C.</year> on the death of his brother, Antiochus VII., who had usurped it. His cruelties and vices, however, caused him to be greatly detested, and during another civil war he was defeated in a battle at Damascus, and killed near Tyre, possibly at the instigation of his wife, a daughter of Ptolemy VII., who was indignant at his subsequent marriage with a daughter of the Parthian king, Mithradates.</mm> </dd></dl>
