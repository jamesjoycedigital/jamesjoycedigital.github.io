As his rivalry with Sturk for a land agency is the subject of Chapelizod gossip, as is his current impecuniosity, he flees the scene in mortal dread of being accused of the crime. His hat falls into the Liffey and he is believed to have drowned himself in the river in the discharge of his escape. On his reappearance (after some time spent abroad seeking evidence of the bigamy of his first wife, and, later, hiding in the house of his Dublin attorney) he is arrested for the murder as a distinctive footprint in the mud by the fallen Sturk has identified him. Only later, with the testimony of Sturk and Zekiel Irons, as to the identity of the true murderer, is he released. Nutter is the subject of a side plot, whereby he is held to be married twice, to Mrs Nutter of Chapelizod, and earlier, to a veritable sorceress, Mistress Mary Matchwell. The latter seeks to dispossess Mrs Nutter of house and home on Nutter&apos;s alleged demise, but it transpires that at the time of her marriage to Nutter she was already married to another, and was thus a bigamist. She comes to no good in the end, and Mrs Nutter regains her modest fortune along with her husband. <small> J.
