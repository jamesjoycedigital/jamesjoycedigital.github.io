On finding the company removed to Evesham Fair, they engaged some local drinkers and worsted them. That night, the poet slept out-of-doors, under a tree; in the morning his friends sought to have him return with them to Bidford for more alcohol but he declined, saying: &ldquo;Piping Pebworth, Dancing Marston, / Haunted Hillborough, Hungry Grafton / Dodging Exhall, Papist Wixford / Beggarly Broom, and Drunken Bidford&rdquo;.  <br>Raphael transcription: <a name="c10112i" href="c10all.htm#c10112i">VI.C.10:112(i)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
