After stating that Armagh had been plundered and burned nine times by the Danes before their final defeat at Clontarf on Good Friday, 1014, he writes: &ldquo;The victory brought, no doubt, freedom from foreign oppression, but it did not bring peace. The period separating the defeat of the Danes from the advent of the Normans (1168) was occupied by a fierce contest between three families, the O&apos;Briens of Munster, the MacLoughlins of Ulster, and the O&apos;Connors of Connacht&mdash;for the dignity of Ard Ri <font color="green">[high kingship]</font>. This war of Gael against Gael was marked by sacrileges and atrocities quite equal to the worst attributed to the Norsemen.&rdquo; <small> F.J.
