See OED &lsquo;jus primae noctis&rsquo;, which cites EB 11, XV, 593/1: &lsquo;Jus prim&aelig; noctis, or droit du seigneur, a custom alleged to have existed in mediaeval Europe, giving the overlord a right to the virginity of his vassal&apos;s daughters on their wedding night. The jus, it seems, is a myth, invented no earlier than the 16th or 17th century. </mm> </dd></dl>
