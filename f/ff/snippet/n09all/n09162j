This, tremendously this: why not crop the ears, for are they not &ldquo;irrepressible,&rdquo; only <mark>cartilage</mark>, so that if you bend the ear forward by force, when the finger pressure is released&mdash;presto!&mdash; does it not spring back to the old irrepressible position? Here, then, is the key to their ear-cropping symbol: this refusal of the human ear to bend-and-keep-bent without pressure (unlike the obedient finger or leg, for instance). This is held to <mark>typify human incorrigibly and rebellion</mark>. <i>Ku twala matwi ku petame?</i> is their reminder that the wobbly ear is only cartilage, will not, cannot, lie down submissively; must be bent down and kept down, thus most surely symbolises its sort of &ldquo;I will not listen&rdquo; kind of attitude to life. Hence the cropping of the same is supposed to cure both such sorts of cockiness, literal and moral. <small> Dan Crawford, <a name="BTLG1" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#BTLG1"><cite title="source">Back to the Long Grass</cite></a> (1923) 215</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
