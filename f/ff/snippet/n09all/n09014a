In the 50 years before this date the world&apos;s average wheat yield per hectare had been approximately doubled, partly by the application of various chemical manures, but most of all by the results of systematic crossing work with different races; there was however little prospect of further advance on any of these lines. <i>Porphyrococcus</i> is an enormously efficient nitrogen-fixer and will grow in almost any climate where there are water and traces of potash and phosphates in the soil, obtaining its nitrogen from the air. It has about the effect in four days that a crop of vetches would have had in a year. &hellip; The food glut was also greatly accentuated when in 1942 the <mark>Q strain of <i>Porphyrococcus</i> escaped into the sea</mark> and multiplied with enormous rapidity. Indeed for two months the surface of the tropical <mark>Atlantic set to a jelly</mark>, with disastrous results to the weather of Europe. When certain of the plankton organisms developed ferments capable of digesting it the increase of the fish population of the seas was so great as to make <mark>fish the universal food</mark> that it is now, and to render even England self-supporting in respect of food. &hellip; It was of course as a result of its invasion by <i>Porphyrococcus</i> that the <mark>sea assumed the intense purple colour</mark> which seems so natural to us, but which so distressed the more aesthetically minded of our great grand-parents who witnessed the change. <small> J.
