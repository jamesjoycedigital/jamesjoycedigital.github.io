Is not the shadow the primal part of man, the man? This means, that, unlike ourselves who only claim a modest space for a footing on the soil, these arrogants claim double place for big feet and bigger shadow. Their idea about the shadow is that a man in <mark>robust</mark> health is supposed to <mark>cast a black sharp one</mark>, whereas a weak man casts only a faint shadow on the ground. So hard-mouthed are they on this subject that they push their theory right into the death-chamber, all agreeing that <mark>a dead man has no shadow</mark>. <small> Dan Crawford, <a name="BTLG1" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#BTLG1"><cite title="source">Back to the Long Grass</cite></a> (1923) 198</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
