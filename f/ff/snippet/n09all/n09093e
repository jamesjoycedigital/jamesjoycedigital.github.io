In this ship also travelled James O&apos;Donnell, who had sworn to avenge the man whom Carey&apos;s treachery had sent to the gallows. O&apos;Donnell waited patiently until they arrived at Delagoa Bay, when he calmly shot Carey on deck. <mark>Carey was buried in a convict cemetery, as no priest would officiate</mark> at the burial. <small> <a name="II3mar24" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#II3mar24"><cite title="source">Irish Independent</cite></a> (3 March 1924) 8/7</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
