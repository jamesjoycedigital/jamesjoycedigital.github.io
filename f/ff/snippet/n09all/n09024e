The primary object of scoring is to determine the market value of the article, and it is desirable that all creamery managers should practice the art. But butter should not be judged at the churn, as nearly all samples are palatable when freshly made. Reference samples should be kept for one or two weeks, and then scored. The work should be done in a neat and seemly manner. The hands should be clean, and the trier carefully wiped before it is inserted into the butter. <small> <a name="IS23feb24" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#IS23feb24"><cite title="source">Irish Statesman</cite></a> (23 February 1924) 762/2</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
