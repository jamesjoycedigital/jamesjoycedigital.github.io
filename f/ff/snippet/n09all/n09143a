The devil refers to the most awkward seam in the vessel, hence its name, and if the devil is not payed, the most difficult part of the work yet remains to be done. <small> <a name="II13mar24" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#II13mar24"><cite title="source">Irish Independent</cite></a> (13 March 1924) 6/5</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
