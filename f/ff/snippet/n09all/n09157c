No mere crotchet this; there is a specific verb, <i>Kushendula</i> = to steal one&apos;s shadow, the <mark>photographer&apos;s title being <i>the shadow-stealer</i></mark>. A Kodak with its nozzle of a lens is therefore really a polite revolver. The negro&apos;s form flashes across the &ldquo;finder&rdquo; of the instrument, click! goes the shutter, and at that moment something is simultaneously supposed to snap in the negro&apos;s internal regions. <small> Dan Crawford, <a name="BTLG1" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#BTLG1"><cite title="source">Back to the Long Grass</cite></a> (1923) 198</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c03163i" href="c03all.htm#c03163i">VI.C.03:163(i)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
