Conducted from our Zoo-cage to The Presence, the Mwata arched his aristocratic eyebrows when we proposed to shake hands, refused point-blank, and expected us to kow-tow. Is he not so great that he cannot be mentioned in the singular number, singular enough though he is in other respects? What would my Quaker friends do here? This means that the Messrs. Kazembe is the plural name of the singular man, he can do nothing, but &ldquo;they,&rdquo; yes, they, the Messrs. Kazembe can. Nevertheless this singular long with the plural name is very gracious and returned our salute with a fine cold dignity. There was an old-world politeness in his manner when he turned to my wife saying, &ldquo;We, the <mark>Messrs. Kazembe</mark>, do come of age to-day, in that we behold the first white lady who ever came from the salt seas. But know ye, Oh! <mark>Messrs. The White Lady</mark>, that you too come of age to-day on gazing upon our face, we the Messrs. Kazembe.&rdquo; <small> Dan Crawford, <a name="BTLG1" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#BTLG1"><cite title="source">Back to the Long Grass</cite></a> (1923) 99</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: <cite>FW</cite> 67.13 and 73.04 are probably not from this notebook. </mm> </dd></dl>
