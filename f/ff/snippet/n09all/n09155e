Then clown-like he acts the part, simulating a hunter&apos;s creeping stealthily on his bogus prey. You may now behold this mock Nimrod solemnly <mark>stalking his mushroom</mark> like a living thing, actually aiming his long stick at it with the pleasant pretence of a baby boy playing at shooting with papa&apos;s umbrella. Then finally the infantile imitative bang from his explosive lips, as he pounces on his slain mushroom! <small> Dan Crawford, <a name="BTLG1" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#BTLG1"><cite title="source">Back to the Long Grass</cite></a> (1923) 165f</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
