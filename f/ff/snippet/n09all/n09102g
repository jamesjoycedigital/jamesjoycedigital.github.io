The fervor of the first proselytes prompted them to sell those worldly possessions, which they despised, to lay the price of them at the feet of the apostles, and to content themselves with receiving an equal share out of the general distribution. The progress of the Christian religion relaxed, and gradually abolished, this generous institution, which, in hands less pure than those of the apostles, would too soon have been corrupted and abused by the returning selfishness of human nature; and the converts who embraced the new religion were permitted to retain the possession of their patrimony, to receive legacies and inheritances, and to increase their separate property by all the lawful means of trade and industry. <small> Edward Gibbon, <a name="EGDF2" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#EGDF2"><cite title="source">Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</cite></a> (ed. unknown) I, (Chapter XV) 477</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
