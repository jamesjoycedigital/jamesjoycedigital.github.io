They are the men of to-morrow and laugh at life&apos;s masks and mummeries. The very job of a herd boy is a challenge to Debrett. When Tennyson made &ldquo;all the blood of all the Howards&rdquo; his maximum of aristocratic status, look what an ineptitude he involved himself in. For here I have the charming grandson of a duke assuring me that <mark>the Howards were etymologically the hog wards</mark> or pig keepers, and this ancestor of the Duke of Norfolk was something like Gurth the Swineherd in Ivanhoe. And to prove that this is no mere spiteful dig at a dukedom older than his own, he complacently certifies that the Duke of Bedford is descended from a fishmonger at Poole, as the Duke of Devonshire descends from one of Wolsey&apos;s humble body-servants. Go higher still and the surprise increases with the ascent. To get among the Kings and Queens of England is at least to be safely removed from the realm of mere and conjecture. Here, then, is what the iron pen of history records: A <mark>pot-gill</mark> of Westminster married the master of the pot-house and she, on his demise, consulted and married a solicitor named Hyde. Their daughter was the mother of two Queens of England, Queen Mary and Queen Anne. <small> Dan Crawford, <a name="BTLG1" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#BTLG1"><cite title="source">Back to the Long Grass</cite></a> (1923) 126f</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
