Therefore, that one man, being a spick-and-span aristocrat, the cream of earth&apos;s son, is, and must be, a blue-blood prince, whereas you, the Chief, can have a son who has a King for his father and a slave for his mother.&rdquo; The luminous logic of all this at once clears up an old difficulty, the &ldquo;<mark>sister&apos;s son</mark>&rdquo; being a blue-blood black. Therefore, and by parity of reasoning, a mere King&apos;s son is a nobody. <small> Dan Crawford, <a name="BTLG1" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#BTLG1"><cite title="source">Back to the Long Grass</cite></a> (1923) 130</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: For <cite>FW</cite> 186.19 see <a name="n20033a" href="n20all.htm#n20033a">N20 (VI.B.13):033(a)</a>.</mm> </dd></dl>
