The method employed was drastic and peculiar to that city alone. It was called &ldquo;<mark>Drawing the Log</mark>,&rdquo; the log being a heavy timber beam with a long rope attached. Astride this beam sat a fiddler, tipping our lively tunes, while all the old bachelors who could be laid hold of in the highways and byways of the city were rounded up and forced to draw it through the principal streets, to the malicious delight of the crowd. <small> <a name="II28feb24" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#II28feb24"><cite title="source">Irish Independent</cite></a> (28 February 1924) 6/5</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
