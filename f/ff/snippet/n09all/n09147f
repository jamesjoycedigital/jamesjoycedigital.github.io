The matter stands thus: one thing the reader must never forget if only out of mercy for us who hang on in these degenerating lands. I mean, that the whole of our Africa&apos;s languages from the Atlantic to the Indian Ocean are a jingle of alliteration, and suggestive of the old phrase: &ldquo;apt alliteration&apos;s artful aid.&rdquo; Far from being a mere whim or conversational caprice, it is the cast-iron mould of this my mother tongue. And so, what would be unpardonable in an English writer as a studied straining after effect is to an old missionary his hourly and daily dialectic. Glancing back at these lines, I plead guilty to this alliteration, but claim exemption owing to this extenuating explanation. No African sees sense in writing &ldquo;God is love&rdquo;; by the Medo-Persic law of his language the opening consonant must open every other word in the sentence, thus: &ldquo;God is love&rdquo; = &ldquo;<mark>God gis gove</mark>,&rdquo; and so on and so on, all alliterative and musical as a song. Let this, then, be the defence of my annoying offence of alliteration. <small> Dan Crawford, <a name="BTLG1" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#BTLG1"><cite title="source">Back to the Long Grass</cite></a> (1923) 10</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
