Evans and Co., Dawson street, Dublin, the &ldquo;prescription book&rdquo; of that once-famous dispensing firm had a historical interest, for it proved, inter alia, that the Duke of Wellington was born in Dublin, and not in Co. Meath, and also that the date of his birth was April 29, and not on May 1, as generally stated. Now, as a fact, under date of &ldquo;Sunday, the 30th of April, 1760,&rdquo; the entry in the prescription book runs:&mdash;&rdquo;The following medicines were dispensed for the Countess of Mornington and her infant, the Hon. Arthur Wellesley,&rdquo; duly signed by Sir Fielding Ould, Master of the Rotunda Hospital. Among the items for the infant child were a compound of <mark>fennel water, aniseed, manna and syrup of roses</mark>. <small> <a name="FJ27feb24" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#FJ27feb24"><cite title="source">Freeman's Journal</cite></a> (27 February 1924) 8/5-6</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
