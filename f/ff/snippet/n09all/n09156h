There you have a dozen natives grouped round a small pot and you can see the boiling-water ordeal appealed to. That is to say, so <mark>hard-mouthed</mark> is the negro that both sides brazen out their denial of a crime until the only resort is the scalding-water ordeal. What has driven them into this stupid legal <i>cul-de-sac</i>? The hard cross-swearing of a nation of liars is such that they are forced to gamble away the decision by appealing to the &ldquo;poison&rdquo; test. Hardness of mouth could not decide the matter, hence they demand the &ldquo;boiling-water&rdquo; test, in order to make the decision hinge on hardness of skin. What with hard mouths and hard skins no wonder the Africans are such a hard lot. <small> Dan Crawford, <a name="BTLG1" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#BTLG1"><cite title="source">Back to the Long Grass</cite></a> (1923) 183</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
