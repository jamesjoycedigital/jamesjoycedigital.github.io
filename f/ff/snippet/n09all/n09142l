Should however, the wind unexpectedly shift round so that the side on which the sheets are made fast becomes the weather, or windy side, then these sheets are &ldquo;in the wind,&rdquo; and the vessel staggers and yaws about in a manner rather reminiscent of a person intoxicated. <small> <a name="II13mar24" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#II13mar24"><cite title="source">Irish Independent</cite></a> (13 March 1924) 6/5</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
