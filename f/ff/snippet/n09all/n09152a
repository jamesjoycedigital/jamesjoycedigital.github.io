It first smiled, then caressed, then soothed, then seduced and finally damns him. Of course, having sold his soul for hemp, this old man will on emergency give anything for a smoke, a common price being the bartering of one of his many wives for a small packet of hemp a wife for a smoke. (They have no payments in cash, remember; no cash, only kind, and that kind the best kind, the humankind.) Nor can we laugh when we recall the fact that only yesterday the great British poet who received the Nobel prize wrote: <br>&ldquo;<i>A woman is only a woman <br>And a good cigar is a smoke.</i>&rdquo; <br>Yet across river old Mushidi sang another song on this subject of smoking. He was a <mark>tobacco-fiend</mark> in the otherway-round sense of the phrase; in all his territory it was criminal to try it on as either snuff or smoke.&rdquo; <small> Dan Crawford, <a name="BTLG1" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#BTLG1"><cite title="source">Back to the Long Grass</cite></a> (1923) 100</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
