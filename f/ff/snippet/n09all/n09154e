The curious (shall I say contemptible?) cause of this ever-increasing heap is a fall, the fall of some previous traveller who came a cropper on the slippery path. Hence this cairn of contempt, literally &ldquo;stones of stumbling,&rdquo; thrown as a taunt on the great and growing heap. Why should a two-legged man fall? Why become a baby again grovelling on the ground? All this the jeering cairn says to passers-by, and the hint has in it the double dig of a double fall, material and moral. Thus do they trumpet abroad their African self-righteousness, casting a stone with gusto at the contretemps of their fellow who fell. That cairn for the &ldquo;down dog&rdquo; is a continental symbol of the negro custom of swooping down on any unfortunate and glorying against him. Never a thought that thereby they are cutting down the bridge they themselves will wish to cross one dark day, their day of visitation. <small> Dan Crawford, <a name="BTLG1" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#BTLG1"><cite title="source">Back to the Long Grass</cite></a> (1923) 145</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
