Their names are either Kanyembo, Kinyanta, Lukwesa, Kapumba or some other high-sounding name of the Kazembe dynasty, and beyond this royal nomenclature they seem to know nothing. Fancy England full of bouncing boys called only after Tudor and Hanoverian kings. These small boys are encyclopaedic, any one of them singing out a long string of obscure forest insects, all, all, as utterly lost to a foreigner as needle in haystack. Indeed, this black walking encyclopaedia jabbers so endlessly that you regret he cannot be treated like the one bound in leather at least you can shut that up. Here you have a precious little piece of impertinence (&aelig;tat 7) spouting natural history like a professor. The only book he knows is this big many-paged volume of Nature: and (pedagogues, please ponder) that book he knows so well simply because he does not know it is a book. I mean that each morning he springs from his mat to enter this vast library of Nature, poking into every nook of the forest in a far fresher way than we can poke into dry-as-dust books. And why not fresh, for this thing is, whereas the dry book merely tells about it. Surely, this is the meaning of that unfathomably French phrase for playing truant at school, &ldquo;<i>il fait l&apos;&eacute;cole buissonni&egrave;re</i>&rdquo;? <small> Dan Crawford, <a name="BTLG1" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#BTLG1"><cite title="source">Back to the Long Grass</cite></a> (1923) 125</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: hedge-school: an open air school (formerly in Ireland). </mm> </dd></dl>
