Their bounds meet at a stone standing near the castle of Kyllari, in Meath, which stone is called the navel of Ireland, because it stands in the middle of the country. Hence that part of Ireland is called Meath (Media), because it lies in the middle of the island; but it formed neither of the five famous provinces whose names I have before mentioned. For, when the aforesaid five brothers, Gandius, Genandius, Sagandius, Rutherrargus, and Slanius, had divided the island into five parts, each of these parts had a small portion of Meath, abutting on the stone just mentioned <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> In process of time <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> Slanius alone obtained the monarchy of the whole of Ireland.<font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> He first reunited the five portions of Meath, and forming them into one province, appropriating the whole of Meath to the royal table. </mm> </dd></dl>
