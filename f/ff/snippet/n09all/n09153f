This is <i>chifu cha nguluve</i> <mark>= a pig&apos;s stomach affair</mark>, and refers to their notorious custom when cutting up a pig, that all or any portion of the pig is bestowable except its <i>infra dig.</i> stomach. This is neither saleable nor stealable; anyone can off with it, no &ldquo;by your leave&rdquo; being necessary. <small> Dan Crawford, <a name="BTLG1" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#BTLG1"><cite title="source">Back to the Long Grass</cite></a> (1923) 120</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c03159k" href="c03all.htm#c03159k">VI.C.03:159(k)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
