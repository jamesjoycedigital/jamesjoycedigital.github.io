For what do you think? The same flood that destroyed the bridge is now swirling round the roots of a famous tree, a tree hundreds of years old, growing on the bank. Many a flood so attacked it in the past, and the river lost the battle; year after year the great tree stood strong. You, my reader, can shrug a doubtful, though indulgent shoulder if you care to&mdash;but, I say, <mark>let the Angels</mark> finish this story, please. Truth to tell, the very flood that swept away the old bridge is now going to give us a better one. The end of all things has come at last, the long-defeated river wins the day and crash! falls that giant tree right across the river, bridging it automatically as never engineer could dare do. Can you blame us, pace Pecksniff, for politely raising our voice half an octave in a joyous cry of thanksgiving? <small> Dan Crawford, <a name="BTLG1" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#BTLG1"><cite title="source">Back to the Long Grass</cite></a> (1923) 206</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
