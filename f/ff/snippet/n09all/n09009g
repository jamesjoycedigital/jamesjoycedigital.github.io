In January 1817, these vaults had been rented, and the following entry duly appeared in the Minute Book of the Pro-Cathedral authorities &hellip; &lsquo;Ordered&mdash;That the vaults be cleaned out immediately and prepared for the admission of spirits.&rsquo; During the seven years that the <mark>vaults were used as a sort of bonded stores</mark>, the rent accruing brought into the building fund the tidy sum of &pound;2,075. As is well known, the <mark>&ldquo;Metropolitan Chapel&rdquo;</mark> (for so the Pro-Cathedral was designated in 1824) was practically completed in 1824, and it was formally opened on November 14, 1825. <small> <a name="FJ16feb24" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#FJ16feb24"><cite title="source">Freeman's Journal</cite></a> (16 February 1924) 8/5</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
