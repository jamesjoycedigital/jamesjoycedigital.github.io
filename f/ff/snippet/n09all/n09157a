Then came the riverine trouble that long after was to be re-enacted many a time in Africa. Let Rankin, the &ldquo;wee piecer,&rdquo; tell the tale of his chum David. &ldquo;The proprietors of Blantyre cotton mill,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;assumed Potentate power over their employees, even in non-working hours.&rdquo; Which they had no shadow of right to do, except by an unjust law of their own making. They interdicted their employees from walking on the <mark>bonnie banks</mark> of Clyde at the back of their works; a great grievance this to the workers, more especially on fine summer evenings. <small> Dan Crawford, <a name="BTLG1" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#BTLG1"><cite title="source">Back to the Long Grass</cite></a> (1923) 196</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
