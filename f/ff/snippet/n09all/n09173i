In 1856 inn Neamderthal, a ravine near the village of Hochdal between Dusseldorf and Elberfeld, Rhenish Prussia, were discovered in a Quaternary bed in the Feldhofen Cave human remains, which have been referred to a type commonly called Neanderthal Man. The bones found were a brain-cap - distinguished by enormous superciliary rings -, two femora, two humeri and other fragments. Neanderthal Man represents the oldest known dolichocephalic race of Europe. </mm> </dd></dl>
