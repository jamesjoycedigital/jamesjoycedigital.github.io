This Christian King is almost as intolerant as the Wahhabees. Palgrave tells how he once asked a doctor of that sect which were the great sins. &ldquo;Putting on a profound air, ... he uttered his oracle, that &lsquo;the first of the great sins is the giving divine honours to a creature.&rsquo; ... &lsquo;Of course,&rdquo; I replied, &lsquo;the enormity of such a sin is beyond all doubt. But, if this be the first, there must be a second; what is it?&rsquo; &lsquo;<i>Drinking the shameful</i>&rsquo; (in English, &lsquo;<mark>Smoking tobacco</mark>&rsquo;) was the unhesitating answer. &lsquo;And murder and adultery and false witness?&rsquo; I suggested. &lsquo;God is merciful and forgiving,&rsquo; rejoined my friend. All this is analogous to Africa, for &lsquo;drinking&rsquo; (<i>nwa</i>) tobacco is their very phrase. <small> Dan Crawford, <a name="BTLG1" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#BTLG1"><cite title="source">Back to the Long Grass</cite></a> (1923) 101</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
