As the works of the creation had been finished in six days, their duration in their present state, according to a tradition which was attributed to the prophet Elijah, was fixed to six thousand years. By the same analogy it was inferred that this long period of labor and contention, which was now almost elapsed, would be succeeded by a joyful Sabbath of a thousand years; and that Christ, with the triumphant band of the saints and the elect who had escaped death, or who had been miraculously revived, would reign upon earth till the time appointed for the last and general resurrection. <small> Edward Gibbon, <a name="EGDF2" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#EGDF2"><cite title="source">Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</cite></a> (ed. unknown) I, (Chapter XV) 453-4</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
