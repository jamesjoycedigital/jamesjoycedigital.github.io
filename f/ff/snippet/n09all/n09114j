From this, by the aid of civilization, reason and philosophy, there is gradually developed the civil, occult wisdom. The continual, slow and laborious progress from the one to the other is that which really constitutes history. <small> <cite a>&ldquo;VICO&rdquo;</cite></a> <a name="EBVS" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#EBVS"><cite title="source">Encyclopaedia Britannica</cite></a>, 11th edit.
