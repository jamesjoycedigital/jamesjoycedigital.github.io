Why demand that the African should have the self-same verbal mould as ourselves? Who ever heard of a past-tense noun? Yet, such is the Chibemba phrase, <i>ine wa fikile mailo</i> = <mark>I the-yesterday-arrived-one</mark>. Or a future tense noun: <i>imwe va kesa mailo</i> = <mark>You the-will-come-to-morrow ones</mark>. Here, then, you have a verb easily a noun and in all its tortuous tenses, too. Yet the oncoming English translator, with the deft touch of long malpractice, will politely and particularly kill all this. Kill it because English has no past tense noun, then (bow-wow!) why should &ldquo;lesser breeds&rdquo; have the same? <small> Dan Crawford, <a name="BTLG1" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#BTLG1"><cite title="source">Back to the Long Grass</cite></a> (1923) 120</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
