Contrast our stingy English three genders (or classes) with this solid sixteen in Africa. And our indelicacy of making feminine gender the mark of a class. The African may be nude, but when he looks round Nature to classify all things, he wouldn&apos;t dare, as we have done, to fasten on <mark>sex as mark of gender</mark>, i.e. class. Besides they are so conceivably many that he can only do it on the modest minimum of sixteen divisions or classes (i.e. genders, same word). Thus things are categorised as (1) living or dead; as (2) long and streaky or short or stubby; as (3) soft, flabby or hard and unyielding; as (4) augmentative or diminutive; and above all&mdash;oh! stroke of grammatical genius&mdash;as (5) abstract, the great abstract class that comprehends wisdom, glory, love and the like. <small> Dan Crawford, <a name="BTLG1" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#BTLG1"><cite title="source">Back to the Long Grass</cite></a> (1923) 119</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
