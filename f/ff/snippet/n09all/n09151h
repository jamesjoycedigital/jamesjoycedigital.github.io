Far across the Luapula marshes the natives cock their ears to receive its tell-tale messages. Is a white man approaching, and is the said white a Missionary, not a warrior? Does he wear a blue, black or white coat, or no coat at all? Yea, all these things are nimbly told out by the mighty tambour-telephono Mondo. Is it peace? Then its sibilant whispers voice the same. Is it joy? Then this <mark>local Reuter</mark> throbs out the pleasing news thereof. Is it, alas! sorrow, even the sorrow of death? Then it moans out the name and address of mortal man, mortal malady. At the villages ahead we find the news has all been so telegraphed on, and a common phrase is &ldquo;We heard per Mondo last night that accredited travellers were setting out,&rdquo; or &ldquo;per Mondo came the warning of possible attack from the west,&rdquo; etc. <small> Dan Crawford, <a name="BTLG1" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#BTLG1"><cite title="source">Back to the Long Grass</cite></a> (1923) 103</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
