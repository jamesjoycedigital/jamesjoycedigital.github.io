It has been practically the queen of the garden since the beginning of February, from which it also takes the more pious name of &ldquo;<mark>Candlemas Flower</mark>,&rdquo; the feast of &ldquo;Candlemas,&rdquo; or the Purification, occurring on the 2nd of the month. It has been remarked that, unlike other flowers, the blossoming of the snowdrop is little (if at all) influenced by weather conditions. With the beginning of February it is sure to appear, though the snow be on the ground; and even if &ldquo;forced&rdquo; in a green house, the blossoming refuses to be earlier. <small> <a name="FJ27feb24" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#FJ27feb24"><cite title="source">Freeman's Journal</cite></a> (27 February 1924) 8/6</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
