It certainly seems a sleepy sort of arithmetic, sleepy but sure, for his &ldquo;tortoise-total&rdquo; gains in accuracy what it has lost in speed. Better protract than subtract. Look at the gains he has for the pains of scratching down the five lines IIIII instead of our abrupt figure 5. Watch, I say, what we lose: even Oxford is oblivious of the pains we pay for our gains. For at this point the Luban etymology becomes sarcastic about <mark>&ldquo;counting,&rdquo; the verb is</mark> <i>soroshya</i> or <i>vala</i>, lit. <mark>to &ldquo;one&rdquo;</mark> things. Sarcastic, I mean, for when we dash down 5 or 9 on paper, how often do we recall that we are really saying 5 ones, 9 ones, etc.? <small> Dan Crawford, <a name="BTLG1" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#BTLG1"><cite title="source">Back to the Long Grass</cite></a> (1923) 217</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
