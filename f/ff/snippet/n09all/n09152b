The most extraordinary part of his extraordinary procedure is this: Kazembe dines to the music of a <mark>torrent of curses</mark>, two old doctors being famous &ldquo;maledictors&rdquo; who pour out a cataract of vituperation on the great Mwata&apos;s head. This cursing all happens in a private dining-room where the royal glutton squats <mark>behind a large veil</mark> covering his face, and the curious process of mastication is as inelegant as their own word coined to describe it, the &ldquo;guzzling&rdquo; it is called. Which being interpreted means that it is taboo for the great Mwata to take more than <mark>one bite</mark> of food, hence the curious &ldquo;python&rdquo; method of swallowing at one gasp a great junk. <small> Dan Crawford, <a name="BTLG1" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#BTLG1"><cite title="source">Back to the Long Grass</cite></a> (1923) 104</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
