A well-developed river system has in fact many equally important and widely-separated sources, the most distant from the mouth, the highest, or even that of largest initial volume not being necessarily of greater geographical interest than the rest. <small> <a name="EBGG" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#EBGG"><cite title="source">&ldquo;GEOGRAPHY&rdquo;Encyclopaedia Britannica</cite></a>, 11th edit.
