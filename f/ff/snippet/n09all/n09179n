Thus new land forms are created &mdash; valleys of curious complexity, for example &mdash; by the &ldquo;capture&rdquo; and diversion of the water of one river by another, leading to a change of watershed. &hellip; The slope of the river bed diminishes until the plain compels the river to move slowly, swinging in <i>meanders</i> proportioned to its size, and gradually, controlled by the flattening land, ceasing to transport material, but raising its banks and silting up its bed by the dropped sediment, until, split up and <b>shoaled</b>, its distributaries struggle across its delta to the sea. <small> <a name="EBGG" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#EBGG"><cite title="source">&ldquo;GEOGRAPHY&rdquo;Encyclopaedia Britannica</cite></a>, 11th edit.
