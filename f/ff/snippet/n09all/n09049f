The late R. B. Townsend, in his interesting travel-book, &ldquo;The Tenderfoot in New Mexico,&rdquo; explains that <mark>creasing a horse is shooting him through the top of the neck, so as temporarily to paralyze</mark> the beast by grazing the spinal column. An inch too high and you miss him altogether; an inch too low and you kill him. Therefore, according to this interpretation of the word, &ldquo;creasing&rdquo; does not mean &ldquo;killing.&rdquo; <small> <a name="FJ25feb24" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#FJ25feb24"><cite title="source">Freeman's Journal</cite></a> (25 February 1924) 8/6</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
