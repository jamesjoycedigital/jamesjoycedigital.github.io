Carriages to set down at Cazembe a couple of hundred miles or so south of Burton&apos;s Lake Tanganyika.&rdquo; Even the natives saw what was on, and this Livingstone, who sets and keeps the tone of our chronicle, is known as WALAALA PA MAAVA, <mark>Mr. He-sleeps-on-the-waves</mark>. Every day getting grimmer, greyer and graver, this verbal snapshot of him reveals how it was only the pressure of ironclad necessity that urged him on, splashing all the way. You smile at this geographic nickname of his still surviving when you recall Livingstone&apos;s own prophecy: &ldquo;I asked about the waters, questioned and cross-questioned until I was almost afraid of being set down as afflicted with hydrocephalus.&rdquo; In all the literature of baffled endeavour it is practically certain that no explorer ever scored such a cent, per cent, success. For to have &ldquo;water on the brain&rdquo; is the idiomatic equivalent for &ldquo;sleeping on the waves.&rdquo; The very thing he prophesied they would think of him is the very thing they say of him to-day. <small> Dan Crawford, <a name="BTLG1" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#BTLG1"><cite title="source">Back to the Long Grass</cite></a> (1923) 21f</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
