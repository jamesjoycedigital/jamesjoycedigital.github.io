And all as old as the early Australian days when the pioneers saw the strange marsupial hopping away, baby in pouch. Waving their arms like semaphores they actioned the question, &ldquo;What is that animal&apos;s name?&rdquo; Came the same old answer, <mark>&ldquo;<i>Kang garru?</i>&rdquo; &ldquo;What are you saying?&rdquo;</mark> Here, then, Africa joins hands with Australia in a common howler; <mark>echo answers echo, and the question is its own answer</mark>. <small> Dan Crawford, <a name="BTLG1" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#BTLG1"><cite title="source">Back to the Long Grass</cite></a> (1923) 35f</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
