Force him to use the &ldquo;jingling sounds of like endings&rdquo; and many a fine stanza would finish with a jolt and an artificial tag. <small> Dan Crawford, <a name="BTLG1" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#BTLG1"><cite title="source">Back to the Long Grass</cite></a> (1923) 220</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: See Milton&apos;s prefatory note to <cite>Paradise Lost</cite>, in which he declares that rhyme is &lsquo;no necessary Adjunct or true Ornament of Poem or good Verse &hellip; but the Invention of a barbarous Age&rsquo;.</mm> </dd></dl>
