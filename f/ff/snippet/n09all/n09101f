Besides the occasional prodigies, which might sometimes be effected by the immediate interposition of the Deity when he suspended the laws of Nature for the service of religion, the Christian church, from the time of the apostles and their first disciples, has claimed an uninterrupted succession of miraculous powers, the gift of tongues, of vision, and of prophecy, the power of expelling d&aelig;mons, of healing the sick, and of raising the dead. <small> Edward Gibbon, <a name="EGDF2" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#EGDF2"><cite title="source">Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</cite></a> (ed. unknown) I, (Chapter XV) 458</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
