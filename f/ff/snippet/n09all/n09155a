Our retort is almost ruthless in efficiency. A cast-iron law of African syntax kills this place-not-person idea: <i>KWA</i> can only and always <mark>govern</mark> person, therefore <i>KWA</i> LEZA, i.e. where God (the person) is. <i>KU</i> for place, <i>KWA</i> for person, such is the Medo-Persic law. Livingstone went <i>KU</i> (to the place) Buckingham Palace, but also <i>KWA</i> (to the person) Queen Victoria. <font color="green">[...]</font>But greater and grander link is the root-name for God. Here this subject that &ldquo;spell-bound&rdquo; Livingstone before his death ends on the crescendo. I mean, not merely that these natives have the genuine idea of God, <i>but that they have the identical name Moses used</i>. <i>LE</i> the root for Deity (as in <i>LEza</i>) is found all over, and what is <i>LE</i> but the wrong-way round spelling of Semitic <i>EL</i>? This mere transposing of the vowel is only our old Saxon way of spelling <mark>&ldquo;thrid&rdquo; for &ldquo;third,&rdquo; or &ldquo;brid&rdquo; for &ldquo;bird,&rdquo; or &ldquo;brent&rdquo; for &ldquo;burnt&rdquo;</mark> and so on, following Max Muller&apos;s law of transposition of vowels. <small> Dan Crawford, <a name="BTLG1" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#BTLG1"><cite title="source">Back to the Long Grass</cite></a> (1923) 151</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: OE <i>thridda</i>: three; OE <i>brid</i>: bird; OE <i>brinnan</i>: to burn.
