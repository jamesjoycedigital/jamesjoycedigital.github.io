The stratified formations of the earth&apos;s crust, or geological record, are classified into five main divisions, which in their order of antiquity are as follows: (1) Archaean or Pre-Cambrian, called also sometimes <b>Azoic</b> (lifeless) or Eozoic (dawn of life); (2) Paleozoic (ancient life) or Primary; (3) Mesozoic (middle life) or Secondary; (4) Cainozoic (recent life) or Tertiary; (5) Quaternary or Post-Tertiary. These divisions are further ranged into systems, formations, groups or stages, assizes and zones.  <br>Raphael transcription: <a name="c03173d" href="c03all.htm#c03173d">VI.C.03:173(d)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
