Babel builds a tower to reach up from earth to heaven, and John saw Zion coming <i>down</i> from heaven to earth. These rival methods indicate rival results, the flesh lusteth against the Spirit and the Spirit lusteth against the flesh. <mark>Babel starts from earth</mark> and ends where it began: Zion begins from above and descends from above to wean us from earth to heaven. <small> Dan Crawford, <a name="BTLG1" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#BTLG1"><cite title="source">Back to the Long Grass</cite></a> (1923) 150f</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
