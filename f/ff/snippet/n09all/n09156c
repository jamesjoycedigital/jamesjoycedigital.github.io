The old monks said, &ldquo;Man is what he eats,&rdquo; and this, as I have pointed out, their own Latin language reminded them: every time they said &ldquo;<i>non est</i>&rdquo; they were proclaiming the fact that the verb &ldquo;to be&rdquo; and &ldquo;to eat&rdquo; are the same. Do not even we speak about &ldquo;com(<i>est</i>)ibles&rdquo;? The African says, &ldquo;Drink beer, think beer,&rdquo; and all over the vast interior the verb &ldquo;to be&rdquo; (<i>di</i>) and &ldquo;to eat&rdquo; are the same. Even that devil&apos;s deputy, a Luban cannibal, defends his defiling meal of &ldquo;<mark>black beef</mark>&rdquo; by saying, &ldquo;<mark>Eat man and you become doubly man</mark>.&rdquo; <small> Dan Crawford, <a name="BTLG1" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#BTLG1"><cite title="source">Back to the Long Grass</cite></a> (1923) 170</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
