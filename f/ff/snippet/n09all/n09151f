As, however, it is not usual in our country to levant with the sofa one has sat on in a friend&apos;s house, I protested at his noonday pilfering of royal property. The answer was unanswerable; was, indeed, that the act and fact of <mark>our sitting on the same had made the skin ours for evermore</mark>. The leopard had sat on and in that self-same skin, why not we? Yea, even as the leopard had worn that very skin until death did them part, so now that same skin is ours as long as we have a skin to cover us. <small> Dan Crawford, <a name="BTLG1" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#BTLG1"><cite title="source">Back to the Long Grass</cite></a> (1923) 102</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
