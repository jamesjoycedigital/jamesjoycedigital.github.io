You cannot both have your cake and eat it, nor can you have your own sleep and hear your own snore. Moral: No man ever saw his own country. The Central African surpasses even the erudite Mr. Twain; his &ldquo;Thinking Black&rdquo; equivalent for all this is the more profound &ldquo;No man ever yet did bite his own elbow.&rdquo; Make the mad experiment, if you dare; crane your straining mouth to the elbow that never, no never, met it, then after that acrobatic attempt you will call it what the African does, &ldquo;<mark>the non-biteable elbow</mark>.&rdquo; <small> Dan Crawford, <a name="BTLG1" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#BTLG1"><cite title="source">Back to the Long Grass</cite></a> (1923) 29</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c03155j" href="c03all.htm#c03155j">VI.C.03:155(j)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
