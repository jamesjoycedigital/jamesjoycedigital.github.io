The farther our men from the north penetrate south, the more they begin to adopt new names, name of town or name of river. This new alias seems to be a verbal swagger and he is going to flaunt it to the far-away stay-at-homes when he gets back. He has got half a dozen such aliases already, but the farther he goes south the more certain it is that in this matter of names he will be off with the old love and on with the new. <mark>The new name is supposed to symbolise some new change of nature</mark>, but how can change of climate cause change of character? Do not the old Aberdeen fisherfolk say, &ldquo;New boats but old rocks&rdquo;? In the same way, Livingstone&apos;s men troubled him by changing their names, but he was good-natured enough to remember that his family used to be called &ldquo;McLay&rdquo; but changed their old northern name to the eleven-letter &ldquo;Livingstone.&rdquo; <small> Dan Crawford, <a name="BTLG1" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#BTLG1"><cite title="source">Back to the Long Grass</cite></a> (1923) 199f</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c03167b" href="c03all.htm#c03167b">VI.C.03:167(b)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
