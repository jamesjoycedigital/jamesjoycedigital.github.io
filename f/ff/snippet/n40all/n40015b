All this disturbance was within half a mile from the coast; the ships lying at anchor beyond that distance not being affected, while those within, some thirteen in number, including eleven captured slave ships, were, in the short space of seven hours, dashed into atoms. One of them, the Descobrador, a Brazilian brig of 127 tons burden, was with her anchors and cables literally lifted up , carried broadside on to the English schooner Cornelia, and both together driven on to the shore. </mm> </dd></dl>
