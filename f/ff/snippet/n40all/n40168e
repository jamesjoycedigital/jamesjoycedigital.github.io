Ptolemy became ruler of Egypt (323-283/2 BC) and founded a dynasty that ruled it for the next three centuries, turning Egypt into a Hellenistic kingdom and Alexandria into a center of Greek culture. He assimilated some aspects of Egyptian culture, however, assuming the traditional title of <i>Pharaoh</i> in 305/4 BC. The use of the title of Pharaoh was often situational: pharaoh was used for an Egyptian audience, and <i>Basileus</i> for a Greek audience, as exemplified by Egyptian coinage.</mm> </dd></dl>
