We are going to spend it with friends, and are being punted in our wallam along the canals and over the flooded fields. The wallam is sometimes called by old-fashioned Europeans a &ldquo;country boat.&rdquo; It is &ldquo;uncouth, without nails or iron of any sort&rdquo; in its construction, but &ldquo;sewn together with twine &hellip; having one sail of matting and ropes of husk.&rdquo; That description was written in the thirteenth century by John de Monte Corvino, and is still true. The wallam is a bit of the unchanging East, now so quickly changing, and it has in these days to compete with steamand motor-launches. <small> Rev W.S.
