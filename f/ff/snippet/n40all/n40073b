It was the custom of the Romans to move troops from extreme parts of the empire to avoid the problem of Roman-trained soldiers participating in uprisings to free their native lands. The Theban Legion passed through the Alps into Gaul, under the command of Mauritius, Candidus, and Exupernis, and ain due course joined the emperor. About this time, Maximian ordered a general sacrifice, at which the whole army was to assist; and likewise he commanded that they should take the oath of allegiance and swear, at the saame time, to assist in the extirpation of Christianity in Gaul. Alarmed at these orders, each individual of the Theban Legion absolutely refused either to sacrifice or take the oaths prescribed. This enraged Maximian, who ordered the legion be decimated. The names of the soldiers were written on papers and placed in the caps of the centurions and six hundred selected to be put top the sword. The survivors persisted in declaring themselves Christians, and the decimation began anew and 600 more slaughtered. This second trial made no more impression than had the first; the soldiers preserved their fortitude and their principles, but by the advice of their officers they drew up a loyal remonstrance to the emperor. This, it might have been presumed, would have softened the emperor, but it had a contrary effect: for, enraged at their perseverance and unanimity, he commanded that the whole legion should be put to death, which was accordingly executed by the other troops, who cut them to pieces with their swords, on September 22. The Maximian period is known as the Sixth Primitive Persecution in Fox&apos;s Book of Martyrs. <br>In the <i>Book of Revelations</i>, the number 666 is referred to as the mark of the Beast. The King James Version of the verse reads: 13:18&mdash;&ldquo;Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six.&rdquo; In modern popular culture, 666 has become one of the most widely recognized symbols for the Antichrist or, alternatively, the devil. The number 666 is purportedly used to invoke Satan.  <br>Raphael transcription: <a name="c09270k" href="c9all.htm#c09270k">VI.C.09:270(k)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
