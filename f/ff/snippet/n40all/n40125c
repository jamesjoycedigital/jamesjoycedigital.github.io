At the time of its construction, the angel Gabriel gave the prophets a sacred black stone to be housed in a corner. (The Black Stone is now encased in silver to retain its structure, having in the Middle Ages been broken into pieces by the <i>Qarmatians</i>, an extreme Ismaili sect from Bahrain, who took it for ransom to Tufu in Iraq.) It is imagined as a kind of <i>omphalos</i>, or navel of the world. It points to the four directions of the world: north, south, east, and west; and is thus related to all spatial directions of the world. It is to here that the Muslim community direct their prayer (as it is intermediate with the heavenly Kaaba), and indeed their whole life, forming thereby, as it were, numerous circles around it. The direction toward the Kaaba (the <i>qibla</i>) is marked, in every mosque in the world, by the <i>mibr&aacute;b</i>: the niche pointing to it. The development of Arabic science was piloted, in a sense, by the need to establish this relation. <br>The original structure was more of a rectangle, as it included the semi-circular area known as the Hijr Ismail, and it has been renovated several times in the course of its history. It is presently 42 x 36 x 55 cubic feet in dimension, has no window and only one door. (Anciently, it had two doors and one window.) Inside it are only gold and silver lamps. It is generally covered by the <i>Kiswah</i>, a black cloth embroidered with gold thread. <br> Again according to religious tradition, the Kaaba is located directly under the &ldquo;heavenly Kaaba,&rdquo; <font color="green">[Al-Bait-al-Ma&apos;mur: the house of Allah, where 70,000 angels perform prayers daily; and when they leave they never return to it, but always a fresh number comes into it daily]</font> of which it is an exact, though earthly representation. At the time of the prophet Muhammad, prior to his cleansing of the valley, the edifice was ringed by 360 idols, indicative perhaps that it was most originally a temple to the Arabian sun-god <i>Allat</i>, represented by cubic rocks, and the &ldquo;heavenly Kaaba,&rdquo; on this belief, indicated the sun. </mm> </dd></dl>
