One player called these words to the others at the far side of the &ldquo;den.&rdquo; The sheep answered &ldquo;&lsquo;Fraid.&rdquo; &ldquo;What are you afraid of?&rdquo; was the next call, and, at the answer &ldquo;Wolf,&rdquo; the assurance came, &ldquo;Wolf&apos;s gone to Devonshire! Won&apos;t be back for seven year.&rdquo; At this the sheep ran across the room and out came the wolf. </mm> </dd></dl>
