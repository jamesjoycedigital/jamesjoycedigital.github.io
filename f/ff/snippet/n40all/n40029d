Chatter and laughter and badinage, all rather coarse-sounding, come from them in waves rising and dying down. The owner of the field or his agent is watching and directing, squatting under a <i>cadjan</i> (palm-leaf) umbrella on the ridge, out of pollution range. The ridges and banks are made by the outcastes. They stand in the river up to their necks, and duck to fill their baskets with sand and mud from the river-bed. This they empty into a boat, and use to build or repair ridges or to reclaim land. <small> Rev W.S. Hunt, <a name="WSHI1" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#WSHI1"><cite title="source">India's Outcastes: A New Era</cite></a> (1924) 31-2</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: For example, the Kammala castes generally pollute Nayars by approaching within twelve feet, and Brahmans by coming within thirty-six feet; but an Asari with his measuring rod in his hand has the privilege of approaching very near, and even entering the houses of higher castes without polluting them. </mm> </dd></dl>
