He &ldquo;came before the Public for the purpose of giving him a claim at a future period for a benefit, in order to relieve the distressed Poor of Dublin and its vicinity;&rdquo; and after this night he acted in Dublin intermittently for many years, in the same role, entering Bosworth Field on a donkey, usually for charitable purposes, and by his ineptitude transformed a tragedy into a hilarity. <br>See in this context <a name="n51145a" href="n51all.htm#n51145a">N51 (VI.B.44):145(a)</a>. </mm> </dd></dl>
