The prejudice against those who follow the trade, the feeling of uncleanness attaching to it, is easier to understand than that against cultivators of the soil. The Jews, in common with other oriental peoples, in order to keep ceremonially clean, shrank from touching any dead thing (Lev. xi. 30, etc.); the instinct is, no doubt, primitive. <small> Rev W.S.
