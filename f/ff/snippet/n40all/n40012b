In 1819, the British government commenced the erection of a large and commodious residence for his reception, at an enormous cost; but this pile of build-ups, now known as Longwood New House, was scarcely finished before the Emperor&apos;s death. It is said that Napoleon used to watch the erectlon of these buildings, and was known to say that he would never occupy them. </mm> </dd></dl>
