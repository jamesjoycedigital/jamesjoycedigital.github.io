Of course, it is bigger-about as big as a bell tent, perhaps. It has a floor of beaten mud a little above the level of the ground on which it stands. This floor has, so to speak, been turned up at the sides and back, to make walls about two feet high, with spaces in them for doors. The roof almost reaches them, or rather descends as low as, but stretches out beyond them, making diminutive verandas. It is supported upon branches of trees stuck into the floor for pillars. You will find the inside of the hut, if you will stoop and enter, dark and odorous and very grimy. It is well smoked daily by the cookingfire and never dusted, though the floor is sometimes swept, sometimes also smeared with cow-dung and water. Hanging beneath the roof is a net, the receptacle for domestic utensils, mostly made of coco-nut shells, and for other odds and ends. The <mark>mats which are the family&apos;s beds</mark> are kept there in the daytime, rolled up, so are some dirty cloths. <small> Rev W.S.
