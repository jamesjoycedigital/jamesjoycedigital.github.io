Stead, a quandam teacher in the London schools and a respectable Methodist strenghtened by non-Conformist support, in starting this ignoble surprise on the public was much debated. <small> Richard F. Burton, trans. <a name="RFBS" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#RFBS"><cite title="source">Supplemental Nights to the Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night with Notes Anthropological and Explanatory</cite></a> (n.d.) xvi.319 [Appendix]</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: See also <a name="sa0805ac" href="saall.htm#sa0805ac">SA (VI.A):0805(ac)</a>. The warrant on which Oscar Wilde was arrested charged him with an offence alleged to have been committed under Section xi. of the Criminal Amendment Act of 1885; in other words, he was arrested and tried for an offence that was not punishable by law ten years before. This Act was brought in as a result of the shameful and sentimental stories (evidently for the most part manufactured) which Mr Stead had published in <cite>The Pall Mall Gazette</cite> under the title of &ldquo;Modern Babylon&rdquo;.
