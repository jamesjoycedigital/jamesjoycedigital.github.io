The formula still used at Barnes by children is, &ldquo;Here comes an old soldier from the wars <font color="green">[or from town]</font>, pray what can you give him?&rdquo; Another version is &ldquo;Here comes an old soldier from Botany Bay, Have you got anything to give him to-day.&rdquo; <br>The questioned child replying must be careful to avoid using the words, Yes! No! Nay! and Black, White, or Grey. These words are tabooed, and a forfeit is exacted every time one or other is used. The old soldier walks lame, and carries a stick. He is allowed to ask as many questions, talk as much as he pleases, and to account for his destitute condition. <small> Alice Bertha Gomme, <a name="GAMES" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#GAMES"><cite title="source">Traditional Games of England, Scotland, and Ireland</cite></a> (1894) II 24</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
