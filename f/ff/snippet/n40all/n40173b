In this cathecism, the priest or minister first puts his fingers in the candidate&apos;s ears and puts some of his saliva into his mouth (signifying openness to hearing the word of God and in speaking it). Second, he makes the sign of the cross on the candidate&apos;s forehead, chest, and mouth; and, third, he puts salt in the candidate&apos;s mouth, which signifies wisdom.  <br>Raphael transcription: <a name="c10041h" href="c10all.htm#c10041h">VI.C.10:041(h)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
