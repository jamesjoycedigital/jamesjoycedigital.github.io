Other formulae for games of this kind are, &ldquo;As round as the moon, has two eyes, a nose, and a mouth.&rdquo; These words are said while drawing on a table with the forefinger of the left hand an imaginary face, making eyes, nose, and mouth when saying the words. The fun is caused through those players who are unacquainted with the game drawing the imaginary face with the right hand instead of the left. <small> Alice Bertha Gomme, <a name="GAMES" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#GAMES"><cite title="source">Traditional Games of England, Scotland, and Ireland</cite></a> (1894) I ?363</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
