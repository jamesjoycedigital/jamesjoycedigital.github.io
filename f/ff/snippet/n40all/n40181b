The odd player, carrying a handkerchief, commences to walk slowly round the outside of the ring, repeating the words ; then, touching each one with her handkerchief as she passes, she says, &ldquo;Not you,&rdquo; &ldquo;not you,&rdquo; &ldquo;not you,&rdquo; &amp;c., &amp;c., till the favoured individual is reached, when it is changed to &ldquo;But you!&rdquo; and his or her shoulder lightly touched at the same time. The first player then runs round the ring as fast as he can, pursued by the other, who, if a capture is effected (as is nearly always the case), is entitled to lead the first player back into the centre of the ring and claim a kiss. The first player then takes the other&apos;s place in the ring, and in turn walks round the outside repeating the same formula.
