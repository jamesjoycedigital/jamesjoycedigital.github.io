Ptolemy VIII&apos;s complicated political career started in 170 BC when Antiochus IV Epiphanes of the Seleucid Empire invaded and captured King Ptolemy VI Philometor and all of Egypt, with the exception of the city of Alexandria. Antiochus allowed Ptolemy VI to continue as a puppet monarch. Meanwhile, the people of Alexandria chose Ptolemy Euergetes, his younger brother, as king. Instead of taking up arms against one another, the brothers decided to co-rule Egypt. </mm> </dd></dl>
