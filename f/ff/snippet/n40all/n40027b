He stands with his back bent and covers his mouth with his hands. He is, in truth, the picture of servile fear. &hellip; he speaks through his hands in a semiwhining tone, with a strange pronunciation and stranger grammar, <mark>alluding to himself in ultradepreciatory terms</mark> and to us in ultra-exalted ones.
