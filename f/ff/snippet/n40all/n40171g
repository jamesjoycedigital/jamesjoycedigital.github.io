It was dedicated to the Muses, the nine goddesses of the arts. It flourished under the patronage of the Ptolemaic dynasty and functioned as a major center of scholarship from its construction in the 3rd century BC until the Roman conquest of Egypt in 30 BC, with collections of works, lecture halls, meeting rooms, and gardens. The library was part of a larger research institution called the Musaeum of Alexandria, where many of the most famous thinkers of the ancient world studied. <br>The library was created by Ptolemy I Soter, the successor of Alexander the Great. Most of the books were kept as papyrus scrolls; estimates of their number range from 40,000 to 400,000 at its height. <br>This library is most famous for having been burned down and its destruction has become a symbol for the loss of cultural knowledge. Sources differ on who was responsible for its destruction and when it occurred. The Library may in truth have suffered several fires over many years. Possible occasions for its partial or complete destruction include a fire set by the army of Julius Caesar in 48 BC and an attack by Aurelian in the 270s AD. <br>After the main library was destroyed, scholars used a &ldquo;daughter library&rdquo; in a temple known as the Serapeum of Alexandria, located in another part of the city. According to Socrates of Constantinople, Coptic Pope Theophilus destroyed the Serapeum in AD 391, although it is not certain what it contained or if it contained any significant fraction of the documents that were in the main library. The library may have finally been destroyed during (or after) the Muslim conquest of Egypt in AD 642.</mm> </dd></dl>
