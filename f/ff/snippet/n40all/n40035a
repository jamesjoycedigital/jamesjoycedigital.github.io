Besides the normal department and the practising school, it possesses a school garden of eight acres and a school farm of twentythree acres. Each student has a plot in the garden, and those in the higher classes have one-sixth of an acre of irrigated, and one-third of an acre of un-irrigated, land in the farm. <small> Rev W.S.
