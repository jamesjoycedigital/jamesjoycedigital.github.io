II, vi. 7; Luke x. 17-20). But he himself conquers Satan in resisting his temptations (Matt. iv. I-11). Simon is warned against him, and Judas yields to him as tempter (Luke xxii. 31; John xiii. 27). Jesus&apos;s cures are represented as a triumph over Satan (Luke x. 18). This Jewish doctrine is found in Paul&apos;s letters also. Satan rules over a world of evil, supernatural agencies, whose dwelling is in the lower heavens (Eph. vi. 12): hence he is the &ldquo;prince of the power of the air&rdquo; (ii. 2). <small> &ldquo;DEVIL&rdquo; <a name="EBDV" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#EBDV"><cite title="source">Encyclopaedia Britannica</cite></a>, 11th edit.
