Jeanne / des Anges </blockquote> <dd class="well"><mm class="note">Note: Jeanne des Anges (1602-1665). Hunchbacked mother superior of the Ursuline convent in Poitiers, France, who became possessed with major demons in the famous Loudon possessions case. A mean and vindictive woman, Jeanne des Anges (Joan of the Angels) became the principal demoniac in fraudulent possessions that led to the execution of a priest, the lascivious cur&eacute; Urbain Grandier. She ended her life near sainthood and wrote an account of her experiences in an autobiography modeled on that of St. Teresa of Avila. <br>Jeanne purported to be possessed by a series and mul;tiplicity of demons, including Behemoth, and was exorcised on numerous occasions. At a late point in her life, she took to severe self-mortification. Her notoriety spread, and soon was replaced with religious adulation at her fortitude. Jeanne had audiences with royalty, including Queen Anne, wife of Louis XIII; archbishops; and the dying Cardinal Richelieu (who privately thought the Loudun affair was a fraud). Her stained chemise was used as a blanket in the birth of Louis XIV. Everywhere she went, she was hailed and admired. <br> Jeanne died in January 1665. Her head was cut off and placed in a silver and gold reliquary. The stained chemise was already in its own reliquary. These relics were the objects of popular devotion. The convent commissioned an artist to paint a huge image of the expulsion of Behemoth. In the center, Jeanne knelt before Surin, Tranquille, and a Carmelite, a look of ecstasy on her face. Royalty and commoners looked on. A radiant St. Joseph, accompanied by cherubim, floated overhead with three thunderbolts intended for the demons leaving Jeanne&apos;s mouth. The painting hung in the chapel for more than 80 years, when a bishop ordered it removed. The nuns hid the painting by covering it with another one. In 1772, the convent was suppressed. The painting, chemise, and mummified head were sent into hiding and disappeared. </mm> </dd></dl>
