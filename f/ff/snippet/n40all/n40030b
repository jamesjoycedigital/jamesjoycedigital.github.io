We sometimes speak of people who have gone under as &ldquo;social pariahs.&rdquo; The word is often loosely used of all outcastes, though it is really, as we see here, the name of one section of South Indian outcastes. &ldquo;Pariah&rdquo; is the Anglicized form. In Tamil it is <i>para&iacute;yan</i>; in Malayalam it is <i>payaya</i>. Analogous sections in other language-areas have different names. Other descriptive designations for the outcastes are &ldquo;the depressed classes,&rdquo; because of their low, serf-like social position, and because of the disabilities which the stigma of &ldquo;uncleanness&rdquo; entails; &ldquo;the backward classes,&rdquo; because they are less intelligent and civilized than other classes, and almost destitute of education; &ldquo;the untouchables&rdquo; and &ldquo;unapproachables,&rdquo; which are self-explanatory; &ldquo;panchamas,&rdquo; a polite euphemism signifying fifth caste; &ldquo;outcaste&rdquo; rather gives it away, showing them to be outside caste and therefore of no caste. Sometimes they are called &ldquo;the submerged sixth&rdquo; because they (outcastes and jungle tribes together) are about a sixth of the population, and constitute the social underworld of India. Other names applied by themselves are &ldquo;Adi-Andhras&rdquo; (aboriginal Telugus), Andhra being the ancient name for the Telugu country; and &ldquo;Adi-Dravidas,&rdquo; for those whose language is Tamil. The distinction between &ldquo;outcast&rdquo; and &ldquo;outcaste&rdquo; should be noted. The latter have not, like &ldquo;social outcasts,&rdquo; been cast out of society; they were never in, though some claim that they once were. An American missionary thus describes their position: &ldquo;The outcaste has fallen, not to the bottom, but on through the bottom&rdquo; of the social order. <small> Rev W.S.
