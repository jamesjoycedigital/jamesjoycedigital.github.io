In Siva is perpetuated the belief in the god of Vedic times Rudra, who is represented as &ldquo;the wild hunter who storms over the earth with his bands, and lays low with arrows the men who displease him&rdquo; &hellip;. The evil character of Siva is reflected in his wife, who as Kali (the black) is the wild and cruel goddess of destruction and death. <small> &ldquo;DEVIL&rdquo; <a name="EBDV" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#EBDV"><cite title="source">Encyclopaedia Britannica</cite></a>, 11th edit.
