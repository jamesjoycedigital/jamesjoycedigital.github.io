(Shropshire (<cite>Burne&apos;s Shropshire Folk-lore</cite>, p. 526.) &hellip; The object of all the players is to make Buff smile while going through this absurdity, and if he does he must pay a forfeit. <br>Another version is for one child to be blindfolded, and stand in the middle of a ring of children, holding a long wand in his hand. The ring dance round to a tune and sing a chorus <font color="green">[which is not given by the writer]</font>. They then stop. Buff extends his wand, and the person to whom it happens to be pointed must step out of the circle to hold the end in his hand. Buff then interrogates the holder of the wand by grunting three times, and is answered in like manner. Buff then guesses who is the holder of the wand. If he guesses rightly, the holder of the stick becomes Buff, and he joins the ring (<cite>Winter Evening&apos;s Amusements</cite>, p. 6). When I played at this game the ring of children walked in silence three times only round Buff, then stopped and knelt or stooped down on the ground, strict silence being observed. Buff asked three questions (anything he chose) of the child to whom he pointed the stick, who replied by imitating cries of animals or birds (A. B. Gomme). <small> Alice Bertha Gomme, <a name="GAMES" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#GAMES"><cite title="source">Traditional Games of England, Scotland, and Ireland</cite></a> (1894) I 48</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
