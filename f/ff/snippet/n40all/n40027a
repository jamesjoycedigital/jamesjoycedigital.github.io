He stands with his back bent and covers his mouth with his hands. He is, in truth, the picture of servile fear. &hellip; he <mark>speaks through his hands</mark> in a semiwhining tone, with a strange pronunciation and stranger grammar, alluding to himself in ultradepreciatory terms and to us in ultra-exalted ones. When, however, we ask him about his religion, all expression dies out of his face. There is a flicker of fear, then utter blankness. <small> Rev W.S.
