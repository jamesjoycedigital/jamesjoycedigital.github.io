He also constructed the first safe roadway from the town to the country by way of Ladder Hill. His administration was, however, characterized by much severity, of which an anecdote is told that some soldiers, whom he had unjustly punished, escaped from the Island and his power in an open boat, and performed a voyage of near 4500 miles, eventually arriving at Nevis. Pike was transferred to Bencoolen, but was, in 1731, reappointed Governor of the Island, where he died seven years afterwards. </mm> </dd></dl>
