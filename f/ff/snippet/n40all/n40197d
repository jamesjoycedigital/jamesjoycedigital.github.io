According to Hans Baldung Grien (<i>ca</i> 1484-1545) and Pierre de Rostegny, <i>aka</i> De Lancre (1553-1631), human flesh was eaten during Sabbats, preferably children, and also human bones stewed in a special way. Other descriptions add that human fat, especially that of unbaptised children, was used to make an unguent &mdash; the flying ointment &mdash; that enabled the witches to fly. </mm> </dd></dl>
