In the Old Testament, a talent was a unit of measurement for weighing precious metals, usually gold and silver. In the New Testament, a talent was a value of money or coin. It was first mentioned in the book of Exodus within the inventory of materials used for the construction of the tabernacle: All the gold that was used for the work, in all the construction of the sanctuary, the gold from the offering, was twenty-nine talents (Exodus 38:24, ESV). It was the heaviest or largest biblical unit of measurement for weight, equal to about 75 pounds or 35 kilograms. Thus we cannot underestimate the opulence of the crown mentioned in 2 Samuel 12:30, NIV: &ldquo;David took the crown from their king&apos;s head, and it was placed on his own head. It weighed a talent of gold, and it was set with precious stones.&rdquo; In Revelation 16:21, we read that &ldquo;great hail from heaven fell upon men, each hailstone about the weight of a talent.&rdquo; <br>The Hebrew term for a talent was <i>kikkar</i>, meaning a round gold or silver disk, or disk-shaped loaf. In the Greek language the word comes from <i>t&aacute;lanton</i>, a large monetary measurement equal to 6,000 drachmas or <i>denarii</i>, the Greek and Roman silver coins. <br>In the New Testament, the term &ldquo;talent&rdquo; meant something very different than it does today. The talents Jesus Christ spoke of in the Parable of the Unforgiving Servant (Matthew 18:21-35) and the Parable of the Talents (Matthew 25:14-30) referred to the largest unit of currency at the time. A person who possessed five talents of gold or silver was a multimillionaire by today&apos;s standards. Some calculate the talent in the parables to be equivalent to 20 years of wages for the common worker. Other scholars estimate more conservatively, valuing the New Testament talent somewhere between 1,000 to 30,000 dollars today. </mm> </dd></dl>
