Fracis bell / of baptism</blockquote> <dd class="well"> <blockquote class="sources">The story of Francis Xavier summoning the South Indian fisher-folk with his bell to come and be baptized, as he tramped from village to village, and baptizing until he was so tired that he could no longer raise his hands, is well-known. In one month he baptized 10,000 persons. That was in the sixteenth century. <small> Rev W.S.
