The ring dance round, singing the verse. They then stand still, and the centre child holds out the stick and touches one of the ring. This player must take hold of the stick. Then the Muffin Man asks this player any questions he pleases, &ldquo;Is the morn shining?&rdquo; &ldquo;Is ink white?&rdquo; &amp;c. The child who holds the stick answers &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; in a disguised voice, and the Muffin Man then guesses who it is. He is allowed three tries. If he guesses right he joins the ring, and the child who was touched takes his place in the centre. In the Yorkshire versions no questions are asked; the blindfolded child goes to any one he can touch, and tries to guess his or her name. The other version, sent by Mr. Hardy, is played in the same way, and sung to the same tune. In the Congleton version (Miss Twemlow), the blindfolded child tries to catch one of those in the ring, when the verse is sung. The lines, with an additionalfour from Shropshire Folk-lore, are given by Miss Burne among nursery rhymes and riddles. <small> Alice Bertha Gomme, <a name="GAMES" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#GAMES"><cite title="source">Traditional Games of England, Scotland, and Ireland</cite></a> (1894) I 403</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
