He is the sole Titan mentioned by Homer in the Iliad (8.478-81) as being in Tartarus with Cronus. He is a brother of Cronus, who ruled the world during the Golden Age. <br>Epimetheus (meaning &ldquo;hindsight,&rdquo; literally &ldquo;afterthinker&rdquo;) was the brother of Prometheus (traditionally interpreted as &ldquo;foresight,&rdquo; literally &ldquo;fore-thinker&rdquo;), a pair of Titans who &ldquo;acted as representatives of mankind.&rdquo; They were the sons of Iapetus (in other contexts the father of Atlas). While Prometheus is characterized as ingenious and clever, Epimetheus is depicted as foolish. </mm> </dd></dl>
