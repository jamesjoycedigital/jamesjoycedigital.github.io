They are bent almost double, plucking up handfuls of the tender plants by the roots. Each bunch, as they pluck it, is given a flick (to dry it and rid it of any earth that may cling to it) and then tossed to a heap. They thus progress right through the field, thinning out the plants, and they will presently re-plant in another field those that they have tossed on the heap. <small> Rev W.S.
