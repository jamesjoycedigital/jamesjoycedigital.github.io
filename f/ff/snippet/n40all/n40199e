He was the father of Elam, Asshur, Arphaxad, Lud, and Aram. Genesis 11:10 records that Shem was 100 years old at the birth of Arphaxad, two years after the flood; and that he lived for another 500 years after this, making his age at death 600 years. The first-century historian Flavius Josephus, among many others, recounted the tradition that the five sons of Shem were the progenitors of the nations of Elam, Assyria, Chaldea, Lydia, and Levantine, respectively. </mm> </dd></dl>
