The Ango-Egyptian force (raised by The Egyptian Governor, Rauf Pasha) was, in the words of Winston Churchill, &ldquo;perhaps the worst army that has ever marched to war&rdquo; &mdash; unpaid, untrained, undisciplined, its soldiers having more in common with their enemies than with their officers. According to reports published in England soon after, the Egyptian forces held for two days before finally collapsing. About one-third of the Egyptian soldiers surrendered and were later freed, while all the officers were killed. Only about 500 Egyptian troops managed to escape and make it back to Khartoum. Neither Hicks nor any of his senior officers were among them. Apparently only two or three Europeans survived. After the battle the Mahdist army made El Obeid a centre for operations for some time. Their success also emboldened Osman Digna, whose Hadendoa tribesmen, the so-called fuzzy-wuzzies, joined the rebellion from their lands on the Red Sea coast. </mm> </dd></dl>
