A game in which two or more put a halfpenny each, or any piece of coin, into a cap or bonnet. After jingling or shaking them together, they are thrown on the ground; and he who has most heads when it is his turn to jingle, gains the stakes which were put into the bonnet. Jamieson. Halliwell (Dictionary) says this is a northern name for the game of &ldquo;Shake Cap,&rdquo; and Brockett (North Country Words) speaks of it as a game much practised among the young pitmen and keelmen. <small> Alice Bertha Gomme, <a name="GAMES" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#GAMES"><cite title="source">Traditional Games of England, Scotland, and Ireland</cite></a> (1894) I 238</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
