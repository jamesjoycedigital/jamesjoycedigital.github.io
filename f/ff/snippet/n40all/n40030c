They behave towards each other as high-caste Hindus do to fellow-Hindus of other castes than their own, refraining from associating with each other and from eating together, and holding intermarriage in abhorrence. Some sections are divided into sub-sections, who do not intermarry or &ldquo;interdine.&rdquo; Pulayas, for example, are thus divided into &ldquo;westerns&rdquo; and &ldquo;easterns.&rdquo; <small> Rev W.S.
