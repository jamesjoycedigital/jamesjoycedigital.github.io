For many centuries it was one of the tallest man-made structures in the world. Badly damaged by three earthquakes between AD 956 and 1323, it then became an abandoned ruin. It was the third longest surviving ancient wonder (after the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus and the extant Great Pyramid of Giza) until 1480, when the last of its remnant stones were used to build the Citadel of Qaitbay on the site. <br>The construction of the lighthouse was commissioned by the first Ptolemy (Ptolemy I Soter), who announced himself king in 305 BC after the death of Alexander the Great. The building was finished during the reign of his son, the second Ptolemy (Ptolemy II Philadelphus). It took twelve years to complete, at a total cost of 800 talents, and served as a prototype for all later lighthouses in the world. The light was produced by a furnace at the top, and the tower was said to have been built mostly with solid blocks of limestone. Strabo reported that Sostratus had a dedication inscribed in metal letters to the &ldquo;Saviour Gods.&rdquo; Later, Pliny the Elder wrote that Sostratus was the architect, which is disputed. In the second century AD the satirist Lucian wrote that Sostratus inscribed his name under plaster bearing the name of Ptolemy. This was so that when the plaster with Ptolemy&apos;s name fell off, Sostratus&apos;s name would be visible in the stone <br>Ramesses (Rameses or Ramses) is the name conventionally given in English transliteration to 11 Egyptian pharaohs of the later New Kingdom period. Originally called Pa-ra-mes-su, Ramesses I (reigned c. 1292-1290 BC) was of non-royal birth, being born into a noble military family from the Nile delta region, perhaps near the former Hyksos capital of Avaris. He was a son of a troop commander called Seti. His uncle Khaemwaset, an army officer, married Tamwadjesy, the matron of the Harem of Amun, who was a relative of Huy, the viceroy of Kush, an important state post. Ramesses I found favor with Horemheb, the last pharaoh of the tumultuous Eighteenth dynasty, who appointed the former as his Vizier. Ramesses also served as the High Priest of Amun and as such he would have played an important role in the restoration of the old religion following the Amarna heresy of a generation earlier under Akhenaten. </mm> </dd></dl>
