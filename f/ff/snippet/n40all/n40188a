When the war in Sudan broke out, Baker, hastening with 3500 men to relieve Tokar, encountered the enemy under Osman Digna at El Teb. His men, becoming panic-stricken at the first rush, were slaughtered. Baker himself with a few of his officers succeeded by hard fighting in cutting a way out, but his force was annihilated. British troops soon afterwards arrived at Suakin, and Sir Gerald Graham took the offensive. Baker Pasha accompanied the British force, guiding it on its march to the scene of his defeat, and at the desperately fought second battle of El Teb he was wounded. He remained in command of the Egyptian police until his death. </mm> </dd></dl>
