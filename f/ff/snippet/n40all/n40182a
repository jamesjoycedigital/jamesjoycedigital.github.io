A number of boys put marbles in a ring, and then they all bowl at the ring. The one who gets nearest has the first shot at the marbles. He has the option of either &ldquo;knuckling doon&rdquo; and shooting at the ring from the prescribed mark, or &ldquo;ligging up&rdquo; (lying up) that is, putting his taw so near the ring that if the others miss his taw, or miss the marbles in the ring, he has the game all to himself next time. If, however, he is hit by the others, he is said to be &ldquo;killed.&rdquo; <small> Alice Bertha Gomme, <a name="GAMES" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#GAMES"><cite title="source">Traditional Games of England, Scotland, and Ireland</cite></a> (1894) I ?324</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
