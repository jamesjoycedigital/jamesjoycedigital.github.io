For a long time this man had not worn clothes or lived in a house, but had lived in the tombs. <br>28 When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell at his feet, shouting at the top of his voice, &ldquo;What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don&apos;t torture me!&rdquo; <br>29 For Jesus had commanded the impure spirit to come out of the man. Many times it had seized him, and though he was chained hand and foot and kept under guard, he had broken his chains and had been driven by the demon into solitary places. <br>30 Jesus asked him, &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; &ldquo;Legion,&rdquo; he replied, because many demons had gone into him. <br>31 And they begged Jesus repeatedly not to order them to go into the Abyss. <br>32 A large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside. The demons begged Jesus to let them go into the pigs, and he gave them permission. <br>33 When the demons came out of the man, they went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned. <br>34 When those tending the pigs saw what had happened, they ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, <br>35 and the people went out to see what had happened. When they came to Jesus, they found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus&apos; feet, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid. <br>36 Those who had seen it told the people how the demon-possessed man had been cured. <br>37 Then all the people of the region of the Gerasenes <font color="green">[Gadarenes]</font> asked Jesus to leave them, because they were overcome with fear. So he got into the boat and left. </mm> </dd></dl>
