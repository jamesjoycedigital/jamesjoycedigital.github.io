It was, allegedly, sired in County Wexford, Ireland, and was a cousin of Wellington&apos;s Waterloo mount, Copenhagen. A horse, purported to be this animal was exhibited with sensational success to the public by one Petre, at the new Waterloo Rooms, 94 Pall Mall, London, with an admission fee of 1 shilling for adults and 6 pennies for children and servants, with the account given that it was captured during Napoleon&apos;s Egyptian crusade and carried him throughput his subsequent campaigns. Marengo, it was thus asserted, walked 3,000 miles in 1812 alone, from Paris to Moscow and back again. With such public admiration afforded it, when the horse died in 1832 its skeleton was sent to the London Hospital to be articulated for permanent exhibition; and its bones can today be viewed in London&apos;s Natural Army Museum. </mm> </dd></dl>
