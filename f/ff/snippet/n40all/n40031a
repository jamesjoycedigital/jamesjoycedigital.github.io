Does it derive from aboriginal totemism? These are questions that have suggested themselves, but they cannot be discussed here. <small> Rev W.S.

For example, the Yemmalavaru or buffalo-men, Mandalavaru or men of the herd, Pulavaru or flower-men, and Minalavaru or fish-men are in no way totemistic. </mm> </dd></dl>
