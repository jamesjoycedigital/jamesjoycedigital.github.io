They form the largest group of Malayalam-speaking outcastes. <i>Pariahs</i> are the next largest. There are Tamil-speaking Pariahs also in Tinnevelly, throughout the Madras Presidency, and in South Travancore, a numerous community, less depressed than their Malayali brethren. Symptoms of a mass movement among the Tinnevelly Pariahs are discernible. <small> Rev W.S.
