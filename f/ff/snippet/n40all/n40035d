If we think of the former as having become the latter, what has happened in the interval is this: The desire to become Christians has arisen in them; they have asked the nearest pastor or missionary for a teacher; a teacher has been sent to them; he has taught them the rudiments of the faith as regularly as possible for a considerable time; eventually they have been baptized. <small> Rev W.S.
