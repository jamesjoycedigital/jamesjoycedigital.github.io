But ye Greatwood was miserably lessened and destroyed within our memories, and is not near the circuit and length it was. But we believe it does not contain less now than fifteen hundred acres of fine woodland and good ground, but no springs of water but what is salt or brackish, which we take to be the reason that that part was not inhabited when ye people first chose out their Settlements and made Plantations. </mm> </dd></dl>
