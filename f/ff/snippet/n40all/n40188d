One child is seated on the ground with his legs under him; the other players form a ring round. They then pull or buffet the centre child or Frog, who tries to catch one of them without rising from the floor. The child who is caught takes the place of the centre child. Another method of playing the game is similar to &ldquo;Bull in the Park.&rdquo; The child in the centre tries to break out of the ring, those forming it keeping the Frog in the ring by any means in their power, while still keeping their hands clasped. They sometimes sing or say <br>&ldquo;Hey! hey! hi! Frog in the middle and there shall lie; <br>He can&apos;t get out and he shan&apos;t get out hey ! hey ! hi ! <br>They dance round when saying this, all keeping a watch on the Frog, who suddenly makes a rush, and tries to break through the ring. London (A. B. Gomme). Strutt describes this game, and gives an illustration from a fourteenth century&nbsp;MS. which is here reproduced from the original (Sports, p. 303). Newell (<cite>Games of American Children</cite>, p. 171) also mentions it, and gives the rhyme as &ldquo;Frog in the sea, can&apos;t catch me!&rdquo; <small> Alice Bertha Gomme, <a name="GAMES" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#GAMES"><cite title="source">Traditional Games of England, Scotland, and Ireland</cite></a> (1894) I 145-6</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
