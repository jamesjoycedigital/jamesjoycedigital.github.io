It lasts for two or three days and nights. The chief feature is the sacrifice of a buffalo to the village deity, a local goddess named Pedamma, the Great Mother, whose displeasure is the supposed cause of the epidemic. In this festival various classes of the community participate, but the outcaste Malas and Madigas have a prominent part in it. It has nothing of a festal character, nor anything of the nature of worship in it, but is for the most part gruesome and revolting. The buffalo, dyed yellow with turmeric powder and garlanded with margosa leaves, is led in procession through the village and worshipped by the inhabitants as it passes each door, the heads of the households pouring water over its feet. It is then tied up before the decked-out image of the goddess, and remains there while various further preparations are made. <small> Rev W.S.
