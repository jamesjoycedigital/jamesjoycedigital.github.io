Strabo writes that the lighthouse of Alexandria, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World (c. 280 BC), on the island of Pharos off Alexandria, Egypt, was dedicated and presumably funded by Sostratus, a friend of Egypt&apos;s ruler, Ptolemy I Soter. Pliny says that Sostratus was the architect and that Ptolemy graciously allowed him to &ldquo;sign&rdquo; the monument. </mm> </dd></dl>
