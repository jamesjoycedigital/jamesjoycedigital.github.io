They were the result of: (1) <i>policy</i>, as when the Empire became Christian after Constantine&apos;s conversion, or when Clovis&apos;s 3,000 warriors were baptized with him; (2) <i>compulsion</i>, as in the case of the Russian peasants who, when Vladimir adopted Christianity, were driven into the Dnieper and baptized <i>en masse</i>, or in that of the Ceylonese subjects of the Dutch in the seventeenth century who might not own land or hold office unless baptized; and (3) the ferment of an idea, introduced to a community by a preacher, permeating and possessing a whole people, as when Patrick evangelized the Irish and Ulfilas the Goths. <small> Rev W.S.
