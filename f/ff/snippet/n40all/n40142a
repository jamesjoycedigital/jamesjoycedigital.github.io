He was the youngest son of the 1st Duke. He did not marry, and the dukedom expired with him, although the earldom was inherited by a cousin, Lieutenant-General John Egerton. A pioneer of naval construction, he is famed as the &ldquo;father of British inland navigation,&rdquo; who commissioned the Bridgewater Canal, often said to be the first true canal in Britain, and the modern world. </mm> </dd></dl>
