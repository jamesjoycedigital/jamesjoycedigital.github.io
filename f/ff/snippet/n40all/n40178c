The first player begins by saying, &ldquo;The minister&apos;s cat is an ambitious cat,&ldquo; the next player &ldquo;an artful cat,&rdquo; and so on, until they have all named an adjective beginning with A. The next time of going round the adjectives must begin with B, the next time C, and so on, until the whole of the alphabet has been gone through. &hellip; This is apparently the same game as the well-known &ldquo;I love my love with an A because she is amiable.&rdquo; In this game every player has to repeat the same sentence, but using a different adjective, which adjective must begin with the letter A. Various sentences follow. At the next round the adjectives all begin with B; the next C, until a small story has been built up. Forfeits were exacted for every failure or mistake. The formula usually was <mark>I love my love with an A</mark> because she is (&mdash;). <mark>I hate her</mark> with an A because she is (&mdash;). I took her to the sign of the (&mdash;), and treated her to (&mdash;). The result was(&mdash;). <small> Alice Bertha Gomme, <a name="GAMES" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#GAMES"><cite title="source">Traditional Games of England, Scotland, and Ireland</cite></a> (1894) I 388-9</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
