They took possession of and retained it until the year 1651, when, in consequence of their establishing a colony at the Cape of Good Hope, they left St. Helena, and the English East India Company, being fully alive to its value, imme-diately took possession of it. They held it for ten years, and then obtained from King Charles the Second a charter to secure them in its further possession. This Company becoming absolute owners of the place, at once commenced to establish a small colony. They erected fortifications, introduced settlers from England as well as new plants and stock, so that a general improvement took place, which so excited the covetous desires of its recent possessors, the Dutch, that in the year 1665 they successfully attacked and again took possession of it. The English, however, speedily retook it, and within twelve months were in full possession; but these proceedings impressed them with the importance of strengthening their fortifications, and accordingly they pulled down the original fort, built in 1659, of which a stone record yet remains, and erected another, which doubtless forms the basement story of the present castle in Jamestown. This they called Fort James, in compliment to the then Duke of York (afterwards King James the Second), and this accounts doubtless for the change of name, about this period, from Chapel Valley to James Valley, and more recently to Jamestown. </mm> </dd></dl>
