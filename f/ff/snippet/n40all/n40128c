This word is also used figuratively for a cruel enemy, as some think &ldquo;the Egyptian host, crushed by the divine power, and cast on the shores of the Red Sea&rdquo; (Psalms 74:14). As used in Isaiah 27:1 (&ldquo;leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan that crooked serpent&rdquo;) the word may probably denote the two empires, the Assyrian and the Babylonian. </mm> </dd></dl>
