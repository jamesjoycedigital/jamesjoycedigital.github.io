It is based on the novella <cite>H&eacute;rodias</cite> (1877) by Gustave Flaubert. It was first performed in Brussels on 19 December 1881. The libretto is a retelling of the story of John the Baptist, Salome, Herod Antipas, and Herodias, but is strikingly less psychological and bloody than Richard Strauss&apos;s <i>Salome</i>, based on a text by Oscar Wilde. </mm> </dd></dl>
