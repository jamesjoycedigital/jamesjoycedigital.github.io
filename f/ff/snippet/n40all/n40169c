His reign as king was interrupted by a general rebellion that resulted in his exile from 58 to 55 BC. Thus, Ptolemy XII ruled Egypt from 80 to 58 BC and from 55 BC until his death in 51 BC. Ptolemy XII was generally described as a weak, self-indulgent man, a drunkard, and a music lover. He relied on the Romans to return him to the throne when he was deposed. He succeeded to Ptolemy XI on the latter&apos;s assassination, and soon after died of disease. In his will he named Cleopatra, then 18, and the elder of his two sons, Ptolemy XIII, just 10 years old, as his joint successors. </mm> </dd></dl>
