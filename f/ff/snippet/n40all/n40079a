Mohammed came to their house on a day when Zaynab was alone, and was smitten by her beauty. She related the incident to her husband. Zeid immediately went to Mohammed and declared his readiness to divorce his wife. His offer was accepted. The subsequent marriage of Mohammed with Zaynab stirred great scandal in Medinah for its incestuous connotations. The Prophet abated the scandal by citing a divine revelation that made the union lawful. The story of Zaynab is possibly evoked in <cite>FW</cite> 506.4-8. [Aida Yared.] </mm> </dd></dl>
