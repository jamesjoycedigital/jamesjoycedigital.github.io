From Lake No in South Sudan the river becomes the &ldquo;White Nile&rdquo; in its strictest sense, and continues northwards into Sudan where it ends at its confluence with the Blue Nile near Khartoum. The southern stretch of the river encounters several rapids before reaching the Sudan plain and the vast swamp of the Sudd. It makes its way to Lake No, where it merges with the <i>Bahr el Ghazal</i> and there forms the White Nile. An anabranch river called <i>Bahr el Zeraf</i> flows out of the Bahr al-Jabal at and flows through the Sudd, to eventually join the White Nile. This Mountain Nile cascades through narrow gorges and over a series of rapids that includes the Fula (Fola) Rapids </mm> </dd></dl>
