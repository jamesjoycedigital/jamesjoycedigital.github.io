According to Rackham there were &lsquo;about 143 Forests in England&rsquo;. The scholarly lists of James and Grant contain 129 and 69. Bird confidently stated that &lsquo;the royal forests were sixty-nine in number, besides thirteen chases and more than seven hundred parks;&rdquo; but a sixteenth-century list contains only eighteen royal forests and chases and 67 royal parks. </mm> </dd></dl>
