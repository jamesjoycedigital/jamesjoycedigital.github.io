Following the eruption, thousands of fumaroles vented steam from the ash. Robert F. Griggs, who explored the volcano&apos;s aftermath for the National Geographic Society in 1916, gave the valley its name, saying that &ldquo;the whole valley as far as the eye could reach was full of hundreds, no thousands &mdash; literally, tens of thousands &mdash; of smokes curling up from its fissured floor.&rdquo;</mm> </dd></dl>
