A gregarious chap by all accounts, he was known to address even the slightest of acquaintances as an &ldquo;old pal&rdquo;. From this, legend has it, arose the name of the classic cocktail, &lsquo;Old Pal&rsquo;, created by mixing rye whiskey, French dry vermouth and Campari in a 2:1:1 proportion. (For a single serve, use one and a half ounces of rye whiskey and three quarters of an ounce each of dry vermouth and Campari. To assemble, mix the ingredients in a pitcher, stir in ice and strain into a chilled cocktail glass. Finish off with a twist of lemon. </mm> </dd></dl>
