The heart shaped leaves and the blood-like red sap speak to the abilities of this beautiful tree to heal wounds and cleanse the blood. The flowers found high in the branches resemble the dragon&apos;s head, thus the interesting name, as well as a symbol of its fierce healing ability. </mm> </dd></dl>
