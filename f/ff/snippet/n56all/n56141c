Linnaeus&apos; Sexual System is a simple but ingenious arithmetical method of classification whereby the genera are grouped into 24 classes according to the number of stamens (husbands) and their interrelationships. Within each class the genera are arranged into smaller groups or orders according to the number of pistils (wives). Though this system has since been superseded it was the basis for most books on botany throughout the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, many of which contained his famous synoptic table, the <i>Clavis Systematis Sexualis</i>, a truncated version of which is included here: <UL><LI><b><mark>Publicae Nuptiae</mark></b> (public marriage, everything visible, openly celebrated); <LI> &nbsp; <b><mark>Monoclina</mark></b> (husbands and wives in one bed); <LI> &nbsp; All the flowers hermaphrodite, stamens and pistils in the same flower <LI> &nbsp; &nbsp; Without affinity (husbands not related) <LI> &nbsp; &nbsp; Stamens not united <LI> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1. MONANDRIA (one husband or stamen) <LI> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. DIANDRIA (two husbands) <LI> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3. TRIANDRIA <LI> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &hellip; <LI> &nbsp; &nbsp; With affinity (husbands in groups of brothers) <LI> &nbsp; &nbsp; Stamens united in one or more bundles <LI> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 16.
