They call themselves <mark>Sabme</mark>, but are called Finns by the Norewegians. They are the shortest and most brachycephalic race in Europe. The majority are nomads who live by pasturing reindeer, and are known as <mark>Mountain Lapps</mark>, but others have become more or less settled and live by hunting or fishing. From ancient times the Lapps have had a great reputation among the Finns and other neighbouring nations for skill in sorcery. <small> &ldquo;FINNO-UGRIAN&rdquo; <a name="EBFU" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#EBFU"><cite title="source">Encyclopaedia Britannica</cite></a>, 11th edit.
