Guthrum, the king of the foe, and twenty-nine of his chief men accepted baptism. By the next year (879) not only Wessex, but Mercia, west of Watling street, was cleared of Danes. This is the arrangement known as the peace of Wedmore (878), though no document embodying its provisions is in existence. And though for that present time the north-eastern half of England, including London, remained in the hands of the invaders, in reality the tide had turned and western Europe was saved from the danger of becoming a heathen Scandinavian power. For the next few years there was peace, the Danes being kept preoccupied on the Continent. </mm> </dd></dl>
