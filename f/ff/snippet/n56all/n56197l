In the Triads we read of a Guinevere who is described as &ldquo;the daughter of Ogrvan the Giant&ldquo; (see <i>ante</i>, p. 53). She is, apparently, the one among &ldquo;<mark>the three Guineveres</mark>&rdquo; who is best known to Welsh tradition as the wife of Arthur. She is mentioned both in a poem by the famous Welsh poet of the fourteenth century, Dafydd ap Gwilym&mdash;referring to her adventure with Melwas &mdash;and in an old Welsh rhyme, which gives her a somewhat disreputable character (see Rhys, <cite>Arthurian Legend</cite>, Chap. III.). <small> W. Lewis Jones, <a name="WJKA5" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#WJKA5"><cite title="source">King Arthur in History and Legend</cite></a> (1914) 76n1</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
