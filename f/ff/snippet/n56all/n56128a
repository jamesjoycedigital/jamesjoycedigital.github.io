(with the Turkish Tales = Forty Vezirs) as early as 1714; and subsequently]</font> by Ambrose Phillips (in 1738) (Clouston, in litt). Here, and occasionally elsewhere, I have quoted from some&nbsp;MSS. notes on The Nights by Mr. W. A. Clouston, which Sir R. F. Burton kindly permitted me to inspect. Mr. Clouston then quotes Cazotte&apos;s Preface (not in my edition of the Thousand and One Days), according to which the book was written by the celebrated Dervis Mocl&egrave;s (Mukhlis), chief of the Sofis (Sufis?) of lspahan, founded upon certain Indian comedies. Petis de la Croix was on friendly terms with Mukhlis, who allowed him to take a copy of his work in 1675, during his residence in Ispahan. <small> Richard F.
