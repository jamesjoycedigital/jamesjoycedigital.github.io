At last, standing upon the mysterious island of the <mark>Simurgh</mark>, and &ldquo;casting a clandestine glance at him they saw <mark>thirty birds</mark> in him; and when they turned their eyes to themselves, the thirty birds seemed one Simurgh: they saw in themselves the entire Simurgh; they saw in the Simurgh the thirty birds entirely.&rdquo; Therefore they arrived at the solution of the problem &ldquo;<i>We</i> and <i>Thou</i>;&rdquo; that is, the identity of God and man. <small> Richard F.
