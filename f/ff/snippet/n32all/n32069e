It is related to Nagari, but is hardly legible to anyone except the original writer, and sometimes not even to him. To remedy this defect an improved form of ther alphabet was devised in the 16th century by Angad, the fifth Sikh Guru, for the purpose of recording the Sihk scriptures. It is called <mark><i>Gurmukhi</i></mark>, &ldquo;proceeding from the mouth of the Guru,&rdquo; and is now generally used for writing the language. <small> &ldquo;HINDOSTANI&rdquo; <a name="EBHI" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#EBHI"><cite title="source">Encyclopaedia Britannica</cite></a>, 11th edit.
