P. In the former he is a descendant of Cain, and through his sons the author of primitive civilization; in the latter he is the father of Noah. But it is now generally held that these two genealogies are variant adaptations of the Babylonian list of primitive kings (see Enoch). It is doubtful whether Lamech is to be identified with the name of any one of these kings; he may have been introduced into the genealogy from another tradition. In the older narrative in Gen. iv. Lamech&apos;s family are the originators of various advances in civilization; he himself is the first to marry more than one wife, <mark>&apos;Adah</mark> (&ldquo;ornament,&rdquo; perhaps specially &ldquo;dawn&rdquo;) and Zillah (&ldquo;shadow&rdquo;). He has three sons Jabal, Jubal, and Tubal, the last-named qualified by the addition of Cain (= &ldquo;smith&rdquo;). </mm> </dd></dl>
