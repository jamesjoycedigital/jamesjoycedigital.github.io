This setting out of a Far-Interior caravan, for instance, is one such event, and so orthodox in character that you must begin by ceremonially &ldquo;going into camp,&rdquo; as the phrase goes. Now, this only means that you formally shake the dust from your feet, by leaving your village hut, and, picking out a bit of forest, you hoist your private <mark>flag on the highest tree</mark>: the solemn &ldquo;Blue Peter&rdquo; this, notifying all comers that your land ship has already set out on its long voyage. <small> Daniel Crawford, <a name="DCTB" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#DCTB"><cite title="source">Thinking Black</cite></a> (1912) 65-6</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
