It is now a neglected hole in a field at the rere of the parish school-house, with the remains of a small building or arch over it, which was erected by one of the Plunkets of Dunsoughly, about 1756. It was greatly resorted to, especially in the summer of 1768, when, according to Dr. Rutty, &ldquo;it undoubtedly produced some notably good effects in the cure of divers <mark>impetiginous disorders</mark>, sore eyes, and inveterate and ill-conditioned ulcers.&rdquo; It was used by applying wet rags to the place afflicted, and by drinking it. <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> It was bottled, and made a subject for export. It was much used by Dr. Achmet Buromborad, of whom the reader may find a caricature, with some truth, in &ldquo;Barrington&apos;s Sketches.&rdquo; <small> N.
