This, he contended, was not altogether a Tipperary matter, for the structure was a great monument to a great Churchman and Irishman, and the patron of the Gaels of Ireland. It should bring the blush of shame to Irishmen and Gaels to look upon the memorial owing to the manner in which it was kept. When recently in the town of Thurles he had seen this memorial, and its condition was a disgrace to whoever was responsible for it, for it was without a paling or railing, and there were tinkers&apos; asses tied to it. <small> <a name="FJ21apr24" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#FJ21apr24"><cite title="source">Freeman's Journal</cite></a> (21 April 1924) 5/2</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
