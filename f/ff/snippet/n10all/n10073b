Forty-two years ago she penned a curious note, hoping &ldquo;some nice boy would find it&rdquo; and return it to her and putting it into a sealed bottle cast it into the sea. / During all those years the bottle has apparently remained quite intact in the ocean depths with its curious note fresh as the day it was first written. / Prominence is given to the matter in the American papers to hand. The &ldquo;New York Sun&rdquo; reports the incident as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;While walking along Rockaway Beach yesterday morning Frank Pick, who lives at the resort, noticed a green bottle which had been washed in by the waves. The top of the bottle was sealed and inside was a piece of white paper. Pick broke the neck and read the following message on the paper: / &ldquo;&lsquo;This bottle was cast into the sea at Kingstown, in the County of Dublin, Ireland, on the 4th day of December, 1882, by Elizabeth Kinch, Pave lane, Kingstown, age 18 years. Hope some nice boy finds and returns it to me.&rsquo; / Although the probabilities were that Miss Kinch found a &lsquo;nice boy&rsquo; long since, Pick said he would inform the sixty-year-old woman that the bottle had ended its journey.&rdquo; <small> <a name="FJ21apr24" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#FJ21apr24"><cite title="source">Freeman's Journal</cite></a> (21 April 1924) 4/3</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
