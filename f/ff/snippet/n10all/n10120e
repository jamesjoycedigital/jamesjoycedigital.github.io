The unhappy father had himself embalmed the body, and carried it with him from lodging to lodging. That one object had power to melt the hardened <mark>desperado</mark>, to sober the maddened drunkard; and as he went forth, houseless, from his last lodging, was the sole object of his care. <small> N.
