By an Act of Assembly of the 18th of January, 1716, the Lord Mayor, sheriffs, and citizens, who were owners in fee of the soil, divided the entire of the strand, from the Liffey to the sheds of Clontarf, into convenient plots, and passed a resolution for enclosing and draining it. It was accordingly mapped out, and the various divisions were distributed, by casting lots, among the several members of the corporation. They were of two classes. Some were called <mark>acre lots</mark>, which included all except those abutting on the quay intended to be made along the Liffey, which latter were called <mark>foot lots</mark>. <small> N.
