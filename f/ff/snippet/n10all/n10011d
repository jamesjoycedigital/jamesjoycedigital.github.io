Earwicker. The most historically reliable of the Icelandic sagas is the shortest of the five, the <i>Eyrbyggja saga</i>, especially valuable for the information it has preserved relative to old Scandinavian religious beliefs and practices. It narrates events that took place on the great peninsula of Sm&aelig;fellsness, on the west coast of Iceland, between the period of the settlement (about 884) and the death of the famous chief Snorri (about 1031). The early chapters tell how Th&oacute;r&oacute;lf from Mostr in Norway went out to Iceland, taking with him the timber of Thor&apos;s temple, which he re-erected at the place where he made his new homa. The whole passage relating to this contains much of all that is known about the actual worship of Thor among the old Norwegians and Icelanders, and appears to rest upon a trustworthy tradition. </mm> </dd></dl>
