Towards the end of that time Gormflaith, who had meantime separated from her husband, incited her brother Maelmordha to make war on Brian. Maelmordha and Sihtric began to gather forces for the coming struggle. Sihtric at his mother&apos;s command sought the aid of Siguthr, Earl of Orkney, and of Brodar, a Viking whose fleet then lay off the west coast of Man. Fleets also came from Norway and Iceland to help their kinsmen. The armies under Brian and Maelsechnaill marched towards Dublin, and having encamped near Kilmainham, set fire to the district of Fingal (<i>i.e.</i> <i>Fine Gall</i>, &ldquo;the Foreigners&apos; territory&rdquo;) north of the city. The two armies met at Clontarf on Good Friday morning and the battle, one of the most famous ever fought on Irish soil, raged all that day. The Norsemen suffered a severe defeat, and in attempting to fly for refuge to their ships were slaughted by Maelsechnaill <mark>at Dubhgall&apos;s Bridge, near <font color="green">[where is now]</font> the Four Courts</mark>. Brian himself did not take part in the fight, but he was slain in his tent by <mark>Brodar</mark> <font color="green">[the earl of York]</font> after the battle. <small> A.
