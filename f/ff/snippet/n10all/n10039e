Kenny, A.M.I.E.E., of the firm of Messrs. J.P. Tierney and Co., Consulting Engineers, Dublin, when lecturing on small power supply schemes, before the Irish Centre of the Institution of Electrical Engineers in Trinity College, Dublin, last night. / &ldquo;We look to the future,&rdquo; he proceeded, &ldquo;and we hear talk of the development of peat, of harnessing the Liffey, the Shannon, the Bann, and many other of our rivers. Full of Aerials. &ldquo;If all these schemes develop in proportion to the present-day talk of them every nook and corner will be full of high tension aerials, and <mark>Ireland will be the electrical wonder of the world</mark>.&rdquo; <small> <a name="FJ11apr24" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#FJ11apr24"><cite title="source">Freeman's Journal</cite></a> (11 April 1924) 6/3</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
