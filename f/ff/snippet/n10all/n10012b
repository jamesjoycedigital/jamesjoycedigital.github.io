The great Viking <mark>Magnus</mark>, who was killed in Ireland in <year>A.D.</year> 1103, was usually called &ldquo;<mark>barelegs</mark>&rdquo; (O.N. <i>berfaettr</i>) because he always wore the Irish kilts; and his son, Harold Gilli, who could speak Irish better than Norse, &ldquo;much wore the Irish raiment, being short-clad and light-clad&rdquo;.
