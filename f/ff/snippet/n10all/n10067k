According to an article in the <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>, 9 January 1964, p. 27, cited in Gifford&apos;s note on U 12.120, J.J. Giltrap had an Irish Setter of that name, which was born in 1874, so the dog in &lsquo;Cyclops&rsquo; is likely to have been a descendant&mdash;distinct from &lsquo;Giltrap&apos;s lovely dog Garryowen that almost talked&rsquo; (U 13.233). </mm> </dd></dl>
