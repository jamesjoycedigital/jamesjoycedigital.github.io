Delany&apos;s simplicity and vanity; his almost childish gratification at Swift&apos;s praises; his sincere veneration for his friend; his unsophisticated ignorance of the world, and voluntary exposure of himself to ridicule; his innocent, though absurd self-conceit; his constant hospitality, and no less constant pecuniary embarrassments, form a character so distinct, it is easy to <mark>summon the picture</mark> of the man who was always in debt; who got from his friend the Dean a recommendation to Bolingbroke of a rogue and a whore; and who, after soliciting the honour of preaching before George II., came late to the church, and threw the service into confusion, from his neglect of the usual forms&mdash; &ldquo;Let the Dean say what he will, / Delany, you&apos;re Delany still.&rdquo; <small> N.
