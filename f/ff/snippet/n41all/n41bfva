She became a dancer and later a soloist with the famous dance ensembles, Rythme et Couleur (London) and Th&eacute;&acirc;tre de la Pantomime Futuriste (Italy), and travelled through the whole of Europe. Among her friends were Leos Janacek, Bohuslav Martinu, Oskar Kokoschka and Erich Kleiber. Prague has a concert hall named after her. It is most probable that Joyce&apos;s note was connected with Lucia&apos;s passion for dancing. The French address was probably a temporary one where she was staying at the time: her name is not listed in contemporary directories. Malostranska is probably Malostranske Namesti (square) in the Lesser Town area (Mala Strana) of Prague, which has had no street of that name.</mm> </dd></dl>
