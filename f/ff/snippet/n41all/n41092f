The streets were badly made and ill-kept, and unsafe for pedestrians after dark, as they were miserably lighted, and there was no effective police force. &hellip; Dirt and disorder also reigned in the semi-rural suburbs; rubbish was deposited indiscriminately on waste land, there were dirty and untidy farms, and numerous brickfields sending forth sulphurous fumes. The following lines, from an old poem, describing the purlieus of London, give a somewhast depressing picture: Where&apos;er around I cast my wandr&apos;ing eyes, / Long burning rows of <mark>fetid brick</mark> arise, / And nauseous dunghills swell in mould&apos;ring heaps. / While the fat sow beneath their covert sleeps. <small> George Trobridge, <a name="GTLS" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#GTLS"><cite title="source">A Life of Emanuel Swedenborg</cite></a>, 2nd ed.
