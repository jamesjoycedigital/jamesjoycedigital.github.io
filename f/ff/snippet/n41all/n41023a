Thus, while a husband could obtain a divorce on proof of his wife&apos;s adultery alone, a wife could only obtain similar relief on proof of her husband&apos;s &ldquo;<mark>aggravated adultery</mark>&rdquo;, i.e. adultery accompanied by incest, bigamy, rape, cruelty or desertion for two years or &hellip; desertion arising from non-compliance by the husband with a decree for restitution of conjugal rights (termed &ldquo;statutory desertion&rdquo;). <small> Maud I.
