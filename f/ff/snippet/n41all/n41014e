Presently they returned to the Prophet who asked them, Where be F&iacute;r? and they answered, O our lord, &ldquo;As&aacute; F&iacute;r <font color="green">[i.e. &ldquo;Fir is rebellious.&rdquo;]</font>, whence that name hath clung to the fowls.&ldquo; <br><font color="green">[note to As&aacute;f&iacute;r above]</font>: Plur. of &ldquo;&apos;Usfur&rdquo; = a bird, a sparrow.

VII, 102</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: Joyce&apos;s &lsquo;wren = eagle&rsquo; alludes to the folk tale about how at a gathering of the birds it was decided that the bird that could fly the highest would be declared king. The wren won by hiding in the eagle&apos;s feathers and beginning his flight at the point where the eagle had stopped. A version of the story is found in Grimm (&lsquo;King Wren&rsquo; or &lsquo;Der Zaunk&ouml;nig&rsquo;). Compare also the traditional rhyme associated in Ireland with St Stephen&apos;s day: The wren, the wren / The king of the birds. See also FW 383.04 </mm> </dd></dl>
