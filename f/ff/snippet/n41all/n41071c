She kept none of his; she was too loyal for that. It is extremely probable that he entered into this grim and shocking game of correspondence about poisoning meaning it as little as she did; and it is probable that they both found an erotic stimulus in giving full play on paper to their jealousy. And when the letters ceased, and they met again, they had worked themselves up too far; <mark>what had been grim play had to become grim earnest</mark>; and to avoid anti-climax this jealous lad was forced to the climax of the knife. <small> Filson Young, <a name="FYTF" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#FYTF"><cite title="source">Trial of Frederick Bywaters and Edith Thompson</cite></a> (1923) xix</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
