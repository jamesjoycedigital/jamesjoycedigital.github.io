A male under the age of <mark>14</mark> and a female under the age of <mark>12</mark> is incapable according to English Law to give the necessary consent <font color="green">[to marry]</font>, and therefore to contract a binding marriage. The <mark>marriage</mark> of persons under these ages respectively is however not altogether void, but only <mark>imperfect</mark>; so that either party, when the party who was under age reaches the proper age, may declare the marriage void, or else may affirm it. <small> Maud I.
