M&aacute;lik, i. Arphaxed, i. Sh&aacute;m, i. Nuh (Noah); or son of Nimrod, son of Canaan. Sh&aacute;m = Syria (and its capital) the land on the left, as opposed to Al-Yaman the land on the right of one looking East, is noticed in vol i. 55. In Mr. Cotheal&apos;s&nbsp;MS. Damascus is entitled &ldquo;Sh&aacute;m&rdquo; because it is the &ldquo;Sh&aacute;mat&rdquo; cheek-mole (beauty-spot) of Allah upon earth. &ldquo;Jalak&rdquo; the older name of the <mark>&ldquo;Smile of the Prophet,&rdquo;</mark> is also noted: see vol. ii. l00. <small> Richard F. Burton, trans. <a name="RBTE3" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#RBTE3"><cite title="source">Supplemental Nights to the Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night</cite></a> (n.d.) VII, 167n2</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: Unit repeated at <a name="n4062b" href="n40all.htm#n4062b">N40 (VI.B.28B):62(b)</a>. Burton notes [vol. x.173]: The &ldquo;Palace of Peace&rdquo; (Ddr al-Salam), worthy successor of Babylon and Nineveh, which had outrivalled Damascus, the &ldquo;Smile of the Prophet,&rdquo; and Kufah, the successor of Hira and the magnificent creation of Caliph Omar, possessed unrivalled advantages of site and climate. The Tigris-Euphrates Valley, where the fabled Garden of Eden has been placed, in early ages succeeded the Nile-Valley as a great centre of human development; and the prerogative of a central and commanding position still promises it, even in the present state of decay and desolation under the unspeakable Turk, a magnificent future, when railways and canals shall connect it with Europe. </mm> </dd></dl>
