In Al-Hariri (Ass. xix.) where he enumerates the several kinds of dishes with their metonomies it is called the <mark>&ldquo;Mother of Strengthening&rdquo;</mark> (or Restoration) because it contains wheat &ldquo;the Strengthener&rdquo; (as opposed to barley and holcus). So the &ldquo;Mother of Hospitality&rdquo; is the Sikb&aacute;j, the Persian &ldquo;Sikba&rdquo;, so entitled because it is the principal dish set before guests and was held to be royal food.
