It may also be &ldquo;Zifr&rdquo; = alluding to the <mark>horny matter</mark> which, according to Moslem tradition, <mark>covered the bodies of &ldquo;our first parents&rdquo;</mark> and of which after the &ldquo;original sin&rdquo;</mark> nothing remained but the <mark>nails of their fingers and toes</mark>. It was only <mark>when this disappeared</mark> that they became conscious of their <mark>nudity</mark>. So says M. Houdas; but I prefer to consider the word as a clerical error for Zafar= plaited hair. <small> Richard F.
