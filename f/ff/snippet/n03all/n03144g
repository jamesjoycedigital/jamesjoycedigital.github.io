Before them on the bank sat a poor <mark>pilgrim</mark>, wrapped in his mantle, which was hung with scallop shells; he held out his wooden bowl and craved alms in sharp complaining tones. The Cornish boats came over, rowed by oarsmen. When they drew near the bank, Iseult said to the knights about her: &ldquo;My Lords, how shall I reach the land without soiling my long robes in the mud. A ferryman must come and help me.&rdquo; One of the knights hailed the pilgrim: &ldquo;Friend, gird up thy mantle, come down into the water and carry the Queen, if indeed, broken as thou art, thou dost not fear to fall by the way.&rdquo; The man took the Queen in his arms. She whispered in his ear: &ldquo;Beloved!&rdquo; and then, more softly still: &ldquo;Fall upon the sand.&rdquo; When he reached the bank, <mark>he stumbled and fell</mark>, holding the Queen closely in his arms. Then the squires and mariners, seizing oars and boathooks, pursued the poor wretch. &ldquo;Leave him in peace,&rdquo; said the Queen; &ldquo;no doubt his long pilgrimage has weakened him.&rdquo; And unfastening a golden clasp she threw it to the pilgrim. <small> Joseph B&eacute;dier, <a name="JBLR1" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#JBLR1"><cite title="source">Le roman de Tristan et Iseut</cite></a> (1900) XII &lsquo;Le Jugement par le Fer Rouge&rsquo;, 136</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
