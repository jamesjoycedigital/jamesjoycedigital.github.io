Amongst the captives brought back from one of these foreign raids was Succoth, a lad of sixteen, the son of Decurion Calpurnius, and his wife Conchessa, who was a relative of the great St. Martin of Tours. The boy <mark>Succoth</mark>, afterwards called <mark>Patricius</mark>, probably in allusion to his noble birth, was sold as a slave in Ireland, and employed by his master Milcho to tend his cattle on the slopes of Slieve Mish in Antrim. <small> J.M.
