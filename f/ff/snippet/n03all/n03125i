Common objects assumed for him suggestive meanings. He saw a means of coining new expressions for generative acts and objects; he found associations when he used the <mark>fire-drill</mark> drilling in the hollow of the wood, or when he threw wood upon the fire. In later time he coined new symbolical terms suggested by such acts of his as stuffing a cork in a bottle, or putting bread in the oven, or inserting a key in the lock. <small> Albert Mordell, <a name="AMEM" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#AMEM"><cite title="source">The Erotic Motive in Literature</cite></a> (1919) 168</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
