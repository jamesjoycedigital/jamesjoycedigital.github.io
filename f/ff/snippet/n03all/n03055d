It ends in two blunt points that are not unlike the unshapely fingers of a giant&apos;s hand in a Scandinavian story, only that one of them, that on the northern side, is bigger in every way than the other, built up of huger cliffs, and so higher and freer of the winds and the clouds. Yet it was that northern point that the hardy people of old chose, when Christianity was still young in the land, to give to God, building their little stone church of four simple walls upon it, and burying their dead between that little church and the steep edge of the cliff. Of that early church only fragments of broken walls remain; hundreds of years must have passed since Mass was last sung there above the sea; but the crowded gravestones, many of them too neat, too new, tell us that the people of Rossadoon lay their dead of to-day with those that died over a thousand years ago. <small> Daniel Corkery, <a name="DCHB" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#DCHB"><cite title="source">The Hounds of Banba</cite></a> (1920) 54f</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: RJH: Joyce concludes from the contrast between the old and the new graves that the gravediggers have been on strike for a thousand years. By the way, in the 1930 reprint, the story is called &ldquo;Cowards?&rdquo; with a question mark. </mm> </dd></dl>
