He also here recorded unconsciously some of his own past griefs in love. Freud taught that anxiety dreams were due to the repression of the <mark>libido</mark> being converted into fear. We also know from anthropology that the boar was a sexual symbol. In the poem Diomede appears to Troilus as a boar, also, because Troilus had heard the story of Meleager and the boar and of the ancestry of Diomede. Even though he had forgotten the tale, if he did, since he was reminded of it by his sister, it was still present in his unconscious. His anxiety was due to the fear that Diomede had really won Criseyde. The fear that he experienced at day, that his sweetheart would be lost to him the anxiety that his libido would be repressed, become an anxiety dream in which the boar is the symbol of his rival.&rdquo; <small> Albert Mordell, <a name="AMEM" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#AMEM"><cite title="source">The Erotic Motive in Literature</cite></a> (1919) 160f.</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: See also: <a name="n03126f" href="n03all.htm#n03126f">N03 (VI.B.3):126(f)</a> and <a name="sa0851ce" href="saall.htm#sa0851ce">SA (VI.A):0851(ce)</a>.
