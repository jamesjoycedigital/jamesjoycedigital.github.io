With rare unselfishness, or, if you will, with Celtic clannishness, he did a good deal to make Oscar&apos;s name known. Every clever thing that Oscar said or that could be attributed to him, Willie reported in &ldquo;The World&rdquo;. This puffing and Oscar&apos;s own uncommon power as a talker; but chiefly perhaps <mark>a whispered reputation for strange sins</mark>, had thus early begun to form a sort of myth around him. He was already on the way to becoming a personage; there was a certain curiosity about him, a flutter of interest in whatever he did. <small> Frank Harris, <a name="FHOW2" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#FHOW2"><cite title="source">Oscar Wilde His Life and Confessions</cite></a> (1918) 34</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
