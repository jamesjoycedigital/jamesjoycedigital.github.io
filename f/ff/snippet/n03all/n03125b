This work is largely attributed to the second great English poet <mark>Cynewulf</mark> in the eighth century. Certain riddles are propounded which reek with lewd suggestions, and the answer is supposed to be some object innocent in itself; it is apparent, however, from the questions and descriptions given that the interest in this object is because it is sexually symbolical. Thus the answers meant for the 26th, 45th, 46th, 55th, 63rd and 64th riddles of the Exeter Book are leek, key, dough, churn, poker and beaker, respectively. The reader will note thus how these objects had a sexual symbolic meaning for our ancestors. Professor <mark>Frederic Tupper in his scholarly work <i>The Riddles of the Exeter Book</i></mark> says: &ldquo;By far the most numerous of all riddles of lapsing or varying solutions are those distinctly popular and unrefined problems whose sole excuse for being (or lack of excuse) lies in double meaning and coarse suggestion, and the reason for this uncertainty of answer is at once apparent. The formally stated solution is so overshadowed by the obscene subject implicitly presented in each limited motive of the riddle, that little attention is paid to the aptness of this. It is after all only a pretense, not the chief concern of the jest.&rdquo; <small> Albert Mordell, <a name="AMEM" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#AMEM"><cite title="source">The Erotic Motive in Literature</cite></a> (1919) 166f</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: <cite>The Riddles of the Exeter Book</cite>, edited with an introduction, notes and glossary by Fred Tupper (London: Albion Series of Anglo-Saxon and Middle English Poetry, 1910). The <i>Exeter Book</i> contains two poems by the eighth-century Anglo-Saxon poet Cynewulf, <i>The Ascension</i> and <i>Juliana</i>. </mm> </dd></dl>
