On a table, covered with a rich cloth of purple, his servants placed his dog <mark>Petit-Cr&ucirc;</mark>. It was an enchanted dog; it came from the Isle of Avalon; a fairy had sent it to him as a love-token, &hellip; From a slender gold chain about his neck hung a tiny golden <mark>bell</mark>, which tinkled with so gay, clear, and sweet a sound that, as he heard it, Tristram&apos;s heart was soothed, and his pain melted away. &hellip; <font color="green">[p.154 (Tristram has tricked the Duke and sent his dog to Iseult)]</font> But one day she understood that it was an enchantment, and that it was the tinkling of <mark>the little bell that charmed her heart</mark>. &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;is it well that I should take comfort while Tristram is wretched? He might have kept this enchanted dog and so have forgotten all his grief. Of his courtesy he chose rather to send it to me, to give me his joy and take back his misery. But it is not well that it should be so. Tristram, beloved, <mark>I will suffer as long as thou sufferest</mark>.&rdquo; She took the magic bell, rang it for the last time, untied it gently, then threw it into the sea from the open window. <small> Joseph B&eacute;dier, <a name="JBLR1" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#JBLR1"><cite title="source">Le roman de Tristan et Iseut</cite></a> (1900) XIV &lsquo;Le Grelot Merveilleux&rsquo;, 150</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: Algolagnia: taking sexual pleasure in inflicting or suffering pain. </mm> </dd></dl>
