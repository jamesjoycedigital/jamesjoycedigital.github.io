He wrote in his <cite>Human All Too Human</cite>, Vol. i, pp. 23-26: &ldquo;The perfect distinctions of all dreams representations, which pre-suppose absolute faith in their reality, recall the conditions that appertain to primitive man, in whom hallucination was extraordinarily frequent, and sometime simultaneously seized entire communities, entire nations. Therefore, in sleep and in dreams we once more carry out the task of early humanity. ... I hold, that as man now still reasons in dreams, so men reasoned also when awake through thousands of years; the first cause which occurred to the mind to explain anything that required an explanation, was sufficient and stood for truth &hellip; this ancient element in human nature still manifests itself in our dreams, for it is the foundation upon which the higher reason has developed and still develops in every individual; the dream carries us back into the remote conditions of human culture, and provides a ready means of understanding them better. Dream-thinking is now so easy to us because during immense periods of human development we have been so well drilled in this form of fantastic and cheap explanation, by means of the first agreeable notions. In so far, dreaming is a recreation of the brain, which by day has to satisfy the stern demands of thought, as they are laid down by the higher culture.&rdquo; <small> Albert Mordell, <a name="AMEM" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#AMEM"><cite title="source">The Erotic Motive in Literature</cite></a> (1919) 182-183</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
