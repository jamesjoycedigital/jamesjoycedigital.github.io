In 1922 the Public Record Office was situated in the Four Courts, Dublin. In April of that year the building was seized by anti-Treaty IRA forces, who held it for three months. On 28 June, the army was sent in and the building was shelled. The worst destruction took place on 30 June, the day the occupying force surrendered, when a series of explosions destroyed much of the building. The blasts blew the papers from the Public Record Office all over Dublin and much of the country&apos;s archive was lost.</mm> </dd></dl>
