Joyce decides to skip Chapter XII, <i>Cannibalism: The Atreus Legend</i>, Chapter XIII, <i>Psychoanalysis and Literary Criticism</i>, Chapter XIV, <i>Keats&apos; Personal Love Poems</i> and Chapter XVI, <i>Shelley&apos;s Personal Love Poems</i>, and reads only the chapter about Edgar Allan Poe, half-heartedly, it seems, because the notes are not in chronological order, indicating that he skimmed through it from middle to end to beginning.] </mm> </dd></dl>
