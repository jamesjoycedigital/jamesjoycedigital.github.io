They had come through Moloney&apos;s stabling yard, leaping over the wall into the little bohereen that led up to the hillside. He knew them. One was the Casey boy; the other was the schoolmaster&apos;s son, Sam <mark>Lillis</mark>. They stopped up suddenly to find him in the wicket before them. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; they jerked out, and young Casey turned irresolutely on his heel, looking to see if anyone else were following. But Sam Lillis gave a sort of military salute: &ldquo;Ciaran, &mdash; Ciaran&apos;s after meeting with an accident.&rdquo; <small> Daniel Corkery, <a name="DCHB" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#DCHB"><cite title="source">The Hounds of Banba</cite></a> (1920) 198f</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
