The title of <mark>scribe</mark> is frequently used in our ancient literature to enhance the dignity of a bishop, and we find that St. Conlaeth, the first Bishop of Kildare, was a skilled worker in metals. St. Dega was also a celebrated artificer and scribe; one of St. Patrick&apos;s three smiths was Fortchern, son of Laery, King of Ireland, and it is stated in the Tripartite Life that the holy Bishop Assicus was his coppersmith. <small> J.M.
