We had no facts to go on, and we found this out for each other after some strenuous hours. I also found out (he never would) that we were standing on <mark>St. Patrick&apos;s bridge</mark>, that a cutting wind was blowing up the river, and that Seumas had been coughing the whole time. I persuaded him to go to his lodgings in Sheares street, that he was not needed in the club that night. <small> Daniel Corkery, <a name="DCHB" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#DCHB"><cite title="source">The Hounds of Banba</cite></a> (1920) 71ff</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
