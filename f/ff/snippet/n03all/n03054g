Beneath my eyes I saw certain light marks on the ground, not wheel marks they were not more than two feet six apart, and besides they were not cut into the ground. I was instantly following them. I knew what they were. They were the marks of a &ldquo;<mark>tray</mark>&rdquo;, as the peasants of that place call it both in Irish and English: a sort of <mark>light sleigh on which they bring down the cut turf</mark> from places in the uplands that are too steep for horse and cart. These marks meant a house, sooner or later. With the greatest care I kept to them. And soon I began to come on other signs of human ways and strivings a cairn of stones, a first effort at a clearance, then a crazy sort of boundary fence, long abandoned to its own will, then at last two forked stakes in the ground, a young ash sapling laid across them, closing a gap. I blessed the human touch: the pious hands of husbandry had made it! Then I struck the path. <small> Daniel Corkery, <a name="DCHB" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#DCHB"><cite title="source">The Hounds of Banba</cite></a> (1920) 40</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
