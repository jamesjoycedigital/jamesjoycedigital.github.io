Now it so happened that I went forth and was absent one whole year; and when I returned from my journey I cam to her by night, and saw a black slave lying with her on the carpet-bed and they were talking, and dallying, and laughing, and kissing, and playing the close buttock-game. When she saw me, she rose and came hurriedly at me with <mark>a gugglet of water</mark>: and muttering spells over it, she besprinkled me and said, &ldquo;Comeforth from this thy shape into the shape of a dog;&rdquo; and I became on the instant a dog. <small> Richard F.
