Oscar lectured some ninety times from January till July, when he returned to New York. The gross receipts amounted to some &pound;4,000: he received about &pound;1,200, which left him with a few hundreds above his expenses. His optimism regarded this as a triumph. <mark>One is fain</mark> to confess today that these lectures make very poor reading. There is not a new thought in them; not even a memorable expression; they are nothing but student work, the best passages in them being mere paraphrases of Pater and Arnold, though the titles were borrowed from Whistler. <small> Frank Harris, <a name="FHOW2" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#FHOW2"><cite title="source">Oscar Wilde His Life and Confessions</cite></a> (1918) 43</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
