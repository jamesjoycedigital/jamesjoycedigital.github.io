It resembled very much the type of underwear known as a combination, and was fastened with strings at various places. Over the breast was a mystic sign, differing for man and woman. The garment was supposed to protect the wearer from danger to his or her life, and some of Joseph Smith&apos;s followers maintain that the only reason why the bullets fired at him were able to penetrate his body was his neglect to wear his <mark>Endowment garment</mark> that day. <small> M.R.
