The company was in Annapolis, Marylands. The murder in Rhode Island of a Miss Cornell had aroused the entire population of the eastern states against the accused, the Rev. Ephraim K. Avery, who had been acquitted in the face of general conviction of his guilt. Turner pointed out Barnum to some of the loungers in the bar-room of the Annapolis hotel as the Rev. Ephraim K. Avery, incognito. <font color="green">[The crowd responded by practically lynching Barnum, before his sincere protestations of innocence were heard.]</font> When <font color="green">[Barnum]</font> became angry with Turner, the showman said: &ldquo;My dear Barnum, it was all for our good. Remember, all we need to insure success is <mark><i>notoriety</i></mark>. You will see that the whole town will be talking about the trick played &hellip; and our pavilion will be crammed to-morrow night&rdquo;. <font color="green">[Aaron Turner, one of the early circus propietors of America, and a notorious practical joker, was one of Barnum&apos;s &lsquo;masters&rsquo;.]</font> <small> M.R.
