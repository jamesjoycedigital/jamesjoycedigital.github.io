He had first choice on all the monstrosities in the world, because he paid more for them than anybody else. Men, women and children wrote to him, telegraphed him, and called with varied products for his inspection. <mark>Ossified men</mark>, all bone, india-rubber men, with no bones, three-legged men, and men without legs were brought to his attention. Often Barnum must have felt like the Creator in the presence of His mistakes. <small> M.R. Werner, <a name="MRWP" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#MRWP"><cite title="source">P.T.
