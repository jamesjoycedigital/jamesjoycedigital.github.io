(&pound;30). The gilds and the citizens took great pride in the parts they played, and the expenses of the representations were borne by the gilds severally. The plays of the gilds in the Corpus Chrisiti pageants are given as follows <font color="green">[<cite>Calendar of Ancient Records of Dublin</cite>, i. 239-241]</font>:&mdash; <br>Butchers&mdash;tormentors <font color="green">[executioners]</font>, with their garments well and cleanly <font color="green">[newly]</font> painted. <br>The Mayor of the Bullring and the bachelors of the same&mdash;the nine worthies, riding worshipfully, with their followers accordingly. <br>[Note 4, p.243: The original cycle of the Corpus Christi pageant consisted of fourteen plays. Gilbert&apos;s list (<cite>Cal. Anc. Red. Dub.</cite>) seems to be the final one, after a period of transition in which the Gild of Courteours (whatever that was: the&nbsp;MS. at that place is indistinct) and the Mayor of the Bullring, etc., successfully established their claim to be represented, and were permitted to represent plays that were strangely out of harmony with the remainder of the cycle. The nine worthies were three jews&mdash;Joshua, David and Judas Maccabeus; three pagans&mdash;Hector, Alexander, and Julius Caesar; and three Christians&mdash;Arthur, Charlemagne, and Godfrey of Bouillon (see W. Harris, <cite>Hist. Dub.</cite>, 511). The &lsquo;Mayor of the Bullring&rsquo; was an official elected annually by the citizens to be guardians of the unwedded youths of the city, with power to punish those who frequented brothels. He took his strange title from the iron ring, in the Corn Market,, near Newgate, too which the bull to be baited was tied. In the York cycle of plays (1340-1350) forty-eight trades had different plays allotted to them. <small> M.V.
