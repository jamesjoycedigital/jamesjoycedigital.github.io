<dl id="Raphael-3">   <h4>Transcribed <cite>Finnegans Wake</cite> notebooks, 3rd batch</h4>   </dt>   <dd>The final batch of transcribed notebooks most likely consisted of these eight (VI.C.11-18). Each of the extant primary notebooks copied at this stage has an &ldquo;R&rdquo; written in Madame Raphael's hand at the end of the notebook. The first part of VI.C.16 (the copy of the second part of VI.D.5) might be part of the previous batch, the incomplete VI.C.16 would then have been returned to Mme Raphael to be filled.</dd>   </dl>
