He began it in Paris on his second visit from 23 January to 11 April 1903 (when he was called back to Dublin on news of his mother's ill-health), continued to write in it in Pola in November 1904 (where he had temporarily ended up after eloping with Nora Narnacle in October 1904), and returned to it briefly in Trieste sometime around 1912 to enter another, shorter list of books. <ul><li>DETAILS: <a href="http://catalogue.nli.ie/Record/vtls000356987/HierarchyTree#page/14/mode/1up"  target="_blank">National Library of Ireland Add.
