<dl id="sh4"><dt><a href="../../FF/fnbs/sh4all.htm">Sheets IV</a> </dt> <dd> <ul><li>DATE: late 1933- early 1934 : Paris. Recycled matter from notebooks. This set of sheets were compiled around the same time and from the same set of VI.C notebooks as the main batch of Book III <cite>transition</cite> sheets (see <a name="sh3" href="#sh3">Sheets III</a> above). They were used when Joyce constructed the earliest draft of the &ldquo;Norwegian Captain&rdquo; section of II.3 (Scenes in the Tavern). Joyce designated the particular episode involved, II.3, with the code &ldquo;<big><font face="wake">N</font></big>c&rdquo; (the &ldquo;c&rdquo; is inside the square). Thus, just as chapters 1-4 of Book III were styled &ldquo;<big><font face="wake">D</font></big>a&rdquo;, &ldquo;<big><font face="wake">D</font></big>b&rdquo;, &ldquo;<big><font face="wake">D</font></big>c&rdquo;, and &ldquo;<big><font face="wake">D</font></big>d&rdquo;, we can now see that chapters 1-4 of Book II were styled &ldquo;<big><font face="wake">N</font></big>a&rdquo;,  &ldquo;<big><font face="wake">N</font></big>b&rdquo;, &ldquo;<big><font face="wake">N</font></big>c&rdquo;, and &ldquo;<big><font face="wake">N</font></big>d&rdquo; (but with the letters <i>inside</i> the square). Whereas the Shaun episode code (designating Shaun, Yaun, Yawn and Dawn) is well known, it is only in this case that we find compelling evidence for the Book II episode code. A small amount of corroborative evidence to the same effect appears sporadically in the notebooks. </li><li>First use: preparation of first draft of II.3&sect;1 (&ldquo;Norwegian Captain&rdquo;). <br>TEXT ENTRY LEVEL: II.3&sect;1.0 <br>ORIGIN: Joyce began to copy material from N.44 (VI.B.34), which he worked through in reverse page order, and continued, but no longer in reverse order, with notebooks VI.B.20, VI.B.17 and so on, as in: <br> N44 (VI.B.34) [in reverse], N21 (VI.B.20), N22 (VI.B.17),  VI.C.1, VI.C.3, VI.C.2, VI.C.4, VI.C.5 </li><li>PUBLICATION (online facsimile): NLI website JBZJJF/<a href="http://catalogue.nli.ie/Record/vtls000576980/HierarchyTree"  target="_blank">W/1/23-C</a> and following pages. </li></ul> </dd> </dl>
