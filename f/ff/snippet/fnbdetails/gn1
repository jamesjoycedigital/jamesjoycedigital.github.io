Dzierbicki Collection: The text, which consists of a sequence of 50 prose pieces each separated from its predecessor, is written in ink in Joyce's best handwriting on both sides of eight large artist's drawing sheets held between loose blue covers on which is written &ldquo;Giacomo Joyce&rdquo; in an unknown hand (presumably that of one of his Triestine pupils). The pages, which are not numbered, are all written on. </li><li>PHOTO-REPLICATE: <cite>James Joyce Archive</cite> (New York: Garland, 1978), vol. 7, pp. 276-309. </li><li>PUBLISHED EDITION:  Richard Ellmann, ed. <a href="https://vdocuments.mx/james-joyce-giacomo-joyce.html"  target="_blank"><cite>Giacomo Joyce</cite></a> (London: Faber and Faber, 1968). </li><li>DATE: probably Summer 1914, when Joyce was finishing <cite>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</cite> and beginning <cite>Ulysses</cite> (though no manuscripts from the period for the later book survive). </li></ul> </dd> <dd> This manuscript is a fair copy, so that many of the prose-pieces that make it up may have been written much earlier. Ellmann has dated several of them as early as 1911. Others could not have been drafted before 1914. Joyce left <cite>Giacomo</cite> behind in Trieste when he moved to Paris in July 1920. </dd> </dl>
