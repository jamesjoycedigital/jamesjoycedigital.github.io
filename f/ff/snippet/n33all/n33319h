Gambling with dice, at other times illegal, was now permitted. All classes exchanged gifts, the commonest being wax tapers and clay dolls. These dolls were especially given to children, and the makers of them held a regular fair at this time. Varro thought these dolls represented original sacrifices of human beings to the infernal god. There was, as we have seen, a tradition that human sacrifices were once offered to Saturn, and the Greeks and Romans gave the name of Cronus and Saturn to a cruel Phoenician Baal, to whom, e.g. children were sacrificed at Carthage. <small> &ldquo;SATURN&rdquo; <a name="EBSA" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#EBSA"><cite title="source">Encyclopaedia Britannica</cite></a>, 11th edit.
