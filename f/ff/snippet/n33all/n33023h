The more common form in English is &ldquo;limbo,&rdquo; which is used both in the technical theological sense and derivatively in the sense of &ldquo;prison,&rdquo; or for the condition of being lost, deserted, obsolete. In theology there are (I) the <i>Limbus Infantum</i>, and (2) the <i>Limbus Patrum</i>. 1. The Limbus Infantum or Puerorum is the abode to which human beings dying without actual sin, but with their original sin unwashed away by baptism, were held to be consigned; the category included, not unbaptized infants merely, but also idiots, cretins and the like. </mm> </dd></dl>
