An egg is deposited <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> and held there until a second egg is dropped and cemented to it. Then another egg is placed against the first and second; and so the tiny grey atoms are laid side by side with their pointed tips inclined towards each other. By this unique method <mark>an egg-boat</mark> is made, concave at the top and convex underneath. From three to four hundred eggs are fixed together with adhesive material to form this curious boat. From its <font color="green">[94]</font> shape it cannot possible topple over; neither can it sink. <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> These egg-boats may often be seen on ponds, pools, or <mark>water-butts</mark> during the early summer months. <small> J.H.
