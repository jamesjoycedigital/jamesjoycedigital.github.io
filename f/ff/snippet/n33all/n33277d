At Matlock Bath, the popular Derbyshire village in the vale of the Derwent, the day had been &ldquo;wet and fine,&rdquo; but mostly wet. But between 7 and 8 p.m., when quietly roaming through the vale, a strange phenomenon appeared before us in the near distance. Dark, moving clouds arose about twenty feet above the ground. These were not rain-clouds. <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> One cloud seemed to swoop down within a few yards of the ground. Now the secret was out. These clouds were huge swarms of Gnats, commonly termed Midges. Of course, there are Midges so-called which are not gnats at all and do not belong to the <mark><i>Culex</i></mark> family. <small> J.H.
