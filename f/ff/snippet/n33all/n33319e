Augustus decreed that the 17th should be sacred to Saturn and the 19th to Ops. Henceforward it appears that the 17th and 18th were devoted to the Saturnalia, and the 19th and 20th to the Opalia, a festival of Ops. Caligula added a fifth day, &ldquo;the day of youth&rdquo; (<i>dies juvenalis</i>), devoted no doubt to the sports of the young. But in popular usage the festival lasted seven days. The woollen fetters were taken from the feet of the image of Saturn, and each man offered a pig. During the festival schools were closed; no war was declared or battle fought; no punishment was inflicted. In place of the toga an undress garment (synthesis) was worn. <small> &ldquo;SATURN&rdquo; <a name="EBSA" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#EBSA"><cite title="source">Encyclopaedia Britannica</cite></a>, 11th edit.
