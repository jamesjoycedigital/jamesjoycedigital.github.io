On her husband&apos;s death she assumed the government, and fitted out an army for the invasion of Korea (see Japan, &sect; 9). She returned to Japan completely victorious after three years&apos; absence. Subsequently her son Ojen Tenno, afterwards 15th mikado, was born, and later was canonized as Hachiman, god of war. The empress Jingo ruled over Japan till 270. She is still worshipped. <p>As regards the English oath, usually &ldquo;By Jingo,&rdquo; or &ldquo;By the living Jingo,&rdquo; the derivation is doubtful. The identification with the name of Gingulph or Gengulphus, a Burgundian saint who was martyred on the 11th of May 760, was a joke on the part of <mark>R. H.
