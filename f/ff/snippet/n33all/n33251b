The biretta, too, though not in its origin or in some of its uses a liturgical vestment, has developed a distinctly liturgical character. Besides the strictly liturgical vestments there are also numerous articles of costume worn at choir services, in processions, or on ceremonial occasions in everyday life, which have no sacral character; such are the almuce, the cappa and <mark>mozzetta</mark> (a short cape with a miniature hood), the rochet, the pileolus, a skullcap, worn also sometimes under mitre and tiara. These are generally ensigns of dignity; their form and use varies in different Churches, and they often represent special privileges conferred by the popes, e.g. the cappa of the Lateran basilica worn by the canons of Westminster cathedral, or the almuce worn, by concession of Pope Pius IX., by the members of the Sistine choir. </mm> </dd></dl>
