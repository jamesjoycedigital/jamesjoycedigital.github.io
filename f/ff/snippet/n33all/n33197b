(1165-1223), known as Philip Augustus, king of France, son of Louis VII. and Adela, daughter of Theobald II., count of Champagne, was born on the 21st of August 1165. On the 1st of November 1179 he was associated with his father as king by being crowned at Reims, and at once his father&apos;s illness threw the responsibility of government on him, the death of Louis on the 19th of September 1180 leaving him sole king. In his war against Richard of England, Philip was defeated at Freteval on the 3rd of July 1194, but he continued the war, generally with ill success, for the next five years. Again a formidable coalition was formed against him, including Baldwin IX., count of Flanders and Hainaut, Renaud of Dammartin, count of Boulogne, Louis, count of Blois, and Raymond VI., count of Toulouse. In Germany, Otto of Brunswick, afterwards the emperor <mark>Otto IV.</mark>, allied himself with Richard, while Philip was supported by Otto&apos;s rival, Philip of Swabia. Richard&apos;s death, in April 1199, removed his archenemy, and Richard&apos;s successor, John, concluded the treaty of Le Goulet with Philip on the 22nd of May 1200, ceding to him the county of Evreux, Gravy and Issoudun, and the suzerainty of Berry and Auvergne. John renounced his suzerainty over Brittany and the guardianship of his nephew, Arthur; he engaged not to aid the count of Flanders or Otto IV. without Philip&apos;s consent, paid him a relief of 20,000 marks, and recognized himself as his vassal for his continental fiefs. Philip&apos;s son Louis, afterwards Louis VIII., married Blanche of Castile, John&apos;s niece. </mm> </dd></dl>
