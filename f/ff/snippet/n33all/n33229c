In the course of ages, these appendages have been astoundingly modified in form and in function. So it happens that we find in the arthropods of the present day pairs of antennae, of <mark>mandibles</mark> and other mouth-parts, of <mark>pincers</mark>, of legs, of swimming-feet and of tail pieces which on close examination can all be traced back to a common structure. <small> Harold Russell, <a name="HRTF" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#HRTF"><cite title="source">The Flea</cite></a> (1913) 2</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: The mandible is either of the pair of outermost, biting jaws of an insect.  <br>Raphael transcription: <a name="c15123c" href="c15all.htm#c15123c">VI.C.15:123(c)</a>, <a name="c15123d" href="c15all.htm#c15123d">VI.C.15:123(d)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
