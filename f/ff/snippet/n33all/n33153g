This device, however, did not come into extensive use owing to its danger and inconvenience and to the cost of the phosphorus, and till the beginning of the 19th century flint and steel with <mark>tinder-box</mark> and sulphur-tipped splints of wood&mdash;&rdquo;spunks&rdquo; or matches&mdash;were the common means of obtaining fire for domestic and other purposes. <small> &ldquo;MATCH&rdquo; <a name="EBMA" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#EBMA"><cite title="source">Encyclopaedia Britannica</cite></a>, 11th edit.
