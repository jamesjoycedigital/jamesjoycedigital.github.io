Catholics support this doctrine chiefly by reference to the Jewish belief in the efficacy of <mark>prayer for the dead</mark> (2 Macc. xii. 42 seq.), the tradition of the early Christians, and the authority of the Church. Irenaeus regards as heretical the opinion that the <mark>souls of the departed</mark> pass immediately into glory; Tertullian, Cyprian, the Acts of St Perpetua, Clement of Alexandria, Cyril of Jerusalem, Basil, Gregory of Nyassa, Ambrose, Chrysostom and Jerome, all speak of prayer for the dead and seem to imply belief in a purgatory, but their view seems to have been affected by the pre-Christian doctrine of Hades or Sheol. Some of the Greeks, notably Origen, teach that even the perfect must go through fire in the next world. Augustine writes (De VIII. <i>Dulcitii quaestionibus</i>) that &ldquo;it is not incredible&rdquo; that imperfect souls will be &ldquo;saved by some purgatorial fire,&rdquo; to which they will be subjected for varying lengths of time according to their needs;. but in other passages he expresses conflicting opinions (<i>De civitate</i>, xx. 25, xxi. 13, 26; <i>Enchiridion</i>, 69). </mm> </dd></dl>
