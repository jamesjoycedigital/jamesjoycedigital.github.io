His brother Chilperic also wished to make a brilliant marriage and married her sister Galswintha. He had already repudiated his first wife and had taken as his concubine a serving-woman called Fredegond. But he soon tired of his new partner, and one morning, Galswintha was found strangled in her bed. A few days later Chilperic married Fredegond. This murder was the cause of long and bloody wars, interspersed with truces, between Chilperic and Sigebert. </mm> </dd></dl>
