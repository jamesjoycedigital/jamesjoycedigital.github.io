The attempts made by his father to assign him a kingdom, first Alamannia (829), then the country between the Meuse and the Pyrenees (839), at the expense of his half-brothers Lothair and Louis led to a rising on the part of these two. The death of the emperor in 840 was the signal for the outbreak of war between his sons.</mm> </dd></dl>
