Preschel of Vienna, who in 1833 had a factory in operation for making phosphorus matches, <mark>fusees</mark>, and amadou slips tipped with igniting composition. At the same time also matches were being made by F. Moldenhauer in Darmstadt; and for a long series of years Austria and the South-German states were the principal centres of the new industry. &hellip; &ldquo;Vestas&rdquo; are matches in which short pieces of thin &ldquo;wax taper&rdquo; are used in place of wooden splints. <mark><i>Fusees</i></mark> or vesuvians consist of large oval heads fixed on a round splint. These heads consist of a porous mixture of charcoal, saltpetre, cascarilla or other scented bark, glass and gum, tipped with common igniting composition. When lighted they form a glowing mass, without flame. <small> &ldquo;MATCH&rdquo; <a name="EBMA" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#EBMA"><cite title="source">Encyclopaedia Britannica</cite></a>, 11th edit.
