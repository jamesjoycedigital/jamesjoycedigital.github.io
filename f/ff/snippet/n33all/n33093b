Sir William Leigh de Burgh <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> and Richard de Bermingham, the fourth baron of <mark>Athenry</mark>, were sent against him. Fedhlim met them with a numerous army, and the most sanguinary engagement recorded in our history since the invasion was fought near Athenry, in the County of Galway, in which the native troops were singularly defeated. Fedhlim, the last of his name who assumed sovereignty, fell in the field, and with him (as is stated) 8000 men. The walls of Athenry are said to have been built from the spoils of battle; and the power of the O&apos;Conors, which here received its final blow, was totally destroyed. <small> James Hardiman, <a name="JHHT2" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#JHHT2"><cite title="source">The History of the Town and County of the Town of Galway</cite></a> (1820, rpt. 1926) 57f.</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
