The first of these was said to have been the son of Gordius and Cybele, whose first priest he was, and in whose honour he founded a temple at Pessinus. Having taken the drunken Silenus back to his youthful charge Dionysus, he was rewarded by the god with the power of transforming everything he touched into gold. Finding himself in danger of starvation, even his food and drink being changed by his touch, Midas entreated Dionysus to take back the gift. By the command of the god he bathed in the river Pactolus, which henceforth became auriferous (Ovid, Metam. xi. 85-145; Hyginus, Fab. 191). Another story connects him with the musical contest between Apollo and Marsyas (or Pan). Having decided against the god, his ears were changed into those of an ass. He concealed them under a Phrygian cap; but the secret was discovered by his barber, who, being unable to keep it, dug a hole in the ground and whispered into it &ldquo;Midas has the ears of an ass.&rdquo; He then filled up the hole, thinking his secret safe; but the reeds which grew up over the spot proclaimed it to all the world. Joyce also alludes to the phrase <i>in medias res</i>, meaning: in the middle of things. See also: <a name="n33128g" href="n33all.htm#n33128g">N33 (VI.B.4):128(g)</a> </mm> </dd></dl>
