He was brought up in his father&apos;s camp on the Rhine among the soldiers, and received the name Caligula from the <i>caligae</i>, or foot-soldiers&apos; boots, which he used to wear. He also accompanied his father to Syria, and after his death returned to Rome. In 32 he was summoned by Tiberius to Capreae, and by skilful flattery managed to escape the fate of his relatives. After the murder of Tiberius by Naevius Sertorius Macro, the prefect of the praetorian guards, which was probably due to his instigation, Caligula ascended the throne amidst the rejoicings of the people.
