(1165-1223), known as Philip Augustus, king of France, son of Louis VII. and Adela, daughter of Theobald II., count of Champagne, was born on the 21st of August 1165. On the 1st of November 1179 he was associated with his father as king by being crowned at Reims, and at once his father&apos;s illness threw the responsibility of government on him, the death of Louis on the 19th of September 1180 leaving him sole king. Philip was the first of the great Capetien kings of medieval France. He was a major figure in the 3rd crusade to the Holy Land in 1119. </mm> </dd></dl>
