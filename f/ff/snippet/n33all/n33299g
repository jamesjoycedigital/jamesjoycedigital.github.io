The Ant milks her cow, the <mark>Aphis</mark>, at every available moment. It does not kill the &ldquo;cow,&rdquo; as is the case with the Lace-Wing larva. It endeavours to keep the Aphides at one spot, on one twig or leaf, and, like a human milkmaid, passes from one to the other, drawing an infinitesimal quantity of sweet juice from each. <small> J.H.
