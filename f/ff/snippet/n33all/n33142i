But the soldier who had taken it refused to give it up, and broke it into fragments with his battle-axe. Some time afterwards, when Clovis was reviewing his troops, he singled out this soldier, upbraided him for the neglect of his arms and dashed his battle-axe to the ground. As the man stooped to pick it up, the king clove his skull with the words: &ldquo;Thus didst thou serve the vase of Soissons.&rdquo;</mm> </dd></dl>
