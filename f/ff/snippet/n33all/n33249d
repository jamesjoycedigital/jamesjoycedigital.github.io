The orchestra of fleas, all securely fixed with cement, is placed above a little musical-box. The music proceeds from the box, but the <mark>vibrations make the fleas gesticulate</mark> violently over their musical instrument. The dancers spin round on the ballroom floor. The couples are fastened by a rigid <mark>bar</mark> <font color="green">[73]</font> opposite each other, so that they cannot touch or part. Each is pointed in an opposite direction, and <mark>tries to run away</mark>. A rotary motion ensues which, to the spectators if not to the fleas, is very like waltzing. <small> Harold Russell, <a name="HRTF" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#HRTF"><cite title="source">The Flea</cite></a> (1913) 73f</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
