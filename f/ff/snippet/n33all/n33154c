It appears to have been made almost simultaneously in several distinct centres. The name most prominently connected with the early stages of the invention is that of J. Preschel of Vienna, who in 1833 had a factory in operation for making phosphorus matches, fusees, and amadou slips tipped with igniting composition. At the same time also matches were being made by F. Moldenhauer in Darmstadt; and for a long series of years Austria and the South-German states were the principal centres of the new industry. But the use of ordinary white or yellow <mark>phosphorus</mark> as a principal ingredient in the igniting mixture of matches was found to be accompanied with very serious disadvantages. It is a deadly poison, and its free dissemination has led to many accidental deaths, and to numerous cases of wilful murder and suicide. <small> &ldquo;MATCH&rdquo; <a name="EBMA" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#EBMA"><cite title="source">Encyclopaedia Britannica</cite></a>, 11th edit.
