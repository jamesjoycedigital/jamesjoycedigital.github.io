Gradually most of the <i>chansons de geste</i> were attached to the name of Charlemagne, whose poetical history falls into three cycles:&mdash;the <i>geste du roi</i>, relating his wars and the personal history of himself and his family; the southern cycle, of which Guillaume de Toulouse is the central figure; and the feudal epic, dealing with the revolts of the barons against the emperor, the rebels being invariably connected by the trouveres with the family of Doon de Mayence. </mm> </dd></dl>
