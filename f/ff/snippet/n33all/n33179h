To avoid this a short Chapter (V.) was drawn up, the recital of which was believed to free the deceased from doing any work in the underworld. But it was felt that the work must be done by some person or thing, and eventually it became the custom to <mark>bury</mark> a figure or figures of the deceased with him in his tomb so that it or they might perform whatever work fell to his share. To these figures the Egyptian gave the name <i>ushabtiu</i>, a word which is commonly rendered by &ldquo;respondents&rdquo; or &ldquo;answerers,&rdquo; and they are often described in modern times as the &ldquo;<mark>working figures of Hades</mark>.&rdquo; <small> E.A.
