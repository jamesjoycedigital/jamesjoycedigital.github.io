The tiara, the pontifical head-dress, is not used strictly speaking in the course of the liturgical functions, but only for processions. To these vestments or insignia the pope adds: the falda, a kind of long skirt trailing on the ground all round, which the chaplains hold up while he is walking. Over the chasuble he wears the fanone; and after that the <mark>pallium</mark>. He is preceded by the papal cross, carried with the crucifix turned towards him. When going to solemn ceremonies he is carried on the sedia, a portable chair of red velvet with a high back, and escorted by two flabelli of peacock feathers.</mm> </dd></dl>
