In this battle Sigebert, the king of the Ripuarians, was wounded in the knee and limped during the remainder of his life&mdash;hence his surname Claudus (the Lame). The Ripuarians long remained allies of Clovis, Sigebert&apos;s son Chloderic fighting under the king of the Salian Franks at Vouille in 507. Clovis, however, persuaded Chloderic to assassinate his father, and then posed as Sigebert&apos;s avenger, with the result that Chloderic was himself assassinated and the Ripuarians raised Clovis on the shield and chose him as king. Thus the Salian Franks united under their rule all the Franks on the left bank of the Rhine. During the reigns of Clovis&apos;s sons they again turned their eyes on Germany, and imposed their suzerainty upon the Franks on the right bank. This country, north of the Main and the first residence of the Franks, then received the name of Francia Orientalis, and became the origin of one of the duchies into which Germany was divided in the Toth century&mdash;the duchy of Franconia (Franken). </mm> </dd></dl>
