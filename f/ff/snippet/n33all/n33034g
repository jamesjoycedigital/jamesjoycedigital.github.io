The founder and headmaster was an Ulster Scot, very pro-British, named Francis Irwin &hellip;. Joyce devotes the second chapter of <cite>Ulysses</cite> to describing Stephen&apos;s activities at a school clearly modeled on Irwin&apos;s. As usual, his account is tenacious of remembered facts. The students whom Stephen teaches are based in part at least on actual ones: Armstrong, for example, is described as living on Vico-Road <font color="green">[in Dalkey]</font>, &hellip;. Irwin is presented under the name of Deasy &hellip;.&rdquo;  <br>Raphael transcription: <a name="c15016a" href="c15all.htm#c15016a">VI.C.15:016(a)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
