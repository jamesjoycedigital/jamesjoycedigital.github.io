Its advantage lay in that it drew him towards the Mystics (who also turned aside from the <mark>Scholastics</mark>), causing him to seek a more intense degree of religious fervour in the hope of achieving Communion with the Divine than did the Scholastics, working in the Scientific Light kindled for them by Aristotle. But the drawback is to be found in the dualism arising from the hard-and-fast division of Belief and Science in the intellectual life of modern times, upon which Kant laid his finger with so much acumen, and upon which he expended so vast an amount of dialectics that it has in the present day came to be accepted as the most natural and reasonable thing in the world. <small> Ernst Boldt, <a name="BFLS" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#BFLS"><cite title="source">From Luther to Steiner</cite></a>, (1921) 44</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
