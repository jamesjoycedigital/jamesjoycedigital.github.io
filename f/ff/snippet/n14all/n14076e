He had come to Ireland with a great and royal fleet and &lsquo;assumed the sovereignty over the foreigners in Erin.&rsquo; He had fleets on Lough Neagh, and on Lough Ree, and raided the country as far south as the Meath district. Turges was not the only invader at this time: indeed so numerous were the invading hosts that the chronicles tell us &lsquo;after this there came great sea-cast floods of foreigners into Erin, so that there was not a point thereof without a fleet.&rsquo; The power of Turges culminated in 841, when he drove the abbot of Armagh into exile, usurped the abbacy, and exercised the sovereignty of North Ireland. At the same time his wife <mark>Ota</mark> (O.N. Au&eth;r) profaned the monastery of Clonmacnoise and gave audience, probably as a <i>v&ouml;lva</i> or prophetess, upon the high altar <small> Allen Mawer, <a name="AMTV1" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#AMTV1"><cite title="source">The Vikings</cite></a>, (1913) 13</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
