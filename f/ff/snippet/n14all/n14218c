After a lapse of years Hoskulld was surprised by overhearing the supposed dumb mother speaking to her son. The discovery led her to confess that, from a sense of degradation she had remained mute, that her name was Melkorka, and that her father was Miarkartan, King of Ireland, from whence she had been carried captive when fifteen years of age. <small> Charles Haliday, <a name="SKD1" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#SKD1"><cite title="source">The Scandinavian Kingdom of Dublin</cite></a>, 2nd ed.
