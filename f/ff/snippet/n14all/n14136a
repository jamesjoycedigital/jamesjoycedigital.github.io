The most famous of these were the sons of Ragnarr Lo&eth;br&oacute;k. Berno, who first appeared on the Seine in 855, was <mark>Bj&ouml;rn Ironside</mark>, while it is quite possible that the Sidroc who accompanied him was Sigurd Snake-eye, another son of that famous leader. With Bj&ouml;rn, at least according to Norman tradition, came Hastingus (O.N. H&aacute;steinn), his foster-father. <small> Allen Mawer, <a name="AMTV1" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#AMTV1"><cite title="source">The Vikings</cite></a>, (1913) 44</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
