Greek history also places the giants near the time of the Flood and, through the giant Prometheus, it tells us of <mark>Deucalion</mark>, the grandson of Iapetus and father of <mark>Hellen</mark>, the founder of the Greek race,<sup>77</sup> who gave his name to the &lsquo;Hellenes&rsquo;. This must have been the Greek race, descended from Japhet, that went on to populate Europe, just as <font color="green">[that of]</font> Ham populated Phoenicia and Egypt, and then Africa. But be-cause of the ruined nature of the traditions that had been handed down to Homer, Chaos was taken to be the confusion of the seeds of nature, the Ogygian<sup>78</sup> and Deucalionian<sup>79</sup> Floods were thought to be individual floods, whereas they could <font color="green">[72]</font> only have been mutilated traditions of the Universal Flood,<sup>80</sup> and the giants to have had bodies and strength that were believed to have been impossible in nature. Hence the origins of profane history and its continuity with sacred history have lain unknown until now. <br>72n77: Pausanias, <cite>Itinerary of Greece</cite>, X, 38, 1. <br>72n78: A flood of the valley of Boeotia, named after Ogyges, traditionally the first ruler of Thebes. <br>72n79: The mythical nine-day flood that destroyed all the inhabitants of Hellas, with the ex-ception of Prometheus&apos; son, Deucalion, after whom it was named, and his wife. <br>73n80: This is part of the argument whereby Vico wished to establish the continuity of gentile and Hebrew history through Greek history. <small> Giambattista Vico, <a name="VICO1" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#VICO1"><cite title="source">Principj di una Scienza Nuova</cite></a> (1836) 88</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: See also <a name="n18091g" href="n18all.htm#n18091g">N18 (VI.B.8):091(g)</a> and <a name="n35166e" href="n35all.htm#n35166e">N35 (VI.B.24):166(e)</a>. Deucalion, the son of Prometheus, king of Thessaly, and husband of <i>Pyrrha</i>, daughter to Epimetheus. In his reign came the deluge or universal flood, and he and his wife got into a small ship, which was carried to mount Parnassus and there stayed, and there the dry masses first appeared after the waters abated. He consulted with the oracle of Themis how mankind might be repaired, and was answered: if he cast his grandmother&apos;s bones behind his back; whereupon he and his wife cast bones over their shoulders, and they became men and women.</mm> </dd></dl>
