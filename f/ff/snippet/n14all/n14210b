These have drawn us again and again into their charmed circle. And that even although during the long summer days, when we frequent the isles, the winds sometimes blow for weeks together, and the sea shows itself in dangerous moods. The <mark>fisher-crofters</mark>, who get their living from the sea? &mdash; their <mark>treasury of Mary</mark> &mdash; and, in so doing, have a &ldquo;life-long struggle with something greater than themselves&rdquo;, are yet fully alive alike to its seduction and to its cruelty. <small> Marjory Kennedy-Fraser and Kenneth Macleod, <a name="MKSH" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#MKSH"><cite title="source">Songs of the Hebrides</cite></a> (1917) ix</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
