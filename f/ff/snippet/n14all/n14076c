Such differences of opinion are unfortunately only too often possible owing to the scantiness of the material upon which we have to base our conclusions. Medieval chroniclers were for the most part unable or unwilling to distinguish between Danes and Norwegians; they were all alike &lsquo;Nordmanni&rsquo; to them and the term &lsquo;<mark>Dani</mark>&rsquo; is practically interchangeable with it. The vagueness of their ethnographical knowledge is manifest when we find the Norman Dudo at the beginning of the 11th century tracing back the Dani (or Daci) to an original home in Dacia. <small> Allen Mawer, <a name="AMTV1" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#AMTV1"><cite title="source">The Vikings</cite></a>, (1913) 9-10</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c05239e" href="c05all.htm#c05239e">VI.C.05:239(e)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
