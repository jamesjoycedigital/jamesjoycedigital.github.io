As, however, there is no such thing as absolute right judgment, the validity of all truth being relative and dependent upon the standpoint of the person expressing it, so, too, the judgment of any person with regard to what he may, in any given case, consider to be the right thing to do is obviously bound to be in accordance with <i>his</i> relations to the world. (As, however, the personality of an Initiate stands in an entirely distinctive relationship to the world, it will readily be seen that the judgments of an Initiate will be very different from those of ordinary men.) <mark>Two different people will approach the same set of circumstances from entirely opposite points of view</mark> due to their characters, experience, and education. <small> Ernst Boldt, <a name="BFLS" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#BFLS"><cite title="source">From Luther to Steiner</cite></a>, (1921) 102</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
