Norse tradition, as given by Snorri Sturluson, makes <mark>Rollo to be one Hr&oacute;lfr</mark>, son of R&ouml;gnvaldr earl of M&ouml;re, who was exiled by Harold Fairhair and led a Viking life in the west. Norman tradition, as found in Dudo, made him out the son of a great noble in Denmark, who was expelled by the king, and later went to England, Frisia and Northern France. Dudo&apos;s account of the founding of Normandy is so full of errors clearly proven that little reliance can be placed on his story of the origin of Rollo. The <i>Heimskringla</i> tradition was recorded much later, but is probably more trustworthy, and it would be no strange thing to find a man of Norse birth leading a Danish host. <small> Allen Mawer, <a name="AMTV1" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#AMTV1"><cite title="source">The Vikings</cite></a>, (1913) 52-3</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
