These dangers are known in the language of Spiritual Science as the &ldquo;Ahrimanic and Luciferan dangers,&rdquo;<sup>1</sup> and can be combated only by the active, regenerating power of the Christ Force within our own souls. <br>xvn1: &ldquo;<mark>Ahriman</mark>,&rdquo; according to the Persian Mysteries, is the Spirit of Darkness, or of &ldquo;World-Evil,&rdquo; being identical with <mark>Satan</mark>, or <mark>Mephistopheles (that which does not love the Light)</mark>. He is the contrary to &ldquo;<mark>ORMUZD</mark>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<mark>AHURA MAZDA</mark>,&rdquo; the <font color="green">[sic]</font> Cosmic Spirit of the Sun. &ldquo;LUCIFER&rdquo; is known in the Rosicrucian Mysteries as the &ldquo;Light-Bearer,&rdquo; being identical God of Light, who&mdash;together with CHRIST&mdash;is identical with with <font color="green">[sic]</font> Prometheus, as also with the Serpent of Paradise. He is the Inspirer of human freedom and of knowledge, giving Personality, with both its good and bad aspects. LUCIFER has also another side when he acts as the Tempter to the human soul where matters appertaining to Mysticism, Egoism, and the senses are concerned. <small> Ernst Boldt, <a name="BFLS" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#BFLS"><cite title="source">From Luther to Steiner</cite></a>, (1921) xv</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: Continued on <a name="n14023a" href="n14all.htm#n14023a">N14 (VI.B.7):023(a)</a></mm> </dd></dl>
