The &ldquo;Faust&rdquo; book appeared in 1587, and a contemporary of Melanchton, alluding to this remarkable man (Faust), says that he had for a time &ldquo;laid the Holy Scriptures beneath a bench behind the door,&rdquo; turning from Theology to Medicine. This <font color="green">[45]</font> Faust represents the very type of the human soul, which, as the outcome of the Reformation, found itself enmeshed in the struggles inseparable to the dawn of a New Era. This Faust did indeed typify the German&mdash;seeking and yearning for universal cognition, for a more elevated sense of existence, and for the attainment of his independence as a thinking individual. Indeed, it is symptomatic that it should have been Goethe of all men who seized on this old legendary theme from which to fashion a garment for his masterwork. But, while the folk-tale of the Middle Ages consigned his hero&mdash;bent on storming heaven&mdash;to the devil, Goethe&apos;s &ldquo;Faust&rdquo; does ultimately attain salvation: a termination which points to a significant advance. So that, whereas Kant took the <i>negative</i> spirit of the Reformation as the basis of his principal work, Goethe grounded his masterpiece in the <i>positive</i> spirit of the same historical event. The &ldquo;Criticism of Pure Reason&rdquo; is the very reverse of the positive and practical cognition which is displayed in &ldquo;Faust,&rdquo; and we are, indeed forced to recognize that Kant and Goethe are in the most real sense at absolutely opposite poles. <small> Ernst Boldt, <a name="BFLS" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#BFLS"><cite title="source">From Luther to Steiner</cite></a>, (1921) 45-46</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
