Their chieftains are called &ldquo;Tomar&apos;s chieftains,&rdquo; their subjects &ldquo;the people of Tomar&rdquo;; the king of Dublin himself being called &ldquo;Prince Tomar,&rdquo; the badge of his authority &ldquo;<mark>the ring of Tomar</mark>,&rdquo; and a wood near Dublin, &ldquo;Tomar&apos;s wood,&rdquo; probably from having been devoted to the religious services of Thor. <small> Charles Haliday, <a name="SKD1" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#SKD1"><cite title="source">The Scandinavian Kingdom of Dublin</cite></a>, 2nd ed.
