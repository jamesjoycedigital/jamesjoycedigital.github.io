They do not correspond to any known ethnographical differences, and the only other reasonable suggestion which has been offered is that the terms are used to describe some difference of armour or equipment as yet unknown to us. The Irish annals also distinguish between Daunites or Danes and <mark>Lochlanns</mark> or men from Lochlann, i.e. Norway; but again the origin of the term Lochlann as applied to Norway is obscure. The writers of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle seem to use the term <i>Nor&eth;menn</i> very definitely of Norwegians, just as Alfred does in his translation of Orosius, but the term <i>Dene</i> came to be used more vaguely and uncertainly. <small> Allen Mawer, <a name="AMTV1" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#AMTV1"><cite title="source">The Vikings</cite></a>, (1913) 9-10</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c05239d" href="c05all.htm#c05239d">VI.C.05:239(d)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
