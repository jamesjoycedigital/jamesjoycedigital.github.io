Is not this, then, the final effort of desperation?&mdash;a drowning man&apos;s clutching at a straw?&mdash;and does it not imply, at one and the same time, the Christian Longing for <mark>the Beyond</mark>? Heroes do not seek to pass to the Beyond, but would rather compel it <i>hither</i>; and does not the whole world cry out&mdash;doing so more or less consciously&mdash;that everything depends on &lsquo;<i>this side</i>,&rsquo; and that &lsquo;heaven&rsquo; should be brought to <i>earth</i> and experienced even <i><mark>here</mark></i>?&rdquo; <small> Ernst Boldt, <a name="BFLS" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#BFLS"><cite title="source">From Luther to Steiner</cite></a>, (1921) 56</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
