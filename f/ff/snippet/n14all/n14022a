And this being so, Steiner himself has now become the target for both slander and abuse. It would seem, indeed, as if his opponents were <i>determined</i> not to understand him; they go even further, for, since his work by no means suits their reactionary ideas, they put every difficulty in the way of others who may be interested in it. Slander is, of course, an old and well-tried weapon resorted to in all ages. Was it not said of <mark>One yet Greater</mark>: &ldquo;He has blasphemed God&mdash;what need we of further testimony?&rdquo; And how many a brave fighter of the Middle Ages has not paid the price of his &ldquo;heresy&rdquo; with his life? If, then, to-day a Great One bears within him the Living Power of the Christ, and seeks to revivify our present civilization and our immediate future&hellip; what easier than to dub him | a traitor to the German Spirit, a Hungarian Jew, an Indian Juggler, a Rabbi dabbling in Occultism, a Romish Jesuit, a Russian Bolshevist, a <i>Bourgeois</i> Capitalist? <small> Ernst Boldt, <a name="BFLS" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#BFLS"><cite title="source">From Luther to Steiner</cite></a>, (1921) v-vi</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
