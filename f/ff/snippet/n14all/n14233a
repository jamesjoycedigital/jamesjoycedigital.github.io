For instance, we know that the Scandinavians sometimes sacrificed their prisoners to Thor or Odin, by &ldquo;crushing the spine&rdquo; (or &ldquo;breaking the back on a stone&rdquo;), or by plunging the victim head foremost in water, and auguring from the sacrifice future victory or defeat. Such sacrifices may be alluded to in statements &hellip; that, &ldquo;Conor Mac Dearmada, half-King of Meath, was <mark>stifled in water</mark> at Cluain Iraird, by Aulaf, King of the foreigners&rdquo; of Dublin. <small> Charles Haliday, <a name="SKD1" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#SKD1"><cite title="source">The Scandinavian Kingdom of Dublin</cite></a>, 2nd ed.
