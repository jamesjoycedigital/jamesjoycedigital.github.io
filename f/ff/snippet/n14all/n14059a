I felt I was free to believe or not believe this old Teacher, for his teaching laid no external obligation upon me, yet, nevertheless, took so powerful a hold on me that it seemed to me that I now for the first time understood the meaning of Revelation. <small> Ernst Boldt, <a name="BFLS" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#BFLS"><cite title="source">From Luther to Steiner</cite></a>, (1921) 16</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
