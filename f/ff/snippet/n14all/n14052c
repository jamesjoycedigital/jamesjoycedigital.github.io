Eckhart&apos;s teaching and example lived on and worked through his pupils, among whom we need only mention the most renowned, namely, the Dominican, Johannes Tauler (1130-1361). He, too, courted danger by his freedom of speech and his undaunted demeanour, and, indeed, the papal ban launched against him appears to be more excusable in his case; for Tauler had gone a step further, and had, so to speak, initiated the pious layman into those methods by which he might &ldquo;find Christ&rdquo;&mdash;whether Jew, Gentile, or heathen&mdash;and thus attain salvation without the <mark>mediation</mark> of either priest or Church. It was therefore but human if action which threatened to render the priesthood and its offices superfluous was viewed with some trepidation in Rome! <small> Ernst Boldt, <a name="BFLS" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#BFLS"><cite title="source">From Luther to Steiner</cite></a>, (1921) 9-10</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
