These were mostly <mark><i>waulking</i> songs</mark>, sung at the shrinking of the home-spun web. As this process of <mark>fulling</mark> the cloth was long and heavy, the songs used for it were correspondingly stimulating. And many ancient airs are still preserved in Benbecula just because the work of weaving still goes busily forward there. A much larger crofter community than that of Eriskay &dash; there were some 1,300 folk in the Isle of Benbecula &dash; hardly a day passes that is not marked by a waulking. And where there are many waulkings there will survive the greater number of varied and complex labour-song refrains. For at these gatherings the singing is the attraction, and the tedious work of tossing, dumping and circulating the moisture laden cloth is completely forgotten in the intoxicating swing of the body to the rhythmic refrain. <small> Marjory Kennedy-Fraser and Kenneth Macleod, <a name="MKSH" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#MKSH"><cite title="source">Songs of the Hebrides</cite></a> (1917) xii</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
