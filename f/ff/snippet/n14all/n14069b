He was ready, in principle, to meet actual and natural life halfway, doing this, moreover, with so complete a <i>naivet&eacute;</i> that there was no hint of a bad conscience&mdash;far less of sin&mdash;about it. As we know, he removed <mark>the ban which Gregory VII (1074) had placed upon the marriage</mark> of the priesthood, and married Katherine de Bora in order to carry his own convictions into practice.</p> <small> Ernst Boldt, <a name="BFLS" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#BFLS"><cite title="source">From Luther to Steiner</cite></a>, (1921) 54</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: A synod in Rome, on March, 1074, held by Pope Gregory VII deposed the priests who had bought their dignity or benefices, prohibited all future sacerdotal marriage, required married priests to dismiss their wives or cease to read mass, and commanded the laity not to attend their services. (The same decrees had been passed under Nicolas II. and Alexander II., but were not enforced. ) The forbidding of the laity to attend mass said by a married priest, was a most dangerous, despotic measure, which had no precedent in antiquity.</mm> </dd></dl>
