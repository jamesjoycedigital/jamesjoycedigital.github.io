In these he seems to breathe a free and invigorating air, free from the miasma of Roman Catholicism, which had so long hung like a pall about the souls of his fellow-countrymen.</p> <small> Ernst Boldt, <a name="BFLS" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#BFLS"><cite title="source">From Luther to Steiner</cite></a>, (1921) 15</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
