So, too, with religious orthodoxy, even where this is presented in its most liberal and enlightened form; where piety and religious fervour are <mark>plainly evinced</mark>, with a genuine striving after &ldquo;experience of God,&rdquo; or a &ldquo;communion with God&rdquo;: even there is the taint of the Luciferan spirit. In considering this question we have to bear in mind how great a portion of our <mark>German lands</mark> is still subject to Catholicism and <mark>Jesuitry</mark>. <i>Catholic</i> Germany, of which the politically active representative is the Centre Party, is one of the greatest dangers to <i>Spiritual</i> Germany, whose mission consists in bringing to active fulfilment the Living Impulse of Christ&mdash;and through Germany to all the rest of Europe. <small> Ernst Boldt, <a name="BFLS" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#BFLS"><cite title="source">From Luther to Steiner</cite></a>, (1921) xvii</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
