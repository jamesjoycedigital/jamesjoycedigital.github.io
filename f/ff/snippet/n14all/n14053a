The reply is that, had not the papacy in so sinister a manner made this fusion a point of contention, it is hardly likely that a <i>political</i> <mark>protest</mark> would have been made by a German theologian. For several centuries the political system of Rome had rendered abortive any religious advance such as Germany desired. The German Mystics and Folk-Theologians, who had so bravely made the attempt, had on every occasion been put down with a high hand. There remained, therefore, but one way of breaking Rome&apos;s political system, and that was by setting up another in opposition, and it was this that Luther made it his first business to do. We must therefore, in the first place, regard him in his capacity of political hero, for his initial act was to free the German people from the slavery of Rome. He brought about the emancipation of the German crown, hitherto dependant on the &ldquo;Papal Crook,&rdquo; and separated politics from religion. <small> Ernst Boldt, <a name="BFLS" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#BFLS"><cite title="source">From Luther to Steiner</cite></a>, (1921) 11-12</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
