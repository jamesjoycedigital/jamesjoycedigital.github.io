This division of the country placing the district once settled by Danes and Norsemen under an English king while the heart of England itself was in the possession of a Scandinavian king shows how completely the settlers in those districts had come to identify themselves with English interests as a whole. <small> Allen Mawer, <a name="AMTV1" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#AMTV1"><cite title="source">The Vikings</cite></a>, (1913) 39-40</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
