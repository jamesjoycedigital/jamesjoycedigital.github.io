This suggestion is rendered more probable when we observe that those who are known to be the descendants and successors of Regnar Lodbrok are called, by the Irish &ldquo;the race of Tomar.&rdquo; The name is given to the pagan kings of Dublin who succeeded Ivar, the son of Regnar. Their chieftains are called &ldquo;Tomar&apos;s chieftains,&rdquo; their subjects &ldquo;the people of Tomar&rdquo;; the king of Dublin himself being called &ldquo;Prince Tomar,&rdquo; the badge of his authority &ldquo;the ring of Tomar,&rdquo; and a wood near Dublin, &ldquo;<mark>Tomar&apos;s wood</mark>,&rdquo; probably from having been devoted to the religious services of Thor. <small> Charles Haliday, <a name="SKD1" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#SKD1"><cite title="source">The Scandinavian Kingdom of Dublin</cite></a>, 2nd ed.
