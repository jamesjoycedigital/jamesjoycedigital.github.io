In spite, therefore, of their &ldquo;Card of Membership to the Anthroposophical Society&rdquo; such members remain practically at the same level&mdash;mentally and spiritually speaking&mdash;at which they were when first joining, save, possibly, for such crumbs of superficial knowledge they may have picked up from the teachings of spiritual science. Indeed, such members are (and will in all probability <mark>increasingly</mark> prove themselves to be) unsuited to co-operate in the great work of the present and the near future, for they are wanting in the most elementary qualifications needed. Persons of this kind have often <mark>not the faintest interest</mark> in philosophy: they may be deficient in scientific training, or again they may lack the ability to think &ldquo;logically.&rdquo; <small> Ernst Boldt, <a name="BFLS" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#BFLS"><cite title="source">From Luther to Steiner</cite></a>, (1921) 89-90</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
