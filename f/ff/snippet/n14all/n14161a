Durham the tributaries of the Wear vary between &lsquo;burn&rsquo; and &lsquo;beck,&rsquo; but by the time we reach the Tees these have all become becks. Beechburn Beck, a tributary of the Wear, shows how a Scandinavian term could be attached to an English name, when its own meaning was neglected or forgotten. Other Scandinavian names are common, but as in Northumberland they belong to the dialect generally and are seldom found in names of towns or villages. Viking settlers must have been few in numbers and widely scattered throughout these two counties. One great exception must be named among the towns; viz. <mark>Durham</mark> itself. The city was named <mark><i>D&uacute;n-holmr</i></mark>, the &lsquo;hill-island,&rsquo; by the Vikings, and its present name is only the Norman corruption of that form. <br>South of the Tees we find ourselves in a district whose place-names are to a very large extent Scandinavian, and Norse settlements are thickly and evenly distributed from the North Sea to the Pennine chain. <br>Passing from Northumbria to the Danelagh, Lincolnshire is perhaps more purely Scandinavian in its place-names than any other English county. In Derbyshire Viking influence is not so strong but the county was probably very thinly inhabited at least <font color="green">[128]</font> in the north and west and did not offer attractive settling ground. <mark>Derby</mark> itself was rechristened by the Northmen, its earlier name being &lsquo;<mark>Nor&eth;weor&eth;ig</mark>.&rsquo; <small> Allen Mawer, <a name="AMTV1" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#AMTV1"><cite title="source">The Vikings</cite></a>, (1913) 127-9</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
