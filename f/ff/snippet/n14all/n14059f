For what may prove goodly food for one people at one period of its age, may well act as a poison to another. Should, however, some great Reform be really needed by a people&mdash;then God is with them, and it will succeed. This was true of Christ and His first Followers; for the coming of the new Doctrine of Love was a need for the people. So, too, was it true in the case of Luther; for a clean sweep of the distortions with which priestcraft had overlaid that doctrine was no less requisite. Neither of these great forces was the friend of that which is stationary; indeed, both were alive to the fact that the old yeast must be got rid of, and that things could no longer proceed upon a basis of falsehood, injustice, and inadequacy.&rdquo; <small> Ernst Boldt, <a name="BFLS" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#BFLS"><cite title="source">From Luther to Steiner</cite></a>, (1921) 22</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
