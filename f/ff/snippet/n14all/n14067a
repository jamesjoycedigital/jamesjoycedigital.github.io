The term, &ldquo;Gnosis&rdquo; is now, by general consent, applied only to the Christian occult teachings of the first three centuries <year>A.D.</year>, in the form in which they were known to the well-known Church Father, Clement of Alexandria (who died about 220), and to his disciple, Origen (184-254). The exoteric Church of Rome, then aspiring to imperial power, did its utmost to crush this essentially spiritual movement in the earliest days of its inception, for it persecuted its representatives with the greatest severity, accusing them of heresy. <small> Ernst Boldt, <a name="BFLS" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#BFLS"><cite title="source">From Luther to Steiner</cite></a>, (1921) ?132</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c05236c" href="c05all.htm#c05236c">VI.C.05:236(c)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
