To Scandinavian influence we owe the pronouns <mark><i>they</i>, <i>them</i>, and <i>their</i></mark>, the adjective <mark><i>same</i> and <i>both</i></mark>, the <mark><i>fro</i></mark> in <i>to and fro</i> and possibly the auxiliary <mark><i>are</i></mark> and the preposition <i>till</i>. These last are found in the Northumbrian dialect of Old English but their widespread use is probably due to Scandinavian influence. <small> Allen Mawer, <a name="AMTV1" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#AMTV1"><cite title="source">The Vikings</cite></a>, (1913) 130</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
