Never did he tire in his campaign for the defence of Germanism against <mark>Guelphish</mark> deceit and treachery&mdash;the &ldquo;trickery of the Romish priests.&rdquo; So great was his spirit of independence that he only sided with the Hohenstaufens when they opposed the Pope; and he even expressed his deep sorrow at the manner in which the German tribes were torn asunder owing to the action in war of those who owed their power to the papacy, kindred German blood being thus driven to fight against a German emperor. <small> Ernst Boldt, <a name="BFLS" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#BFLS"><cite title="source">From Luther to Steiner</cite></a>, (1921) 4</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
