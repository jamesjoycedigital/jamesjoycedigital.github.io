Many of the settlers betook themselves to Iceland, the most famous of them being Au&eth;r the deep-thoughted, widow of Olaf the White and daughter of Ketill. <mark>Norse rule</mark> was all powerful during the 10th and 11th centuries. There was a line of kings but we find ruling side by side with them certain officers known as &lsquo;lawmen&rsquo; (<i>v. infra</i>, p.103), while in the late 10th century and for the greater part of the 11th century, the Hebrides were under the sovereignty of the Orkney-earls. <mark>Norse rule</mark> in the Hebrides did not finally come to an end until 1266 when Magnus H&aacute;konsson, king of Norway, renounced all claims to the islands. <small> Allen Mawer, <a name="AMTV1" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#AMTV1"><cite title="source">The Vikings</cite></a>, (1913) 68</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
