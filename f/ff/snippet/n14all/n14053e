The authority of the State is, therefore, dependent on the priesthood, even as human things depend on things divine, and worldly things on things spiritual.&rdquo; <small> Ernst Boldt, <a name="BFLS" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#BFLS"><cite title="source">From Luther to Steiner</cite></a>, (1921) 12-13</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
