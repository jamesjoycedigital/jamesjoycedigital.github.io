This last translation may sound pedantic but it is the most accurate description of the style, for we have no attempt to represent the full form of any animal that ever had actual existence; rather we find the various limbs of animals&mdash;heads, legs, tails&mdash;woven into one another in fantastic design in order to cover a certain surface-area which requires decoration. <small> Allen Mawer, <a name="AMTV1" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#AMTV1"><cite title="source">The Vikings</cite></a>, (1913) 106</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
