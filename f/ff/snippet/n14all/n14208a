In 872 the Ostmen of Dublin fought for Norwegian liberty at the fatal battle of Hafursfiord, where the Irish allies, or &ldquo;Westmen,&rdquo; distinguished by their &ldquo;white shields&rdquo; were probably led by Eyvind Austman, son-in-law of Cearbhall, King of Ossory, or by Cearbhall himself, as after their defeat Cearbhall was met in the Hebrides, and accompanied to Ireland by <mark>Onund, surnamed &ldquo;Trefotr,&rdquo;</mark> from his wooden substitute for the foot or leg he had lost in the engagement. <small> Charles Haliday, <a name="SKD1" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#SKD1"><cite title="source">The Scandinavian Kingdom of Dublin</cite></a>, 2nd ed.
