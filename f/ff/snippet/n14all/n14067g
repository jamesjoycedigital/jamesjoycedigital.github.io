All are acquainted with the declaration they made against slavery, but&mdash;while they sought to impress us with their humane maxims for the extermination of the iniquitous Slave-Trade&mdash;it now transpires that their true motive was a practical one, without which, as is well known, an Englishman never acts, <mark>as we ought to have known all along</mark>&rdquo; (1829). <small> Ernst Boldt, <a name="BFLS" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#BFLS"><cite title="source">From Luther to Steiner</cite></a>, (1921) ?26</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
