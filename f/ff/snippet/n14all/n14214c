Contrary to the philologists, Vico wants to establish that the census was intended to consolidate an aristocratic form of government. Livy offers an account of Servius&apos; census of the sort that Vico wants to deny was possible at this stage, i.e. that it was administered on the basis of wealth, compensated by political privilege and involved the abandonment of universal suffrage which, Livy says, had obtained since Romulus. <small> Giambattista Vico, <a name="VICO1" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#VICO1"><cite title="source">Principj di una Scienza Nuova</cite></a> (1836) 121</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
