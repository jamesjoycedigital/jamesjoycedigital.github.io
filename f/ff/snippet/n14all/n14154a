Mention has already been made more than once of the way in which the Northmen entered the service of the emperors at Constantinople or <mark>Miklagardr</mark>, &lsquo;the great city,&rsquo; as they call it. From here they visited all parts of the Mediterranean. <small> Allen Mawer, <a name="AMTV1" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#AMTV1"><cite title="source">The Vikings</cite></a>, (1913) 80-1</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
