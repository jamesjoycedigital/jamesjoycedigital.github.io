Nor did they lay much store by the activities of the Scholastics, who sought to emphasize the &ldquo;reasonableness&rdquo; of doctrinal teaching by an appeal to Aristotelian logic&mdash;in which, for instance, Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274) was so distinguished. <small> Ernst Boldt, <a name="BFLS" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#BFLS"><cite title="source">From Luther to Steiner</cite></a>, (1921) 8</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
