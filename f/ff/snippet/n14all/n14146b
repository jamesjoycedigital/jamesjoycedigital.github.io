He entered into an alliance with Thorstein the Red, son of Olaf the White, and together they conquered Caithness and Sutherland, as far south as the river Oikel on the borders of Ross and Cromarty. <mark>Sigurd&apos;s son Einar, known as Turf-Einar</mark> because he first taught the islanders to cut peat for fuel, founded a long line of <mark>earls of the Orkneys</mark>. He had a quarrel with Harold Fairhair and when that king imposed a fine on the islanders for the murder of his son and the farmers could not pay it, Einar paid it himself on condition that the peasants surrendered their <i>&oacute;&eth;</i> rights, i.e. their rights of possession in the lands they cultivated. Turf-Einar&apos;s son Sigurd the Stout was the most famous of all the Orkney-earls, renowned both as warrior and poet. He conquered Sutherland, Caithness, Ross, Murray, Argyle, the Hebrides and Man, securing the support of the men of Orkney by giving them back their <i>&oacute;&eth;al</i>. He married a daughter of Malcolm king of Scotland, and met his end, as we have already seen, fighting on the side of the heathen Norsemen in the battle of Clontarf in 1014. After this the power of the Orkney-earls declined. <small> Allen Mawer, <a name="AMTV1" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#AMTV1"><cite title="source">The Vikings</cite></a>, (1913) 66-7</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
