Yet still, in the music of our race, we find ourselves; in these racial musical survivals the very character and spirit of our <mark>forebears</mark> is distilled. &ldquo;C&apos;est le grand r&eacute;v&eacute;lateur des forces cr&eacute;atrices d&apos;une nation,&rdquo; says a French writer. And the perfervid feeling of the Scot, though it smoulder like the dull embers of the peat fire, needs but the breath of an old song to make it leap again into flame. And such surviving fragmentary human documents seem to tend to drift ever westwards before the advancing tide of cosmopolitanism; to the remote Western Isles, therefore, one must go to-day to find still unrecorded types of this racial self-expression. And gladly one goes to the West! <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> <small> Marjory Kennedy-Fraser and Kenneth Macleod, <a name="MKSH" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#MKSH"><cite title="source">Songs of the Hebrides</cite></a> (1917) ix</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
