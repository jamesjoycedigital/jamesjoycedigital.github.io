This boy, aged sixteen, living in Leipzig, suffered from the following defects: he was insensitive to touch, he had no sense of smell or taste, he had no muscular sense, no sense of pain, and, finally, he was deaf in the right ear and blind in the left eye. When his left ear was stopped up and his right eye bandaged, he fell asleep in two or three minutes. This negative sensory factor for sleep consists virtually in not engaging consciousness with sensory activity. <small> D. F.
