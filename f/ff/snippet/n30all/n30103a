Edward Quinn, a farmer, from Ballymacrossan, stated that about <mark>2 a.m., old time</mark>, on the 4th May, Glynn came and knocked at a window of his house and called him. The witness got out of bed and came downstairs &hellip; Did Glynn ask you for anything? &mdash; He asked for a pipe of tobacco. I gave it to him, and he made me a present of a pipe, which he took from his left coat-pocket. / What did he say to you? &mdash; He said that he had a lot of pipes; and he &ldquo;knackered&rdquo; three or four of them before he left the house. / What do you mean by &ldquo;knackered&rdquo; &mdash; is it pinched? &mdash; No, but took.
