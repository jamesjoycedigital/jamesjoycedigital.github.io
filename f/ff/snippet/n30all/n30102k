It is said that old soldiers never die, and certainly the keepers of the &ldquo;Zoo&rdquo; seem to fill the bill. I believe that <mark>Flood, the keeper of the lions</mark>, has been in the employment of the Council for forty-seven years, and <mark>Kenny, who has charge of the Elephants</mark>, has about thirty years&apos; service; while <mark>Supple, the head keeper</mark> in the monkey house, is the third generation of his family. <small> <a name="IT1jun28" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#IT1jun28"><cite title="source">Irish Times</cite></a> (1 June 1928) 5</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
