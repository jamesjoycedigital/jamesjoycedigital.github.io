Every mother knows that in the infant&apos;s head there is a membranous spot (the anterior fontanelle) which moves up and down with the same rhythm as the child&apos;s breathing. Obviously the more blood in the child&apos;s brain, the more will this membrane bulge up. Now it can be seen that this membrane is depressed during sleep and raised during wakefulness. When <mark>the child cries</mark>, and so prevents the veins from the head emptying their blood easily into the heart, the blood so dammed back <mark>causes the fontanelle to bulge</mark> upwards. <small> D.
