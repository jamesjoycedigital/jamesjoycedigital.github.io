They assign a certain hour to wake, and at that hour they regain consciousness. This faculty of unconsciously estimating time is an extremely convenient one. While no dogmatic explanation can be given, the suggestion has been made that this power is an expression of the working of the sub-conscious mind. The additional supposition has to be made that the subconscious mind can take cognizance of the lapse of time. When so little is positively known about it, we may take refuge in a simile and say that the psychic, subconscious alarm-clock is volitionally wound up to go off at a certain hour, and that <mark>the mechanism &ldquo;carries on&rdquo; until the alarm is duly released</mark>. <small> D.
