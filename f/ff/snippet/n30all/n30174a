(The anachronism of guns in the time of Alexander must be pardoned.) A blind man dreamed that a relative was dead by his being conscious of touching a cold corpse. Another dreamed of the &ldquo;Day of Judgment&rdquo; by being pulled up to Heaven by a rope and hearing trumpets sounding. <small> D. F.
