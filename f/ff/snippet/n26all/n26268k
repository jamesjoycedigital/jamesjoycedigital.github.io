Mancipation]</font>&mdash;Mancipation is described by Gaius, with particular reference to the conveyance of movable <i>res mancipi</i>, as a pretended sale in presence of not less than five citizens as witnesses and a <i>libripens</i> holding a pair of copper scales. The transferee, with one hand on the thing being transferred, and using certain <mark>words of style</mark>, declared it his by purchase with a piece of copper (which he held in his other hand) and the scales (<i>hoc aere aeneaque libra</i>); and simultaneously he struck the scales with the <i>as</i>, which he then handed to the transferrer as figurative of the price. The principal variation when it was an immovable that was being transferred was that the mancipation did not require to be on the spot: the land was simply described by its known name in the valuation roll. <small> &ldquo;ROMAN LAW&rdquo; <a name="EBRL2" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#EBRL2"><cite title="source">Encyclopaedia Britannica</cite></a>, 11th edit.
