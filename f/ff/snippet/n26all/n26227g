These <mark>long ships were also called &ldquo;Dragons,&rdquo; </mark> because the sterns were frequently ornamented with carved, and even gilded, images of dragons; or else were beheld there figures of vultures, lions, and other animals, ornamented with gold. These long ships had sometimes crews of several hundred men. Other, and partly smaller, ships had different names, such as <mark>&ldquo; snekken,&rdquo; &ldquo;barden,&rdquo; &ldquo;skeiden,&rdquo; &ldquo;karven,&rdquo; &ldquo;barken,&rdquo; </mark> and several others. <small> Jens Jacob Asmussen Worsaae, <a name="JJAW1" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#JJAW1"><cite title="source">An Account of the Danes and Norwegians</cite></a> (1852) 109-110</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
