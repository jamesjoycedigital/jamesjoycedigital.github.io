It was in these districts that the Anglo-Saxon kings had always found their truest and most numerous adherents, and they had therefore generally been the theatre of the more important battles between the Anglo-Saxons and the Danes. Near Waresham, in Dorsetshire, Alfred purchased peace with a host of the latter, who <mark>swore on their armlets</mark> to observe it; but, though this oath was regarded by the Danes as very sacred, they are said to have broken it immediately. <small> Jens Jacob Asmussen Worsaae, <a name="JJAW1" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#JJAW1"><cite title="source">An Account of the Danes and Norwegians</cite></a> (1852) 21</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
