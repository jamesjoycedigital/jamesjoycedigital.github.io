In the immediate neighbourhood is also the old Danish town Baldoyle, and the district of Finngall, colonized by the Norwegians. Directly north of Howth rises &ldquo;Ireland&apos;s eye&rdquo; (in Irish, &ldquo;Inis Eirinn&rdquo; and Inis Meic Ness- &aacute;in&rdquo; ); and still farther to the north the islands of &ldquo;Lambay&rdquo; (in Irish &ldquo;Rachrainn&rdquo; ) and &ldquo;<mark>Skerries</mark>,&rdquo; or the Skj&aelig;re (reefs). <small> Jens Jacob Asmussen Worsaae, <a name="JJAW1" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#JJAW1"><cite title="source">An Account of the Danes and Norwegians</cite></a> (1852) 324</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
