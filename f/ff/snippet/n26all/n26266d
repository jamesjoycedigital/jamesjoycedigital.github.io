It appears to have had a wider range that <i>jus</i>. It forbade that a war should be undertaken without the prescribed <mark>fetial</mark> ceremony, and required that faith should be kept even with an enemy when a promise had been made to him under sanction of an oath. <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> It punished murder &hellip;; the sale of a wife by her husband &hellip;; the lifting of a hand against a parent &hellip;; incestuous connections, for they defiled the altar; the false oath and the broken vow, for they were an insult to the divinities invoked; the displacement of a boundary or a landmark, not so much because the act was provocative of feud, as because the <mark>march-stone</mark> itself, as the guarantee of peaceful neighbourhood, was under the guardianship of the gods. Some breaches of <i>fas</i> were expiable <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> others were inexpiable. When an offence was inexpiable, the punishment was usually what is called <i>sacratio capitis</i>, <mark>excommunication</mark> and outlawry of the offender. <small> &ldquo;ROMAN LAW&rdquo; <a name="EBRL2" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#EBRL2"><cite title="source">Encyclopaedia Britannica</cite></a>, 11th edit.
