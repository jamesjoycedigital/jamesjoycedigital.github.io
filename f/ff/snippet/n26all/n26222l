The Scotch and Irish distinguish clearly between &ldquo;Dub-gall&rdquo; or the black stranger (whence the present name Dugal), and &ldquo;Finngall,&rdquo; or the fair stranger. <small> Jens Jacob Asmussen Worsaae, <a name="JJAW1" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#JJAW1"><cite title="source">An Account of the Danes and Norwegians</cite></a> (1852) 46</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
