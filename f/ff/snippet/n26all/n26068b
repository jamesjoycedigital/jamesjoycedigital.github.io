He describes a book, or scroll, in God&apos;s right hand that is sealed with seven seals. The Lamb of God (Jesus Christ, the Lion of Judah) opens the first four of the seals, which summons forth four beings that ride out on white, red, black and pale horses. These riders are generally understood to represent Conquest, War, Famine, and Death, respectively. </mm> </dd></dl>
