On the flat shores in the middle of the eastern coast of Ireland, between Dublin and Drogheda, which are called Finngall, or &lsquo;the strangers&rsquo; land&rsquo; (from &lsquo;finne,&rsquo; a land, and &ldquo;gall,&rdquo; a stranger), and which in ancient times were colonized chiefly by Norwegians, is a small town called <mark>Baldoyle</mark>. <small> Jens Jacob Asmussen Worsaae, <a name="JJAW1" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#JJAW1"><cite title="source">An Account of the Danes and Norwegians</cite></a> (1852) 313</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
