And there she saw it, and her pale sad face lit up with such a wondrous joy that she had some ado to conceal her emotion from the king and those around her who were ever keeping her watched. Deftly, though, she slipped <mark>the ring out of her mouth</mark>, and deftly she presently managed to slip it into her bosom, marvelling much the while whence and how it came, and why. <small> Mabel Quiller-Couch, <a name="TRIS" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#TRIS"><cite title="source">Cornwall's Wonderland</cite></a> (1914) 238</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
