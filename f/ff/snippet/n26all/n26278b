Then was the young wife filled with shame that ever she had showed her love for him, and jealousy raged in her, turning her love to bitter hate, and her heart hardened so that night and day she longed to be revenged. <p>Thus a whole year passed away, and Tristram and Queen Iseult loved each other as dearly as ever; but King Mark in his jealous anger kept them so watched that they could never see or speak one to the other, and they had no peace or <font color="green">[228]</font> joy in life, until at last they could bear the pain no longer, and one day they managed to escape together and to reach the Castle of Joyous Gard, where the king had no power to reach them, even had he know where they were hid. Of their love and happiness there no tongue can tell, and of the peace and joy of their life, for they loved each other above all else, and when they were together nothing had power to pain them.</p> <small> Mabel Quiller-Couch, <a name="TRIS" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#TRIS"><cite title="source">Cornwall's Wonderland</cite></a> (1914) 228-9</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
