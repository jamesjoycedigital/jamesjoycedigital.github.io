Mancipation]</font>&mdash;Mancipation is described by Gaius, with particular reference to the conveyance of movable <i>res mancipi</i>, as a pretended sale in presence of not less than five citizens as witnesses and a <i>libripens</i> holding a pair of copper scales. The transferee, with one hand on the thing being transferred, and using certain words of style, declared it his by purchase with a piece of copper (which he held in his other hand) and the scales (<i>hoc aere aeneaque libra</i>); and simultaneously he struck the scales with the <i>as</i>, which he then handed to the transferrer as figurative of the price. The principal variation when it was an <mark>immovable</mark> that was being transferred was that the mancipation did not require to be on the spot: the land was simply described by its known name in the valuation roll. <small> &ldquo;ROMAN LAW&rdquo; <a name="EBRL2" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#EBRL2"><cite title="source">Encyclopaedia Britannica</cite></a>, 11th edit.
