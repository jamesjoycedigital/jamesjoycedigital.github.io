As it was the head and capital of their colonies in Leinster, from when they issued out upon all occasions against their enemies, it is no way improbable but they rendered it fit for defence and security soon after they first possessed it; which seems to have been about the year 838, when we are told &ldquo;that a fleet of sixty sail of those foreigners entered the river Liffey, and another of the same number possessed themselves of the mouth of the river Boyne, at Drogheda.&rdquo; Ware indeed, from the authority of some Irish histories, takes it for granted, &ldquo;that the Danes possessed themselves of the city of Dublin, and of the neighbouring territory called Fingal, before the year 851.&rdquo; <small> J.
