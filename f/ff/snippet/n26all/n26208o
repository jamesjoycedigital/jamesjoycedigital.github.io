He lacked the military and administrative abilities of his father, and the success of his reign was not commensurate with the ability of the ruler. He was never crowned at Babylon, which was in a perpetual state of revolt until, in 691 <year>B.C.</year>, he shocked the religious and political conscience of Asia by razing the holy city pf Babylon to the ground. His campaign against Hezekiah of Judah was an equal failure, and in his murder by his sons on the 20th of Tebet 681 <year>B.C.</year> both Babylonians and Jews saw the judgement of heaven.</mm> </dd></dl>
