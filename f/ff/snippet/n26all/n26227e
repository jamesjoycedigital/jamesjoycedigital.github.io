That according to the laws of his country <mark>an Anglo-Saxon merchant obtained the rank and title of Thane, or Chief, when he had thrice crossed the sea in is own ship</mark>, sufficiently attests how desirous the Anglo-Saxon kings were to awaken among their subjects, by means of large rewards, a desire for such voyages. <small> Jens Jacob Asmussen Worsaae, <a name="JJAW1" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#JJAW1"><cite title="source">An Account of the Danes and Norwegians</cite></a> (1852) 101</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
