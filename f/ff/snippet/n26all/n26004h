This bipartite division was made about the year 191; but it did not subsist longer than a year, when it was overturned by the ambition of Mogha-Nuagad, who thought himself over-reached in the partition; because the half of the harbour of Dublin, which he observed to be commodious for traffic and fishing, did not fail within his allotment, to recover which he again commenced hostilities, and fell in the attempt. <small> J.
