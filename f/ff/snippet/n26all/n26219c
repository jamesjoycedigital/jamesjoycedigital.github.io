A piece of ground near the bridge over the river Derwent is called &ldquo;Battle-flats,&rdquo; and in the surrounding fields, where, for about a century after the battle, large heaps of human bones were to be seen, joint-bones, together with iron swords and other weapons, have been ploughed up, as well as horse-shoes that would be suitable for the small Norwegian horses. <small> Jens Jacob Asmussen Worsaae, <a name="JJAW1" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#JJAW1"><cite title="source">An Account of the Danes and Norwegians</cite></a> (1852) 40-1</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: Bottle-washers. </mm> </dd></dl>
