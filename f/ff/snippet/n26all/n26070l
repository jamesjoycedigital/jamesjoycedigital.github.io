The habit of moveable nations in the uncivilized or nomadic state, would lead us to infer, as these Kimmerii or Kimbri are characterised as a wandering nation, and are shown by all that remains of their history to have been so, that at some early period, after they reached the shores of the German Ocean, they crossed it in their rude vessels to Great Britain. This reasonable supposition, analogous to all that we know of the customs of such nations, and of the colonization of other parts of the world, has a remarkable support in the name and traditions of the Welsh and their ancient British literature. It is agreed by the British antiquaries, that the most ancient inhabitants of our island were called <mark>Cymry</mark> (pronounced Kumri): they are so named in all that remains of the ancient British literature. <small> Sharon Turner, <a name="HOAG" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#HOAG"><cite title="source">The History of The Anglo-Saxons</cite></a> (1820) 35-6</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
