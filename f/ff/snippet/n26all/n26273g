Nor could anyone tell how to release him, and the heartbroken queen was dying of grief, for she loved her husband very dearly.</p> <small> Mabel Quiller-Couch, <a name="TRIS" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#TRIS"><cite title="source">Cornwall's Wonderland</cite></a> (1914) 195</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
