The knight or the county gentleman could not apprentice his superfluous daughters to a pursemaker or a weaver in the town; not from them were drawn the regrateresses in the market place and the harvest gatherers in the field; nor was it theirs to make the parti-coloured bed and shake the coverlet, worked with grapes and unicorns, in some rich <mark>vintner&apos;s</mark> house. There remained for him, if he did not wish or could not afford to keep them at home and for them, if they desired some scope for their young energies, only marriage or else a convent, where they might go with a smaller dower than a husband of their own rank would demand. <small> Eileen Edna Power, <a name="MLEN" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#MLEN"><cite title="source">Medieval English Nunneries</cite></a> (1922) 5-6</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
