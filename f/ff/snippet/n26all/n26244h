The Battle of the Boyne [1 July 1690) was a decisive battle between the forces of the deposed King James VII and II of Scotland, England and Ireland and those of Dutch Prince William of Orange [King Billy] who, with his wife Mary II (his cousin and James&apos;s daughter), had acceded to the Crowns of England and Scotland in 1688. The battle took place across the River Boyne near the town of Drogheda and resulted in a victory for William. This turned the tide in James&apos;s fortunes and ultimately aided in ensuring the continued Protestant ascendancy in Ireland.</mm> </dd></dl>
