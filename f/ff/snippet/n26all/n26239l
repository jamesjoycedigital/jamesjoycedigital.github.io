In the northern counties of England, viz., Northamptonshire, Nottinghamshire, Lincolnshire, and Yorkshire, this term is still used instead of the customary one of &ldquo;Hundred.&rdquo; Yet there is some probability that it may have been derived from the circumstance that the Danes, like the ancient inhabitants of the North in general, elected their chiefs, and signified their assent to any proposition at the Things, by Vaabentag, or Vaabenlarm (sound, or clang of arms). Vaabentag (Wapentake) might thus have become the name of a small district, having its own chief and its own Thing. A law of King Ethelred&apos;s (see Thorpe <cite>Leges et Instit. Anglo-Sax.</cite>, Glossary, <i>Lahman</i>), which seems to have been promulgated only for the five Danish burghs, and the rest of the Danish part of England, orders that there shall be in every Wapentake a <i><mark>Gemot</i></mark> or Thing. <small> Jens Jacob Asmussen Worsaae, <a name="JJAW1" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#JJAW1"><cite title="source">An Account of the Danes and Norwegians</cite></a> (1852) 159</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
