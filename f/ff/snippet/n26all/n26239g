It is probable that the original Udallers were the chief leaders, or generals, of the Danish conquerors settled in East Anglia. From the fines fixed for the murder of such &ldquo;holdas,&rdquo; it is plain that they held a very high rank. The old Scandinavian name for peasant, &ldquo;<i><mark>Bonda</mark></i>,&rdquo; was also disseminated in the north of England. <small> Jens Jacob Asmussen Worsaae, <a name="JJAW1" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#JJAW1"><cite title="source">An Account of the Danes and Norwegians</cite></a> (1852) 157</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
