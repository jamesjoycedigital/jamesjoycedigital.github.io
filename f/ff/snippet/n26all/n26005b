It is certain that ancient geographers have often truncated the initial letters of proper names of places. For instance, instead of Pepiacum, and Pepidii in Wales, Ptolemy writes Epiacum and Epidii; and for Dulcinium, now called Dolcigno, in Dalmatia, he has Ulcinium, and Pliny, Olchinium. The inhabitants of Fingal call this place Divelin, and the Welch, <mark>Dinas-Dulin</mark>, or the city of Dulin, to this day. <small> J. Warburton, Rev. J. Whitelaw, and Rev. R.
