On the return of the commissioners in <mark>452 <year>B.C.</year></mark> all the magistracies were suspended, and a body of ten patricians <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> was appointed with consular powers, under the presidency of Appius Claudius, for the express purpose of putting the laws into shape. Before the end of the ensuing year (<mark>451</mark>) the bulk of the code was ready and was at once passed into law by the <i>comitia</i> of the centuries and published on ten tables (whether of brass or wood is doubtful), which were set up in the Forum. <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> On the downfall of the decemvirate, these new laws, after being duly accepted by the <i>comitia</i>, were published on two other tables, thus bringing the number up to twelve. The code then received the official name of <i>Lex XII.
