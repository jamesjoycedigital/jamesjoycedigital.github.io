From this description given by Pembrige, some judgment may be formed how the ancient walls of the city were carried, namely, from Wine-tavern gate along the south side of Cook-street, till they joined Owen&apos;s arch, which yet remains, and was a portal to the city and from thence were continued north of Owen&apos;s church-yard, to a castle called Fagan&apos;s-castle, in Page&apos;s court, where was another portal, and from thence they extended to Newgate. <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> <br>From the north or Store tower of the castle, formerly mentioned, the city wall was carried by the garden of Cork House, which was anciently the church-yard of St. Mary les Dames, unto Dames&apos;-gate, which stood upon the rising of Cork-Hill, opposite to a small alley, called by some <mark>Scarlet-alley</mark>,and by some Salutation-alley. <small> J.
