The battle took place across the River Boyne near the town of Drogheda and resulted in a victory for William. This turned the tide in James&apos;s fortunes and ultimately aided in ensuring the continued Protestant ascendancy in Ireland.  <br>Raphael transcription: <a name="c08089a" href="c08all.htm#c08089a">VI.C.08:089(a)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
