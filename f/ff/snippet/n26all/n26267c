Husband, wife and children did not necessarily constitute an independent family among the Romans, as with us, nor were they all necessarily of the same one. Those formed a family who were all subject to the power&mdash;originally <i>manus</i>, later <i>potestas</i> or <i>jus</i>&mdash;of the same head (<i>paterfamilias</i>). <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> But if his wife had not passed <i>in manum</i> &hellip;, she did not become a member of his family: she remained a member of the family in which she was born, or, if its head were deceased or she had been emancipated, she constituted <mark>a family in her own person</mark>. <small> &ldquo;ROMAN LAW&rdquo; <a name="EBRL2" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#EBRL2"><cite title="source">Encyclopaedia Britannica</cite></a>, 11th edit.
