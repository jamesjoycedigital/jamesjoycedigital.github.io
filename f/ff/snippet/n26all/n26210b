The Irish called the town &ldquo;Port Lairge;&rdquo; to which name, however, modern Irish scholars would ascribe a &ldquo;Danish&rdquo; origin, as it is supposed to be derived from a Danish chief called Lairge, mentioned in the Irish annals in the year 951. The Norwegians, on the other hand called it &ldquo;Ve&eth;rafjo&ouml;r&eth;r,&rdquo; the resemblance of which to Waterford is not to be mistaken. Near the coast of this &ldquo;fiord,&rdquo; which may have given name to the town, is still to be seen a monument, very rare in Ireland, of the ancient Norwegians&apos; art of fortification, namely, a round tower, said to have been erected in the year 1003 by the reigning Norwegian king in Waterford, Regnald or Reginald (Ragnvald), and which to the present day is commonly called &ldquo;<mark>Reginald&apos;s Tower</mark>.&rdquo; <p>This tower, which in Irish was also called &ldquo;<mark>Dundory</mark>,&rdquo; or the king&apos;s fortress, was afterwards used both as a fortress and a mint. After the English conquest of Waterford, Earl Strongbow used it in the year 1171 as a secure dwelling-place; and, among other prisoners, for a long time kept Reginald, the last king of the &ldquo;Danes&rdquo; in Waterford, imprisoned in it.</p> <small> Jens Jacob Asmussen Worsaae, <a name="JJAW1" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#JJAW1"><cite title="source">An Account of the Danes and Norwegians</cite></a> (1852) 318</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
