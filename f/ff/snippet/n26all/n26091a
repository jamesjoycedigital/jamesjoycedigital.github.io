For those who entered young and of their own will, religion was either a profession or a vocation. They might take the veil because it offered an honourable career for superfluous girls, who were unwilling or unable to marry; or they might take it in a real spirit of devotion, with a real call to the religious life. <small> Eileen Edna Power, <a name="MLEN" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#MLEN"><cite title="source">Medieval English Nunneries</cite></a> (1922) 25</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
