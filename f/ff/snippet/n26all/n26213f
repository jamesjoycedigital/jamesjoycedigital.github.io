But the favourite heroes of the Danes and Norwegians are seamen; as Christian IV., Wiels Juel, Hvitfeld, and especially Tordenskjold, who, singularly enough, was contemporary with Charles XII. The difference between the people is clearly expressed in the opening lines of two of the most favourite national songs. The Danish&mdash;formerly the Norwegians also&mdash;runs thus: <br>&ldquo; <mark>Kong Christian stod ved ho&ouml;ien Mast I Ro&ouml;g og Damp</mark>,&rdquo; <br>(&ldquo; King Christian stood by the high mast, enveloped in mist and smoke&rdquo; ), <br>where there is an allusion to a fight at sea. But the Swedish lines, <br>&ldquo; <mark>Kung Karl den unge hjelte</mark> <br><mark>Han stod i r&ouml;k och dam</mark>,&rdquo; <br>(&ldquo; King Charles the young hero, stood in smoke and dust&rdquo; ), <br>allude to battle and victory on land. <small> Jens Jacob Asmussen Worsaae, <a name="JJAW1" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#JJAW1"><cite title="source">An Account of the Danes and Norwegians</cite></a> (1852) xx</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
