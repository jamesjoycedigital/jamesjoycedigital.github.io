A piece of ground near the bridge over the river Derwent is called &ldquo;<mark>Battle-flats</mark>,&rdquo; and in the surrounding fields, where, for about a century after the battle, large heaps of human bones were to be seen, joint-bones, together with iron swords and other weapons, have been ploughed up, as well as horse-shoes that would be suitable for the small Norwegian horses. <small> Jens Jacob Asmussen Worsaae, <a name="JJAW1" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#JJAW1"><cite title="source">An Account of the Danes and Norwegians</cite></a> (1852) 40-1</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
