Mercia, or the middle part of England, which was half-Saxon and half-Danish, he gave to Edrik Streon, who was in favour with the mixed population there, possibly because, as the proverb runs, <mark>he wore his cloak on both shoulders</mark>. <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> <mark>Canute</mark> increased, moreover, the number of his guards of Scandinavian <mark>Huskarle, or <i>Thingmen</i></mark>, of whom his forefathers had already availed themselves; and drew up for them a special code of laws, of such severity, that even the king himself could not infringe them with impunity. These Huskarle, or body guards, being thus totally separated from the English by a peculiar system of law, became, in consequence, a really firm support for the kings. His Huskarle law, <font color="green">[141]</font> called <mark>Witherlagsretten</mark>, remained in force in the Danish court long after Canute&apos;s time. <small> Jens Jacob Asmussen Worsaae, <a name="JJAW1" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#JJAW1"><cite title="source">An Account of the Danes and Norwegians</cite></a> (1852) 141-2</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
