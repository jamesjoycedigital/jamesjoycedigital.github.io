It is true that it was extremely difficult for the Danes to force an entrance on the land side, and, in order to do so by sea, it was necessary to make a troublesome and dangerous voyage round the long-extended peninsula formed by the modern Cornwall and Devonshire. In general its rivers were not large or navigable, and the number of good harbours was but small. Nevertheless, the Northmen seem to have known Wales well, as the old land of the Britons; since it was always called &ldquo;Bretland,&rdquo; to distinguish it from England. Palnatoke, the celebrated chief of the Jomsvikings, is said to have married there, during one of his warlike expeditions, Ol&ouml;f, a daughter of the Bretland jarl, Stefner, whose Jarled&ouml;mme (earldom) Palnatoke afterwards possessed. The Sagas often make mention of <i>Bj&ouml;rn hin Bretske</i> (Bear the Briton) as being among his men; and it is said that when he <font color="green">[7]</font> assisted at the funeral solemnities with his foster son, King <mark>Svend Tveskj&aelig;g</mark> <font color="green">[n.: Split-beard]</font>, held in honour of his father, King Harald Blaatand <font color="green">[n.: <mark>Blue-tooth</mark>]</font>, the half of his suite were Britons. <small> Jens Jacob Asmussen Worsaae, <a name="JJAW1" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#JJAW1"><cite title="source">An Account of the Danes and Norwegians</cite></a> (1852) 7-8</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c08168d" href="c08all.htm#c08168d">VI.C.08:168(d)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
