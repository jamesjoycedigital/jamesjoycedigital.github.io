In London, where the same termination of <font color="green">[39]</font> the names of streets frequently occurs some have, indeed, endeavoured to derive this <i>gate</i> from the gates which these streets adjoined; and, as far as regards London, this explanation may probably in most cases be correct. But in York, where formerly there were at least a score of such streets, it is certainly by no means a probably conjecture that twenty gates existed from their names were derived; and it therefore becomes a question whether these <i>gates</i> should not be derived from the old Scandinavian &ldquo;<i>gata</i>&rdquo; (a street), particularly when they appear in compound names, such as Petersgate (Petersgade), <mark>Marygate</mark> (Mariegada), Fishergate (Fiskergade), <mark>Stonegate</mark> (Steengade), <mark>Micklegate</mark> (from the old Scandinavian &ldquo;mykill,&rdquo; signifying great); which have a striking resemblance with Scandinavian names of streets; nay, there is even a legend respecting Godram, or Guthramgate, that it was named after a Danish chieftain, Guthrum or Gorm, who is said to have dwelt there. <small> Jens Jacob Asmussen Worsaae, <a name="JJAW1" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#JJAW1"><cite title="source">An Account of the Danes and Norwegians</cite></a> (1852) 39-40</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
