For about three centuries the Danes were the terror of the Anglo-Saxons. They generally anchored their ships at the mouths of rivers, or lay under the islands on the coasts. Thence they would sail up the rivers to the interior of the country, where they frequently mounted on horseback, and conveyed themselves with incredible speed from one place to another. Their frightful sabre-cuts resounded everywhere. Their progress was marked by the burning of churches and convents, castles, and towns; and great multitudes of people were either killed or dragged away into slavery. In a short time they began to take up their abode in the country for the winter, and in the spring they renewed their destructive incursions. The terrified inhabitants imagined they beheld a judgment of God in the devastations of the Vikings, which had been foretold in ancient prophecies. <p>Not even the remote and poorer districts of Wales were spared. It is true that it was extremely difficult for the Danes to force an entrance on the land side, and, in order to do so by sea, it was necessary to make a troublesome and dangerous voyage round the long-extended peninsula formed by the modern Cornwall and Devonshire. In general its rivers were not large or navigable, and the number of good harbours was but small. Nevertheless, the Northmen seem to have known Wales well, as the old land of the Britons; since it was always called &ldquo;Bretland,&rdquo; to distinguish it from England. Palnatoke, the celebrated chief of the Jomsvikings, is said to have married there, during one of his warlike expeditions, Ol&ouml;f, a daughter of the Bretland jarl, Stefner, whose Jarled&ouml;mme (earldom) Palnatoke afterwards possessed. The Sagas often make mention of <i>Bj&ouml;rn hin Bretske</i> (Bear the Briton) as being among his men; and it is said that when he <font color="green">[7]</font> assisted at the funeral solemnities with his foster son, King <mark>Svend Tveskj&aelig;g</mark> <font color="green">[n.: Split-beard]</font>, held in honour of his father, King Harald Blaatand <font color="green">[n.: Blue-tooth]</font>, the half of his suite were Britons.</p> <small> Jens Jacob Asmussen Worsaae, <a name="JJAW1" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#JJAW1"><cite title="source">An Account of the Danes and Norwegians</cite></a> (1852) 7-8</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
