With true northern pride he would not make himself known to Ella, who caused him to be thrown into a pen filled with snakes; and it was not till the dying Regner had sung his swan&apos;s-song, &ldquo;Grynte vilde Grisene, kjendte de Galtens Skjebne&rdquo; (How the young pigs would grunt if they knew the old boar&apos;s fate), that Ella too late observed to his terror that he had exposed himself to the fearful vengeance of the king&apos;s sons; who, guided by the shrewd Ivar Beenl&ouml;se, had long been silently preparing for the conquest of Ella&apos;s kingdom. <small> Jens Jacob Asmussen Worsaae, <a name="JJAW1" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#JJAW1"><cite title="source">An Account of the Danes and Norwegians</cite></a> (1852) 33</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
