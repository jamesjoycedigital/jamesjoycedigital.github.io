If, for instance, Anglo-Saxons <mark>met a Dane upon a bridge</mark>, they were obliged to stand still, and make low bows; nay, even if they were on horseback, they must dismount, and wait till the Dane had <font color="green">[143]</font> passed. At the same time the Anglo-Saxon nobility gradually lost the many fiefs and lucrative posts of honour which had formerly been in their possession, but which were now transferred to their powerful conquerors. <small> Jens Jacob Asmussen Worsaae, <a name="JJAW1" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#JJAW1"><cite title="source">An Account of the Danes and Norwegians</cite></a> (1852) 143-4</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
