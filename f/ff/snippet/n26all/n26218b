Traces of Danish castles and ramparts are not only found in the southern and south-eastern parts of England, but also quite in the south-west, in Devonshire and Cornwall, where, under the name of <i>Castelton Danis</i>, they are particularly found on the sea coast. <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> On the plain near Ashdon, in Essex, where it was formerly thought that the battle of Ashingdon had taken place, are to be seen some large Danish barrows, which were long, but erroneously, said to contain the bones of the Danes who had fallen in it. The so-called dwarf-alder (<i>Sambucus ebulus</i>), which has red buds, and bears red berries, is said in England to have germinated from the blood of the fallen Danes. It is therefore called <i><mark>Daneblood</mark></i> and <i><mark>Danewort</mark></i> and flourishes principally in the neighbourhood of Warwick where it is said to have sprung from, and been dyed by, the blood shed there, when Canute the Great took and destroyed the town. <small> Jens Jacob Asmussen Worsaae, <a name="JJAW1" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#JJAW1"><cite title="source">An Account of the Danes and Norwegians</cite></a> (1852) 24-5</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
