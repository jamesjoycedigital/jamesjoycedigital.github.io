The Goths called themselves Gutans, and their word for god was <i>gudh</i> or <i>guth</i>.]</font> &lsquo;<i>God</i>&rsquo; is a word common to all of the Germanic languages. It was, in heathen times, of neuter gender and was used almost exclusively in the plural number. This was not because these people thought of the gods as many, but rather it expressed a feeling for the multiform majesty of the divinity. The <i>V&ouml;lusp&aacute;</i> <font color="green">[Song of the Sybil]</font>&mdash;a poem of the Elder Edda written in Iceland in the eleventh century&mdash;writes of the history of the Norse gods and distinguishes a two-fold form of nomenclature: the esoteric influences&mdash;nameless and without attributes&mdash;who ruled the world, and the exoteric and personalised gods. Of the first of these, we find the &lsquo;deciding powers&rsquo; (Old Norse <i>regin</i> or <i>r&ouml;gn</i>) and the &lsquo;decision-making powers&rsquo; (ON <i>b&ouml;nd</i> and <i>h&ouml;pt</i>). <font color="green">[In the singular <i>band</i> and <i>hapt</i>.]</font> Of the more manifested gods, two divine families were identified: the <i>Aesir</i> <font color="green">[singular: <i>&aacute;ss</i>]</font>&mdash;these include Odin, Thor, and Tyr&mdash;and the <i>Vanir</i> <font color="green">[sing.: <i>Vanr</i>]</font>&mdash;these include Njord, Frey (the fertility god) and Freya (Frey&apos;s female counterpart). Fjorgynn <font color="green">[Earth]</font> was the mother of Thor. Tyr, or Tiw, was identified by the Romans with their Mars and was a god of battles and of contest. Also known as &lsquo;law-maintaining&rsquo; Tyr, it was in an early period a god of some importance, to be eclipsed later by Odin and Thor. ON <i>d&iacute;ar</i> has two senses. The first is a general name for certain of the Aesir; the second for sacrifice-conducting priests or chiefs. <i>J&ouml;tunn</i> <font color="green">[with plural <i>Jotnar</i>]</font> has the meaning of a &lsquo;giant&rsquo;. <i>Vear</i> is a poetic term for the gods in general. </mm> </dd></dl>
