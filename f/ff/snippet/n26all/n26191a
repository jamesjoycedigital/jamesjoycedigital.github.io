After his divorce from her, he married Anne Bolyn (1533), who was later condemned to death on a charge of adultery (1536). Henry then married Jane Seymour, who was obnoxious to no one, gave birth to Edward VI., and then died (1537). Anne of Cleves was chosen to be Henry&apos;s fourth wife, but was speedily divorced. He next married Catherine Howard, who was shortly after brought to the block (1542). Her successor in the royal bed was Catherine Parr. </mm> </dd></dl>
