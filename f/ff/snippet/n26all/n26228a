But even if this supposition be unfounded, or destitute as yet of certain <font color="green">[113]</font> historical proof, may it not at least be probable that Columbus had heard in some other way of the Northmen&apos;s former voyages to Greenland; and that this might have had some influence on the resolution he afterwards formed to set out across the Atlantic on a voyage of discovery towards the west? <p>But under any circumstances, the regular voyages of the English to Iceland were certainly connected with <mark>the subsequent complete discovery of the New World</mark>. They had served to make them familiar with more extensive voyages on the open ocean, and thus essentially contributed to foster that daring Viking spirit, which they had inherited from their Scandinavian forefathers, and which in process of time was to become so important in cementing the connec-tion between the Old and the New World. No sooner was the latter a second time discovered than the Vikings&apos; spirit again strongly displayed itself in a re-newed form among the English people.</p> <small> Jens Jacob Asmussen Worsaae, <a name="JJAW1" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#JJAW1"><cite title="source">An Account of the Danes and Norwegians</cite></a> (1852) 113-4</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
