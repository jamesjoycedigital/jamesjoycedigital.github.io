The walls inclosed only that proportionally small part of the modern London called the &ldquo;City,&rdquo; and which forms the centre of its busy commerce. Close by lay a castle (whence the Northmen&apos;s name for London, &ldquo;<mark>Lundunaborg</mark>&rdquo; ), and undoubtedly on the same spot where, not long after Canute&apos;s time, William the Conqueror built the tower. Somewhat higher up the Thames, on an island which, from the many thorns growing there, obtained the name of Thorney (<i>Anglo-Saxon</i> Thornege), or the Thorn Island, stood another castle, said to have been inhabited at different times by Canute. <small> Jens Jacob Asmussen Worsaae, <a name="JJAW1" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#JJAW1"><cite title="source">An Account of the Danes and Norwegians</cite></a> (1852) 15-16</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
