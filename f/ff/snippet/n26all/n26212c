It was a common saying that the Irish soil was so holy that neither <mark>vipers</mark>, nor any other poisonous reptiles, could exist upon it. Numerous priests set out from Ireland as missionaries to the islands lying to the west of Scotland; nay, they even went as far as the Faroe Islands and Iceland, long before these islands had been colonized. Thus, when the Northmen first discovered Iceland (about the year 860), they found no population there; but on &ldquo;Papey,&rdquo; in &ldquo;Papyli,&rdquo; and several places in the east and south of the country, they found traces of &ldquo;Papar,&rdquo; or Christian priests, who had left behind them croziers, bells, and Irish books; whence they perceived that these priests were &ldquo;<mark>Westmen</mark>,&rdquo; or Irishmen; for just as the Irish called the Scandinavians &ldquo;Ostmen,&rdquo; because their home lay to the east of Ireland so also did the Scandinavians call the Irish &ldquo;Westmen.&rdquo; The most southern group of islands near Iceland is called to the present day &ldquo;Vestmannaeyjar&rdquo; (the Westman Isles), <font color="green">[332]</font> because, at the time of their colonization, a number of Irish serfs, or Westmen, were put to death there for deceiving their masters. <small> Jens Jacob Asmussen Worsaae, <a name="JJAW1" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#JJAW1"><cite title="source">An Account of the Danes and Norwegians</cite></a> (1852) 332-3</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
