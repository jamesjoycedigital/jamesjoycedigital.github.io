Colburn, 1828). According to Herbert Gorman, this was one of four books owned by John Stanilaus Joyce: &ldquo;His father&apos;s library,if the few volumes can be so dignified, consisted of <cite>Pelham, or the Adventures of a Gentleman</cite>, by Bulwer-Lytton (John Stanislaus could never make up his mind whether the English author&apos;s name was Bu;wer=Lytton or Lytton-Bulwer); <cite>Harry Coverdale&apos;s Courtship</cite>, by Smedley; Jonah Barrington&apos;s <cite>Recollections of His Own Times</cite>, and <cite>The House by the Churchyard</cite>, a story about old Chapelizod, by Le Fanu.&rdquo; The author&apos;s full name was Edward George Earle Lytton Bulwer-Lytton, so J.S.J. was justified in his confusion.
