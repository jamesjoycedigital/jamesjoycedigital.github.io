After the death of Harald, Erik became chief sovereign in Norway; but he and his queen, the notorious Gunhilde, ruled here with so much cruelty, that the Norwegians gave Erik the surname of Blod&ouml;xe (<mark>Blood-axe</mark>). Driven from his kingdom, he at length repaired to Northumberland, where King Athelstane is said to have made him a tributary king, and where, after many vicissitudes of fortune, he met his death. <small> Jens Jacob Asmussen Worsaae, <a name="JJAW1" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#JJAW1"><cite title="source">An Account of the Danes and Norwegians</cite></a> (1852) 35</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c08176l" href="c08all.htm#c08176l">VI.C.08:176(l)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
