Had it not been one of the most, or indeed quite the most, favourably situated stream in Europe for commerce, the greatest commercial city in the world would hardly have risen on its banks. But just as5 the Thames brought, in the olden times, numerous merchant vessels, and, along with them, wealth and prosperity to the south of England, so must it also have frequently drawn down ruin on the surrounding districts, since it attracted thither almost all the Vikings who sought for booty and conquest. Nature herself has cut a deep bay into the eastern coast of England, at the mouth of the Thames, and thus pointed out to the Vikings the way they should pursue. The ships of the Danish Vikings constantly <mark>swarmed at the mouth of the Thames</mark>. <small> Jens Jacob Asmussen Worsaae, <a name="JJAW1" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#JJAW1"><cite title="source">An Account of the Danes and Norwegians</cite></a> (1852) 11-2</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
