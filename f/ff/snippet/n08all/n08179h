His most formidable antagonist was the great hero Eoghan-Mor, otherwise called Mogh-Nuadhat, king of Munster, who having defeated him in ten battles, forced him at last to divide Ireland between them. For a line of demarcation they fixed on a natural ridge of sand-hills called <i>Esker-Riada</i>. </mm> </dd></dl>
