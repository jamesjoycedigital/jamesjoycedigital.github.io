There is no mention of this in the Annals, and we may be certain that it is an invention. <small> Stephen Gwynn, <a name="SGHI" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#SGHI"><cite title="source">The History of Ireland</cite></a> (1923) 42</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: A few years after the battle of Cooldrevny, Diarmait seized by force the chief of the Hy Maine, who had slain his herald and taken refuge with St. Ruadan of Lothra. According to the legend the saint, accompanied by St. Brendan of Birr, followed the king to Tara and solemnly cursed it, from which time it was deserted. </mm> </dd></dl>
