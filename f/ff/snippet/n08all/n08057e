The smaller and much more naturally drawn figure at the top may also be intended for him. The difference of execution in the two cases would, I suggest, almost justify the conclusion that the larger figure was a later addition in order to fill a space left vacant when the original artist had touched the Manuscript for the last time. I think, too, that we can almost see from the illumination itself the very place where he was hurried from his work. <small> Sir Edward Sullivan, <a name="BOK1" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#BOK1"><cite title="source">The Book of Kells</cite></a>, 2nd ed.
