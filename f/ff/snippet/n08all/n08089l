Witness the case of the strange find at Hull the other day. The SS. Reventazon was landing <mark>a cargo of bananas from Jamaica when a strange little creature was discovered hiding among the fruit</mark>.

It is remarkably agile, especially in the matter of climbing, and is capable of gripping anything. A London Journal gives the following description of it. It is:&mdash;The size of a rat, a light fawn colour; the possessor of large, luminous black eyes; the possessor of paws like a monkey; the possessor of a long, prehensile tail, and a tapering snout.
