Its work, that is to say, was carried out, not by individual priests appointed as ministers to a marked-out section of the countryside, ruled by a bishop having also his defined territory, but rather by communities planted in some locality, from which priests went out to minister, and to which the faithful came for their devotions. <small> Stephen Gwynn, <a name="SGHI" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#SGHI"><cite title="source">The History of Ireland</cite></a> (1923) 30-31</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c03046b" href="c03all.htm#c03046b">VI.C.03:046(b)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
