The Cruithni were one of several tribes or groups of those earlier inhabitants whom the Gaels subjugated. All these were under tribute to the Gaelic chiefs, even though they still owned their stretch of territory and had their own chiefs. They were therefore called the &ldquo;Rent-paying Communities.&rdquo; <small> Stephen Gwynn, <a name="SGHI" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#SGHI"><cite title="source">The History of Ireland</cite></a> (1923) 3</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: In the Irish Annals, the picts were usually called &ldquo;Cruithne&rdquo;, considered to be synonymous with &ldquo;Picti&rdquo;, i.e. painted, from &ldquo;cruith&rdquo;, colour. </mm> </dd></dl>
