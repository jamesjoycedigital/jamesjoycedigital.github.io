Firbolg means Men of the Leather Bag, and the chroniclers made up a story to account for it which is quite unhistorical, and was plainly invented to connect the legendary history of Ireland with the legendary history of Greece. But the name becomes interesting because other &ldquo;rent-paying&rdquo; communities also had names relating to a trade or craft, such as the <i>Ceardrighe</i>, Smith folk; and it is conjectured that a sort of caste system, under which occupations are hereditary in a tribe, may have existed among these pre-Gaelic peoples. <small> Stephen Gwynn, <a name="SGHI" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#SGHI"><cite title="source">The History of Ireland</cite></a> (1923) 4</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
