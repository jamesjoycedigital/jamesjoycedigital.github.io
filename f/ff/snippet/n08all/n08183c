This was especially true of the law which laid down that killing should be atoned for by a fine, legally fixed&mdash;as was the usage in Ireland as long as the native law lasted. This principle has been common to many countries. It was followed by all Scandinavia through the Middle Ages; and though it has been described as barbarous, it is less so than the excessive use of capital punishment characteristic of the English law, under which even in the nineteenth century pocket-picking or sheep-stealing was punishable by death. <small> Stephen Gwynn, <a name="SGHI" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#SGHI"><cite title="source">The History of Ireland</cite></a> (1923) 25</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
