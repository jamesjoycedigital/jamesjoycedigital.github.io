But his great power had made itself felt in other ways. He had quarrelled with Dermod the High King, who was of the Southern Hy Neill, and Columba persuaded his nearest kindred, the Northern Hy Neill, to make war. The hosts met at Cooldrevny, between Benbulben and the sea, and the High King was defeated. <small> Stephen Gwynn, <a name="SGHI" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#SGHI"><cite title="source">The History of Ireland</cite></a> (1923) 33</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
