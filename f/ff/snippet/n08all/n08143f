The phrase apparently was first used in its Latin form in 1803 by Francis Plowden (1749-1829), a Jesuit supporter of the Act of Union. It was applied primarily to the Gaelicization of the Anglo-Norman settlers, whose enthusiastic adoption of Irish ways was viewed as a threat to English colonization. In 1366 the Statute of Kilkenny was passed in order to reverse this process. It consisted of 36 clauses, including those forbidding the colonists to intermarry with the Irish, or use the Irish language. <font color="green">[Vincent Deane.]</font> </mm> </dd></dl>
