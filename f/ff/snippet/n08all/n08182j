Here Dicuil, owner of the land where he disembarked, became a convert, and granted to Patrick the site on which he established his first place of worship in a wooden barn. Saul (that is <i>Sabhall</i>, the barn) still keeps the name. He founded other churches here, and there is a picturesque legend concerning his visit to his old master at Slemish. But these are small matters compared with the importance of a step which he took almost at once. He pushed straight for Tara itself. <small> Stephen Gwynn, <a name="SGHI" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#SGHI"><cite title="source">The History of Ireland</cite></a> (1923) 23</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
