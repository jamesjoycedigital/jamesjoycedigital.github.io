We read again and again that at a stage in his missionary journeys &ldquo;he wrote an alphabet.&rdquo; This was an elementary religious catechism, in Latin; it was left for an instruction in Christianity, in the Latin language, and in reading or writing. Patrick made reading and writing common in Ireland; he made a knowledge of Latin common, and Latin was then the necessary key to whatever knowledge western Europe possessed. <small> Stephen Gwynn, <a name="SGHI" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#SGHI"><cite title="source">The History of Ireland</cite></a> (1923) 24</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
