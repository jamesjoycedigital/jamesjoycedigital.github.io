They captured Emania and destroyed it, about 330 A,D.; they won a territory in the centre of Ulster comprising what is now the counties of Armagh and Monaghan, with part of Tyrone and Derry. This was termed henceforth the kingdom of Oriel, that is Oirghialla, &ldquo;the eastern subjects,&rdquo; so called because the home of this monarchy still lay west in Connaught. <small> Stephen Gwynn, <a name="SGHI" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#SGHI"><cite title="source">The History of Ireland</cite></a> (1923) 15</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
