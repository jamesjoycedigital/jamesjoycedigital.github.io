He is said to have ordained three hundred and fifty bishops. Inconveniences resulted, but it is more than probable that the work would not have advanced so quickly had not each tribal grouping been given its own spiritual head. Interference in another tribe s boundaries was strictly forbidden. A bishop had charge only of those churches which he had founded or of which he had been put in charge, and his ministrations were naturally directed to his own people. <small> Stephen Gwynn, <a name="SGHI" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#SGHI"><cite title="source">The History of Ireland</cite></a> (1923) 24</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
