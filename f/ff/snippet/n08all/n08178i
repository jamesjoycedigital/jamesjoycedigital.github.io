It describes a war in which Ulster is attacked by a host from the rest of Ireland, led by the princes of Connaught. In the story the war is levied to carry off the famous Brown Bull from Cooley (that is, the mountainous Carlingford peninsula in County Louth), just as the siege of Troy is represented as a quest for Helen. <small> Stephen Gwynn, <a name="SGHI" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#SGHI"><cite title="source">The History of Ireland</cite></a> (1923) 6-7</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: &ldquo;T&aacute;in Bo Chuailgne&rdquo; or &ldquo;the cattle-raid of Cooley&rdquo; is one of the greatest Irish epics.
