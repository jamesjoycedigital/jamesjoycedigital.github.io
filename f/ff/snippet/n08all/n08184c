The first is that the High King was holding the Feast of Tara, a great ceremony which took place on special occasions once at least in each king&apos;s reign. It was attended in the High King&apos;s honour by the provincial kings and the ollaves or chief men of the learned professions, history, law, poetry, and medicine, and also the ollaves of the skilled crafts. There were sports of all kinds, and there were also meetings for discussion; and to preserve the peace of the Feast, violence was forbidden under pain of death. But one noble at this Feast, which was the last ever held in Tara, quarrelled with another and killed him by the blow of a hurley club. The slayer fled to Columcille, who took him under his protection, but King Dermod refused to recognise the protection, and put the offender to death. <small> Stephen Gwynn, <a name="SGHI" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#SGHI"><cite title="source">The History of Ireland</cite></a> (1923) 34</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: A line joins &lsquo;Dermot&rsquo; to &lsquo;defeated&rsquo;. At an assembly held at Tara in 554, Curnan, son of the king of Connaught slew a nobleman, a crime punishable with death. Curnan fled for sanctuary to St. Columba. But Diarmait pursued him and disregarding the opposition of the saint seized Curnan and hanged him. St. Columba&apos;s kinsmen, the northern Hy Neill, took up the quarrel and attacked and defeated the king at Cooldrevny in 561. </mm> </dd></dl>
