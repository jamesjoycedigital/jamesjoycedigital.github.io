The Irish clan or sept was a very loose, and in many cases irregular, structure, embracing even those who were practically undistinguishable from slaves, yet from none of these could any but a <i>fair</i> or customary rent be demanded. <small> Emily Lawless, <a name="ELIS" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#ELIS"><cite title="source">Ireland (Story of Nations series</cite></a> (192?) 28</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
