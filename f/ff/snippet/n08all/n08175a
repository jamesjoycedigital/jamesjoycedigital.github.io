Milo de Cogan, the Norman governor of Dublin, fell upon his assailants suddenly. John the Mad was slain, as were also nearly all the Berserkers. Hasculph was brought back in triumph, and promptly beheaded by the conquerors. <small> Emily Lawless, <a name="ELIS" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#ELIS"><cite title="source">Ireland (Story of Nations series</cite></a> (192?) 87</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c03035f" href="c03all.htm#c03035f">VI.C.03:035(f)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
