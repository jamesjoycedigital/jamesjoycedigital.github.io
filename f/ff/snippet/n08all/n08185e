Colman got the western portion; Hugh got Bregia&mdash;that is, the present Meath, with parts of County Dublin and Louth. Of the two lines, Clan Colman were the stronger and provided most of the High Kings; but Tara was in Bregia. Thus the Hy Neill dynasty was broken up at its original seat of power; and a High King from Clan Colman was always likely to have his power challenged in Tara itself. <small> Stephen Gwynn, <a name="SGHI" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#SGHI"><cite title="source">The History of Ireland</cite></a> (1923) 42</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
