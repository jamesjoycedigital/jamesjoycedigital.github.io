They take their name from Eusebius, Bishop of Caesaria, a well-known Church historian. Before his time a Harmony of the Gospels had been constructed by Ammonius of Alexandria, about <year>A.D.</year> 220, in which St. Matthew&apos;s Gospel was taken as the standard, and parallel passages from the other Gospels were set out side by side with it. Eusebius improved on his predecessor&apos;s plan; his object being to set forth the mutual relation of the four evangelical narratives, and not merely to furnish illustrations to certain passages from other sources, as in the marginal references in modern Bibles. <small> Sir Edward Sullivan, <a name="BOK1" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#BOK1"><cite title="source">The Book of Kells</cite></a>, 2nd ed.
