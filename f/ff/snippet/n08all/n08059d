He laid his foot on the artist&apos;s lap, who scraped the boot with his spudd, <mark>wiped it with the wig</mark>, and laid on the lamp black and rotten egg composition as thick as black paint with the painter&apos;s brush.<font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> At that period city people only used polish. In the country boots were greased, and <mark>goose grease</mark> being the most fashionable and highly thought of was used by the clergy. An old ballad began: &ldquo;Oh! lay by the fat to grease the priest&apos;s boots.&rdquo; <small> <a name="II8jan24" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#II8jan24"><cite title="source">Irish Independent</cite></a> (8 January 1924) 6/5</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
