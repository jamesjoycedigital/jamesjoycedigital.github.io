He died in 1904. See John Wyse Jackson and Peter Costello <cite>John Stanislaus Joyce</cite>, p.267: &ldquo;On April Fool&apos;s Day the notice appeared in the Freeman that Valentine Blake Dillon had died at his Leeson park home at the age of fifty-seven. Another great raconteur gone. He was put to rest at Glasnevin at the beginning of April. John Stanislaus Joyce spruced himself up as best as he could and turned out to honour the ex-Lord Mayor of great ability and great bulk, whose path had crossed and recrossed his own since the old days.&rdquo; </mm> </dd></dl>
