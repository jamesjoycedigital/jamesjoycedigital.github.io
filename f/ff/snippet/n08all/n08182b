The feud between them and the usurping ruler of Tara was permanent. King Leary refused Christianity because he said that he meant, when he died, to be buned upright in the ramparts of Tara, with his face towards the Leinstermen, &ldquo;by reason of the hardness with which he hated them,&rdquo; and he was so buried. <small> Stephen Gwynn, <a name="SGHI" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#SGHI"><cite title="source">The History of Ireland</cite></a> (1923) 18</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: The next king was Laegaire (Leary), son of Niall of the Nine Hostages: the first of the Hy Neill (&ldquo;descendants of Niall&rdquo;) kings. Leary was buried in pagan fashion, under one of the ramparts of his own rath at Tara, standing up fully armed in his grave, with his face towards Leinster. </mm> </dd></dl>
