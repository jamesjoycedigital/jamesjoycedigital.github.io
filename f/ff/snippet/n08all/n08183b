It is told that King Leary, who would not be a Christian, called in the Christian missionary for help and counsel in a great work. He decided to bring together in a written code the laws of Ireland. A body of nine was appointed, consisting of three kings&mdash;Leary himself, the King of Munster, and the King of Ulster; three ollave poets who were also learned in the law, Duffach being one of these; and three bishops Patrick, Benen, and Carnach. Carnach was a Briton, one of the company who came with Patrick. But Benen was a young Irishman, the first Irish disciple to whom Patrick gave ordination and tonsured for the Church. This code of laws, known as the <i>Senchus Mor</i>, is preserved, and, though it has no doubt been altered in many respects, there is little reason to doubt that a code was originally framed by these nine men in 439. <small> Stephen Gwynn, <a name="SGHI" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#SGHI"><cite title="source">The History of Ireland</cite></a> (1923) 24-5</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
