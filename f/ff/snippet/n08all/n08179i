From that time onward the northern half of Ireland, marked off by this natural way, along which ran the Slighe M&oacute;r, chief road from east to west, was called Leath (Conn&apos;s Half), and the southern Leath Mogha. <small> Stephen Gwynn, <a name="SGHI" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#SGHI"><cite title="source">The History of Ireland</cite></a> (1923) 13</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: See also N12 (VI.B.14):124(g, h) and <a name="n12176k" href="n12all.htm#n12176k">N12 (VI.B.14):176(k)</a>. </mm> </dd></dl>
