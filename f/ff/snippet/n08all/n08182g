And he gave one of them to me, and I read the beginning of the letter purporting to be the &lsquo;Voice of the Irish&rsquo; and while I was reading at the beginning of the letter I thought that at that moment I heard the voices of them who dwelt beside the wood of Focluth, which is by the western sea, and this they cried, as if with one mouth: &lsquo;We beseech thee, holy youth, to come and walk once more amongst us.&rsquo; And I was greatly touched in heart and could read no more, and so I awoke. Thanks be to God, that after very many years the Lord granted to them according to their earnest cry.&rdquo; <small> Stephen Gwynn, <a name="SGHI" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#SGHI"><cite title="source">The History of Ireland</cite></a> (1923) 22</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
