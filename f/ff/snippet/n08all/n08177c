In a sense, Irish history begins from the point at which Ireland was reached by a strong and definite wave of influence from the Roman world. St Patrick established throughout Ireland what was then the religion of the Roman Empire; and by so doing he brought Ireland into far closer relations than before with the civilisation from which all European culture descends. <small> Stephen Gwynn, <a name="SGHI" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#SGHI"><cite title="source">The History of Ireland</cite></a> (1923) 2</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
