City (and county) in Northern Ireland. James I granted the city to the citizens of London in 1613, in a charter that added the prefix &lsquo;London&rsquo; to the name. The English settlers undertook extensive re-building of the city. &lsquo;Londonderry&rsquo; is a shibboleth for Unionists: Nationalists, Republicans and most of those living south of the Border continue to call it &lsquo;Derry&rsquo;. <font color="green">[Vincent Deane.]</font> </mm> </dd></dl>
