Then for the first time the black Viking ships were to be seen sweeping shorewards over the low grey waves of the Irish Channel, laden with Picts, Danes, and Norsemen, &ldquo;people,&rdquo; says an old historian, &ldquo;from their very cradles dissentious, Land Leapers, merciless, soure, and hardie.&rdquo; They descended upon Ireland like locusts, and wherever they came ruin, misery, and disaster followed. / Their first descent appears to have been upon an island, probably that of Lambay, near the mouth of what is now Dublin harbour. Returning a few years later, sixty of their ships, according to the Irish annalists, entered the Boyne, and sixty more the Liffey. <small> Emily Lawless, <a name="ELIS" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#ELIS"><cite title="source">Ireland (Story of Nations series</cite></a> (192?) 53-4</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
