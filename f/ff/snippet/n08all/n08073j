Thus English has taken over the German word <i>kindergarten</i> unchanged, while for the same institution Danish has the literal translation <i>b&ouml;rnehave</i> and Norwegian <i>barnehave</i>. <small> Otto Jespersen, <a name="OJGS" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#OJGS"><cite title="source">The Growth and Structure of the English Language</cite></a>, 4th ed.

Havet is not in the source text. </mm> </dd></dl>
