Bodkin, BA. BL., said most people would agree with Plato&apos;s view that a picture was a painted representation of natural objects, and that the art of painting was therefore &ldquo;the art of imitating solid objects on a flat surface by means of pigments.&rdquo; Recent critics, however, amongst them Mr. Clive Bell, held that the painter was concerned only with the expression of aesthetic emotion, and that a picture might be completely non-representative. As usual, the truth was to be found somewhere amid-stream. <small> <a name="II9feb24" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#II9feb24"><cite title="source">Irish Independent</cite></a> (9 February 1924) 5/3</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
