All this may be dismissed as pure mythology. The third colony was that of the Firbolg. This begins to get in touch with fact; there were real people so called. The fourth was that of the Tuatha D&eacute; Danann. These represent quite certainly gods who in the earlier heroic romances mixed themselves up with the loves and wars of heroic mortals as did the gods of ancient Greece. The fifth and last colony was the Milesians. These are simply the Gaels; but the name was invented after the Roman Miles had become famous through the western world. Probably the Gaelic invaders never heard it. <small> Stephen Gwynn, <a name="SGHI" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#SGHI"><cite title="source">The History of Ireland</cite></a> (1923) 3</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
