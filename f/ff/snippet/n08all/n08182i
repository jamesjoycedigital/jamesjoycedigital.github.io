A fellow-student of his at Auxerre, called in Latin <i>Iserninus</i>, was a native of Leinster. In 431 <year>A.D.</year> Pope Celestine decided to send a bishop to take charge of the scattered Christians in that country, and the deacon Palladius was consecrated bishop and sent there. Of his work very little is known; he died within the year. Patrick, who was already preparing to join the mission, was now consecrated bishop to take charge of it. Thus he came to Ireland with the full authority of Rome. <small> Stephen Gwynn, <a name="SGHI" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#SGHI"><cite title="source">The History of Ireland</cite></a> (1923) 22-3</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
