Logeman&apos;s ingenious explanation. The term was originally applied to the inhabitants of the Dutch colonies in North America (New Amsterdam, now New York, etc.). Now <i>Jan Kees</i> is a nickname still applied in Flanders to people from Holland proper. <i>Jan</i> of course is the common Dutch name corresponding to English John, and <i>Kees</i> may be either the usual pet-form of the name Cornelis &hellip; or else a dialectal variation of <i>kaas</i> &lsquo;cheese&rsquo; in allusion to that typically Dutch product, or&mdash;what is most probable&mdash;a combination of both. <i>Jankees</i> in English became <i>Yankees</i>, where the <i>s</i> was taken as the plural ending and eventually disappeared, and <i>Yankee</i> became the designation of any inhabitant of New England and even sometimes of the whole of the United States. <small> Otto Jespersen, <a name="OJGS" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#OJGS"><cite title="source">The Growth and Structure of the English Language</cite></a>, 4th ed.
