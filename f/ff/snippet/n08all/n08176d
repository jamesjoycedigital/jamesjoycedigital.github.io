About the middle of Lent, the wind veering at last to the east, ships arrived from England and Aquitaine, bearers of very ill news to the king. Two legates were on their way, sent by the Pope, to enquire into the murder of Becket, and armed in case of an unsatisfactory reply with all the terrors of an interdict. <small> Emily Lawless, <a name="ELIS" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#ELIS"><cite title="source">Ireland (Story of Nations series</cite></a> (192?) 92</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
