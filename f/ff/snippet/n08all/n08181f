Their race was still dominant in the time of Maeve and Conachar Mac Nessa. But at some time before St Patrick came this dynasty had been replaced by Gaelic conquerors probably a new invasion from Gaul. These conquerors fixed their fortress at Cashel which is the Latin word <i>castellum</i> and may have come from a Gaul already beginning to be Romanised. <small> Stephen Gwynn, <a name="SGHI" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#SGHI"><cite title="source">The History of Ireland</cite></a> (1923) 16</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
