This particular book was recovered after the Battle of Cooldrevny by Columba, and became the chief relic of Columcille in the territory of Kinel Connell; it was kept in a case of silver overlaid with gold, and before the army of Kinel Connell (that is, the people of Tyrconnell) went into battle it was carried three times round the host to bring victory ; so that it came to be called the Cathach or Battler. <small> Stephen Gwynn, <a name="SGHI" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#SGHI"><cite title="source">The History of Ireland</cite></a> (1923) 34</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: Cathach or &ldquo;Battler&rdquo; was properly a relic brought to the battle in the hope it would ensure victory. The most celebrated of the battle-relics was the cathach or battle-book of the O&apos;Donnells of Tirconnel. </mm> </dd></dl>
