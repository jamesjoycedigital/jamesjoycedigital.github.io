The serpent, &ldquo;<i>more subtile than any beast of the field</i>,&rdquo; conceived the plan of depriving the human race of the benefits of immortality to the profit of his own race, and so he suggests to Eve, and through her to Adam, that they should eat the fruit of the <i><b>tree of death</b></i>, which he pretends is the fruit of <i>the tree of knowledge</i>; he himself takes possession of the fruits of life. <small> Charles Guignebert, <a name="CDEV" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#CDEV"><cite title="source">&ldquo;Concerning the devil&rdquo;</cite></a>, <cite a>The Criterion</cite></a> (Oct 1923) 21</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
