It is true that these names &hellip; were not at first meant to express any parallelism with the characteristics of the two sexes, but arose merely from the grammatical fact that the weak <i>-e</i> was the ending of the feminine gender (grande, etc.). <small> Otto Jespersen, <a name="OJGS" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#OJGS"><cite title="source">The Growth and Structure of the English Language</cite></a>, 4th ed.
