The winter, however, was now at hand, and a temporary peace was accordingly patched up; Leinster being restored to Dermot on condition of his acknowledging the over-lordship of Roderick. Giraldus recounts at much length the speeches made upon both sides on this occasion; the martial addresses to the troops, the many classical and flowery quotations, which last he is good enough to bestow upon the unlucky Roderick no less than upon his own allies. <small> Emily Lawless, <a name="ELIS" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#ELIS"><cite title="source">Ireland (Story of Nations series</cite></a> (192?) 84-5</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
