The two ends of a Russian rosary are often bound together for a short distance, so that the lines of beads run parallel (hence the name <i>ladder</i> used for the rosary), and they finish with a three-cornered ornament often adorned with a tassel or other finial, corresponding to the cross or medal used in a Latin rosary. <small> <a name="CECRA" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#CECRA"><cite title="source">&ldquo;Coemgen&rdquo;, &ldquo;Rosary&rdquo; and &ldquo;Albigenses&rdquo;</cite></a> <cite a>Catholic Encyclopaedia</cite></a> (1911) XIII, &lsquo;Rosary&rsquo; 187b</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
