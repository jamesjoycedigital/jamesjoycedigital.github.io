He was the High King, and to him the provincial kings paid tribute and rendered service, while he made to them in return a payment, by acceptance of which they acknowledged his lordship. In the same way, each provincial king had within his province many petty kingdoms, each of which was a tuath or territory. For every tuath there was a <i>ri</i>, head in war, chief judge, sole ruler, <i>but bound to rule according to custom</i>. He rendered service to the provincial king and took wages from him, as was done in the higher degree; and it would seem that the smaller kingdoms were older than the provincial, as certainly the provincial kingdoms were before the High Kingship. <small> Stephen Gwynn, <a name="SGHI" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#SGHI"><cite title="source">The History of Ireland</cite></a> (1923) 13-14</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c03041n" href="c3all.htm#c03041n">VI.C.03:041(n)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
