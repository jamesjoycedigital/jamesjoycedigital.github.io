When this happens (as it will this year) to be in a Leap Year, then the extra day is always set down officially, on board ships, as &ldquo;February 30th.&rdquo; On the extra day in February, 1904, which was a Leap Year, a baby was born on board a ship proceeding from Yokohama to San Francisco, and the interesting event was recorded on the ship&apos;s books as having taken place on February 30th. <small> <a name="FJ1feb24" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#FJ1feb24"><cite title="source">Freeman's Journal</cite></a> (1 February 1924) 8/5</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
