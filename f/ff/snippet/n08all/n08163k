The four which are now to be thrown open are the Salt, Broad Arrow, Martin and Byward Towers. The Martin Tower is the most interesting, as German spies were kept here before they were shot in the minature range at the fort of the Tower. <small> <a name="II9feb24" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#II9feb24"><cite title="source">Irish Independent</cite></a> (9 February 1924) 3/5</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
