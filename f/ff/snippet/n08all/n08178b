Brugh na Boinne, the Irish name for these burial-places, comes into all the Irish stories. But the tombs were not the work of the Gael. They belonged to an older race, wholly outside our ken, and Gaelic imagination made them the home of Gods. <small> Stephen Gwynn, <a name="SGHI" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#SGHI"><cite title="source">The History of Ireland</cite></a> (1923) 5</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
