He went to Auxerre to study, and difficulties met him. Irish had grown more familiar to him than his native tongue. &ldquo;My speech and style are changed into the tongue of the stranger,&rdquo; he says; and he was always, up till old age, painfully conscious that better educated men scoffed at his &ldquo;rusticity&rdquo; and rude Latin which is indeed very clumsy and ungrammatical. He seems to have known very little but the Bible and the heart of man. <small> Stephen Gwynn, <a name="SGHI" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#SGHI"><cite title="source">The History of Ireland</cite></a> (1923) 22</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
