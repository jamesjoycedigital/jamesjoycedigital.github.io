The Basilian monks make use of it in the Eastern style just described and in many cases use it in the Roman fashion in some monasteries. The more active life prescribed for them in following the example of Latin monks leaves less time for the recitation of the rosary according to the Eastern form, whilst the reading and recitation of <mark>the Office</mark> during the canonical Hours fulfils the original monastic obligation and so does not require the rosary. Latterly the Melchites and the Italo-Greeks have in many places adopted among their laity a form of to the one used among the laity of the Roman Rite, but its use is far from general. The Ruthenian and Rumanian Greek Catholics do not use it among the laity, but reserve it chiefly for the monastic clergy, although lately in some parts of Galicia its lay use has been occasionally introduced and is regarded as a latinizing practice. It may be said that among the Greeks in general the use of the rosary is regarded as a religious exercise peculiar to the monastic life; and wherever among Greek Uniats its lay use has been introduced, it is an imitation of the Roman practice. On this account it has never been popularized among the laity of the peoples, who remain strongly attached to their venerable Eastern Rite. <small> <a name="CECRA" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#CECRA"><cite title="source">&ldquo;Coemgen&rdquo;, &ldquo;Rosary&rdquo; and &ldquo;Albigenses&rdquo;</cite></a> <cite a>Catholic Encyclopaedia</cite></a> (1911) XIII, &lsquo;Rosary&rsquo; 188a</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
