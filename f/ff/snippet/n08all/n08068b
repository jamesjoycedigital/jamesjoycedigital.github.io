We thus find the obscured form, which was written <i>a</i> (or <i>&apos;a</i>), in use for &lsquo;he&rsquo; till the beginning of the 16th century &hellip; and in use for &lsquo;she&rsquo; and for &lsquo;they&rsquo; till the end of the 14th century. &hellip; the dative <i>hem</i> still survives in the form <i>&apos;em</i> (&lsquo;take &apos;em&rsquo;), which is now by people ignorant of the history of the language taken to be a shortened <i>them</i>; <i>her</i> &lsquo;their&rsquo; is the only form for the possessive of the plural found in Chaucer &hellip; and there are two or three instances in Shakespeare. <small> Otto Jespersen, <a name="OJGS" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#OJGS"><cite title="source">The Growth and Structure of the English Language</cite></a>, 4th ed.
