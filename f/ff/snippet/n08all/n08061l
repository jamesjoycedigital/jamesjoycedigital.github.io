The more ancient Latin version, then displaced, is termed the Old Italic or Ante-Hieronymian; and to this version, with occasional modifications, the Irish Church continued to adhere until the beginning of the ninth century. <small> Sir Edward Sullivan, <a name="BOK1" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#BOK1"><cite title="source">The Book of Kells</cite></a>, 2nd ed.
