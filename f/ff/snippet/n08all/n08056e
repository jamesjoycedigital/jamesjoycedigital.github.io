Finnan&apos;s / psalter (fingers light) / Cathach battle</blockquote> <dd class="well"> <blockquote class="sources">During a sojourn with St. Finnan, in Ulster, Columba borrowed his psalter, and copied it furtively in his church, with the aid of miraculous light in the night time. Finnan demanded the copy, but Columba refused to give it up, and the matter was submitted for judgement to Diarmaid, Monarch of Ireland, at Tara. Diarmaid, with the rough and ready justice of a new Solomon, decided that as to every cow belongs her calf, so to every book belongs its copy. A sanguinary battle was the result; but the copy remained with him who made it. It was known in later times as <i>Cathach</i>, from the Irish <i>cath</i>, a battle. <br>Joyce provides the extra information that the miraculous light derived from the Saint&apos;s luminous fingers. <small> Sir Edward Sullivan, <a name="BOK1" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#BOK1"><cite title="source">The Book of Kells</cite></a>, 2nd ed.
