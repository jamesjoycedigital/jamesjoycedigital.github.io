Finnian found out, and insisted that he should have the copy; Columba refused, and the matter was referred to the High King, who gave his decree: &ldquo;With every <i>bo</i> (cow) her <i>boneen</i> (little cow, calf), with every <i>leabhar</i> (book) its <i>leabhareen</i>.&rdquo; Columba thought the decision unjust, and made a war about it. <small> Stephen Gwynn, <a name="SGHI" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#SGHI"><cite title="source">The History of Ireland</cite></a> (1923) 34</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
