Leary was succeeded as High King by his brother Ailill, King of Connaught. But Lughaidh (Lewy), son of Leary, had succeeded his father as King of Meath, and he conspired with Murtough, King of Ailech. In 483 they defeated and slew Ailill, Lughaidh became High King, but with the compact that he should be succeeded by Murtough. <small> Stephen Gwynn, <a name="SGHI" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#SGHI"><cite title="source">The History of Ireland</cite></a> (1923) 18</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
