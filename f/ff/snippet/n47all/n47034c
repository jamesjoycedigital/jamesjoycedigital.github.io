Lord Chesterfield, who loved the classics, utilized the legend of the wonderful bird, whose name is supposed to have been derived from its bright colour, resembling the scarlet Phoenician dye. &hellip; The new phoenix rising from the flames surmounts Lord Chesterfield&apos;s fluted Corinthian column, which is thirty feet high and bears inscriptions stating that Lord Chesterfield erected the column and beautified the Park for the delight of the citizens. On the side next the Chief Secretary&apos;s Lodge there is a coat of arms with the motto <i>Exitus acta probat</i>, which may be translated The event tests what has been done. The Phoenix was once surrounded by a large circle called the Ring. Many uneducated citizens of Dublin call the Phoenix the &ldquo;<mark>Eagle Monument</mark>&rdquo;, and the mistake is very natural. <small> Dillon Cosgrave, <a name="DCND2" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#DCND2"><cite title="source">North Dublin</cite></a> (1909) 2 (The Phoenix Park and the Barony of the Tyrrells [Castleknock]) p.19</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
