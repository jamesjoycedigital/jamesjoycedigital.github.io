The reconstituting of the body of Osiris was commemorarted annually at Abydos by a solemn festival, during which, in a sort of miracle play, every step in the process was acted by priests and their assistants. The crowning scene was the erection of the backbone of Osiris and the placing of the head of the god upon it. <small> E.A.
