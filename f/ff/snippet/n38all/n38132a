In addition to Michael, it is only necessary to mention three of the sons: Mark <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> Patrick <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> and Joseph, who is mentioned by Thomas Moore as an ever-welcome guest at his mother&apos;s parties in Dublin.<font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> <mark>Joe Kelly</mark> was the inseparable companion of another young singer, <mark>Wesley Doyle</mark>, and their duets together were the delight of the gay, supper-giving society of the Irish capital during the last decade of the eighteenth century. <small> S.M.
