Very often he rendered Hawthorne&apos;s song, &ldquo;There was a Jolly Miller,&rdquo; from Bickerstaffe&apos;s <i>Love in a Village</i> (1762). The boy <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> was soon a pupil of Morland <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> He was succeeded by Italians&mdash;<mark>Passerini and Peretti</mark>&mdash;who taught young Kelly all the operatic airs of the day.
