When there is a funeral (which usually takes place in the afternoon), at 12 noon our sexton makes his way to the church tower, and goes through the process of striking a few strokes on all the bells in the tower, beginning on the treble to <mark>the tenor</mark>, on which latter he gives many strokes. When I asked what it meant he could give me no information, except that he was &ldquo;crossing the bells,&rdquo; a custom which appears to have been from time immemorial in this parish. Is the custom peculiar to Henstridge? <br>&mdash;The Rev. G.F.C.
