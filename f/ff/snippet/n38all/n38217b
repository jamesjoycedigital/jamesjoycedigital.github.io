It is this that first catches your attention. Caste people and their belongings are defiled by their touch. Even the lowest castes, who themselves pollute those of higher caste, are polluted by them. Outcastes are outside the pale of Hindu society, though in a sense annexed to it. They are regarded much as lepers were in Jewry, and the regulations respecting them are not very different from those concerning lepers in Lev. xiii. 45, 46. Like the lepers, they have to live outside towns and villages, and (in some parts of India) to announce their approach by a cry equivalent to &ldquo;Unclean! Unclean!&rdquo; and that although they may be, unlike lepers, altogether free from any contagious disease, or any moral taint. A healthy, clean-minded outcaste would have to keep the prescribed distance from an immoral and leprous Brahman, to prevent the latter form being polluted by him. <small> Rev W.S.
