In the &ldquo;Morning Post&rdquo; of January 22, 1778, there is the following paragraph: / &ldquo;The intended match between the Duke of Hamilton and Miss Burrell was first thought of at the happy meeting of the numerous nobility at the grand cricket match at the Oaks <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> last summer, where his Grace was observed to pay an uncommon degree of attention to this lady during the whole entertainment, but probably when she took the bat in hand, then her Diana-like air communicated an irresistible impression. She got more <i><mark>notches</mark></i> (runs) in the first and second innings than any lady in the game, and at last bowled the Duke himself fairly out. <small> <a name="MP17may30" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#MP17may30"><cite title="source">Morning Post</cite></a> (17 May 1930) 4/4</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
