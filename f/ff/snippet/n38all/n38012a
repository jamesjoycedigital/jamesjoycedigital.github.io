He had a strong vessel built, the <i>Fram</i>, which in September 1893 he ran into the pack-ice off Siberia in the hope that it would take him close to the Pole. When this failed, he attempted to reach the Pole on foot, but failed again. He did prove that the North Pole was not a land mass but a moving pack of ice. In 1922 he received the Nobel Prize for Peace for his work for refugees.</mm> </dd></dl>
