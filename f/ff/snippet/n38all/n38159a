The great confraternity of Amen-Ra, the &ldquo;King of the Gods,&rdquo; felt it to be necessary to emphasize the supremacy of their god, even in the Kingdom of Osiris, and they added many prayers, litanies and hymns to the Sun-god to every selection of the texts from the PER-T EM HRU that was copied on a roll of papyrus for funerary purposes. The greater number of the rolls of this period are short and contain only a few Chapters, <i>e.g.</i>, the Papyrus of <mark>the Royal Mother Netchemet</mark> (Brit. Mus. No. 10541) and the Papyrus of Queen Netchemet (Brit. Mus. No. 10478). <small> E.A.
