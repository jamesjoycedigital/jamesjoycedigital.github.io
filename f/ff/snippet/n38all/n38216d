If one of those grass-cutters had come nearer to the Hindu lady she would have been polluted. She would have had to return to the temple and to re-perform her somewhat complicated ceremonial ablutions, and possibly to undergo other purificatory ceremonies involving the payment of fees, before she could associate with her friends and relatives or eat her evening meal. And, if one of these outcaste purchasers had gone too near that shop, no Hindu could have patronized it until its polluted contents had been destroyed and it had been ceremonially cleansed, for which again the priest would have to be paid. <small> Rev W.S.
