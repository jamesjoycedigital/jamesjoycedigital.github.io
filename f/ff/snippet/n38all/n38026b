This and the previous unit may perhaps be related to the South African riots reported in many newspapers at this time. See for example <cite>Irish Times</cite> issue of 6 May 1930-10/2: <b>South African Riots.</b> [&hellip;] For some time past trouble has been brewing in South Africa among the native and coloured peoples, who regard with great suspicion the Government&apos;s policy in regard to the so-called &ldquo;black menace.&rdquo; The fear has been expressed by Nationalist members of Parliament that the white races in South Africa will eventually be swamped by the black man, and a policy is being evolved to avert this peril, which is regarded in government circles as a real one. Naturally this has aroused resentment among the black races, and the various organisations representing the black and coloured populations are making capital out of the situation. </mm> </dd></dl>
