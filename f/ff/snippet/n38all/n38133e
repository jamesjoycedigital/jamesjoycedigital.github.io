The younger Arne died in great destitution, for he was of a dreamy, shiftless nature. Kelly stated that &ldquo;Arne, not content with being one of the greatest musical geniuses the world ever produced, wished also to possess the philosopher&apos;s stone; and, fancying himself a great alchemist, actually took a house at <mark>Richmond, near Dublin</mark>, and, neglecting all his pupils, gave himself up to a scientific search for gold. <small> S.M.
