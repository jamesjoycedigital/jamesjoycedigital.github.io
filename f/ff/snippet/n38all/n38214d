The community which is moving to Christianity is the <mark>outcaste</mark> community &mdash; or, more strictly, certain outcaste communities in certain areas. And no doubt it is because they are primitive people, in whom the sense of individuality is still faint, that they thus act corporately in what seems to us so individual a thing as a change of religion. <small> Rev W.S. Hunt, <a name="WSHI" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#WSHI"><cite title="source">India's Outcastes: A New Era</cite></a> (1924) 4-5</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: The people who Hunt refers to as &lsquo;outcastes&rsquo; are more commonly known as Untouchables. This segment of society is, in fact, &lsquo;outside&rsquo; of India&apos;s traditional rigid caste system. The term &lsquo;Untouchables&rsquo; refers to the strict rules about cleanness and pollution which dictates that the touch or proximity of a lower caste person pollutes an upper caste person and the touch or proximity of an Untouchable pollutes any member of a caste. Untouchables traditionally hold the most undesirable and &lsquo;unclean&rsquo; jobs in Indian society &mdash; those deemed unacceptable for caste members because the jobs themselves are polluting.  <br>Raphael transcription: <a name="c08041d" href="c8all.htm#c08041d">VI.C.08:041(d)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
