Hindus believe in <mark>transmigration</mark>. If a man live a good life, according to Hindu standards, doing all that a man of his caste should do, he will in his next life be born a member of a higher caste than that to which he belongs; if he is a bad man, according to the same standards, he will be lower in caste than he is now, or an outcaste &mdash; perhaps even an animal or reptile. <small> Rev W.S.
