She also supplied Meccah, which suffered severely from want of water, with the chief requisite for public hygiene by connecting it, through levelled hills and hewn rocks, with the Ayn al-Mushash in the Arafat subrange. <small> Richard F.

The work of Zubaydah to provide Meccah with water was also familiar to Joyce from his reading the article <i>Mecca</i> in the <i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i>, 11th edition. Also cf. <cite>FW</cite> 135.27-28 where Joyce relates a similar feat and ascribes it to Finn MacCool, the &ldquo;upright one, vehicule of arcanisation in the field, lying chap, floodsupplier of celiculation through ebblanes&rdquo;. </mm> </dd></dl>
