It is certainly our duty to teach them to know the compassionate Saviour Who came that they might have life, and have it abundantly. &ldquo;Being moved with compassion, he stretched forth his hand and touched him, and saith unto him: &lsquo;<mark>Be thou made clean</mark>.&rsquo;&rdquo; What He did for the leper He can and will do &mdash; and is doing &mdash; for the untouchable. He touches him and he is made clean, not ceremonially, but actually. <small> Rev W.S.
