And this policy has been gloriously successful &mdash; witness the long roll of notable converts, <mark>confessors</mark> and martyrs, and the still longer roll of those unremembered save in Heaven. The hope with which missionary enterprises have been begun has no doubt been that converts might be many, but as individuals, or at most households, one here and another there, not in groups or masses. The latter, however, has sometimes happened. <small> Rev W.S.
