When the tribal system began to be broken up by conquest and <mark>by the rise of towns</mark> and of territorial government, the use of a common surname furnished a new bond for keeping up a connection between kindred. <small> &ldquo;CLANS&rdquo; <a name="EBCL" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#EBCL"><cite title="source">Encyclopaedia Britannica</cite></a>, 11th edit.
