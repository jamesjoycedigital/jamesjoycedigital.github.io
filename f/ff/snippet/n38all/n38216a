A dozen of them, some standing and some squatting, are in the middle of the road facing a very humble shop <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> The shopkeeper lolls against the door-post, preparing a &ldquo;chew&rdquo; of betel and chatting with two or three friends. His wife is bathing her lamenting and kicking baby in an <mark>areca-palm spathe</mark> beside the well; her little daughter is a washing a cooking pot. <small> Rev W.S. Hunt, <a name="WSHI" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#WSHI"><cite title="source">India's Outcastes: A New Era</cite></a> (1924) 14-15</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: Areca: Name of the tree and fruit of a genus of palms, of which one species (A. Catechu) bears nuts of the size of a nutmeg, which many inhabitants of South-East Asia roll up with a little lime in the leaves of the betel, and chew, thereby tingeing their teeth and saliva red (OED). Spathe: A large bract or sheathing-leaf enveloping the inflorescence (usually a spadix) of certain plants, as arums, palms, etc., in such a way as completely to enclose it before expansion (OED).)  <br>Raphael transcription: <a name="c08042c" href="c8all.htm#c08042c">VI.C.08:042(c)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
