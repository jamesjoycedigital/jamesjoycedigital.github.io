The report of the last Indian <mark>census</mark>, taken in 1921, showed that &ldquo;there are now two and a half times as many Christians <font color="green">[in India]</font> as there were in 1881,&rdquo; and gave the following remarkable percentages of increase during those forty years, namely, in the Punjab 1134.3; in Baroda 862.5; in the Central Provinces 489.9; in the United Provinces 326.2; in Haidarabad 360.2; and in Travancore 135.3. The greatest increase of all was in Assam, where there were only 7000 Christians in 1881 and are now 132,000, a growth of 1762.5 per cent. It is mainly to mass movements that these increases have been due. <small> Rev W.S.
