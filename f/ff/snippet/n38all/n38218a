Not only do people of different castes, if they are orthodox, not feed together or intermarry, but people of different <mark>sub-castes</mark> within the same caste as a rule do not. Pollution would occur if they did. Food is polluted if touched by a person of lower caste. The lower a man&apos;s caste the more polluting he is, and the higher he is the more sensitive he is to pollution. A Brahman in Malabar is polluted if an outcaste comes within ninety paces of him, but a man a litter lower is not polluted if the outcaste keeps fifty paces away. <small> Rev W.S.
