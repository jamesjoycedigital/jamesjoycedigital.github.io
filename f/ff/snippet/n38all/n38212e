The <mark>poor have had the Gospel preached to them</mark>, and are now &ldquo;besieging&rdquo; the Kingdom. While Christ is known and admired, reverenced and loved by many among India&apos;s intelligentsia, it is still the &ldquo;babes&rdquo; who are flocking into His Church. This book is an attempt to sketch the beginning of the reign of God in these Indian souls. <small> Rev W.S.
