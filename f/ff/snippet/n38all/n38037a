The shape is not usual, and just as <mark>the cradle shape for mince pies</mark> is the oldest, and which we still continue to use here, <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> Banbury, Eccles, <mark>Penrith Fair, Chorley, also Coventry God-cakes</mark> are all Festival Cakes without a doubt; Cumberland Cake, too. The filling of Banbury and Eccles cakes resembles a particularly delicious mincemeat. Soul-cakes, although eaten for the living, are intended for the hungry dead <mark>on the Eve of All Souls,</mark> <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> Every door is left open so that the dead may enter, and it is something unforgettable to be in the midst of ceremonies of age-old interest on the night of <mark>Black Vespers</mark>. In our own country &ldquo;soul cakes&rdquo; were distributed to the poor on All Souls&apos; Day; John Aubrey records this, describing them as &ldquo;like <mark>Shew-bread</mark> in the Old Bibles,&rdquo; and quotes the verse: / &ldquo;A soul cake, a soul cake, / Have mercy on all Christen soules for a soule cake.&rdquo; There is much I could add, but fear to take too much space, but so-called <mark>Thar-cake (a kind of parkin)</mark> eaten in the North of England on the <mark>Fifth of November</mark> appears as <mark>&ldquo;therf-cake</mark>&rdquo; in Piers Plowman, <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> <small> <a name="MP24may30" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#MP24may30"><cite title="source">Morning Post</cite></a> (24 May 1930) 6/4</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
