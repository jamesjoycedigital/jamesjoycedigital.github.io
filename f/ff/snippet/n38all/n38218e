They are but working out their karma, and (from that point of view) are hardly to be pitied. How they pollute by proximity is sometimes thus explained. Every one has an <i><mark>aura</mark></i>, a kind of invisible, ethereal sheath around and extending beyond the body, possessing the same qualities as himself. The aura of an unclean outcaste is unclean, and therefore defiles the pure aura of a holy man if it touches or mingles with it. <small> Rev W.S.
