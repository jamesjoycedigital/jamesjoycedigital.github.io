Set marked this and became very jealous of his brother, and wished to slay him so that he might seize his throne and take possession of Isis, whose reputation as a devoted and loving wife and able manager filled the country. By some means or other Set did contrive to kill Osiris: according to one story he killed him by the side of a canal at Netat <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> near Abydos, and according to another he caused him to be drowned. Isis, accompanied by her sister Nephthys, rescued his body, and with the help of Anp, a son of Ra the Sun-god, embalmed it.
