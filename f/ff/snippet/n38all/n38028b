It flows in a narrow and tortuous course, through rocks and boulders, forming many a picturesque cascade and pool. Leaving the foot of St. Mary&apos;s Cliff, where grows the <mark>giant ivy</mark>, celebrated in the Ossianic Poems before mentioned, it flows under many a small rowan tree, no doubt lineal descendants of that which, in Oisin&apos;s time, bore berries larger than St. Patrick&apos;s loaves. Lower down the Glenasmole Valley, the Dodder receives little streamlets from Glasmullan, and one from the Holy Well of Killsantan, another at Ballymore Finn, and another at Allagour.&rsquo; </mm> </dd></dl>
