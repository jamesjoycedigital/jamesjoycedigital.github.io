When the hour of midnight struck, these &ldquo;husband-diviners,&rdquo; as one may call them, were obliged <mark>to walk to bed backwards</mark>, maintaining (if they were able!) a discreet silence the while. If this was properly carried out a vision of the future husband was vouchsafed to them. <small> <a name="MP28may30" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#MP28may30"><cite title="source">Morning Post</cite></a> (28 May 1930) 6/4</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: See 079(b)</mm> </dd></dl>
