Sir.&mdash;This specimen of the language of &ldquo;our youngers,&rdquo; as quoted in yesterday&apos;s &ldquo;Way of the World,&rdquo; is, of course, too utterly typical of their distorted vocabulary. / I would, however, be grossly unfair to blame them. Peter Simple admits that we ourselves did similar violence to our &ldquo;glorious heritage,&rdquo; but are not many of us still waging war on our mother-tongue? / Until we have eliminated such monstrosities as &ldquo;rather priceless,&rdquo; &ldquo;more perfect,&rdquo; &ldquo;somewhat unique&rdquo; and other assaults on the superlative we shall surely expose ourselves to a retort that the pot is even &ldquo;more utterly black&rdquo; than the kettle! / W.
