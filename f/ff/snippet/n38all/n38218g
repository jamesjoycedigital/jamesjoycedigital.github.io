The sense of their inferiority, and the needs of the community, account for their enslavement. The determination to keep their race pure and dominant led the Hindu lawgivers, typified by Manu (the code called by his name may have been contemporary with that of Moses), to prevent for all time any kind of social intercourse between their people and people of other races, including outcastes &mdash; the aliens with whom they were in actual contact. This the caste system has achieved. To clinch the matter, the keeping of caste became for Hindus their &ldquo;practical&rdquo; religion (<i>dharma</i>), and contravention of it the sin entailing the heaviest retribution. <small> Rev W.S.
