The most complete form of it is given in the Papyrus of Ani, and may be thus described: At one end of the Hall of Maati Osiris is seated on a throne within a shrine made in the form of a funerary coffer; behind him stand Isis and Nephthys. Along one side of the Hall are seated the gods Harmachis, Tem, Shu, Tefnut, Geb, Nut, Isis and Nephthys, Horus, Hathor, Hu and Saa, who are to serve as the divine jury; these formed the &ldquo;Great Company of the Gods&rdquo; of Anu (Heliopolis). By these stands the Great Balance, and on its pillar sits <mark>the dog-headed ape Astes, or Astenu</mark>, the associate of Thoth. <small> E.A.
