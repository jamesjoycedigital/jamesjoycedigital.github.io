They were made in honour of the Queen of Heaven in her aspect as Diana, and in a round shape, marked with a cross, or with horns. These were called <i>Bouns</i>, so we have not strayed far away from their ancient name. <br>Gwendolen Paget. / 4, St. George&apos;s-terrace, N.W.1. <small> <a name="MP28may30" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#MP28may30"><cite title="source">Morning Post</cite></a> (28 May 1930) 6/4</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
