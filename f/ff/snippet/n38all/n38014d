In 1910 he sailed in the <i>Fram</i> to discover the North Pole, but hearing that the American explorer Robert E. Peary had already reached it, he decided instead to race Scott to the South Pole. In December 1911 he reached the Antarctic one month ahead of Scott. Joyce probably noted his name in an obituary notice for Nansen.</mm> </dd></dl>
