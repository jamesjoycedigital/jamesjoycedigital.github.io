I have long been seeking him; now I have found Him.&rdquo; The man&apos;s name was Venkayya. He was an outcaste belonging to the section called <mark>Malas</mark>. A few months later the missionary baptized him and his family in their village of Raghavapuram. Venkayya became as earnest a seeker after souls as he had been after God. He spoke of Christ to outcastes wherever he went, while the mission workers followed up these openings and were led on from them to others. <small> Rev W.S.
