Here Ossian, his son, after living in the fairy Land of the Young (<i>Tir na n&Oacute;g</i>) for a period of three hundred years, fell from his horse, touched the ground and, as forewarned, hence became greatly aged. It was in this condition that he met St Patrick and the dialogue between them was a dialogue of Christian with pagan Ireland.</mm> </dd></dl>
