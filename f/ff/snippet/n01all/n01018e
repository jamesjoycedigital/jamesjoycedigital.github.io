The trouble arose over &ldquo;the lady Pantasilea who bore me that false and burdensome love&rdquo;; but yet Benvenuto disliked that Luigi should partake of her favors. This he told him in a manner that makes one think of the fire and cunning of Iago&mdash;and in truth Cellini often reminds one of that honest person, showing how well Shakespeare knew his Italian. Here was the way of it. <p>&ldquo;As soon as <mark>the brazen-faced whore</mark> (just a page before she had been &lsquo;<mark>the lady</mark> Pantasilea&rsquo;!) set eyes on the fine youth, she had her designs on him. Seeing this, as soon as our supper was over, I called Luigi aside and told him that for the sake of the kindness he owned I had done him, he must never seek the company of that prostitute. His reply was, &lsquo;Alas, my friend Benvenuto, do you take me, then, for a madman?&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;Not for a madman but for a young man,&rsquo; I answered; &lsquo;and I swear to you I have no thought of her at all, but I should be very sorry if through her you broke your neck.&rsquo; Whereupon he swore and called to God to witness that <font color="green">[307]</font> if ever he spoke to her, he might break his neck upon the spot.&rdquo;</p> <small> Michael Monahan, <a name="MMAL" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#MMAL"><cite title="source">Adventures in Life and Letters</cite></a> (1912) 307 [Cellini]</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c05103f" href="c05all.htm#c05103f">VI.C.05:103(f)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
