There are also cases where game such as pheasants or partridges are scarce, and where rabbits and hares are the only means of securing a good <mark>mixed bag</mark>. This sort of shooting is not to be despised, for it offers very good sport. Often on an estate where there are plenty of pheasants there cannot always be flushed, and it is then that a good show of rabbit makes up for the deficiency. <small> <a name="IT19dec22" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#IT19dec22"><cite title="source">Irish Times</cite></a> (19 December 1922) 6/6</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
