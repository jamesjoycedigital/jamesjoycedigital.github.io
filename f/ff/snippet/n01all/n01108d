With this instrument extraordinary things are being done. By means of the <mark>photographs that it takes of</mark> the oscillations produced in the air by <mark>sounds</mark> it is possible to estimate the degree of noise and set up a standard that is useful in many ways. When there is absolute silence the film inside registers a straight line; and a noise by a pronounced jagged line. <small> <a name="ES5jan23" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#ES5jan23"><cite title="source">Evening Standard</cite></a> (5 January 1923) 7/1</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c05161k" href="c05all.htm#c05161k">VI.C.05:161(k)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
