Everything felt happy-go-lucky and informal, there was no particular atmosphere. Nobody put on any airs, because nobody in the Nardini took any notice if they did. The little ducal dog yapped, the ducal son shouted, the waiter dropped half a dozen spoons, the old women knitted during the waits, and <mark>all went off so badly</mark> that it was quite pleasant. Yes, Aaron preferred it to Bertolini&apos;s, which was trying to be efficient and correct: though not making any strenuous effort. Still, Bertolini&apos;s was much more up to the scratch, there was the tension of proper standards. Whereas here at Nardini&apos;s, nothing mattered very much. <small> D. H.
