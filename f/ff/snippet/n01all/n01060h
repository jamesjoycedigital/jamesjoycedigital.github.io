Again supposing I am the owner of extensive grounds and <mark>lay a trap therein for the purpose of catching ground vermin</mark>. If a tramp trespasses on my ground and gets hurt, say, by his foot being caught in the trap, and the latter is within 25 yards of the road or highway, an action would lie against me. But if the trap was more than 25 yards away from the road I should not be liable. <small> <a name="DM6dec22" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#DM6dec22"><cite title="source">Daily Mail</cite></a> (6 December 1922) 6/5</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c05130b" href="c05all.htm#c05130b">VI.C.05:130(b)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
