But the laws of the natural world are revealed to us by the discoveries of science; while the laws of the spiritual world are revealed to us through the authority of spiritual institutions, inspired witnesses, or divinely guided institutions. And the two regions of knowledge lie side by side, contiguous but not connected, like empires of different race and language, <mark>which own no common jurisdiction nor hold any intercourse</mark> with each other, except along a disputed and wavering frontier where no superior power exists to settle their quarrels or determine their respective limits. <small> A.
