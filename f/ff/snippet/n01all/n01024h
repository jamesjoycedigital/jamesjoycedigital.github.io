The farmer, previous to the famine, was not proprietor of his bit of land; he was a <mark>cottier</mark>, at a nominal rent, puffed up by competition to a height far above what could, even under the most favourable circumstances, be paid, and the effect of which was that whether he gained much or little, beyond the daily potatoes of which his family could not be deprived, all was swept off for arrears of rent. Alone of all working people, the Irish cottier neither gained anything by industry and frugality, nor lost anything by idleness and reckless multiplication. <small> J. S. Mill, <a name="JSME" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#JSME"><cite title="source">England and Ireland</cite></a>, (1869) 40</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: An historical term used in 19C Ireland for a peasant who rents land under the cottier tenure system. This was defined by an Act of Parliament of 1860 as tenancy of a cottage and not more than half an acre of land, at a rent not exceeding &pound;5 a year.  <br>Raphael transcription: <a name="c05108d" href="c05all.htm#c05108d">VI.C.05:108(d)</a></mm></dd> </dd></dl>
