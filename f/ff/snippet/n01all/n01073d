[&hellip;] and to-day delegations [&hellip;] will meet at the Guildhall to celebrate the eighth birthday of this wonderful fellowship. The Prince of Wales, who is patron of &ldquo;Toc H,&rdquo; will attend the festival, and the event of the evening will be the lighting by his Royal Highness of the <mark>lamps of maintenance</mark> which are to be presented to delegates from fifty branches. The lamp of maintenance is a replica of the old Christian catacomb lamp, except that the handle has been designed in the form of a cross to represent part of the arms of Ypres. It is a symbol of the recognized establishment of a branch of &ldquo;Toc H&rdquo; and will be displayed burning on ceremonial occasions.&rdquo;  <br>Note: See also EB 14 Vol. 22, p.264: &lsquo;Toc H&rsquo;: Each branch has Lamp of Maintenance [&hellip;] relighted in rededication to the task [&hellip;] [of] building &ldquo;a New Jerusalem.&rdquo; </mm> </mm></dd></dl>
