By AN ANTIQUARY]</font> The oldest manufactured articles in the world are probably some chipped stones found on the Kentish Weald. <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> Knives, axes, hammers, scrapers, spearheads, arrowheads, even awls for piercing skin and roughly notched saws for cutting bone were made of flint or chert or obsidian&mdash;any stone that would chip to a cutting edge hard enough to stand wear. <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> But it is a curious and significant thing that these eoliths all &ldquo;<mark>come to the hand</mark>,&rdquo; as a workman would say. When one is held in the hand so that it <mark>fits</mark> most comfortably to the grasp of palm and fingers, the chipped edge will be found in the right place for striking a blow with the maximum effect, and this is hardly likely to be accidental. <small> <a name="DM2jan23" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#DM2jan23"><cite title="source">Daily Mail</cite></a> (2 January 1923) 6/5</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c05150b" href="c05all.htm#c05150b">VI.C.05:150(b)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
