Once again, the current British stamps were used until the first Irish definitive stamps could be produced (see next page). The 2d. and 3d. stamps were issued on January 6, 1923, the 4d. on January 16, 1923, and all the other values were issued on December 6, 1922. The 2&frac12;d. to 1 shilling values can only come from one printing, by Alex Thom and Co. Ltd in December 1922/January 1923, whilst the &frac12;d., 1d., 1&frac12;d. and 2d. values were also produced by Harrison and Sons, Ltd, in England in coil form. The &ldquo;Seahorse&rdquo; higher value stamps provide a more complicated area for the philatelist to study. Because the Free State did not produce stamps of its own designs for values of 2 shillings and sixpence to ten shillings until 1937, the overprinted versions remained in use until then, being subject to the variations in type of the basic British stamps (eg, the &ldquo;re-engraved&rdquo; designs of the 1935 issue), and to wear of the overprinting type. <br>The first truly Irish stamp went on sale on 6 December 1922, the 2d. Map of Ireland. It was chosen following a design competition organized by the Provisional Government. J. Ingram submitted the winning entry. The other design of these early issues included &ldquo;The Sword of Light&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Arms of the Four Provinces of Ireland&rdquo;, and the &ldquo;Cross of Cong&rdquo; &hellip; The dies for these stamps were engraved at the Royal Mint in London and a specially watermarked paper was made with an overall pattern of monogram &ldquo;SE&rdquo; [Saorstat &Eacute;ireann] that was used for all Irish stamps until the introduction of the new Irish Constitution in 1937, after which the monogram in the watermark was changed to &ldquo;e&rdquo; (&Eacute;ire). After 1971, all Irish stamps have been printed on non-watermarked paper An original Irish 2d. stamp was issued earlier in 1922 by the Irish Republicans during the Civil War: &ldquo;During the Civil War the I R A prepared three denominations of postage stamps for their own postal service, a 1d. brown, a 2d. green, and a 6d. blue. They appear to have been produced in July 1922, but all except a small quantity (about 250 of each value) were destroyed when the National Army captured Cork in August. These stamps are known with perforation 11 on wove paper; imperforate on wove paper (probably proofs), and the 6d. is known with perforation 11 on laid paper. All versions are rather valuable &hellip; [Effects of the Partition of Ireland on the postal service (1920-1922)] </mm> </dd></dl>
