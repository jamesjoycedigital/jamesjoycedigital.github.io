By BERYL SAGE.]</font> &ldquo;Where can I safely carry money?&rdquo; is a problem which women have vainly endeavoured to solve. For the most part they place faith in the <mark>handbag</mark>, though every day yields a harvest of bags garnered by professional thieves. <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> There are the hair, the crown of the <mark>hat</mark>, the shoes and gloves. <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> The ancient method of tying up money in the corner of a <mark>handkerchief</mark> still has its adherents, though where to carry the handkerchief constitutes a problem in itself. The equally old expedient of a <mark>pocket in the petticoat</mark> has also its defenders, though this device is not at all safe. <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> The <mark>corsage</mark> is one of the most ancient receptacles for ready cash and small articles of jewellery <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> But all these devices aim only at safeguarding money. Convenience is not considered. Yet convenience is a factor of the problem. If the handbag, with its manifest disadvantages, is taboo where shall a <mark>woman carry her money</mark>? <small> <a name="DM28dec22" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#DM28dec22"><cite title="source">Daily Mail</cite></a> (28 December 1922) 6/5</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c05145l" href="c05all.htm#c05145l">VI.C.05:145(l)</a></mm></dd> </dd></dl>
