He had indeed, just previous to the casting of the Perseus, met with his enemy and rival Bandinello in a desolate region near Florence, and first thought to &ldquo;<mark>yerk him here under the ribs,</mark>&rdquo; like Iago on a somewhat like occasion. Bandinello, in truth, expected no less and became pale as death, shaking from head to foot. His fear was vain: the admirable Benvenuto&apos;s spirit had declined, and he contented him self with thanking God who by His own strength had kept him from such a deed of violence! <small> Michael Monahan, <a name="MMAL" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#MMAL"><cite title="source">Adventures in Life and Letters</cite></a> (1912) 315 [Cellini]</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: Shakespeare, <cite>Othello</cite> i. ii. 5: Nine, or ten times I had thought t&apos;haue yerk&apos;d him here vnder the Ribbes. <br>Raphael transcription: <a name="c05103j" href="c05all.htm#c05103j">VI.C.05:103(j)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
