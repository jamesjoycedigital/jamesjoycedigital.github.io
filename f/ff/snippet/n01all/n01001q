The letter was a reader&apos;s response to an article in the Irish Times of 17 October 1922 entitled <i>Beaveritis</i> which attacked the current brief vogue for the game of Beaver. This was played by two people using a scoring system borrowed from tennis. The player scored who first cried &lsquo;Beaver&rsquo; as, and if, a bearded person appeared. Several other references to the term appear in the IT around this period. See OED &lsquo;Beaver&rsquo; sb, 4, in which all citations that give the game as current are dated 1922. [This same year also saw the publication of John Kettlewell&apos;s <cite>Beaver</cite> (London: Werner Laurie)&mdash;a study of the subject&mdash;and Aldous Huxley&apos;s <cite>Antic Hay</cite> (see Chapter 4 of the latter for opportunistic musings on the subject) followed in 1923.  <br>Raphael transcription: <a name="c05092n" href="c05all.htm#c05092n">VI.C.05:092(n)</a></mm></dd> </dd></dl>
