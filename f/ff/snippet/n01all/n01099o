Nearby are Bride Lane and Bridewell Lane. The name Bridewell came from a well near the Fleet (New Bridge Street), dedicated to St Bride, and was attached to a house built by Henry VIII. The Bridewell was a palace presented by Edward VI to the City authorities and afterwards used as a prison.  <br>Raphael transcription: <a name="c05156g" href="c05all.htm#c05156g">VI.C.05:156(g)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
