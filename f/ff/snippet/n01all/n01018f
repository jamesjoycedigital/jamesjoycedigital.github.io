The guardsman had plainly acted in self-defence, and the quarrel was one which the fiery Cecchino had brought on himself. Nevertheless, the filial Benvenuto pined <mark>to avenge his brother</mark> and became so gloomy from brooding over this thought of blood that Pope Clement (for whom he was doing some artistic work at the time and who perhaps feared that it might suffer) rebuked him, saying: &ldquo;Oh, Benvenuto, I did not know you were demented. Haven&apos;t you learnt before now that for death there is no remedy? You are doing your best to follow your brother.&rdquo; <small> Michael Monahan, <a name="MMAL" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#MMAL"><cite title="source">Adventures in Life and Letters</cite></a> (1912) 309 [Cellini]</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c05103g" href="c05all.htm#c05103g">VI.C.05:103(g)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
