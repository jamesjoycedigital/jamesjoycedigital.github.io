Otherwise, if the big winds of liberty did not uproot the infant <mark>Bramley seedlings and immature bugarreaus</mark> in their adolescence, the sacred privileges of a vested interest would confine their mature utility exclusively to the provision of golf-club heads and imitation blackthorn walking-sticks. Let Dr. Gogarty plant the embankments of our State-owned railways with weeping elders and sad cypress, and none will say him nay.&mdash;Yours, etc., &ldquo;Woodsman.&rdquo;</p> <small> <a name="IT31oct22" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#IT31oct22"><cite title="source">Irish Times</cite></a> (31 October 1922) 3/5</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: See also <a name="n01017f" href="n01all.htm#n01017f">N01 (VI.B.10):017(f)</a> below.  <br>Raphael transcription: <a name="c05100e" href="c05all.htm#c05100e">VI.C.05:100(e)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
