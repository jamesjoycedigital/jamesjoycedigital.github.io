But he didn&apos;t come in those long novels with the handcuffs strung around the cover. His was a smaller book with a colored picture on the outside showing <mark>Jonathan Wilde</mark> in a red coat and a cocked hat and a ferocious sneer, looking through the bars of a cell at Jack Sheppard. Oh, how I hated that Jonathan Wilde, and how I loved Blueskin for cutting his throat, though he didn&apos;t make a perfect job of it! <small> Michael Monahan, <a name="MMAL" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#MMAL"><cite title="source">Adventures in Life and Letters</cite></a> (1912) 93 [Knights of the Road]</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: Jack Sheppard (1702-24), romanticised highwayman hanged at Tyburn; the subject of ballads and ballads and a tract by Defoe.
