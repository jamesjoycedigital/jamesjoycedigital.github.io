Say, there wasn&apos;t her match in England for beauty and speed. Black every inch of her and <mark>fleet as the wind</mark>. When the coachies caught sight of her, they just hollered, &ldquo;O Lord! It&apos;s Dick Turpin and his Bonny Black Bess,&rdquo; and told everybody they&apos;d better fork over quiet and peaceful. But, say, did you ever hear of anything like that ride <mark>to York&mdash;one hundred and fifty miles</mark>, without stopping once, to save her master and then dropped dead as he cleared hisself from the stirrups. There was a picture in my book showing the gallant steed stretched lifeless in the road, with Dick Turpin bending sorrowful-like over her. Oh, my Bonny Black Bess! (I have lived to see many a famous picture by some of the world&apos;s great artists, but none that pierced my heart with such sorrow as that old wood-cut in the story of Dick Turpin.) <small> Michael Monahan, <a name="MMAL" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#MMAL"><cite title="source">Adventures in Life and Letters</cite></a> (1912) 92-93 [Knights of the Road]</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: Richard Turpin (1706-39), short-lived highwayman, hanged at York (not Tyburn).
