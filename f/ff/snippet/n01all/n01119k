As it is half-past nine, John Hind has stopped ploughing-in his potatoes, to have his lunch of bread, fat bacon, and beer; and his son stands talking to him whilst he eats. The two horses are grazing by the side of the dyke, steam rising from their backs, and the sun glints on the share of the <mark>hilling-plough</mark>, which divides each ridge and covers up the potatoes. One-half of the field is finished, whilst the <mark>seed potatoes</mark> lie uncovered in the furrows of the other half, awaiting their turn. <small> Bernard Gilbert, <a name="BGLH" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#BGLH"><cite title="source">King Lear at Hordle</cite></a>, (1922) 82 [the introduction to <i>A Tanvats Nietzsche</i>]</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c05168j" href="c05all.htm#c05168j">VI.C.05:168(j)</a>, <a name="c05168k" href="c05all.htm#c05168k">VI.C.05:168(k)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
