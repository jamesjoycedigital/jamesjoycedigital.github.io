Struthio, through its Greek form, derives from the word meaning a bird, and this in turn is identical in root to the Gothic <i>sparwa</i>, whence the modern word &lsquo;sparrow&rsquo;. In Classical Greek the ostrich was called &lsquo;struthiocamel&rsquo;, which in its English form was so used by Massinger.  <br>Raphael transcription: <a name="c05138f" href="c05all.htm#c05138f">VI.C.05:138(f)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
