In the preface to <i>Pierre et Jean</i>, already cited, he says: &ldquo;After so many masters of nature so varied, of genius so manifold, what remains to do, which has not been done, what remains to say, which has not been said? Who can boast, among us, of having written a page, a phrase, which is not already, almost the same, to be found elsewhere?&rdquo; Now the man who seeks only to amuse his public, continues Maupassant, by means already known and familiar, writes with confidence, his work being intended for the ignorant and idle crowd. But&mdash;and here is a truth, oh ye professors of literature!&mdash;those upon whom weigh all the past cycles of literature, those whom nothing satisfies, whom everything disgusts, because they dream better, to whom everything seems already deflowered, whose work gives them always the impression of a labor useless and common&mdash;<i>they</i> arrive at length to judge the literary art as a thing unseizable and mysterious, which even the greatest masters have scarcely unveiled. What remains then, he asks, for us who are simply conscientious and <mark>persevering</mark> workers? Why, we can maintain our struggle against invincible discouragement only by continuous effort par la <i>continuit&eacute; de l&apos;effort</i>. <small> Michael Monahan, <a name="MMAL" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#MMAL"><cite title="source">Adventures in Life and Letters</cite></a> (1912) 80 [Guy de Maupassant]</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: Possibly a misreading questioned by Joyce when being read to.</mm> </dd></dl>
