To the editor of the Irish Times. As an Englishman resident in Ireland for a great many years I have hitherto enjoyed the privilege of a Parliamentary and municipal vote; but it appears that I am now about to be penalised on account of my nationality. Recently I received a form from the registration officer of my district, which in due course I returned filled in. Question 2 asked &ldquo;nationality of occupier and domicile.&rdquo; This I filled in as &ldquo;British,&rdquo; stating the number of years during which I have been resident. A few days ago I received the enclosed circular letter, from which you will observe that I am to be disfranchised unless I sign as accepting citizenship of the Free State. <small> <a name="IT11nov22" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#IT11nov22"><cite title="source">Irish Times</cite></a> (11 November 1922) 8/5</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c05109k" href="c05all.htm#c05109k">VI.C.05:109(k)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
