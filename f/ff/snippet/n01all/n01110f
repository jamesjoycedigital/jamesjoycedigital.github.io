This last, melted down and blended with an equal quantity of almond oil, keeps wrinkles at bay, and makes the skin silken smooth. After washing, a little of the cream is massaged or patted very gently into the skin, allowed to remain on for ten minutes or so, and then wiped off with a soft towel. Such &ldquo;old women&apos;s&rdquo; lotions as <mark>elder flower-water</mark> and <mark>&ldquo;cucumber milk&rdquo;</mark> are, in grandma&apos;s opinion, far more beneficial to the complexion than modern cosmetics, and, if her white-skinned, gentle face is the result of their use, we would do well to renounce our paint-pots and powders and become old-fashioned and beautiful. <small> <a name="IT16jan23" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#IT16jan23"><cite title="source">Irish Times</cite></a> (16 January 1923) 2/3</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c05163a" href="c05all.htm#c05163a">VI.C.05:163(a)</a>, <a name="c05163b" href="c05all.htm#c05163b">VI.C.05:163(b)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
