Believing his own life to be threatened, the latter with admirable <mark>forehandedness</mark> attacked Pompeo in the midst of a band of friends. &ldquo;But with a little keen-edged dagger (he was perhaps laudably partial to the national weapon) &ldquo;I forced their ranks and had my hands upon his breast so quickly and with such coolness that not one of them could hinder me. I was aiming at his face, but in his terror he turned his head, so that I plunged the poniard in just below the ear. It only needed two strokes, for at the second he fell dead, which had not been at all my intention. But as the saying is, &lsquo;There is no bargaining about blows.&rsquo;&rdquo; <small> Michael Monahan, <a name="MMAL" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#MMAL"><cite title="source">Adventures in Life and Letters</cite></a> (1912) 311 [Cellini]</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c05103i" href="c05all.htm#c05103i">VI.C.05:103(i)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
