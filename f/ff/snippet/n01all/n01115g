Husband Leaves Wife After Ceremony]</font> From the correspondence, which was referred to, it appeared that, in reply to a letter from the petitioner, stating that she was prepared to go out to him in India as as soon as he let her know that he would give her a home, the respondent wrote to her from Calcutta, on 17th November, 1921, stating that he was not in a position to maintain her, and that their marriage was a rash act. He had no intention, he added, of ever living with her, and should probably stay in India <mark>for at least another five or six years</mark> before going home. <small> <a name="IT20jan23" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#IT20jan23"><cite title="source">Irish Times</cite></a> (20 January 1923) ?5/5</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c05166c" href="c05all.htm#c05166c">VI.C.05:166(c)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
