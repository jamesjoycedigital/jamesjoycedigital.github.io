These insignia of the <font color="green">[87]</font> Road and the Police waking in my heart an exquisite thrill of boyhood (through them I first felt the power of Art), would alone have certified to me the Adventures of <mark>Claude Duval</mark>, with the accompanying and more or less related histories of Dick Turpin, <mark>Tom King</mark>, and <mark>Sixteen-String Jack</mark>. The sight of Aladdin&apos;s Lamp or the Slaves of the Ring could not have moved me more&mdash;nay, not so much, for Hounslow Heath laid a stronger toil upon my young fancy than any scene of Arabian enchantment: I was, and ever have remained, a child of the Occident. <small> Michael Monahan, <a name="MMAL" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#MMAL"><cite title="source">Adventures in Life and Letters</cite></a> (1912) 87-88 [Knights of the Road]</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: Claude Duval (1643-70) was a notorious highwayman born in Normandy but operated in England. He was eventually captured and executed. &lsquo;Sixteen-string Jack&rsquo; was the <i>nom-de-guerre</i> of John Rann, Esq., highwayman, hanged in 1774. His nickname derives from his fashionable dress, which included a bunch of sixteen strings at the knees of his breeches. Tom King acted as a partner to the notorious Dick Turpin.  <br>Raphael transcription: <a name="c05105d" href="c05all.htm#c05105d">VI.C.05:105(d)</a>, <a name="c05105e" href="c05all.htm#c05105e">VI.C.05:105(e)</a>, <a name="c05105f" href="c05all.htm#c05105f">VI.C.05:105(f)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
