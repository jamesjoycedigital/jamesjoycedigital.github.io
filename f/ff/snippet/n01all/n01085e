Even in the little out of the way town, the general storekeeper will be ready to supply your demand for a &ldquo;Handy Grip&rdquo;. / Interested in mechanics, you will appreciate this ingenious device. The base of the soap itself is <mark>threaded</mark>. It thus screws into the metal &ldquo;Handy Grip&rdquo;. When the soap finally wears down you <mark>unscrew the stub</mark>, and screw in a &ldquo;Refill&rdquo; &mdash; like putting a new electric bulb in a socket. <br>The ad appeared variously, e.g. in the <i>Strand Magazine</i> issue of March 1922.  <br>Raphael transcription: <a name="c05147e" href="c05all.htm#c05147e">VI.C.05:147(e)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
