The two civilians turned down Arran street, and witness was too late to turn his car after them. Consequently, he jumped out and, drawing his revolver, called on them to halt. <p>The civilians took no notice, but continued running. Witness fired one round from his revolver. Simultaneously, the smaller of the two civilians turned into a side street on the left of Arran street. The taller man went down the next street to the left &mdash; <mark>a matter of fifteen yards</mark>. Witness saw that further pursuit was useless, &ldquo;and left it at that&rdquo;.</p> <small> <a name="IT9dec22" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#IT9dec22"><cite title="source">Irish Times</cite></a> (9 December 1922) 7/4</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
