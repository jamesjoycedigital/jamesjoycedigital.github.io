Nothing less than a miracle happened to me at that moment in the grimey old book shop, under the dealer&apos;s careless yet observant eye. From an <mark>oldster</mark> of some forty odd I became in a flash a boy of eleven, and stood there tingling and trembling at sight of what had been my earliest introduction to Romance. <p>What was the marvel? Only a parcel of dusty, shelf-worn paper novels, long out of print, so far as I know, and certainly never looked on by these eyes of mine since the gates of boyhood closed behind me.</p> <small> Michael Monahan, <a name="MMAL" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#MMAL"><cite title="source">Adventures in Life and Letters</cite></a> (1912) 87</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: Mentioned in <cite>The Dead</cite>.
