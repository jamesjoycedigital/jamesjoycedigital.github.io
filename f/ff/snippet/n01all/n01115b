It was announced this morning with much surprise, and in some cases with reprobation that Mass was celebrated in a Congregational church in the West End yesterday morning. The chapel is the historic King&apos;s Weigh House in Duke street, off Oxford street, and it is one attended by many well-known people. Sung Mass has been celebrated at the chapel for a very long period&mdash;almost years now. The <mark>Roman devotion known as Benediction</mark> is also given. Surprise is expressed because the Services are accompanied by incense. The minister at the chapel is Doctor Orchard, a great preacher and, I believe, an ordained priest of the Church of England. <small> <a name="IT23jan23" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#IT23jan23"><cite title="source">Irish Times</cite></a> (23 January 1923) 4/7</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: See also <a name="n25082e" href="n25all.htm#n25082e">N25 (VI.B.15):082(e)</a> </mm> </dd></dl>
