No one seemed to mind, and the thing was far from the failure that the <mark>superstitious ones of the stage</mark> would have held it invariably must be. Many of the young people on the stage are too material to pay even any half-serious attention to old superstitions <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> If, for instance, actors and actresses want to whistle in their dressing rooms why shouldn&apos;t they whistle? How can such <mark>whistling possibly bring &ldquo;bad luck&rdquo;</mark> to the play? <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> And then there is the idea that <mark>on no account should anyone speak the &ldquo;tag&rdquo;</mark> of the play &mdash; the last few words &mdash; before the end of the first performance. <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> and I very much doubt if it would strike terror nowadays into the hearts of her companions if an actress came into the theatre <mark>with peacock&apos;s feathers</mark> or if someone thoughtlessly <mark>quoted from &ldquo;Hamlet&rdquo;</mark> in a dressing-room. <small> <a name="DM18nov22" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#DM18nov22"><cite title="source">Daily Mail</cite></a> (18 November 1922) 6/4</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c05112a" href="c05all.htm#c05112a">VI.C.05:112(a)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
