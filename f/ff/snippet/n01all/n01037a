It was distinct from its national counterpart, the Royal Irish Constabulary, being unarmed. In 1922 the RIC was disbanded and replaced by the Royal Ulster Constabulary in the North and the G&aacute;rda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the South. In 1925 the D.M.P. was absorbed by the G&aacute;rda. </mm> </dd></dl>
