By AN OLD MAID]</font> &ldquo;When I was a girl,&rdquo; she began,&rdquo;we would have no more thought of omitting <mark>syllabub</mark> from the Christma festivities than of going without plum pudding and turkey. &ldquo;When we saw grandfather measure out <mark>a pint from the sherry</mark> that always stood in a decanter on the sideboard,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;we always knew what was going to happen. Then he used to fetch up a bottle of <mark>port and pour out a pint of that also</mark>. Both lots of wine went into a big old china bowl and were sweetened with sugar to father&apos;s liking. &ldquo;Then he and I went across the yard to the netters. Father carried the bowl and I took the milking-stool under my arm. Father would pet one of the quietest of the cows and feed it with apples while I milked her into the bowl. <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> &ldquo;After waiting about 20 minutes,&rdquo; continued mother, &ldquo;we used to pile up the bowl with <mark>clotted cream</mark>. From time to time, as father heaped it up, we would put in a little powdered <mark>cinnamon</mark>. &ldquo;On the top we grated nutmeg and stuck in some sweetmeats. Grandma liked nonpareil <mark>comfits</mark>, she bought them at Norwich when she went up to do the Christmas shopping. <small> <a name="DM29nov22" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#DM29nov22"><cite title="source">Daily Mail</cite></a> (29 November 1922) 8/5</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
