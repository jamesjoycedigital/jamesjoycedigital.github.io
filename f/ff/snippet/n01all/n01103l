Lawson, superintendent mechanical engineer of the South African Railways. This is the construction and running of a self-contained electrically-propelled train. The train has no need of either central power station, live rails or overhead wires. Its power is generated by means of the &ldquo;<mark>char</mark>&rdquo; or ash from locomotiver <mark>fire-boxes</mark>, which is at present thrown on the waste-heap. <small> <a name="IT11jan23" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#IT11jan23"><cite title="source">Irish Times</cite></a> (11 January 1923) 4/6</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Raphael transcription: <a name="c05158n" href="c05all.htm#c05158n">VI.C.05:158(n)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
