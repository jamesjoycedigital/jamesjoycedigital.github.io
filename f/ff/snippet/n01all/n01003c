They were friends of Joyce in Paris. Ellmann writes (p.516) that Joyce, on visiting the Wallaces at their small country house at Chatillon and overhearing Lillian speaking with a young painter, in which she repeated the word &lsquo;yes&rsquo; many times, in different tones of voice, got the idea for the opening and closing words of his &lsquo;Penelope&rsquo; episode.  <br>Raphael transcription: <a name="c05093k" href="c05all.htm#c05093k">VI.C.05:093(k)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
