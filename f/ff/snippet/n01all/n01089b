By AN ANTIQUARY]</font> The oldest manufactured articles in the world are probably some chipped stones found on the <mark>Kentish Weald</mark>. <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> Knives, axes, hammers, scrapers, spearheads, arrowheads, even awls for piercing skin and roughly notched saws for cutting bone were made of flint or chert or obsidian&mdash;any stone that would chip to a cutting edge hard enough to stand wear. <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> But it is a curious and significant thing that these <mark>eoliths</mark> all &ldquo;come to the hand,&rdquo; as a workman would say. When one is held in the hand so that it fits most comfortably to the grasp of palm and fingers, the chipped edge will be found in the right place for striking a blow with the maximum effect, and this is hardly likely to be accidental. <small> <a name="DM2jan23" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#DM2jan23"><cite title="source">Daily Mail</cite></a> (2 January 1923) 6/5</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
