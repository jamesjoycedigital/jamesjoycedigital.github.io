Here, too, <mark>Dan O&apos;Connell</mark> made his first public speech&mdash;a protest against the Union. It was in <mark>1852</mark> that the Exchange became the City Hall of the Corporation of Dublin. <small> <a name="FJ30jul23" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#FJ30jul23"><cite title="source">Freeman's Journal</cite></a> (30 July 1923) 8/5</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
