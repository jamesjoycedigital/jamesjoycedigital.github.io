Kevin is given seven different ecclesiastical epithets&mdash;holy, most holy, venerable, most venerable, blessed, most blessed, Saint). One also finds diffused through the tableau (in addition to the Canonical Hours and the Liturgical Colours) the Seven Sacraments (in inverse order), (inversely) the Gifts of the Holy Ghost, (inversely) the Celestial Hierarchy, and the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy. It is probable that these were listed on pages now missing from this notebook, and are so treated below as &lsquo;virtual units&rsquo;. It is possible that the notebook also contained the specifics of the concentric rings of water (beginning with that of the bathwater) that surround his Kevin as he sits in meditation. </mm> </dd></dl>
