In the Latin Church the ecclesiastical orders are those of bishops, <mark>priests</mark>, deacons, subdeacons, acolytes, exorcists, lectors [readers], <i>ostiarii</i> or doorkeepers, and all are very ancient. Some canonists add another order, that of the tonsure, but this is generally regarded as a mere introduction to the clerical state. Apart from this, very many theologians, among whom is St. Thomas, do not regard the episcopate as a separate order, but only as the completion and extension of the priesthood, and hence reckon the number of the orders as seven. </mm> </dd></dl>
