Ready as the author was to fulfil the highest office of a poet by telling secrets that were lawful, the peril of telling secrets that his church might think it unlawful to tell was too great. <small> <a name="QR1jul23" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#QR1jul23"><cite title="source">Quarterly Review</cite></a> (1 July 1923) 132</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
