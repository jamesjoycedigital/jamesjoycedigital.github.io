At first the vestments were of one colour&mdash;white. Black was sometimes used in sign of mourning. Innocent III. is the first to mention four colours&mdash;white, which the Roman Church employs on feasts of confessors, virgins, and on joyful solemnities generally; red, used on the feasts of martyrs, of the cross, and on Whit-Sunday, by some also on All Saints; <mark>black</mark>, used in penitential seasons and Masses for the dead; green, used on common days, because &ldquo;midway between black and white&rdquo;. He regards violet, which is now the penitential colour, as a mere variety of black, and says the former was used on Holy Innocents and Laetare Sunday. So scarlet and saffron-yellow (<i>coccineus et croceus</i>) are varieties of red and green. Rose-coloured vestments, he says, were sometimes used on feasts of martyrs, and yellow ones on feasts of confessors. At present yellow counts as white, and rose-coloured vestments are only used at solemn Mass on the third Sunday in Advent and the fourth in Lent. </mm> </dd></dl>
