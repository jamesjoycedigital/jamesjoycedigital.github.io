Until the decipherment of the cuneiform inscriptions, he was known only from the book of Daniel (v. 2, 11, 13, 18) and its reproduction in Josephus, where he is represented as the son of Nebuchadrezzar and ther last king of Babylon. As his name did not appear in the list of the successors of Nebuchadrezzar handed down by the Greek writers, various suggestions were put forward as to his identity. Niebuhr identified him with Evil-Merodach, Ewald with <mark>Nabonidos</mark>, others again with <mark>Neriglissor</mark>. The identification with Nabonidos, the last Babylonian king according to the native historian Berossus, goes back to Josephus. The decipherment of the cuneiform texts put an end to all such speculations. In 1854 Sir H.C. Rawlinson discovered the name of Bel-sarra-uzur&mdash;&ldquo;O Bel, defend the king&rdquo;&mdash;in an inscription belonging to the first year of Nabonidos which had been discovered in the ruins of the temple of the Moon-god at Muqayyar or Ur. <small> &ldquo;BEELZEBUB&rdquo; <a name="EBBZ" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#EBBZ"><cite title="source">Encyclopaedia Britannica</cite></a>, 11th edit.
