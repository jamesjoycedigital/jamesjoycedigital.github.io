This expression was applied to the Buddha&apos;s arrival in Benares, where he first preached, or &lsquo;turned the wheel of the law&rsquo;. The expression is derived from one of the Buddha&apos;s titles, chakravartin, &lsquo;monarch&rsquo;, which literally means &lsquo;the turner of a wheel&rsquo;. This has led to the use in Buddhist monasteries of praying wheels, on which the doctrines of the Buddha are inscribed. </mm> </dd></dl>
