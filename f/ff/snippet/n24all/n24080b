It is no laughing matter though. Imagine the worst dog kennel you ever saw, placed upon two poles from a mouldy fencing &mdash; In such a wretched thing sat a squalid old woman, squat like an ape half-starved, from a scarcity of biscuit in its passage from Madagascar to the Cape, with a pipe in her mouth, and looking out with a round-eyed skinny-lidded inanity; with a sort of horizontal idiotic movement of her head &mdash; Squat and lean she sat, and puffed out the smoke, while two ragged tattered girls carried her along. What a thing would be a history of her life and sensations.&rsquo;  <br>Raphael transcription: <a name="c16048b" href="c16all.htm#c16048b">VI.C.16:048(b)</a>, VI.C.9.003 </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
