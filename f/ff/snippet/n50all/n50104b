The names of families adduced in confirmation of this, as Harrold (Harald), Iver (Ivar), <mark>Cotter or Mac Otter</mark> (Ottar), and others, which are genuine Norwegian names, corroborate the assertion that Norwegian families appear to have propagated themselves uninterruptedly in Dublin down to our times, as living evidences of the dominion which their forefathers once exercised there. <small> J.J.A.
