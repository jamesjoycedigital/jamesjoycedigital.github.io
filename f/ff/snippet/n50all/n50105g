That according to the laws of his country an Anglo-Saxon merchant obtained the rank and title of <mark>Thane</mark>, or Chief, when he had thrice crossed the sea in his own ship, sufficiently attests how desirous the Anglo-Saxon kings were to awaken among their subjects, by means of large rewards, a desire for such voyages. <small> J.J.A.
