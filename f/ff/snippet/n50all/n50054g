He tries to prove that the original form of the name is not <i>Lochlann</i>, but <i>Lathlann</i>, <i>Lothlann</i>, which at first signified the Danish island, Lolland. Zimmer also believes that the name <i>Hiruath</i>, as early as the ninth century, completely disappears, and is replaced by the name Lochlann; and he sees in this a proof of his theory. <small> Alexander Bugge, <a name="ABUG2" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#ABUG2"><cite title="source">Contributions to the History of the Norsemen in Ireland</cite></a> (1900) I, 4</small></blockquote> <mm class="note">Note: See also <a name="n22063g" href="n22all.htm#n22063g">N22 (VI.B.17):063(g)</a>. </mm> </dd></dl>
