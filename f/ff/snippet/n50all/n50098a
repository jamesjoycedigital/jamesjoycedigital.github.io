They not only reflect the customary hatred and prejudices of the Christians against the heathen Northmen, but frequently bear the stamp of being derived from early poetical legends. They relate how several Irish saints, as <mark>St. Columkill</mark>, St. Berchan, St. Kieran, and St. Comgall, had long before <mark>predicted the coming of the Scandinavian heathens</mark> and their barbarous proceedings. They likewise depict how terribly the heathens devastated and plundered unhappy Ireland. People were everywhere killed or maltreated; churches and convents were plundered, burnt, and desecrated. <small> J.J.A.
