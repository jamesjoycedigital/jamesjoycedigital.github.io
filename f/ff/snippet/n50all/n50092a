Everybody knew beforehand that the real meaning of O&apos;Connell&apos;s speech was, that just as the Irish, with Brian Boroimha at their head, had formerly defeated the Danes on that very place, and thus saved Ireland&apos;s freedom, so should they now in like manner follow O&apos;Connell (who, besides, gave himself out for a descendant of Brian Boru <font color="green">[?]</font>), and make every sacrifice to wrest back their lost independence from English, or &ldquo;Saxon,&rdquo; ascendancy. The English government, however, forbade the meeting, and indicted O&apos;Connell. But the same extravagant notions respecting the national importance of the battle of Clontarf naturally continued to be generally received; and that not only amongst the adherents of O&apos;Connell, or &ldquo;<mark>Old Irelanders</mark>,&rdquo; as they are called, but also among the members of a political party, the &ldquo;<mark>Young Irelanders</mark>,&rdquo; which has arisen since, and whose aim it is to sever the connection with England by open force. <small> J.J.A.
