These, which are of Anglo-Saxon origin, and which also serve still further to prove the preponderating influence of the Anglo-Saxons in that part, are, it is true, also spread over the whole of the north of England. But, even in the districts about the Thames (in Kent, Essex, Suffolk, and Norfolk) they already begin to be mixed with previously unknown names ending in &mdash;by (<i>Old Northern</i>, b&#7923;r, first a single farm, afterwards a town in general), &mdash;<mark>thorpe</mark> (old Northern (sic) &thorn;orp, a collection of houses separated from some principal estate, a village), &mdash;<mark>thwaite</mark>, in the old Scandinavian language &thorn;veit, tved, <mark>an isolated piece of land</mark>, &mdash;n&aelig;s, a promontory, and &mdash;ey, or &ouml;e, an isle; as in Kirby, or Kirkby, Risby, Upthorpe and others. As we approach from the south the districts west of the Wash, such as Northamptonshire and Warwickshire, the number of such names constantly increases, and we find, among others, Ashby, Rugby, and Naseby. As we proceed farther north, we find still more numerous names of towns and villages having in like manner new terminations such as, &mdash;<mark>with (i.e. forest)</mark>, &mdash;<mark>toft</mark>, &mdash;beck, &mdash;<mark>tarn</mark> (<i>Scandinavian</i>, tj&ouml;rn, or tjarn, a small lake, water), &mdash;<mark>dale</mark>, &mdash;<mark>fell</mark> (rocky mountain), &mdash;<mark>force</mark> (waterfall), &mdash;<mark>haugh, or, how</mark> (<i>Scand</i>., haugr, a hill), &mdash;<mark>garth</mark> (Scand., gar&eth;r, a large farm); together with many others. The inhabitants of the north will at once acknowledge these endings to be pure Norwegian or Danish; which is, moreover, placed beyond all doubt by the compound words in which they appear. <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> <mark>Lund; Danish for <i>grove</i>)</mark>, <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> <small> J.J.A.
