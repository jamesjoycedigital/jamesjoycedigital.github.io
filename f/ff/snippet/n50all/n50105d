In the early part of the middle ages this church was called in Latin, &ldquo;Ecclesia Sancti Clementis Danorum,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;the Danes&apos; Church of St. Clement.&rdquo; It was here that the Danes in London formerly had their own burial place; in which reposed the remains of Canute the Great&apos;s son and next successor, Harald Harefoot. <small> J.J.A.
