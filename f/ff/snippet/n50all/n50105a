In the year 1011 especially, the Jarl Thorkel the Tall, <mark>visited it with fire</mark> and sword. Christchurch, the principal church in England, was burnt down; the monks were put to death, and only one in ten of the citizens spared. Many, and among them Archbishop Elfeg, who was afterwards cruelly murdered, were cast into prison. <small> J.J.A.
