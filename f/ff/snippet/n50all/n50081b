These are small silver coins struck by Danish-Norwegian kings and jarls during their dominion there. I do not allude, of course, to coins of such kings as Canute the Great, Harald <mark>Harefoot</mark>, and Hardicanute; for as these princes held a confirmed dominion in England&mdash;and that at a time when coining was general in Europe, and when on the whole the light of history begins to shine clearer&mdash;there would be nothing strange, nor particularly instructive in an historical point of view, that they also had coined money. <small> J.J.A.
