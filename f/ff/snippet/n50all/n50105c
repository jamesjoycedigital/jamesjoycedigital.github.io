The walls enclosed only that proportionally small part of modern London called the &ldquo;City,&rdquo; and which forms the centre of its busy commerce. Close by lay a castle (whence the Northmen&apos;s name for London, &ldquo;<mark>Lundunaborg</mark>&rdquo;), and undoubtedly on the same spot where, not long after Canute&apos;s time, William the Conqueror built the Tower. <small> J.J.A.
