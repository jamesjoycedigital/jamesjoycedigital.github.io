At no great distance, near Great Driffield, is &ldquo;the Danes&apos; Dale,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Danes&apos; Graves,&rdquo; where remains of the Danes who fell in a battle are said to have been dug up. South of York, on the Humber, between Richal and Skipwith, human bones and pieces of iron have likewise been found in several <mark>barrows</mark>, or tumuli, ascribed to the Danes. It is supposed that the Danes and Norwegians landed in this neighbourhood at different times, when proceeding up the Humber on their warlike expeditions. <small> J.J.A.
