Thus the Norwegian chief Harald Haardraade, before he became king of Norway, and after his return from his many expeditions into the Greek Empire, sitting and conversing one evening (according to the nineteenth chapter of his Saga) with King Svend Estridsen of Denmark at the drinking table, Svend asked him what precious things he had that he set most value on? He answered, his <mark>banner, called Land&ouml;de (or, the land-ravager)</mark>. Svend then asked what qualities this banner had, since he esteemed it so precious a thing? Harald replied, &ldquo;They say that he before whom this banner is borne always gains the victory; and such has constantly been the case since I possessed it.&rdquo; <small> J.J.A.
