The names of several streets in York end in <i>gate</i>. In London, where the same termination of the names of streets frequently occurs, some have, indeed, endeavoured to derive this <i>gate</i> from the gates which these streets adjoined; and, as far as regards London, this explanation may probably in most cases be correct. But in York, where formerly there were at least a score of such streets, it is certainly by no means a probable conjecture that twenty gates existed from which their names were derived; and it therefore becomes a question whether these gates should not be derived from the old Scandinavian <mark>&ldquo;<i>gata</i>&rdquo; (a street)</mark>, particularly when they appear in compound names, such as Petersgate (Petersgade), Marygate (Mariegade), Fishergate (Fiskergade), Stonegate (Steengade), <mark>Micklegate</mark> (from the old Scandinavian &ldquo;mykill,&rdquo; signifying great); which have a striking resemblance with Scandinavian names of streets; nay, there is even a legend respecting Godram, or Guthramgate, that it was named after a Danish chieftain, Guthrum or Gorm, who is said to have dwelt there. The historical accounts of the number and influence of the Northmen in York cannot but strengthen these suppositions in a high degree. <small> J.J.A.
