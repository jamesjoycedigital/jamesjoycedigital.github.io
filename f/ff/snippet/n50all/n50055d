Dr. Todd, in his admirable introduction, has proved that this old chronicle must have been composed soon after the battle of Clontarf, probably about the year 1030. The chronicle relates (pp. 27 and 232) that the Danish chieftain <mark><i>Mac Ragnaill</i></mark>, i.e. Ragnall&apos;s son, came to Dublin, and that a banquet was given in his honour. This event must be dated 877. <small> Alexander Bugge, <a name="ABUG2" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#ABUG2"><cite title="source">Contributions to the History of the Norsemen in Ireland</cite></a> (1900) I, 8</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
