Yet it deserves to be mentioned that the Scandinavian name <i>N&ouml;k</i> (a river-sprite), is not yet forgotten in Yorkshire; although some by &ldquo;Nick&rdquo; or &ldquo;Oud-Nick&rdquo; erroneously imagine the devil to be meant, instead of the watersprite. Many little tricks performed by the <i>nix</i> (<i>Dan</i>., nisse, a brown&icirc;e) are known there, as well as in Scandinavia. Once, in England, the conversation happening to turn on these little beings, I related our Scandinavian legend about a peasant who was plagued and teazed in all possible ways by a <i>nisse</i> or brown&icirc;e, till at last he could bear it no longer, and determined to <mark><i>flit</i></mark> (move house) to another place. When he had conveyed almost all his goods to the new house, and was just driving thither with the last load, he accidently turned round, and whom did he see? Why, the brown&icirc;e with his red cap, who sat quietly on the top of the load, and nodded familiarly to him, with the words, &ldquo;Now we flit.&rdquo; One of the persons present immediately expressed a lively surprise on hearing a legend related as Danish, and that, too, almost word for word, which he had often heard in Lancashire in his youth. The word <i>flit</i> was, and still is, used there by the common people. <small> J.J.A.
