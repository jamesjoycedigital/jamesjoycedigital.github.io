It appears to have been a species of <i>rheda</i>. It had four wheels, and was used in travelling. Nero is said never to have travelled with less than 1000 carrucae. These carriages were sometimes used in Rome by persons of distinction, like the <i>carpenta</i>, in which case they appear to have been covered with plates of bronze, silver, and even gold. An <i>aurea carruca</i> could have had the value of a farm. Carrucae were also used for carrying women, and were then, as well, perhaps as in other cases, drawn by mules. From the <i>carruca</i> are traced the modern European names, &mdash; the English <i>carriage</i>, the French <i>carrosse</i> and the Italian <i>carrozza</i>.  <br>Note: See also: <a name="n10032i" href="n10all.htm#n10032i">N10 (VI.B.16):032(i)</a> </mm> </mm></dd></dl>
