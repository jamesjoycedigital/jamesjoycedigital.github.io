The phrase was apt. He was bored and languid. A year ago she would have told him he had <mark>not &ldquo;pep&rdquo;</mark> or possible that he was a &ldquo;poorboob,&rdquo; a &ldquo;dumb bell,&rdquo; a &ldquo;bonehead,&rdquo; or a &ldquo;<mark>stupe</mark>.&rdquo; But a flat tyre is the latest and smartest American term of reproach, and who says there are not fashions in slang? <small> <a name="HNS4jan24" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#HNS4jan24"><cite title="source">The Hawera and Normanby Star</cite></a> (4 January 1924) 6/3</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
