Of these &ldquo;Slighes,&rdquo; or roads, the &ldquo;Slighe Cualaun&rdquo; was one traced with the greatest apparent certainty by the Ordnance Survey. It struck off from the <i>Fan-na-g-carbad</i>, or &ldquo;Slope of the chariots,&rdquo; and led via Ratoath and Dublin into Cualaun; a district extending from Dalkey, southwards and westwards, and part of which, including Powerscourt, is designated in Anglo-Norman records, as Fercullen, or &ldquo;the territory of the men of Cualaun.&rdquo; <small> Charles Haliday, <a name="SKD4" href="../../FF/fdra/fdex.htm#SKD4"><cite title="source">The Scandinavian Kingdom of Dublin</cite></a>, 2nd ed.
