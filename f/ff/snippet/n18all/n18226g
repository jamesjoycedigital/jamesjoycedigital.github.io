But the editor says in a note that the Annals of Clonmacnois and the Four Masters specify Athliag and are probably correct as Dublin was at this time subject to O&apos;Brien, and neither that monarch nor his Danish subjects of Dublin would tolerate such an assumption of authority on the part of Maelseachlainn who had recently been forced to resign the supremacy in his favour. <small> Charles Haliday, <a name="SKD4" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#SKD4"><cite title="source">The Scandinavian Kingdom of Dublin</cite></a>, 2nd ed.
