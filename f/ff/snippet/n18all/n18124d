The most dignified were those attached to Diiovis, Mars, and Quirinus, the <i>Flamen Dialis</i>, <i>Flamen Martialis</i>, and <i>Flamen Quirinalis</i>. The two first are said by Plutarch to have been been established by Romulus; but the greater number of authorities agree in referring the institution of the whole three, in common with all other matters connected with state religion, to Numa. The number was eventually increased to fifteen; the three original flamens were always chosen from among the patricians and styled <i>Majores</i>; the rest from the plebians, with the epithet <i>Minores</i>. The office was understood to last for life; but a flamen might be compelled to resign for a breach of duty, or even on account of an ill-omened accident while discharging his functions. Their characteristic dress was the apex, the laena, and a laurel wreath. To counterbalance the high honours the position entailed, the Dialis was subjected to a multitude of restrictions and privations; among these were such restrictions as: he was not allowed to swear an oath nor to wear a ring, nor to have a knot in any part of his attire, nor to walk along a path over-canopied by vines. He was forbidden either to touch or to name a dog, a she-goat, ivy, beans, or raw flesh. He was however required to take a wife (termed, <i>flaminica</i>), a virgin, and to wed according to the ceremonies of <i>confarreatio</i>, which regulation also applied to the two other flamines majores, and he could not marry a second time. </mm> </dd></dl>
