The process of road-making as practised by the Romans was thoroughly scientific. In the first place, two shallow trenches (Sulci) were dug parallel to each other, marking the breath of the proposed road; this in the great lines, such as the Via Appia, the Via Flaminia, the Via Valeria etc., is found to have been from 13 to 15 feet. The loose earth between the Sulci was then removed, and the excavation continued until a solid foundation (gremium) was reached, upon which the materials of the road may firmly rest; if this could not be attained (in consequence of the swampy nature of the ground or from any peculiarity in the soil), a basis was formed artifically by driving piles (<i>fistucationibus</i>). Above the gremium were four distinct strata. The lowest course was the <mark>statumen</mark>, consisting of stones not smaller than the hand could just grasp; above the statumen was the rudus, a mass of broken stones cemented with lime (what masons called rubble-work) ramnmed down hard and nine inches thick; above the rudus came the nucleus, composed of fragments of bricks and pottery, the pieces being smaller than in the rudus, cemented with lime and 6 inches thick. Uppermost was the <i>pavimentum</i>, large polygonal blocks of the hardest stone (silex), usually, at least in the vicinity of Rome, basaltic lava, irregular in form but fitted and jointed with great precision so as to present a perfectly even surface as free from gaps and irregularities as if the whole had been one solid mass, and presenting much the same external appearance as the most carefully built polygonal walls of the old Pelasgian towns. The centre of the way was a little elevated so as to permit the water to run off easily, and hence the terms <i>agger viae</i> and <i>summum dorsum</i>, although both may be applied to the whole surface of the pavimentum. Nor was this all. Regular footpaths were raised upon each side and strewed with gravel, the different parts were strengthened and bound together with gomphi or stone wedges, and stone blocks were set up at moderate intervals on the sides of the footpaths, in order that travellers on hordseback might more easily be able to mount. Finally, Caius Gracchus erected milestones along the whole extent of the highways, marking the distances from Rome (these appear to have been counted from the gate at which each road issued forth), and Augustus (when appointed inspector of the viae around the city) erected in the forum a gilded column on which were inscribed the distances of the principal points to which the viae conducted. It is certain that during the earlier ages of the republic the construction and general superintendence of the roads without, and the streets within, the city were committed like all other importane work to the censors. When no censors were in office, these duties devolved upon the consuls, and in their absence on the Praetor Urbanus, the Aediles, or such persons as the senate thought fit to appoppoint.</mm> </dd></dl>
