His mind was long concerned with the momentous problem of gravity, despite his achievements in the field of astronomy, and by August 1684 he had perceived that the central force of the solar system must decrease inversely as the square of the distance. He applied vainly to Wren and Hooke for further elucidation, and in August 1684 made a journey to Cambridge for the purpose of consulting Newton, which resulted in the publication of the <cite>Principia</cite>. The labour and expense of passing this great work through the press devolved upon Halley, who also wrote the prefixed hexameters. Among his many services to the British Navy, the provision of maps and suchlike, was the selection and fortifying the port of Trieste. Halley&apos;s most notable scientific achievements were -- his detection of the long inequality of Jupiter and Saturn, and of the acceleration of the moon&apos;s mean motion (1693), his discovery of the proper motions of the fixed stars (1718), his theory of variation (1683), including the hypothesis of four magnetic poles and his suggestion of the magnetic origin of the arora borealis; <i>his calculation of the orbit of the 1682 comet (the first ever attempted), coupled with a prediction of its return, striking verified in 1759</i>; and his indication (in 1679, and again in 1716) of a method extensively used in the 18th and 19th centuries for determining the solar parallax by means of the transit of Venus. </mm> </dd></dl>
