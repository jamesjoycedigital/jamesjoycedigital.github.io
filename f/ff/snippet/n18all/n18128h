They are Messrs. Atkinson &amp; Co., Elliot &amp; Sons, Fry &amp; Co., and Pim Bros. &amp; Co. A fifth has recently been started by a Mr. Bergin in Camden Street. All these firms confine their attention chiefly to poplin weaving and tiemaking. No <mark>whole silk</mark> is woven by any of them as part of their regular business. They make, however, whole silk for special orders. Ribbands are also made when specially ordered. <small> J. J.
