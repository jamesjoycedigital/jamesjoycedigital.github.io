Their existence at Alba Longa is connected with the earliest Roman traditions, for Silvia, the mother of Romulus, was a member of the sisterhood. Their establishment in the city is attributed to Numa, who selected four, two from the Titienses and two from the Ramnes. Two more were subsequently added from the Luceres.  <br>Raphael transcription: <a name="c07083a" href="c07all.htm#c07083a">VI.C.07:083(a)</a> </mm></dd> </dd></dl>
