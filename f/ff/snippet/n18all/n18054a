In love, in war, in captivity, in magnificence, and in the art of leading his people out from the lingering bondage of medieval darkness to riot in the full sun of Renaissance splendor, who can rival Francis I? <font color="green">[&hellip;]</font> <p>Francis I did nothing indeed by halves. Whatsoever he planned had to be executed in a royal way. Whether it was decking France with magnificent palaces, or pitting himself against the greatest master-mind, as emperor and general, in Europe; or in the matter of love-making; or luring to France such artists as Cellini, as Primaticio, above all others, as Leonardo da Vinci; whatever Francis I conceived, created, desired, or attracted by reason of his imaginative grasp and his magnetic charm, must be of a splendor commensurate with the largeness of a mind to whom small ways and petty ambitions were deemed unworthy of a French king.</p> <p>Orders were given to the commandant of Honfleur to construct a &ldquo;great port&rdquo; at Havre, one to harbor &ldquo;the great ships of our kingdom and those of our allies.&rdquo; Privileges were lavishly granted. The town must be peopled and finely built. Havre de Gr&acirc;ce promptly took the king at his word, and proceeded to grow and grow.</p> <small> Anna Bowman Dodd, <a name="ABDU" href="../../ff/fdra/fdex.htm#ABDU"><cite title="source">Up the Seine to the Battlefields</cite></a> (1920) 18-9</small></blockquote> </dd></dl>
