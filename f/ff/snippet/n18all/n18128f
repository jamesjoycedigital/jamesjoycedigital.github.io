They infused new life and vigour into many of the industries they found in existence there; they introduced a wholly new industry, the silk manufacture, which was destined to give employment to thousands in the city; many of them rose to the highest eminence in the commercial life of Dublin. Notable amongst others was the <mark>La Touche</mark> family, which at one time carried on a great banking establishment in Dublin, and is to this day prominently connected with one of our biggest manufacturing concerns. <small> J.
