It was the first ever laid down on a grand scale and upon scientific principles, the natural obstacles which it was necessary to overcome were of the most formidable nature, and when completed it well deserved the title of <i>Queen of Roads</i> (<i>regina viarum</i>). It issued from the <i>Porta Capena</i> and originally terminated at <i>Capua</i>, and had seven principal ramifications. It was eventually extended to <i>Brundusium</i>. </mm> </dd></dl>
