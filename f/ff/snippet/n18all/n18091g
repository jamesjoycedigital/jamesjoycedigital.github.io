In this king&apos;s reign came the deluge or universal flood. On this event, he and his wife got into a small ship, which was carried to Mount Parnassus and there stayed; and there the dry masses first appeared after the waters abated. He consulted with the oracle of Themis how mankind might be restored, and was answered, If he cast his grandmother&apos;s bones behind his back. Thereupon he and his wife cast the bones over their shoulders, and these became men and women. </mm> </dd></dl>
