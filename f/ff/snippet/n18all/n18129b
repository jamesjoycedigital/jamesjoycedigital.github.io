There are two kinds of loom in use the plain loom used for poplin of a simple pattern, the Jacquard loom for figured poplin. Patterns of very intricate design can be woven by means of the latter loom with the same facility as the ordinary pattern. The high reputation of Irish poplin is due to the fact that the materials used have always been of the best quality. The Dublin manufacturers have never deviated from that high standard of excellence. They have consistently set their face against a device adopted by foreign manufacturers known as &ldquo;<mark>weighting the silk</mark>.&rdquo; <small> J. J.
