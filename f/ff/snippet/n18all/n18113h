We are ignorant of their precise form. We know that they were drawn by horses, and escorted by the chief senators in robes of state, who, along with pueri patrimi, laid hold of the bridles and traces, or perhaps assisted to drag the carriage by means of thongs attached for that purpose. SO sacred was this duty considered, that Augustus, when labouring under sickness, deemed it necessary to accompany the tensae in a litter. The only gods distinctly named as carried in tensae are Jupiter and Minerva, and, possibly, Mars. That a considerable number of deities however received this honour seems probable. Among the impious flatteries heaped on Caesar, it was decreed that his ivory statue should accompany the images of the gods to the circus in a complete chariot, and that this chariot should stand in the Capitol immediately opposite to that of Jupiter. </mm> </dd></dl>
