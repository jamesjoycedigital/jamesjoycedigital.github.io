Haliday&apos;s <cite>Scandinavian Kingdom of Dublin</cite> 231n3f <font color="green">[unlikely to be Joyce&apos;s immediate source for these notes]</font>: The Pigeon House, in Dublin, first as an hotel, and then as a fort or magazine was preceded by a block house for storing wreck. The Dublin newspapers of 1766 mention that a vessel being wrecked, a number of &lsquo;rockers&rsquo;, who always came down for plunder, were by this means disappointed. It got perhaps the name of Pigeonhouse from John Pigeon employed there. &ldquo;8th June, 1786, order that John Mullarky and <i>John Pigeon</i> do attend on Saturday next&rdquo; &hellip; <font color="green">[The committee do]</font> allot one portion <font color="green">[of blockhouse]</font> to Mr Francis Tunstall, the inspector of the works of the Ballast Board, and other part of, O&apos;Brien and his wife during pleasure as housekeeper &hellip; In the Dublin Penny Journal for September, 28th 1832, is to be found a legend entitled &ldquo;The Pidgeon House, a tale of the last century.&rdquo; It is stated that there was then living at Ringsend one who had resided there near a century, and is vouched as the author of the story, of which it is enough for the present to say that from Ned Pidgeon, living in the house built &ldquo;at the pile ends,&rdquo; the Pigeon House is alleged to have got its name.
