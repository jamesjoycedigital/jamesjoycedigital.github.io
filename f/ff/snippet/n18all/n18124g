His images were made with two faces, one looking backward, the other forward, to denote both a retrospect and prospect, with a staff of white thorn in one hand, and a key in the other, whence he is called Clusius, and Patulcius. He brought into Italy the use of wine and of temples and altars. The doors of his temple in the Roman Forum were always open in time of war, and shut in time of peace. </mm> </dd></dl>
