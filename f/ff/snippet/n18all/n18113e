The carpentum was used to convey the Roman matrons of distinction in the public festal processions. It was commonly drawn by a pair of mules, but more rarely by oxen or horses, and sometimes by four horses like a <i>quadriga</i>. For grand occasions it was very richly adorned. It was apparently also used as a kind of funeral carriage. Covered carts were much used by the Britons, and by the Gauls, the Cimbri, the Allobroges, and other northern nations. The Gauls and Helvetii took a great many of them on their military expeditions; and, when they were encamped, arranged them in close order, so as to form extensive lines of circumvallation.  <br>Note: See also: <a name="n10032g" href="n10all.htm#n10032g">N10 (VI.B.16):032(g)</a> </mm> </mm></dd></dl>
