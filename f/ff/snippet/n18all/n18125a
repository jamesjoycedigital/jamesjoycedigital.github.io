Each of these tribes was composed of a union of ten <i>curiae</i>, or wards, so that the whole number of the latter was thirty. Again, each of these thirty curiae was formed of <i>gentes</i> or houses, the families constituting which were not necessarily related. Dionysius further informs us that Romulus divided the curiae into <i>decads</i>, at the head of which were officers called <i>decurions</i>. Each of the three tribes therefore was originally composed of one hundred gentes; and as in the old legion the three centuries of horse (<i>Equites</i> or <i>Celeres</i> <font color="green">[horsemen]</font>) corresponded to the three tribes, so did the thirty centuries of foot represent the same number of curiae. </mm> </dd></dl>
