This article, it may be explained, is a combination of silk and wool. The material is woven with a <mark>silk warp and woollen weft</mark>. It is so made that the surface on both sides of the cloth is all silk. The wool is used as a foundation. The combination of these two textiles gives a material of excellent appearance and wonderful durability. <small> J. J.
