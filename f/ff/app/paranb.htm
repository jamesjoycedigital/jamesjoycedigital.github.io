<p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn1">  1  Joyce associated thunder with Vico (remember how at the beginning we came back via a &lsquo;commodious vicus&rsquo;). Vico's philosophy postulated a perpetual recurrence of a fourfold historical pattern and this is used loosely through the <cite>Wake</cite> as a pivotal structuring device, much as is Bruno's concept of the identity of opposites. Vico associated thunder with man's earliest consciousness of guilt. On hearing its deafening roar primitive man, he supposed, coming suddenly into a consciousness of externality, supposed it was an angry God that spoke out of the sky. The primitives then fled in fear into caves and began the slow process of civilised living.

</p><p> There are in the <cite>Wake</cite> ten thunder-words (at 3.14, 18.23, 35.16, 72.16, 90.03, 203.23, 242.04, 256.07, 322.01, and 329.30 [3.15, 23.05, 44.20, 90.31, 113.09, 257.27, 314.08, 332.05, 414.19, and 424.20]). Each represents an utterance (divine) as well as some sound appropriate to the narrative (a ladder collapsing, a door closing, etc). The hundred-lettered words may also serve as narrative chronological indicators. They are each some particular aggregate of elements, in most cases the same word given in different languages; thus, the root words for the first and second are simply &lsquo;thunder,&rsquo; for the third &lsquo;clap&rsquo; (as in &lsquo;applaud&rsquo;); for the fourth &lsquo;whore,&rsquo; for the sixth &lsquo;shut the door,&rsquo; and for the eighth &lsquo;cough.&rsquo; The others form sentences of a sort.

</p><p> Finnegan's fall is interpreted at 5.10 (5.29) as the fall from grace of Adam, the first man: &lsquo;so sore did abe ite ivvy's holired abbles.&rsquo; It is also referred to as a &lsquo;municipal sin business&rsquo; (as original sin). <font face="wake">A</font> is associated with apples and <font face="wake">H</font> with oranges: hence his interment at 3.21 (3.23) involves oranges being laid &lsquo;to rust upon the green.&rsquo; When the hen pecking at the Egyptian midden in chapter I.5 uncovers fragments of half-rotted orange-peel, it is at one level recovering bits of <font face="wake">H</font>'s corpse.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn2">  2  If we care to leaf through our copies of the <cite>Wake</cite> to get to the end of Book III we will find HCE, wrapped in the identity of Mr Porter, in a remarkably similar plight when, ultimately, the last straw having been added to his camel's back, an &lsquo;explosium of his distilleries deafadumped all his dry goods down to his most favoured sinflute and dropped him, what remains of a heptark, leareyed and lotterish, weeping worrybound on his bankrump&rsquo; 459.15-17 (489.36ff). After all that he is to go through, everything he has to endure, all that gossip and scandal-mongering, HCE is to end up exactly as he started out, on the beam-end of his behind.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn3">  3  Many of the words used in the text in this war passage derive from a study of vocabulary in Rabelais. Most are the names of ancient implements of war: <i>badelaire</i>, <i>partisan</i>, <i>migraine</i>, <i>malchu</i>s, <i>verdun</i>, <i>baliste</i>, <i>aze gaye</i>, and so on. See in this connection Claude Jacquet, <i>Joyce et Rabelais: aspects de la creation verbale dans</i> Finnegans Wake (Paris, 1972), and Danis Rose, &lsquo;Corrections to Jacquet's Joyce et Rabelais&rsquo; (<i>A Wake Newslitter</i> [hereinafter abbreviated <i>AWN</i>] 13 (1976) pp 106-08 and 17 (1980) p 24). Joyce conflates flood, fall (from the wall, from Eden, and falling asleep), and first thunder.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn4">  4  See Jane Meehan, &lsquo;Tim Finigan's Wake&rsquo; (<cite>AWN</cite> 13 (1976) 69-73), for a history of this Irish-American ballad.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn5">  5  Nathan Halper (<cite>AWN</cite> 12 (1975) 29) sees in HCE the archetypal master-builder working in the great river-valleys where historical civilisations are thought to have originated.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn6">  6  As we read on, we quickly appreciate that our topical hero, HCE, whose name alters from state to state, consistently changes his appearance. One could say of him that he never appears but in a new suit of clothes. He always wears headgear of some sort and carries a stick or other implement. When we meet him later as &lsquo;the Willingdone&rsquo; his mitre turns up as the &lsquo;Lipoleumhat&rsquo; and his hod and trowel as a telescope. In episode I.2, he is again a new man. Hastening out in an extraordinary and heterogeneous get-up to greet the King, who happens to have paused outside his humble abode, he carries with him a long pole with a flower-pot stuck on one end. On encountering the cad in the park, he carries a briar (a pipe) and a walking-stick. And so on right through the book, everything changing into something else all of the time, modifying itself as conditions change, turning into something quite distinct yet withal with still a trace of its former instantiations.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn7">  7  The placement of the bush is, after old tradition, to indicate that <big><font face="wake">N</font></big> is an ale-house.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn8">  8  The <i>habitaculum</i> that Finnegan builds and essentially completes, as indicated by the bush, is not a mere wall or even the Eiffel Tower: it is also the tower of Babel itself. It encompasses all edifices built by hands.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn9">  9  Compare Stephen's definition in <cite>Ulysses</cite>: &lsquo;Stephen jerked his thumb towards the window, saying: That is God. Hooray! Ay! Whrrwhee! What? Mr Deasy asked. A shout in the street, Stephen answered, shrugging his shoulders.&rsquo; Finnegan's fall is occasioned by God, Who is angered at the hubris behind the erection of the wall. It is also and perhaps more realistically caused by half-suffocation induced by the &lsquo;fumes and the hopes and the strupithump&rsquo; of Dublin (recalling Horace, <cite>Odes</cite> III.29.12: <i>fumum et opes strepitumque Romae</i>: the smoke and the grandeur and the noise of Rome).

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn10">  10  Few can doubt but that it was because of his tippling that Tim missed his footing that time; but, ironically, 5.27 (6.13-14) suggests he died of thirst on that trying Thursday morn.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn11">  11  They laid HCE &lsquo;brawdawn alanglast bed.&rsquo; Intermittently, he turns up in the guise of a fish. In this section he is, as Finnegan, part <i>brad&aacute;n</i> or salmon, but also ling, whale, grampus, thunderfish and so forth: in any event, somebody's supper.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn12">  12  The <cite>Wake</cite>'s version of Tim's wake is accompanied with boisterous singing, not only of the ballad <i>Finnegan's Wake</i> but also <i>Adeste Fidelis</i>, <i>De Profundis</i>, <i>Phil the Fluter's Ball</i> and <i>Mrs Holohan's Christmas Cake</i>.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn13">  13  The magazine fort in the Phoenix Park is the subject of Swift's <cite>Epigram on the Magazine</cite>, parodied at 10.32 (12.35). It is an important <cite>Wake</cite> location. Built by Wharton in fear of invasion (and hence known locally as &lsquo;Wharton's Folly&rsquo;) on the site of the old Manor House, it stood some distance from the Wellington Monument.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn14">  14  Waterloo was called &lsquo;La Belle Alliance&rsquo; by the Prussians and &lsquo;Mont St Jean&rsquo; by the English.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn15">  15  &lsquo;So gigglesome minxt the follyages.&rsquo; Clearly, the villagettes are a metaphor for <font face="wake">J</font> and <font face="wake">K</font> (Issy and her mirror image). The three boys <font face="wake">C</font> <font face="wake">D</font> and <font face="wake">G</font> (Shem, Shaun and Shem-Shaun) are later given a landscape presence as three mounds (small mountains).

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn16">  16  In a sense, the museum is a version of Anna Livia's sack of rubbish. In other instantiations it is the Wellington monument itself or perhaps no more than a horse mushroom sprung up overnight or the inside of Finn's head.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn17">  17  Throughout the <cite>Wake</cite> we come upon clusters of words having a common factor, such as the names of rivers of insects or words in some particular language, or from a particular source. These extend the narrative vertically in a kind of reference axis, as a kind of supra-narrative. Where they appear they are always apposite. In the case of the Waterloo episode the text carries a strong secondary axis of reference to place names where historically noted battles took place (Salo, Loos, Magenta, and so on). The reader need not necessarily be aware of these individually in order to follow the story line. For example, HCE wears &lsquo;goldtin spurs,&rsquo; clearly golden/tin spurs, yet &lsquo;<i>Golden Spurs</i>&rsquo; is a historical battle reference. Joyce may have at one stage intended to include in the final text a more polished version of the map used in the early draft, after seeing examples of such maps in one of his major source books, Sir Edward Creasy's <cite>Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World: from Marathon to Waterloo</cite>.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn19">  19  This is evidently also a flag of sorts.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn20">  20  This is the first intimation of the coming assaults on HCE.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn21">  21  Joyce's &lsquo;crimealine&rsquo; is a form of fortification. It is also the river Liffey and the hem of ALP's skirt.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn22">  22  It becomes apparent, retrospectively, that the Duke, the three bachelors, and the two girls constitute the principal protagonists of the (mock) battle, which is itself a proto-version of HCE's crime in the park. At one level they represent a family group. HCE's daughter Issy commonly appears as a twosome, two forms of herself, here called &lsquo;jinnies&rsquo; after the word <i>jinny</i>, meaning a chamber pot. His sons Shem and Shaun (<font face="wake">C</font> and <font face="wake">D</font>) seem on occasion (as here) to generate a third entity between them, a personality (Shem-Shaun) represented in Joyce's sign complex as <font face="wake">G</font>.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn23">  23  This character is later to resurface as HCE's Man Friday, just as Kate turns out to be none other than his cleaning lady. At one level the pair, dotard <font face="wake">S</font> and crone <font face="wake">}</font>, form a degenerate version of HCE and ALP.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn24">  24  Telescope, memorial, sword (Excalibur) and penis are conflated. The Wonderworker, a prospectus for which Leopold Bloom (in <cite>Ulysses</cite>) keeps in a drawer, was, we remember, the world's &lsquo;greatest remedy for rectal complaints direct from Wonderworker, Coventry House, South Place, London E.C.&rsquo; It appears here as, inter alia, HCE&apos;s phallus. I have also come upon appreciation in the local newspaper here in Ballydehob: </p><p class="set">O Glorious Wonderworker of Padua, Saint Anthony, Father of the poor and consoler of the afflicted, who has so thoughtfully come to my aid and consoled me so much: behold me at thy feet desiring to offer thee my sincerest gratitude.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn25">  25  These despatches parody the <cite>Dispatches of the Duke of Wellington during his Various Campaigns</cite>, 1834-39. The Duke's remark to a correspondent, Jenny, to &lsquo;publish and be damned&rsquo; also refers. &lsquo;Jenny&rsquo; may have suggested the name &lsquo;the jinnies&rsquo; to Joyce.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn26">  26  This cross-fire situation is the most persistent symbol in the <cite>Wake</cite> of HCE's sin.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn27">  27  This early-bird hen is ALP's first animate appearance in the <cite>Wake</cite>. In a like vein, her children appear here with her also as birds. She is a type of Isis, trying to piece together what she can of the recently dismembered Osiris (HCE having been blown up).

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn28">  28  ALP's sack is also a mailbag, since it contains the Boston Letter <big><font face="wake">N</font></big> (about which we are later to read much). We can already make out its principal elements: Father Michael, a lovely present of cakes, Maggy, and, at 9.33 (11.27), the crosses listed in signing off: &lsquo;With Kiss. Kiss Criss. Cross Criss. Kiss Cross.&rsquo; The I.1 version ends &lsquo;Slain.&rsquo; That is, <i>sl&acute;n</i> (Irish, goodbye) and stain (the tea-stain of 88.30 [111.20]). We learn in chapter I.8 that ALP's sack and lamp have been borrowed from her postman son Shaun.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn29">  29  The letter is fetched out of the mud in I.5 by the hen. Anna Livia's gifts are described in I.8.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn30">  30  At 164,34 (210.01) the sack <big><font face="wake">N</font></big> is called a &lsquo;culdee sacco of wabbash she raabed&rsquo; (cul-de-sac of rubbish she robbed) and at 282.15 (364.33) HCE describes her gifts as &lsquo;all the riflings of her victuum gleaner&rsquo; (vacuum cleaner).

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn31">  31  HCE is absorbed into the earth. In Norse myth, at the subsidence of the universal flood the body of Ymir became the earth, his hair turned into trees and his eyebrows metamorphosed into the grasses and flowers of the world. Hence 10.08 (12.08): &lsquo;there's nare a hairbrow nor an eyebrusch on this glaubrous phace of Herrschuft Whatarwelter.&rsquo;

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn32">  32  It is a bomb-proof structure for storing ammunition and gunpowder, and was built on the site of the old manor house of Fionuiske in the Phoenix Park. Completed in 1801, the fort was surrounded by a dry ditch equipped with a drawbridge. The whole occupied 2 acres and 3 square perches of ground and was fortified by ten 24-pounders. It also contained barracks for soldiers.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn34">  34  Joyce is saying that ephemeral phenomena are mere manifestations of underlying energies that persist.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn36">  36  The <cite>Wake</cite> Annals are parodies of those printed in Thom's <cite>Dublin Directory</cite>. The first event listed would seem to derive from Thom's notes for 1331: &lsquo;A great famine relieved by a prodigious shoal of fish, called <i>Turlehydes</i>, being cast on shore at the mouth of the Dodder. They were from 30 to 40 feet long and so thick that men standing on each side of one of them could not see those on the other.&rsquo; Stephen Dedalus recalls this same history in <cite>Ulysses</cite>.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn38">  38  The Blue Book of the Liffey. J.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn39">  39  This is a highly irregular image of the slain HCE (<font face="wake">w</font>). Saint Patrick is elsewhere identified with one or other of his two sons.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn40">  40  Five successive groups of invaders occupied Ireland before the ancestors of the Gaels eventually settled there. These were the peoples of Cessair, Parthalon and Nemed, the Fir Bolg, and the Tuatha De Danann. They peoples were all harassed by a race of ferocious sea-robbers called the Fomorians.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn41">  41  This business about wild flowers outlasting the conflicts of mortals is a re-expression of Quinet's famous statement to the same effect. Joyce uses this theme several times in the <cite>Wake</cite> and quotes it almost verbatim (in French) at 218.08ff. (281.04-13). For an analysis of Quinet's sentence as <i>leitmotif</i> see Clive Hart, <cite>Structure and Motif in Finnegans Wake</cite> (1962), pages l82ff.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn42">  42  Mutt's greeting in French, <i>Comment vous portez-vous aujourd'hui, mon blond monsieur</i> (How do you do today, my fair man), is the same as that spoken by the cad in his button-holing HCE in I.2. It is repeated verbatim in various other languages in other places by other characters.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn43">  43  In II.3, during their second encounter, Butt (Mutt) informs Taff (Jute) that on sighting the Russian general (HCE) he (Butt) was &lsquo;babbering and yetaghain blubbering bibbelboy, me marrues me shkewers me gnaas me fiet [his arrows, skewers, knees and feet], tob tob tob beat it&rsquo; (266.16). He seems to remember, and mix up, the blowing up of the Willingdone and Buckley's shooting of the Russian general.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn44">  44  The coins are variously described, as &lsquo;bisons&rsquo; (nickels), &lsquo;trink gelt&rsquo; (trinkets, gold), &lsquo;sylvan coyne&rsquo; (slivers of wood, silver coin), &lsquo;piece of oak&rsquo; (wood, piece-of-eight), and &lsquo;ghinees&rsquo; (guineas). When Jute tells Mutt that &lsquo;Ghinees his good for you&rsquo; (Guinness is good for you), he associates the coins with drink, a big issue in their next encounter.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn45">  45  Clontarf field was formed by filling in with rubbish. HCE's impressive defecation is directly identified with the formation of <big><font face="wake">N</font></big> (the mound, midden, barrow, wheelbarrow, mastaba, kistvaen, dump, refuse heap, grave, as well as tavern and book). In this sense, his extraordinary turd represents the original fecund egg of the cosmos from which creation was hatched. At a different level, the movement is seen as the fall of Humpty Dumpty (HCE equated with his own turd) and the point of assassination as the impact and cracking/fragmentation of the shell.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn46">  46  That is, Viking glebe, grab (a coasting vessel) and/or the vice-king's (HCE's) grave. The Norsemen were slaughtered in a bloody war waged by the Irish under the command of Brian Boru on the shore line at Clontarf. Brian himself fell there. The phrase also suggests the Phoenix Park and the murders of May 6, 1882, thereby connecting Clontarf with the site of the killing of the Willingdone. By II.3, the site has of course shifted again. The dune or mound that contains the dead HCE is extended and by then encompasses a plague grave or mass burial place.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn47">  47  Joyce seems to imply here threat followed by flight: the story of his life.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn48">  48  The Prankquean tale seems in part to embody a Viconian version of the evolution of language from the inarticulate grunts and whines of the inexpressive giants, save when under the influence of great passion (Shit!), with the first words being loud and onomatopoeic utterances. The first language would have been, on this view, a kind of poetic, creative singing.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn49">  49  The Prankquean is an ALP figure; the Jarl is of course an early HCE as a Dutch Van Houten. The Jiminies are his twin boys (<i>Gemini</i>) and the Dummy is his daughter. The names of the two boys, Tristopher and Hilary, were probably suggested to Joyce by Giordano Bruno's motto, <i>In tristitia hilaris hilaritate tristis</i>: in sadness cheerful, in gaiety sad.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn50">  50  The closing of the door is accompanied by the <cite>Wake</cite>'s second thunder-word: <i>Perkodhuskurunbarggruauyagokgorlavorgromgremmitghundhurthrumathunaradidillifaititillibumullunukkunun!</i>) This thunder-word, like the previous one, is an agglutination of elements meaning &lsquo;thunder&rsquo; or &lsquo;to thunder&rsquo; in various different languages.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn51">  51  396.07(509.33) posits a connection between the piece of pastoral poetry and HCE's turd: &lsquo;So he outandouts his volimetangere and has a lightning consultation and he downadowns his pantoloogions and made a piece of first perpersonal puetry that staystale remains to be. Cleaned.&rsquo; Thus the second thunderclap is also the deafening sound of his defecation: as he &lsquo;ordurd.&rsquo;

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn52">  52  Joyce based this episode on an incident in the life of Grace O'Malley (&lsquo;her grace&rsquo;), the Princess of Connacht (Joyce's &lsquo;westerness&rsquo;) or, as the Irish called her, Granuaile (&lsquo;brannewail&rsquo;/&lsquo;grannewail&rsquo;). On returning from England and landing at Howth, she called to the castle of the St Lawrence's in expectation of the hospitality that was then universally afforded to travellers, only to find the doors shut, as the family was at dinner. In retaliation at the perceived slight she kidnapped the young heir and took him to her stronghold in Mayo (&lsquo;Erio&rsquo;). Eventually she returned the boy on the family promising always to leave the castle door open at mealtimes. The <cite>Wake</cite> version is more complicated. The Prankquean calls three times to kidnap not one heir but two, if not three. A great deal of doubling and tripling is going on, encompassing actions, states of warmth, verbs, type of domicile, part of body, colours, speech, and so forth. The reader can pick out these patterns easily enough in a careful reading. One perhaps less obvious pattern is a reference to Saint Patrick's prophetic vision of the three orders of Irish saints when he saw at first all Ireland ablaze, and afterwards only the mountains on fire, and at last only lamps lit in the valleys. Thus, on the three days of her visits: &lsquo;fireland was ablaze&rsquo; at 17.10 (21.16), &lsquo;redcocks flew flackering from the hillcombs&rsquo; at 17.29 (22.03), and &lsquo;valleys lay twinkling&rsquo; at 18.11 (22.27). The first image recurs at 389.29 (501.22): &lsquo;There were fires on every bald hill in holy Ireland that night.&rsquo;

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn53">  53  Joyce provided a key to 18.32–40 (23.16–26), see <cite>Selected Letters</cite>, <a name="8Aug1928" href="../../flett.fwlett.htm#13May1927">13 May</a> 1927. The reader is urged to read this to appreciate how seriously Joyce strived to introduce real depth into his text. Take, for example, &lsquo;O foenix culprit! Ex nickylow malo comes mickelmassed bonum.&rsquo; One can see in this <font face="wake">H</font> as foe, or snake, the culprit of the park; Augustine's &lsquo;<i>O felix culpa!</i>,&rsquo; the phoenix, a symbol used by Michelet to explain Vico's theory of a quadripartite cyclic pattern in history (the squared circle) and used by Joyce to illustrate Bruno's identity of opposites (here, birth and death); Satan (Lucifer or Nick) and the archangel Michael; the Latin phrases <i>Ex nihilo nihil fit</i> and <i>Ex malo bonum fit</i>; as well as an elegant pun on the Latin word <i>malum</i> (apple).

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn54">  54  Joyce comments (<cite>Selected Letters</cite>, 321): &lsquo;the source of the Nile, later supposed to represent <font face="wake">w</font> &amp; <font face="wake">A</font>,&rsquo; hence the names &lsquo;Homfrie Noanswa&rsquo; and &lsquo;Livia Noanswa,&rsquo; a no-answering Albert and Victoria Nyanza.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn61">  61  The Jukes and the Kallikaks were two of a number of families studied by eugenists in late 19th and early 20th century America. The titles of the books tell the story well enough: <cite>The Jukes: A Study in Crime, Pauperism, Disease and Heredity</cite> by Richard Louis Dugdale (1877) and <cite>The Kallikak Family: A Study in the Heredity of Feeble-Mindedness</cite> by Henry H. Goddard (1912).

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn62">  62  This account of the crime or original sin in the park or garden may seem to posit both events, hetero- and homosexual exhibitionism, as occurring at different periods, unlike what is suggested in the I.1 Waterloo episode, and the buggery aspect as graver than that of seduction. The consideration that the second allegation was made by three Welsh Guards reconnects the events. Of interest is the somewhat clearer text of the proto-form in notebook N3 (VI.B.3).153: &lsquo;It is not true that Pop was homosexual / he had been arrested at the request of some nursemaids to whom he had temporarily exposed himself in the Temple gardens.&rsquo;

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn63">  63  Joyce allegedly claimed that an anecdote of his father about a tramp who accosted him in the Phoenix Park (a &lsquo;young man&rsquo; whom he described as a &lsquo;cad with a bicycle&rsquo;) with a request for a match with which to light his pipe was the basis of his book. While this is true only in a very limited sense, the cad story is certainly pivotal and in retelling it Joyce casts his father as HCE.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn64">  64  The cad addresses HCE in Irish, <i>Conas ta tu indiu mo dhuine uasal fionn?</i> These are the exact words spoken by Mutt (in French) to Jute at 13.08 (16.04): &lsquo;Come on, fool porterfull, hosiered women blown monk sewer.&rsquo; The same phrase reappears elsewhere: as for example at 147.25 (186.32), where Sigurdsson addresses Shem in distorted Danish: &lsquo;<i>Where ladies have they that a dog meansort herrin?</i>&rsquo; Joyce emphasises the cad's pipe rather than his bike and has our hero mistake it, if indeed he is mistaken, for a weapon.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn65">  65  Cf. <a name="n03130a" href="../fnbs/n03all.htm#n03130a">N3 (VI.B.3).130(a)</a>: &lsquo;Pop has a Waterbury watch.&rsquo; Jurgensen is another kind of watch. Earwicker's fear of being violently assaulted dogs him throughout the book. It perhaps reflects the Englishman's instinctive dread of the Irishman. The watch that he pulls out may well be a real watch, but it may equally be a shooter (he was quick to draw it, after all) whipped from a holster with the settled intention of perforating the cad with lead. In this sense, the threatening originates in and emanates from HCE. It is he who initiates the menace by raising a staff &mdash; his &lsquo;tigerwood roadstaff&rsquo; or &lsquo;copperstick&rsquo; &mdash; to the cad. Which of the pair is aggressor and which aggrieved remains ambiguous, the sword of certainty (alas) never falling.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn66">  66  This is a particularly appropriate moment rich in gruesome associations. It is the precise hour when HCE, in the role of defecating Russian general, is shot dead by an outraged private (at that insult to Ireland!): &lsquo;precisely the twelves of clocks, noon minutes, none seconds&rsquo; (273.31 [353.30]). It also reflects the timeless time (precisely midnight) at which Ebenezer Scrooge comes face-to-face with his psyche in Dickens' <cite>A Christmas Carol</cite>. In the <cite>Wake</cite>'s dream world, noon and midnight are interchangeable.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn67">  67  That is, the Wellington Monument in the Phoenix Park. This hollow edifice was never completed. A projected accompanying equestrian statue of the Duke himself was omitted. As it stands, it resembles an enormous lead pencil, an erect penis, or an extended telescope.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn68">  68  This unsolicited self-defence, accompanied with a pronounced stammer, is according to certain psychologists indicative of guilt. As cited here, Earwicker's words are <i>as cited by Webster</i> and we can compare this version with that recounted by the cad. The hero's <i>actual</i> spoken defence is quoted at 281.13 (363.20), slightly transposed in time and space, when he openly admits his guilt but in self-exoneration reminds us that, in fairness, all men are sinners and again at 413.34 (532.06) where he flatly repudiates the accusations (trite!) and boasts rather of his impressive civic achievements.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn69">  69  The cad thanks HCE for guilders received. How the issue of money arises is not stated; though some coins are passed over in the earlier Mutt and Jute dialogue. (The <cite>Wake</cite>'s encounters are self-reflexive.) In later restatements of the meeting, the money angle is more realistically explained.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn70">  70  That is, a sovereign or a crown piece, respectively.

Both of HCE's sons are therefore involved in the conspiracy behind the former's downfall insofar as they are implicated in the composition of the ballad the dissemination of which brings it about.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn72">  72  The clapping is truly representative. The thunder-word is a compound of elements in French, Russian, German, Italian, Latin, Irish, and some other languages. Each element means &lsquo;applause&rsquo; (noun) or &lsquo;to applaud&rsquo; (verb).

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn73">  73  Hosty's account is a bit distorted (poetic license) but the business about the two girls and the trouble with the fusiliers are both in evidence. The rann initiates the downfall of the once-respected HCE as, Parnell-like, his good name is dragged through the mud of mockery and vilification and he becomes a pariah, a Cain.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn74">  74  The man in the garden is none other than the cad, though his get-up is described in very Berwick-upon-Tweed terms: &lsquo;scratch wig, squarecuts, stock lavaleer, regattable oxeter, baggy pants and shufflers.&rsquo; He addresses the child hangers-on in his &lsquo;native&rsquo; language, Irish, just as he did Earwicker. His recollection of the details of his meeting with HCE and of Earwicker's stuttered response is faulty; though we are to understand that he represents an essential link in the passing on of the story. Why he fled to England is not discussed.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn75">  75  John D'Esterre was slain by Daniel O'Connell in a duel. Legend has it that O'Connell wore a black glove on his right hand. D'Esterre was a protestant from Limerick, a member of Dublin Corporation, an ex-officer of the marines, and reputedly one of the best shots that ever fired a pistol. The duel, held at dusk on a snowy day at Bishop's Court, was arranged to kill O'Connell. D'Esterre fired first but missed his man. O'Connell fired next, wounding D'Esterre in the thigh, mortally, as he died the following day. O'Connell offered to pay half of his income to D'Esterre's widow, but she declined his offer. Some years later, O'Connell successfully defended D'Esterre's daughter, free of charge, in a troublesome law suit.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn76">  76  This is HCE in a Lewis Carroll role. The girl is one of his child models.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn77">  77  The plebiscite relates exclusively to HCE's prototypal crime in the park involving the two girls and the three soldiers and not to his encounter with the cad, though that is the issue under discussion. We get back to this now and look at subsequent activities.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn78">  78  The place to which Earwicker flees to elude apprehension on a charge of manslaughter, in this version of the saga, is a composite of Dublin, Uruvela (where the Buddha attained enlightenment) and Trieste on the Adriatic (where Joyce exiled himself). The city, the text suggests, was almost granted to him by a charter as bogus as King Edgar's of A.D. 964, which reads: <i>By the abundant mercy of God who thundereth on high divine providence hath granted me the greatest part of Ireland, with its most noble city of Dublin</i>. A fertile land, HCE's new sanctuary is soon to prove as hostile as the city from which he has fled.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn79">  79  What the parcel contains, assuming it is a parcel, is nowhere unambiguously stated. It is at one point the stolen coffin of 53.27 (66.27). At 50.33 (63.07) the assailant calls it a fender. By 65.26 (82.06) it has become a distillery worm, and by 67.08 (84.04), when the attacker picks it up, a &lsquo;humoral hurlbat or other uncertain weapon of <i>lignum vitae</i> (but so evermore rhumanasant of a toboggan poop)&rsquo;. It is thus a dream-formed composite of weapon, bone, hurley stick, bat, staff, tobacco pipe, and pouch. At 67.33 (84.34) it is re-described as a &lsquo;pierced paraflamme and claptrap fireguard.&rsquo; When at 403.01 (518.15) the four annalists question Shaun about the encounter, they put this question to him: <i>The illegal-looking range or fender, alias turfing iron, a product of Hostages and Co, Engineers, changed feet several times as briars revalvered during the weaponswap?</i> Shaun replies that it was an &lsquo;ersatz lottheringcan.&rsquo; At 411.34 (529.22) Luke calls it &lsquo;an ark, of eggshaped fuselage and made in Fredborg into the bullgine&rsquo; (a bomb). Finally, it reappears in Book IV as the hot-water bottle Juva lends to Muta.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn80">  80  This is reminiscent of Sigurdsson's &lsquo;toocisive bottle of Tilsiter&rsquo; in the foregoing Waterloo interlude.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn82">  82  This list of old Dublin pubs relocates the incident (though the ambush began in London) and posits a strong correspondence between the diurnal activities of Hosty and those of the assailant. We can discern a marked conflict running through these early chapters: Lipoleums v. Willingdone <font face="wake">H</font> (weapon: bomb); Cad v.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn91">  91  <i>Magh Elta></i>, the Old Plain of Elta, appears also at 14.09 (17.19), where Mutt speaks of the countless souls that perished there. The plain was historically the most ancient in Ireland and so barren nothing could grow there. An early colonist of Ireland, Parthalon, and his people, a group of some nine thousand in all, died there of a terrible plague. They were buried in a mass grave at Tallaght. The plain is said to have embraced the isthmus of Sutton. Cf. 3.05 (3.05) and 14.04 (17.11).

</p><p> Lough Neagh in Northern Ireland is said to possess the power of petrifaction. On calm days the roofs of the houses of a sunken city are reputedly visible under its waters. Hence the seven towers of HCE's grave. Joyce wrote (<cite>Letters</cite>, III, 26 February 1935) that under the lake &lsquo;there is said to be buried a kind of Atlantis.&rsquo; &lsquo;Others say,&rsquo; he adds, &lsquo;Finn MacCool in anger took a sod of turf out of Ireland and flung it into the sea, making 1) Lough Neagh 2) Isle of Man.&rsquo; The reference to a sod re-connects Lough Neagh (called &lsquo;Lough Murph,&rsquo; another dead sea, at 212.30 (272.23f) with HCE. Hence &lsquo;as much in demand among misonesans as the Isle of Man today among limniphobes,&rsquo; and &lsquo;after the Fianna's foreman had taken his handful&rsquo; at 61.11-14 (76.22-25).

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn92">  92  Billy in the Bowl was a formidable, if legless, beggar of old Dublin. An otherwise handsome and powerful man, he is credited with a number of strangulations. His technique was to have his victim approach closely, out of sympathy, then to catch, choke and rob her (or him).

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn93">  93  Kate Strong, like Billy in the Bowl, was a real old Dublin personage. She was official Scavenger to Dublin, though records attest her besom cleaned but sparingly. In her <cite>Wake</cite> role as Kate the Char (a version of <font face="wake">A</font>) she is married to the boots Sigurdsson (a version of <font face="wake">H</font>).

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn94">  94  Kate's account seems to have been recovered from court records. As witness she pairs with the mysterious &lsquo;W.P.&rsquo; (witness for the prosecution) who in all likelihood is her husband, Joe Sigurdsson. While the dump she describes is her own, it encompasses Earwicker's shack &mdash; &lsquo;a homelike cottage of elvanstone&rsquo; &mdash; with its windows all broken after all the stone throwing. This in turn ties it in with her version of the museum at 9.03 (10.26): &lsquo;It's a candlelittle houthse of a month and one windies.&rsquo; Her dump is also Dublin itself: &lsquo;dumplan.&rsquo;

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn95">  95  A &lsquo;howe&rsquo; (ON) is a hill or hillock or a tumulus or a grave. Wellington's Monument is intended. At 44.20 (56.12), the cad calls it an &lsquo;overgrown leadpencil which was soon, monomentally at least, to rise to be his mausoleum.&rsquo; It is also the Earwicker's domicile/shack. That the area was flooded at the time of the encounter reflects the detail at 29.02 (36.14): &lsquo;above the ambijacent floodplain, scene of its happenence.&rsquo; The path is discussed at length at 63.38ff (80.01ff) where it is described as a <i>vicinal</i> in such poor repair that no trespass is legally possible, as a Flaminian way paved by one hundred thousand slaves, and as Dublin's finest, O'Connell Street. On this occasion of viewing it, it is situated &lsquo;near the Serpentine in Phornix Park;&rsquo; that is, near the monument. Scattered along the path, we are told, are the headstones of the unfortunate slaves who helped to lay it, transmogrified into milestones. In III.3 these details are scrupulously examined by the Four (<font face="wake">X</font>) and the significant business of the path is looked at again; see 371.13ff. (478.06ff).

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn96">  96  In early drafts of this episode, Joyce calls him a &lsquo;wouldbe burglar&rsquo; and a &lsquo;masked man,&rsquo; thereby connecting it with the earlier encounters.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn97">  97  This object, I think we are on safe ground in assuming, is one and the same as the suspicious parcel of 50.20ff (62.28ff.) &lsquo;eluded at some lives earlier.&rsquo; A <i>worm</i> is a spiral pipe used in distilling for condensing liquids. It is here called a &lsquo;handy term for the portable distillery which consisted of three vats, two jars and several bottles&rsquo; of spirits. This implies that HCE is running a shebeen or unlicensed public house. By 66.24 (83.14), the worm has become a war-trophy &lsquo;somethink like a jug&rsquo;, a &lsquo;coctable&rsquo; (revolver).

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn98">  98  The true story of another Pat, &lsquo;Pat the Pedlar,&rsquo; is instructive and could have been lifted out of (or dropped into) the pages of the <cite>Wake</cite>. Pat, a gentle old soul, earned a small living by selling bootlaces, polishes, pencils and hair-combs to passers-by from his pitch on Rory O'Moore (alias Bloody/Barrack/Victoria and Albert/Watling Street) Bridge in Dublin. Pat was also known for his cures for rheumatism, coughs, skin diseases and such like. Where he came from in the morning and where he retired to at night, when not at his stall on the bridge, was never discovered. Pat came to a tragic end in the late 1860's, being quite horrifically murdered one dark winter's night as he started to make his way home after a particularly profitable day. He put up a stiff resistance but was left in a savagely beaten-up state on the roadside, where he was found by some local women who raised the alarm. He was taken to Steven's Hospital and passed away the following morning, but not before he gave a description of his assailant to the police. Little headway was made in solving the crime until one year later when a man closely answering the description of the attacker stumbled, badly shaken, into Chancery Police Station with the extraordinary story that, as he was crossing Watling Street Bridge, he was chased by the ghost of the pedlar. He was convicted of Pat's murder and locked up in a madhouse.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn101">  101  The accused speaks &lsquo;in the vermicular.&rsquo; Joyce may have in mind a parody of a trial he expressed interest in, of a namesake, Myles Joyce, in Irish, Maolra Seoigh, a hirsute native of Galway who was convicted of the murder of five persons (all members of the same family, also called Joyce) in the townland of Maamtrasna on the Galway-Mayo border. Two of his co-accused admitted their guilt, but insisted Myles was innocent of any involvement. Their admissions, however, were deemed insufficient to revoke the execution order. </p><p> The trial was troubling. Myles was a native Irish speaker, speaking not a word of English, the language in which his trial was conducted. No interpreter was admitted and his evidence in his defence was accordingly unheard. Moreover, alleged witnesses in the case were awarded compensation under the direction of the Lord Lieutenant. Myles, alongside his alleged fellow conspirators, was hanged by the British authorities in December of 1882 (James Joyce's birth-year). Two of his co-accused admitted their guilt but insisted Myles was innocent of any involvement. Their admissions, however, were deemed insufficient to revoke the execution order. </p><p> Redress was long delayed but on 4 April 2018 the unfortunate man was granted a posthumous pardon by the President of Ireland, Michael D. Higgins. Descendants of both the murdered men and the hanged man attended a special ceremony at &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in (formerly the Lord Lieutenant's residence) in the Phoenix Park.

The Four (<font face="wake">X</font>) translate it at 75.32 (95.05) as &lsquo;How do you do todo, North Mister?&rsquo;

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn112">  112  Shem's cell is identified at 144.20 (182.32) as &lsquo;<i>Quivapieno</i>, known as Haunted Inkbottle, no number Brimstone Walk, Asia in Ireland.&rsquo;

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn114">  114  The passage includes a short list of songs and composers at 74.29ff. [93.27ff.). Joyce is perhaps suggesting that the courtroom scenes resemble those at Tim Finnegan's wake. The songs listed could well be one sung at an Irish wake.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn115">  115  This section opens with a fox hunt, as did I.2. HCE is the fox. His clothing of coat and boots is suitably transformed into fur. As well as fox, he is here associated with other animals: badger, bear, hare, hound, and so on. His &lsquo;holt&rsquo; is yet another form of the shack (<big><font face="wake">N</font></big>). Later in the chapter it enlarges itself into a tower and/or ziggurat. By the episode's close, it reverts to a simple grave. How HCE manages to survive in the holes he inhabits is much at issue. Here it is on syllabub (milk, port, sherry, and cinnamon mixed) and, later, on grass (compare the living tissue he consumes in section one).

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn116">  116  Through HCE's mangled frame one can discern the escutcheon of the East Breifne branch of the O'Reilly family: quarterly, 1 and 4, <i>vert</i>, a dexter hand apaumee couped at the wrist proper, dropping blood, supported by two lions combatant <i>or</i>. The remaining quarters 2 and 3, <i>argent</i>, on a mount an oak tree with a snake descending its trunk proper, can be found at 79.31 (100.11). This is a most irregular image of the encounter. Things are getting progressively more serious. In I.2, no-one is struck; in I.3, manslaughter is suggested; here we have a full-blown murder.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn117">  117  ALP was the cause of all the trouble, on one view, by writing her letter to the king. HCE, exasperated with the woman, offered (in an early draft published as part of <cite>Finn's Hotel</cite>) to pay ten pounds to anyone who would throw her in the Royal Canal.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn118">  118  Sullivan comments on this aspect of the Kells Document. Joyce, of course, is also referring to his own practice of composing by piecing together multiple fragments of other people's words (works).

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn119">  119  The identity of the current narrator is open to question. It is clearly a bibliographer commenting on a document (Sullivan on the <cite>Book of Kells</cite>) but in <cite>Wake</cite> terms his or her identity is uncertain. Bernard Benstock, writing in <cite>A Conceptual Guide to Finnegans Wake</cite> says, &lsquo;If it is a pedagogical Shem that began the explanations, it is then a hard-headed Shaun that demanded direct information without frills. The Shem who answers remains patronising, but he does modulate his vocabulary to a degree and gets down to a more fundamental level of inquiry, identifying the father figure of the remote past, the surname-less Earwicker of the closing pages of the first and opening pages of the second chapter of the <cite>Wake</cite>.&rsquo; Benstock interprets the chapter as the work of two alternating narrators. This view is supported perhaps by 90.15ff (113.23ff): &lsquo;Let us now drop this jiggerypokery and talk straight turkey as meet to mate,&rsquo; though this may simply be the narrator addressing the reader. It is not really clear that either of the two brothers &mdash; let alone both &mdash; is delivering this lecture. At 88.09ff the narrator refers to Kevin (Shaun) as the sole observer of the hen unearthing the buried letter and proceeds to discuss the fowl's behaviour. This <i>may</i> indicate that the current narrator is one and the same Kevin, now of course many years older. Also, at the close of the episode Shem is described in hostile terms in typical Shaun-fashion. The most likely scenario is that the speaker throughout is Shaun and the silent listener is Shem. This hypothesis is corroborated in I.7, in which what we can presume is the same speaker reappears and is there unambiguously Shaun. Finally, we can note that Shaun, being the postman carrrying the letter, is in the best position to examine it.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn120">  120  The idea of a &lsquo;passionpallid nudity or plaguepurple nakedness&rsquo; tucked under the flap of an envelope cannot fail but put us in mind of Joyce's own private letters to Nora, pornographic tracts delivered in all innocence by an unsuspecting Catholic Irish postman. The writing and other marks on the envelope are discussed by <font face="wake">D</font> (Shaun) later in III.1 when answering the ninth query.

There are, other than the version outlined here, six principal foreshortened forms of the infamous Boston Letter cited in the <cite>Wake</cite>. These are as follows: </p><p> 1 9.29ff (11.22ff): <i>boaston nightgarters and masses of shoesets and nickelly nacks [knickknacks] and fodder allmicheal and a lugly parson of cates [provisions] and howitzer muchears and midgers and maggets With Kiss.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn127">  127  This version ultimately derives from ALP's statement to her &lsquo;Majesty&rsquo; (in a superseded draft section) that she <i>can show anyone the bag of cakes given to me by Mr Earwicker for our last wedding day.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn128">  128  Shaun hints that the letter was either written by or read by a lady while sipping tea. Lydia Languish in Sheridan's <cite>The Rivals</cite> wrote letters to herself. In III.3, <font face="wake">X</font> (the Four) reconsider the possibility that the letter is a page of a diary: a letter written to oneself.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn129">  129  These details do not appear in the fragment of letter that Shaun cites. He is overstepping his text or is in possession of information withheld from us. The relation between ALP's letter as it appears here and the exoneration/exculpation of HCE is obscure, but it becomes clearer in Book IV where the full text of the famous letter is given and the role of the sneak, Magrath, is clarified.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn130">  130  Several of the notebooks Joyce employed in writing the <cite>Wake</cite> are of graph-paper with his noted entered in various directions.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn131">  131  : The symbols listed occur (along with some others) scattered throughout most of Joyce's later notebooks.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn132">  132  The <cite>Book of Kells</cite> is not dated.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn133">  133  Joyce here refers to the argument advanced in Victor B&eacute;rard's cite>Les Ph&eacute;niciens et l&apos;Odyss&eacute;e</cite></font> that in writing his epic Homer derived all of its topographical detail from an Egyptian work that was in turn based on a Phoenician sailing manual.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn134">  134  Sullivan writes, &lsquo;In the matter of its punctuation, the written text is not a very good example of the Irish practice where three dots (:.) mark a period, two dots a comma; (..,) a semicolon; and one dot (.) a comma.&rsquo; The Kells punctuation comprises dots drawn square in shape or quadrilateral and not round, a curiosity Sullivan believes may help in establishing a date of production; hence Shaun and the matter of the holes in the letter-paper.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn135">  135  The parenthesis, &lsquo;kak, pfooi, bosh and fiety, much earny, Gus, poteen?

</div></p><p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn136">  136  That is, Belfast, Cork, Dublin, and Galway. Of the four &lsquo;Nublid&rsquo; is the least acceptable answer, as it does not begin with the letter &lsquo;d&rsquo; and end with the letter &lsquo;n.&rsquo; This anomaly perhaps accounts for the earlier observation that Shaun &lsquo;misunderstruck and aim for am ollo of number three of them and left his free natural ripostes to four of them.&rsquo; Shem refers in his question to the Phoenix Park, to Guinness's Brewery, to O'Connell Street, and to the penchant for horses, for tea, and for philosophy and religion among Dublin's perennially pauperised population.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn137">  137  When <font face="wake">J</font> (Issy) speaks in the <cite>Wake</cite> her words are generally prefaced with an exhortation to listen. <i>Listening</i> is associated with her, as <i>seeing</i> is with <font face="wake">D</font> (Shaun) and <i>hearing</i> with <font face="wake">C</font> (Shem).

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn138">  138  The great elaboration of Shaun's reply to Shem's question was prompted in part by Wyndham Lewis who criticised Joyce's work in his study <cite>Time and Western Man</cite> as being excessively time-oriented. Joyce wrote: &lsquo;No. 11 is <font face="wake">D</font> [Shaun] in his know-all profoundly impressive role for which an &ldquo;ever devoted friend&rdquo; [W.L.] (so his letters are signed) unrequestedly consented to pose (the appellation &ldquo;darling X&rdquo; has also been addressed to me who am hopelessly given to the use of signorial titles). I wanted it [I.6] as ballast and the whole piece is to balance <font face="wake">D</font> abcd [III.1-4] more accurately&rsquo; (<cite>Letters</cite> I, 14 August 1927).

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn139">  139  The Mookse is attired very much in the usual Shaun the Postman get-up, mailbag and all.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn140">  140  The Mookse's arguments in demonstration of the non-tenability of the Gripes' theological and philosophical outlook on life proved more difficult to put together than Joyce had hoped. Writing about this episode, he had this to say: &lsquo;The old catholics Augustiner Kirche are a good example of a Mookse gone Gripes. They separated from Rome in '71 when the infallibility of the pope was proclaimed a dogma but they have since gone much more apart. &hellip; But most important of all they have abolished the <i>Filioque</i> clause in the Creed concerning which there has been a schism between western and eastern Christendom for over a thousand years, Rome saying that the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father and the Son, Greece and Russia and the East Orthodox Churches that the procession is from the Father alone, <i>ex patre</i> without <i>filioque</i>. Of course the dogmas subsequently proclaimed by Rome after the split are not recognised by the east such as the Immaculate Conception. See the Mookse and the Gripes that are West and East, paragraph beginning &lsquo;When that Mooksius&rsquo; and ending &lsquo;Philioquus.&rsquo; All the grotesque words in this are Russian or Greek for the three principal dogmas which separate Shem from Shaun. When he gets A and B on to his lap, C slips off, and when he has C and A, he loses hold of B.&rsquo; (<cite>Letters</cite> III, 3 September 1933) Translating and simplifying the relevant paragraph (156.08-18), Joyce seems to be saying that, while the Mookse with great equivocation was promulgating this and that before the schismatic Gripes he had all but succeeded in co-ordinating his points; but no sooner had be managed to reconcile their respective ideas about the Immaculate Conception and to unify their concepts of the Procession of the Holy Ghost than the logothetes of his ecclesiastical dignitaries were found at variance with the members of his own synods; so his papal infallibility got the hoof along with his <i>filioque</i>.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn141">  141  For &lsquo;accursed&rsquo; we can also read &lsquo;holy&rsquo; or &lsquo;sacred.&rsquo;

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn142">  142  Joyce's description of Shem may owe something to Francis William Newman's description of a young man he calls the Irish clergyman, an indefatigable curate in the mountains of Wicklow. In chapter 2 (&lsquo;Strivings after a More Primitive Christianity&rsquo;) of his <cite>Phases of Faith</cite>, he writes: </p><p> His bodily presence was indeed weak. A fallen cheek, a bloodshot eye, crippled limbs resting on crutches, a seldom-shaved beard, a shabby suit of clothes and a generally neglected person He did not fast on purpose, but his long walks through wild country and indigent people inflicted on him such severe deprivation: moreover, as he ate whatever food offered itself, food often impalatable and indigestible to him, his whole frame might have vied in emaciation with a monk of La Trappe. </p><p> So holy was this man, Newman contends, he &lsquo;had practically given up all reading except that of the Bible.&rsquo; When Shem reads, or tries to read, given the fading light and disorder of his cell, is not the Bible, but his useless, unreadable, blue book of Eccles ( <cite>Ulysses</cite>).

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn143">  143  Shem's &lsquo;first riddle of the universe&rsquo; reappears at 275.31 (356.12) <i>the farst wriggle from the ubivence, whereom is man, that old offender, nother man, wheile he is asame</i>; at 384.23 (495.06) <i>Sylphing me when is a maid nought a maid</i>; and at 474.07 (607.11) <i>The first and last rittlerattle of the anniverse: when is a nam nought a nam whenas it is a. Watch!</i> In the notebooks the question is associated with Shem, with God (see <a name="sd2759i" href="../fnbs/sd2all.htm#sd2759i">SD2 (VI.A):759(i)</a>) and, curiously, with Leopold Bloom (see <a name="n03030b" href="../fnbs/n03all.htm#n03030b">N3 (VI.B.3):030(b)</a>). Shem seems to be pondering his masculinity.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn144">  144  Joyce is referring to his own migration from soul-destroying Ireland, a land divided, to cosmopolitan (as it then was) Europe.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn145">  145  Shaun is talking about wine, of course, of which Joyce himself was very fond. The wine Shaun specifies as Shem's special tipple is <i>Orina di un archiduchessa</i>, known to Joyce as &lsquo;the archduchess's urine&rsquo; and his own favourite. As we read about Shem, we find that he has a great deal in common with Joyce in this self-parody. The book Shem is said to read in his cell is <cite>Ulysses</cite> and the one he is writing is <cite>Finnegans Wake</cite>. The titles of the stories in <cite>Dubliners</cite> can be detected spread out over pages 147-8 (l86-7). <cite>A Portrait</cite> is included at 144.10 (182.19); <cite>Chamber Music</cite> at 145.19 (184.04); and <cite>The Holy Office</cite> at 150.10 (190.13). Nobody reading the present chapter could doubt but that Shem's many failings, down to his piteous eye-patch, derive from Joyce himself. This is in stark contrast the flattering self-portrayals found in his earlier fiction, an indulgence that he here openly mocks.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn146">  146  Shem's cable is a minor motif in itself. It is invariably a request for more money. One sees here again another characteristic of James Joyce.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn147">  147  This is not strictly true. Shem plays all sorts of games in the twilight chapter, II.1.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn148">  148  Joyce is alluding to the British soldiers firing into the crowds at Croke Park in Dublin on &lsquo;Bloody Sunday,&rsquo; 21 November 1920, a brutal senseless reaction to the assassination, by Michael Collins' rebels, of British spies on the morning of the same day.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn149">  149  Shem is similarly treated at 74.16 (93.11), where &lsquo;all the twofromthirty advocatesses within echo, pulling up their briefs at the krigkry <i>Shun the Punman!</i>, safely and soundly soccered that fenemine Parish Poser (how dare he!) umprumptu rightoway hames, much to his thanks, gratiasagam, to all the wrong donatrices (for like your true venison Esay he was dovetimid as the dears at Bottome), to biss Drinkbottle's Dingy Dwellings (toegang) where he shat in (zoo) like the muddy gaolbird who he was.&rsquo;

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn150">  150  Joyce wrote to Harriet Weaver on May 13, 1924: &lsquo;I am very fatigued, in sight of the operating table and half stupefied by the gloom, noise, expense and uncertainty in which I try to work.&rsquo;

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn151">  151  There used to be an &lsquo;ink-bottle&rsquo; house located at Martin's Row in Chapelizod. It is now demolished. It was shaped like an ink-well and had the added charm of having no windows at the front. Shem, according to this account, lives diametrically opposite HCE's shack, their dwellings being located outside, on opposite sides, of the Phoenix Park.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn152">  152  HCE also survives a man-hunt by feeding on his own &lsquo;misplaced fat.&rsquo;

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn153">  153  Cf. Vulg. Ps. 44.2: <i>Lingua mea calamus scribae velociter scribentis</i>.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn154">  154  The presence of the policeman outside Shem's door is understandable when one considers the attempted assassination; but Shaun explains that there was a better reason: the mob still wanted to get in at him. Once again, Shem is very much Earwicker's son.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn155">  155  Sigurdsson greets Shem in distorted Danish, properly <i>Hvorledes har De det i dag, min sorte herre?</i> He appears elsewhere in the text as HCE's handyman around the house, part-time barman and bottle-washer. His role as policeman re-arises in III.4 where, while again pounding his beat, he watches the shadows of the copulating Porters cast on the window blind by the bedroom light.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn156">  156  This list appears on BL ADD MS 47471b 65v. The passage parallels 458.34&ndash;459.17 (589.12&ndash;590.03) where HCE's seven capital failures are enumerated.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn157">  157  Joyce seems to imply frustration of natural conception by condom, something he indulged in himself.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn161">  161  The legitimacy of HCE and ALP's marriage is open to question (see <a name="n08114c" href="../fnbs/n08all.htm#n08114c">N8 (VI.B.6):114(c)</a> and <a name="n21090f" href="../fnbs/n21all.htm#n221090f">N21 (VI.B.20):90(f)</a>).

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn162">  162  These are types of boats.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn163">  163  The washerwoman is combining several answers in one. HCE was born at sea (he has blue in his eye) and came to Ireland as a plunderer. He may have raped ALP before carting her round with him in a parrot-cage (she was very small) that doubled as a lantern. As for getting some money by marrying her, it isn't explained how he did (see <a name="n11110c" href="../fnbs/n11all.htm#n11110c">N11 (VI.B.5):110(c)</a> and <a name="n18037d" href="../fnbs/n18all.htm#n18037d">N18 (VI.B.8):037(d)</a>). His initial taking of ALP, it seems, is the only marriage ceremony she ever got. The physical act of copulation (penetration) is portrayed in the text as a barque barging its way into Dublin Bay and on into the virginal Liffey waters past its labial North and South <i>Bulls</i> (these are sandbanks), so-called after the roaring of surf against them.

But others are more sinister: a cough, water-leg (dropsy), a weak heart, fat calves, snakes, and so on.

The episode at first consisted of only &sect;1-5;&sect;6-7 are late interpolations. The idea of a pantomime was secondary. The games came first and were simply games played on the streets of Chapelizod by the children. In the middle of developing the episode, Joyce turned aside and dealt with <cite>Haveth Childers Everywhere</cite> (III&sect;3B) material before revisiting the <i>Mime</i> in the period 1930&ndash;1932. The parts of notebook N34 (VI.B.27) that were not already dedicated to III&sect;3B and, later, N41 (VI.B.33) were compiled with II.1 in mind.

An account of his use of this book is given in Danis Rose, <i>The Index Manuscript</i>, pages l44-58.

The cathartic work Glugg is planning to write strongly resembles Joyce's <cite>Ulysses</cite>, the chapters of which are recited at 181.06-08 (229.13-16). Glugg speaks of &lsquo;reading off his fleshskin and writing with his quillbone.&rsquo; In I.7, we encounter an older and more mature Glugg (Shem) bottled up in an inkwell house, using a mixture of his own urine and excrement for ink and his own skin for parchment as he writes the slowly unfolding masterful mystery of himself.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn184">  184  Joyce did not need to reach for Quinet in order to find this sentiment of transience well expressed. In a note on a single wildflower, the author Charlotte Grace O'Brien wrote, &lsquo;I found a mass of it growing together only on the southern exposure under the great wall. Now this plant is said to exist only as an introduced species in the British Isles. To account for it, therefore, on this utterly lonely and desolate hilltop, we must look back through the centuries and see the sacred plant in the monastery garden at Askeaton, the first Geraldine home in Desmond. We must think how the seed may, in fact, have been carried up to this watch tower, perhaps by some long-haired daughter of the Geraldines, sent for safety to the mountain fortress. We must imagine how its frail growth (only annual) took hold on the sheltered side; we must see generation after generation of men swept away, the monastery torn down and desecrated, the name of Desmond almost forgotten, the great Geraldine race broken and destroyed: we must see the almost impregnable castle blown to pieces and left as a trampling ground for summer-heated cattle; more wonderful than all, we must realize that time has so gone, that no record is left us of that great downfall and destruction nothing nothing but a few pieces of nine-foot-thick wall, a few earth mounds, and the sacred plant. Irishmen! What national history lies in one seed of that plant!&rsquo;

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn185">  185  Many of the attributes Glugg here ascribes to <font face="wake">H</font> (HCE) were those historically possessed by either Lewis Carroll or Emanuel Swedenborg, Joyce's particular models for the <font face="wake">H</font> of this section.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn191">  191  Joyce equates the wandering of the children in the village streets with the wandering of the Biblical Jews in the desert. This last section is full of Hebrew words and allusions.

The section in between &mdash; a bibliographic <font face="wake">C</font> (Shem) piece &mdash; is free of marginalia. The footnotes, of which there are two hundred and twenty nine, can be ascribed throughout to Issy.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn193">  193  The exact route is specified: a quick left along &lsquo;Livius Lane,&rsquo; by &lsquo;Mezzofanti Mall,&rsquo; diagonally across &lsquo;Lavatery Square,&rsquo; up &lsquo;Tycho Brahe Crescent,&rsquo; past &lsquo;Berkeley's Alley,&rsquo; across &lsquo;Gainsborough Carfax,&rsquo; under &lsquo;Guido d'Arezzo's Gadeway,&rsquo; and along by &lsquo;New Livius Lane.&rsquo; These highly imaginative names Joyce gives to the route reflect the prime concerns of the chapter, referring as they do to exceptional exponents of the arts and sciences: Livy (history), Mezzofanti (language), Lavater (theology), Tycho Brahe (astronomy), Berkeley (philosophy), Gainsborough (painting), Guido d'Arezzo (music), and Livy again (history). </p><p> Some commentators have attempted to correlate Joyce's directions with real Dublin itineraries. Petr Skrabanek (<cite>AWN</cite> 10 (1973), 22-3) suggests that the traveller (who, we may add, is probably riding a bike), after a quick lunch in one of the pubs near Arran Quay, follows the Liffey downstream as far as the Custom House, veers left into Amiens Street to get onto the North Circular Road, passing Berkeley Road on route to the intersection with Phibsborough Road, then descends into the North Circular Road and gets as far as the main entrance to the Phoenix Park before returning along the river. Plotting the route, Skrabanek argues that it traces out a rough <i>vescis pescia</i> as exemplified in the geometrical diagram on page 226 (293), where <i>APL</i> represents the left bank of the Liffey and <i>L&#960;A</i> the North Circular Road. The traveller moves from <i>&#960;</i> to A, turns left at A, goes to L, continues L to P, and thence reaches P to A. The Square (not exactly a square) would be <i>&#960;</i>ALP. Skrabanek somewhat fantastically conjectures (who knows?) that the parallelogram <i>&#945;&#955;&#960;P</i> from the Euclid sketch &lsquo;is the part of the mother's bottom exposed to the lavatory bowl.&rsquo;

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn194">  194  The voyager(s) has (have) comprehended, meditated, pondered, ogled, delighted at and cackled behind the six other wonders of the world: the Pyramids (&lsquo;the cones&rsquo;), Babylon's Gardens (&lsquo;the mured&rsquo;), the Pharos of Egypt (&lsquo;the pensils&rsquo;), the Zeus of Phidias (&lsquo;the olymp&rsquo;), the Temple of Diana (&lsquo;her dianaphous&rsquo;), and the Colossus of Rhodes (&lsquo;his culosses&rsquo;).

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn195">  195  The population of Chapelizod miraculously remained constant from 1905 to 1933 (1,280 persons, living in 225 houses). Joyce alludes to this in his statement that this &lsquo;phantom&rsquo; city was bought and sold &lsquo;for a four of hundreds of manhood in their three and threescore fylkers [figures] for a price partitional of twenty six [shillings] and six [pence].&rsquo; That is, at a considerable loss. Note that 400 x (26 + 6) = 12,800. The figure 63 reminds us that the area comprised by the district of Chapelizod was 63 acres.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn196">  196  In this small part of the text where we sojourn, we find embedded numerous references to placenames in or adjacent to the historical village of Chapelizod, lying a few miles outside Dublin and boasting an origin even older than the metropolis itself. Other than those historical places mentioned in the synopsis above are the following: Riverside, Sunnybank, Buona Vista, Santa Rosa, Mayfield House, Springvale, Orchard Lodge, S. Laurence Lodge, Glenmaroon, Ashview house, Glenthorn, Belgrove, Mulberry House, Boundary Villa, the <i>Wren's Nest</i> (a fine old pub still going strong, where this annotator once drank), the <i>Tap</i> (long gone), the <i>Tavern</i> (a distant memory) and others. Joyce rifled <i>Thom's</i> directory for his information. </p><p> The tavern run by HCE and ALP, with his tobacco-stained hands and her floppy hair, is specified as being precisely two million, two hundred and eighty thousand, nine hundred and sixty &lsquo;lines&rsquo; west of the G.P.O. in Dublin. One can arrive at this number by the multiplication of 1760, 3, 12, and 36: that is, thirty six times the number of inches in a mile. If by a &lsquo;radiolumin line&rsquo; Joyce implies one twelfth of an inch, the figure correlates with an actual measurement of the distance from Chapelizod to the G.P.O.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn199">  199  The passage is associated with a second, mixed-up version of the Maggy letter from Boston. Like the prototype it is incomplete. It reads: <i>Dear A&ndash; N&ndash;, Well, hoping the funeral was a happy one and please accept condolences Poor F.M</i>. [Father Michael] <i>Well, how are all at home and how are you? And thanks for the lovely present of cakes Well, Maggy, hoping soon to hear, must now close With fondest from sender.</i> </p><p> Issy's reading is of the Quinet passage of which Joyce was so inordinately fond of. It originates in Quinet's <i>Introduction a la philosophie de l'histoire de l'humanite</i> (see the <i>Oeuvres Completes</i> (Paris, 1857), volume II, 367-8; see also James Atherton, <i>Books at the Wake</i>, 34 and 276, and Clive Hart, <i>Structure and Motif in Finnegans Wake</i>, l82-200). The sentence, which is slightly altered in Joyce's version translates: </p><p class="set"> Today, as in the days of Pliny and Columella, the hyacinth takes its pleasures in Gaul, the periwinkle in Illyria, the daisy in the ruins of Numancia; and while around them cities have changed masters and names, and many have returned into nothingness, and while civilisations have collided each with each and broken, the peaceful generations of these flowers have continued across the ages following one another down to us, fresh and laughing as on the days of the battles. </p><p> In her second footnote on page 218 (281), Issy asks Teague (Shaun) to translate this &lsquo;gaswind&rsquo; into Turkish, like a good chap, and asks Thady (Shem) to put it into Polish, like a nice boy, on his blotting-paper. Distorted versions of the Quinet motif recur periodically throughout the text. It is in a sense, a central motif of the book.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn200">  200  This section was the first part of the chapter to have been conceptualised and drafted (in 1926). It was later renamed by Joyce &lsquo;The Muddest Thick That Was Ever Heard Dump.&rsquo; (the maddest thing that was ever heard done). Its earliest, most quintessential expression is found in N23 (VI.B.12).021: <font face="wake">C</font> describes a circle / (cuts) / <font face="wake">D</font> bisect a line / <font face="wake">C</font> does theorem for <font face="wake">D</font> / holds candle.

He writes, &lsquo;While the diagram on page 226 (293) is intended to be a symbol of the cosmos, its two cardinal points, A and L, are situated in Ireland as shown in Figure IV, following. The more important of these points, the &lsquo;prisme O&rsquo; (221.30 [287.10]), is identical with the <i>omphalos</i> of III.3, Shaun's navel in the centre of Ireland. This point is defined as &lsquo;the Great Elm with Mearingstone in Foreground&rsquo; (226.32 [293.14]); that is &lsquo;the Great Elm with the Mooring-stone in the foreground.&rsquo; That the centre of Ireland and the Stone of Divisions are intended is clear from the sentence which follows: &lsquo;Given now ann linch you take enn all.&rsquo; The words &lsquo;enn all&rsquo; include an allusion to Lough Ennell, which is just south of Mullingar in Central Ireland, and only a few miles from the Stone of Divisions. Point L is reached when a horizontal &lsquo;copyink strayed line&rsquo; (227.03) [294.02]) is drawn east from Point A, until it reaches &lsquo;Lambday,&rsquo; or Lambay Island, which is three miles off shore, just north of Dublin and on precisely the same latitude as Lough Ennell. Clearly the first, wholly Irish, circle is Shaun's while the other, half in Ireland and half outside it, is Shem's.&rsquo; </p><p> &lsquo;Mearingstone&rsquo; in the above, we may add, also suggests the Mearing stone, a stone situated in a wall immediately south of Dublin Castle; the elm suggests the tree mentioned by LeFanu as long standing in Chapelizod, on the left bank of the Liffey. Further allusions to topography may be found in L.O. Mink, <cite>A &lsquo;Finnegan Wake&rsquo; Gazetteer</cite>. We may note in particular the Leix-Lusk reference, that to Lucan and Allen at 228.01 (295.19), and that to the two Dublin Circular roads at 228.08 (295.31): &lsquo;bicirculars.&rsquo; This last allusion includes yet another candidate for the figure: <i>binoculars</i>, to peer up skirts and behind fig (<i>fig</i>.) leaves with!

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn212">  212  Unfortunately, before we can get on with the story, we are faced with a complication: though a radio programme is being broadcast, it is also an account of actual events unfolding in the public house. There is also some confusion as to who is saying what. Joyce, partly to allow us more certainly to differentiate between the speakers, uses three main variants of the words <i>said he</i>: &lsquo;sagd he,&rsquo; &lsquo;sayd he,&rsquo; and &lsquo;sazd he.&rsquo; These are used as tags indicating the sailor, the agent, and the tailor, respectively. A strange fourth form &mdash; &lsquo;szed he&rsquo; &mdash; appears twice and seems to double for &lsquo;sazd he.&rsquo;

In contrast, in II.3 the male comes and goes, returning (as does the Prankquean) on three occasions and, as she is, looking for something (the suit in his case; soup in hers). In this transformation of the primordial encounter between the sexes, the ship's husband replaces the Jarl. On being shouted at (stop!) as they flee, both of the fugitives flatly refuse (<i>not likely!</i>). The female-male role reversal is accompanied with a shift in the underlying numerology: the Prankquean's <i>forty</i> is re-instantiated as the sailor's <i>seven</i>. These two tales should be read (appropriately enough) in tandem to appreciate the proliferating intertextuality.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn216">  216  At this point <font face="wake">H</font> (HCE) resembles the dissembling sailor that Stephen and Bloom encounter in the cabman's shelter in the &lsquo;Ithaca&rsquo; episode of <cite>Ulysses</cite> who goes outside at one point to spring a leak (take a piss). HCE's actions here as Norwegian captain mimic those in the Phoenix Park where he exposes himself to the two girls while showing his buttocks to the three privates. As elsewhere in the <cite>Wake</cite>, the (re)narration carries overtones of its earlier expression(s), and the deep-structural core persists.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn217">  217  The captain may have been served not a plate of oysters, but the platter of cheese (Icelandic <i>ostur</i>) he asked for.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn218">  218  This is one of a series of allusions running through the story to that of <i>Gideon</i> in the Bible. Joyce posits a correspondence between the fleece of wool and the apparition of the dew, on the one hand, and the suit of clothes and the celebration of the captain's wedding on the other. The Captain, Pukkelsen, alias Horace, plays Gideon to the ship's husband's God. Joyce compounds the sailor-tailor confusion at this stage by re-naming the tailor &lsquo;Ashe Junior.&rsquo; Gideon was the son of Joash.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn219">  219  Who's who, and how many each is, is as vague as can be. As he is wearing a white hat, Kersse, otherwise Tersse, is a <font face="wake">H</font>-type. In Book IV, HCE is told by ALP to take off his white hat when he enters the church. Insofar as he is carrying a coat thrown over his shoulder on his return, and it is not as yet specified where he was in the interim, Kersse is a Butt avatar. At 265.07 (343.13) Butt wears his &lsquo;coatsleeves surdout over his squad mutton shoulder so as to loop more life the jauntlyman&rsquo; &mdash; to look more like a gentleman. The frustrated reader (of the <cite>Wake</cite>), it is instructive to recall, is imagined at 94.21 (119.02) as having his &lsquo;leftoff's flung over [his] homoplate.&rsquo;

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn220">  220  Insofar as there is a scarcely cloaked element of violence between the tailor and the sailor, a cad-HCE situation is emerging. And as both Shem and Shaun elements can be detected in the tailor, it may be that he, Kersse, represents the force <font face="wake">G</font>, the most active of the <font face="wake">C</font> <font face="wake">G</font> <font face="wake">D</font> triad of anti-HCE elements from Chapter I.1. Butt and Taff (<font face="wake">C</font> and <font face="wake">D</font>) merge into <font face="wake">G</font> while still in the public house on the annihilation of HCE at 273.24 (353.22). The expansions and contractions of one character into multiples and vice versa that are early going on, the instability of identity, thus pre-indicate the proximity of conspiracy and threat, a danger that is ultimately realised in an atomic explosion.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn221">  221  In his instantiation as the Norwegian sailor, <font face="wake">H</font> (now distinct from his role as waiting barman) drinks (and eats) quite a lot. His eating, indeed feasting, has about it something of a reverse Last Supper resonance, and regressively reconnects us to his earlier role (in I.1) as the meal itself &mdash; a nice fat salmon on a platter &mdash; and his other role (in I.4) as a self-consuming entity. He eats, is eaten, and eats himself, and is ultimately reduced to molecules and reassembled (in Book IV) as a Humpty Dumpty egg for the reader's breakfast.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn222">  222  The tailor's daughter is clearly ALP and is not, as some commentators have suggested, her own daughter Issy. What we have here is yet another version of how ALP and HCE came to be married. In corroboration of this view, when in Book IV as she prepares for her death ALP recalls the occasion of their first meeting, she says &lsquo;I was but teen, a tiler's dot&rsquo; (a tailor's daughter). See <a name="n50173a" href="../fnbs/n50all.htm#n50173a">N50 (VI.B.37):173(a)</a>.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn223">  223  The actual events of just such a night and HCE's intercourse with ALP are related in III.4.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn224">  224  Joyce uses stout as a male/HCE symbol, and tea as a female/ALP one. An important tea motif is the tea-stain on the letter from Boston (Mass.).

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn225">  225  Among the drinkers we can now discern a Shem-type (&lsquo;touchwood&rsquo;), a Shaun-type (&lsquo;shenstone&rsquo;), as well as the four gospellers with their respective emblems of man, lion, bull and eagle.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn226">  226  Cf. 27.39 (35.01): &lsquo;They tell the story how one happy-go-gusty Ides-of-April morning ages and ages after the alleged misdemeanour when he MET a cad with a pipe.&rsquo; Encounter (generally hostile) is signalled in the <cite>Wake</cite> by the occurrence of the everyday phrase &lsquo;How do you do today, my good man,&rsquo; or some close variation. Here the phrase is given in Russian and Irish (<i>Zdravstvuyte gospodin?</i> and <i>Conas ta tu, a dhuine uasal?</i>, respectively).

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn228">  228  There is a Prankquean-sailor reversal in the previous section; here there is a Kate-Sigurdsson reversal. In I.1 he was the messenger crossing the battlefield; here the messenger is Kate.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn229">  229  Joyce seems to be saying that a traveller stopping at the cottage (the &lsquo;izba&rsquo;, HCE's tavern) can be sure of hearing the great old story told to him of how the king who since has died once drew rein outside.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn230">  230  It is possible that this also implies a worsening of the weather outside the tavern.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn231">  231  Sigurdsson seems to represent HCE after his fall. Kate, on the other hand, seems to represent the widowed ALP after HCE's demise (real or imagined).

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn232">  232  That is leg before wicket (cricket phrase) and thus technically bowled out. This fragment recalls the street interview where sample opinions as to the ethical appropriateness of HCE's behaviour towards (and possibly with) the two young ladies are listed.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn233">  233  The <cite>Wake</cite> version is more elaborate. The basic conflict is extended to encompass a wide spectrum of antipathies: soldier against general, juvex against senex, son against father, plebeian against aristocrat, rebel against conservative, communist against fascist, and so on. Some commentators read in Joyce's retelling the ritual slaying of a (divine) king (<font face="wake">H</font>) by a tribal conspiracy (<font face="wake">C</font> <font face="wake">G</font> <font face="wake">D</font>); others find in it the cannibalistic immolation of a totemic primal father. Yet another sees the General as the Biblical Saul, with Butt as David and Taff as Abishai. (David twice has the opportunity to kill Saul: first, when on going into a cave to shit in privacy he finds him asleep; but, in compassion, rather than do him in as he snores there helplessly, he removes a piece of his clothing in token. On a second occasion, he again stumbles across Saul as Saul sleeps; and, though egged on to kill him, he again refuses.) Another interpretation describes the general ornithomorphically as lusty Cock Robin. At the point of assassination, Butt, the sparrow (that ill-bred plebeian of the gutters), kills the General, the robin (the king of birds) with a bow and arrow: </p><p> At that instullt to Igorlands! Prronto! I gave one dobblenotch and I ups with my crozzier. Mirrdo! With my how on armer and hits leg an arrow cockshock rockrogn. Sparro! (273.21ff). </p><p> Ellmann writes that Joyce told the story to Samuel Beckett, explaining that he was having difficulty in fitting it into the <cite>Wake</cite>, &lsquo;If somebody could tell me what to do, I would do it.&rsquo; Beckett's alleged droll remark, when Joyce brought up the piece of turf &mdash; <i>another insult to Ireland</i> &mdash; seems to have given Joyce a way fully to &lsquo;localise&rsquo; the story. The comment is echoed in the <cite>Wake</cite> at the culmination of the tale (see above) and also earlier at 8.31 in the I.1 Waterloo episode (&lsquo;waggling his tailoscrupp to insoult on the hinndoo seeboy&rsquo;). These two episodes should be explored for further correlations.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn236">  236  This is a representation of HCE as a gorilla/guerrilla spying through his telescope on the girls pissing while the boys behind him are watching.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn237">  237  Joyce embedded many names of historical race-horses into this parenthesis: Epiphanes, Boozer's Gloom, Emancipator, Major X, Eagle's Way, Faustin, and several others. The event is a <cite>Wakean</cite> conflation of the Lincolnshire Handicap, once run at Caerholme, the Grand National Steeplechase (these two constituting the so-called Spring Double), and the One Thousand Guineas, one of the now-discontinued Liverpool Cups.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn238">  238  This interruption, a televised horse-race, is yet another version of the original situation in the Phoenix Park where HCE (&lsquo;Emancipator&rsquo;) exposes himself to two urinating girls (&lsquo;too early spring dabbles&rsquo;) while (un)knowingly revealing his backside to the glare of three bachelors (&lsquo;three buy geldings&rsquo;)

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn240">  240  This passage is saturated with technical terms relating to the mechanism of (early) television. See Danis Rose, <cite>The Index Manuscript</cite>, pp. 204-8.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn241">  241  Butt seems here to be confessing to, or protesting, indulgence in a little illicit carnal pleasure himself. Many of the terms at this point, <i>sisterhood</i>, <i>missus</i>, <i>bludger</i>, <i>tout</i>, and the place-names, <i>Malay Street</i> (Singapore), <i>Lyndhurst Terrace</i> (Hong Kong), <i>Scott's Road</i> (Shanghai), are taken from a study of the white slave trade (prostitution); see Danis Rose, <i>The Index Manuscript</i>, pp. 121-4.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn242">  242  HCE is posing a distorted version of Shem's &lsquo;first riddle of the universe&rsquo; from I.7: <i>When is a man not a man?</i> Shem's answer (which only he himself knew) is: <i>When he is a sham!</i>

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn243">  243  The book seems to be Oscar Wilde's <cite>Salome</cite>, illustrated by Aubrey Beardsley, though HCE confuses it with other books: <cite>The Arabian Nights</cite>, for example. He identifies himself with Herod, Issy with Salome, and his detractor(s) with the John the Baptist. At another level the book may be no more than a tattered copy of <cite>Titbits</cite> (perhaps the one Leopold Bloom perused and misused in <cite>Ulysses</cite>), some pages of which he is glancing at prior to using them as toilet-paper. In conformity with the Middle Eastern theme the text at this point is heavily impregnated with words in the Farsi (Persian) language. See in this connection Bernard Benstock, <cite>Phil. Quart</cite>. 44 (1965) 100-109, and Danis Rose, <cite>AWN</cite> 12 (1975) 12. HCE's praise is taken almost verbatim from the &lsquo;Approbations&rsquo; in Kinane's <cite>Saint Patrick: His Life &amp;c.</cite>

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn244">  244  The customers list the charges of heresy historically brought against Pelagius, confusing HCE with Adam. This seems temporarily to reduce him to base matter: iron ore, sulphides, metal, prussiates, quartz, blood, musk, hashish, nacre, chlorine, and bone ash.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn245">  245  The interlude, a mosaic of musical terms and names of noted composers, portrays the twin Issy phenomenon as Jenny Lind and Florence Nightingale as well as Procne-Philomena to HCE's Terseus.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn246">  246  The description comprises elements derived by Joyce from Rowntree's classic study, <cite>Poverty</cite> (used more extensively in III.3), especially the section dealing with the homes of well-to-do artisans.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn247">  247  Who this <i>judex</i> is remains unclear. HCE describes him as a beautiful young soldier. He perhaps implies the composite three troopers.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn248">  248  Hosty's ballad is closely modelled on an old Dublin street song ridiculing the tenor Tenducci: </p><p class="set"> <i>Tenducci was a piper's son, <br> And he was in love when he was young <br> And all the tunes that he could play <br> Was Water Parted from the Say.</i>

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn249">  249  By having HCE's tavern turn into a ship, and the four old men (<font face="wake">X</font>, unlike the 12 customers <font face="wake">O</font> who get safely off the boat) fall drunk into the Liffey, Joyce smoothes the interface between the ending of II.3 and the environment of the following chapter (II.4): open sea, a ship cruising along and four old men in the water peering in through the portholes.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn250">  250  This part of the section is saturated with references to the field sports of rugby and cricket, almost as if this latest anti-HCE tirade was a sort of match or game.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn251">  251  That is: his own son, Shaun, as will happen in Book IV.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn252">  252  This is the same figure, more or less, that HCE mentions at 281.30 (364.04), &lsquo;twingty to twangty too thews and leathermail coatschemes,&rsquo; where he claims to be the donor of a gift to everyone living in the vicinity.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn253">  253  Joyce particularises here the better known of Diarmuid's exploits: how he bound men with ropes so tightly that none could ever loosen the knots; the <i>geasa</i> or moral obligation put upon him by Grainne to carry her off, explaining to him that she had seen him before at a goaling (hurley) match and admired his freckles and red cheeks; his words sweet as the song of the robin; how he pole-vaulted over doors rather than quietly walk through them; his sleeping out of doors in makeshift beds woven of soft rushes; his eating of the magical berries of the quicken-tree that gave immortality; the three kisses he disrespectfully gave Grainne in the sight of Finn; and so on. See in this interesting context, Danis Rose and John O'Hanlon, &lsquo;Finn MacCool and the Final Weeks of Work in Progress,&rsquo; <cite>AWN</cite> (17, 69-87, October 1980).

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn254">  254  HCE is now portrayed in the character of King Roderic O'Conor, the last High King of Ireland. It was during his reign that the country first became subject to England. He died in 1198 at the age of ninety after a reign of thirty two years. HCE's metamorphosis into O'Conor began earlier at 285.39 (369.18).

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn264">  264  Joyce presumably imagined that he was limiting the incoherence of what he was doing by maintaining the original sequence.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn271">  271  Shaun's yawn echoes the Latin declension <i>amo</i>, <i>amas</i>, <i>amat</i> &mdash; I love, thou loves, he loves &amp;c. It has a certain cadence that puts one in mind of the book's end<i>: A way a lone a lost</i> &amp;c.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn272">  272  Shaun's attitude to Shem is unchanged from I.6, where he disavows any responsibility for his brother's welfare, while at the same time professing that he cares for him. His ambiguity is succinctly stated at 317.15 (408.18): &lsquo;I'm an everdevoting fiend of his.&rsquo;

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn274">  274  The narrator, speaking in the Royal plural, reports direct speech, as if relating the encounter to another. The questions are all but one qualified: we remembered; we explained; we agreed; we proposed; we gathered; we pursued; we responded; we knew; we all requested; we suggested; we went on to ask; we fore-supposed; and, finally, we still so fancied.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn275">  275  In substantiation of his veracity regarding his piety, Shaun recites a prayer.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn276">  276  Shaun is himself the <i>logos</i> (letter), addressing and delivering himself. His barrel is the envelope.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn277">  277  The prototypal fable on which Joyce constructs his re-imagined version, Aesop's <cite>The Ant and the Grasshopper</cite>, is that of the prudent ant and the spendthrift, live-for-the-moment grasshopper, roles Joyce apportions to Shaun and Shem respectively. &lsquo;Ondt&rsquo; is a Norwegian word meaning &lsquo;hard&rsquo; or &lsquo;ill,&rsquo; and &lsquo;gracehoper&rsquo; is an amusing pun on a grasshopper always hoping for grace. The two insects parallel the Mookse/Gripes couple from the earlier fable in I.6. Joyce went to some pains to incorporate hundreds of insect words (both entomological terms and foreign-language words for common insects) into the text of the fable, much as he did theological references in the Mookse skit. Interestingly, a text used in <i>both</i> fables is the Egyptian <cite>Book of the Dead</cite>. To illustrate Joyce's use of &lsquo;insect words&rsquo; consider the following lines at 323.37ff (417.10ff): </p><p class="set"> The Gracehoper, who, though blind as batflea, yet knew, not a leetle beetle, his good smetterling of entymology, asped nissunitimost lous nor liceens but promptly tossed himself in the vico, phthin and phthir, on top of his buzzer, tezzily wondering wheer would his aluck alight </p><p> One can follow the gist of this; but an entomologist who was also a polyglot would be able to discern in the foliage of the words all the creeping, crawling insects: grasshopper, flea, beetle, <i>Schmetterling</i> (German for &lsquo;butterfly&rsquo;), wasp, nit (German <i>Nisse</i>), louse (Greek <i>phtheir</i>) and lice, bee (buzzer), and so on. The whole fable is made up of sentences like this. Joyce explained his game to Harriet Shaw Weaver (<cite>Selected Letters</cite>, pp 329-32) and provided her with a key to many of the well-hidden allusions.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn279">  279  Shaun's throaty cough is expressed as another (the penultimate) hundred-lettered thunder-word. This one is composed of various words meaning &lsquo;cough&rsquo; &mdash; German <i>husten</i>, Latin <i>tussem</i>, Italian <i>tosse</i>, French <i>toux</i>, Welsh <i>peswch</i>, Greek <i>bex</i>, and Russian <i>kasel</i>, for example.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn280">  280  The four female insects are named Floh, Luse, Bienie, and Vespatilla. Uncharacteristically, this particular foursome does not seem to represent an instantiation of <font face="wake">I</font> (Issy), who features in the fable as a different twosome, &lsquo;Dehlia and Peonia&rsquo;, <font face="wake">H</font>'s (HCE's) &lsquo;druping nymphs&rsquo; who spend their waking hours busily &lsquo;bewheedling&rsquo; him.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn281">  281  This father figure is of course <font face="wake">H</font> (HCE). His chemical composition is cited at 322.21 (415.04-07): &lsquo;seven bolls of soap, a lick of lime, two spurts of fussfor, threefurts of sulph, a shake o&rsquo; shouker, doze grains of migniss and a mesfull of midcap pitchies.&rsquo; This recipe derives from a list on page 284 of N33 (VI.B.4).

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn282">  282  Joyce posits certain resonances between the Gracehoper of III.1 and the Prankquean of I.1; for example, its thrice-repeated movement in space.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn287">  287  This numerological balance was discussed by Ian MacArthur, &lsquo;Structure and Motif in Jaun,&rsquo; (<cite>AWN</cite> 15 (1978), 67-73), where he also argues that the structure of the chapter follows a sexual tumescence-detumescence pattern. The &lsquo;rise&rsquo; extends from the beginning to 345.05 (444.25), the &lsquo;penetration&rsquo; from 345.06 &mdash; 352.20 (444.26 to 454.07), the &lsquo;climax&rsquo; from 352.21 &mdash; 354.30 (454.08 to 457.04), the &lsquo;ejaculation&rsquo; from 354.31 &mdash; 364.34 (457.05 to 470.10), and the &lsquo;withdrawal&rsquo; from 364.35 &mdash; close (470.11 to the end). MacArthur suggests that the phallic and religious themes (Shaun as cross-bearing Christ) run parallel throughout the piece and that these can be reconciled if we apply the notion of Augustus, &lsquo;Like a bridegroom Christ went forth from his chamber and came to the marriage bed of the cross and there, in mounting it, He consummated his marriage.&rsquo;

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn294">  294  This parallels the incision in the side of Christ.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn295">  295  Issy's act, producing a handkerchief, parodies Veronica's in wiping the face of Jesus with a cloth. As &lsquo;nosepaper&rsquo; her gift is also notepaper and, by extension, the &lsquo;Dear Maggy&rsquo; letter itself.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn296">  296  Shaun's drinking champagne suggests St. John 19.28-30: &lsquo;After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst. Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a sponge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth. When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, <i>It is finished</i>: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.&rsquo; Shaun's cherished drink is clearly a chaliced one. His body (in the liturgical sense) or, rather, that of his proxy is the host. The proxy, Shaun claims, will arrive &lsquo;incessantly&rsquo; (instantly/unceasingly) in the &lsquo;fraction of a crust&rsquo; (breaking of host/fraction of second). He is Shaun's &lsquo;altar's ego in miniature,&rsquo; that is, Shem. Interestingly, the proxy is also strongly associated with Jonathan Swift.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn297">  297  By introducing his sister to his proxy, Shaun mimics Christ. Cf. St. John l9. 25-27: &lsquo;Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother and his mother's sister [Christ's &lsquo;aunt&rsquo;], Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene. When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman behold thy son! Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour the disciple took her unto his own home.&rsquo;

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn298">  298  We can read more about Shem and his appetite for eggs in I.7 and II.1.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn299">  299  In I.6 Shaun also suggests that Shem takes himself off to somewhere inaccessible.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn304">  304  Writing to Harriet Weaver, Joyce explained: &lsquo;The Maronite (Roman Catholic) liturgy, the language of which is Syrian, is at the back of it. On Good Friday the body of Jesus is unscrewed from the cross, placed in a sheet and carried to the sepulchre while girls dressed in white throw flowers at it and a great deal of incense is used. The Maronite ritual is used in Mount Lebanon. <font face="wake">D</font>b departs like Osiris, the body of the young god being pelted and incensed. He is seen as already a Yesterday (Gestern, turning back his glance amid wails of &lsquo;Today!&rsquo; from To Morrow (to-maronite's wail etc). The apostrophe balances the hyphen Guesturn's, Tomaronites.&rsquo; (<cite>Letters</cite> I, <a name="8Aug1928" href="../../flett.fwlett.htm#a8Aug1928">8 August 1928</a>). </p><p> Joyce was inordinately fond of this verse (from Matins of the Little Office of the Blessed Virgin Mary and the third Lesson (Ecclus. 24, 17-20), followed directly by the Te Deum, read at the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, on 15 August) for its lyricism, and cites it in the Belvedere chapter in A Portrait, where he writes of young Stephen &lsquo;when it fell to him to read the lesson towards the close of the office&rsquo; reading it &lsquo;in a veiled voice, luring his conscience to its music.&rsquo;

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn305">  305  <font face="wake">D</font>'s role as envelope is also stated at 335.01 (431.21) where he is said to deliver himself; earlier in III.1, at 316.36 (407.32), he addressed himself.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn306">  306  The text offers us a second leave-taking, in which we see <font face="wake">D</font> take off in his barrel-boat, a bucket, follow the tide and pass under a bridge &lsquo;a stadion beyond Ladycastle&rsquo; (probably Island Bridge) where, narrowly avoiding fouling its buttress, he ducks. The barrel is here seen as the &lsquo;funnel of his fanmail shrimpnet&rsquo; at 365.39 (471.26). He is ultimately lost to sight as he floats &lsquo;through the statuemen.&rsquo;

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn307">  307  This description places <font face="wake">D</font> in the role of Michael Collins, hero of the Irish independence movement who was gunned down by a rival faction.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn308">  308  This end to Jaun-Shaun, strongly suggestive of Christ's descent into Hell, is given a religious tone by the oblique use of two quotations from Saint John: &lsquo;Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth&rsquo; (12.35) and &lsquo;I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work&rsquo; (9.4). The reader will also detect use of that fine liberating ballad, <i>The West's Awake</i>.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn310">  310  Yawn achieves this remarkable circumposition by virtue of the ancient geographical divisions of Ireland into halves/quarters/fifths and so on. Because he lies at the exact centre of Ireland, where all the provinces meet, and is spread-eagled he has (in one division) one arm in Connacht, a leg in West Munster, the other leg in East Munster, an arm in Leinster, and his head in Ulster. His upper moiety lies in <i>Leth Cuinn</i> (the &lsquo;Half of Conn&rsquo;) and the lower in <i>Leth Moga</i> (the &lsquo;Half of Mug&rsquo;) after an even earlier division of the country into two parts by a ridge known as <i>Eiscir Riada</i>. </p><p> The geographical and mystical centre of Ireland &mdash; called <i>Uisneach</i> &mdash; was located in county Meath. It was there, reputedly, that Mide lit the first fire &mdash; it blazed for seven years. There also was set the Stone of Divisions, a five-ridged pillar stone marking the locus of the coming together of the five partitions of Ireland (there are now only four). Legend associates Uisneach with the tongues of druids (hence, perhaps, Yawn's many voices) and with a huge ash tree (corresponding to Joyce's Wellington Monument/Yggradrasil [the three-rooted evergreen ash tree of Scandinavian mythology that binds together Asgard, Midgard, and Niflheim]).

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn311">  311  It may be that they speak out of turn within a short time of starting their interrogation, a neat correlation having proved to be too much for Joyce's eclectic manner of composition.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn312">  312  The Four are mixing up a lot. They refer indirectly to the strange facts that there are, reputedly, no fewer than <i>six hundred</i> words in the Breton language that signify &lsquo;apple,&rsquo; yet there is not a single word in Irish to mean &lsquo;sorcery.&rsquo; Even so, it seems that what they are after is to get to grips with the mystery of <font face="wake">H</font> (HCE), the majestic quarry, possession of which knowledge will somehow provide them with a solution to their despair. But they add, in Latin, that the more &lsquo;majestate&rsquo; is explained to them, the less they understand it.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn313">  313  Shaun (as Shem) is expressing something obscure here, touching on Saint Patrick's discovery of the key to the mystery of the Holy Trinity that he expressed in clover (German <i>Klee</i>) in the fields (French <i>champs</i>).

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn314">  314  This is the same complaint Shaun made in III.2, when he was making up excuses to Issy for his leaving Ireland.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn315">  315  The boat under discussion is variously described: as a &lsquo;burial battell; as the &lsquo;boat of millions of years&rsquo; that ferried the souls of the blessed through the darkness of death; as the Boat of Hennu; as an &lsquo;orange boat;&rsquo; as a longboat, the <i>Dragon of Denmark</i>; as a French boat, the <i>Pourquoi Pas</i> (a French polar research vessel of this name sank off Iceland in 1936); but it is principally the boats in which Saint Patrick sailed in his coming to Ireland, first as a slave and, again, as teacher. Patrick had to put up with some wolfhounds while on board, hence Shaun's terror of wolves. <i>The wolves of Fochlut! By Whydoyoucallme? Do not flingamejig to the wolves!</i> This also echoes Patrick's statement in his <i>Confessions</i> that while reading the beginning of a letter containing the Voice of the Irish, as he put it, he seemed in that moment to hear the voices of those &lsquo;who were beside the Wood of Foclut, which is near the Western Sea.&rsquo; Parnell, of course, is also comprehended in the wolf allusion.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn316">  316  This is a sentiment that was often said of Daniel O'Connell, the man who famously brought about Catholic Emancipation in Ireland.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn317">  317  Vaughan was the first Dublin Postmaster. He is a <font face="wake">D</font> figure. The &lsquo;document number one&rsquo; was an item important in the Irish war of independence. It is viewed here as a form of <the letter being delivered to the king.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn319">  319  Loosely, this translates: You cannot make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn320">  320  The Four are perplexed at the shifting about of personalities within Shaun, and seem preoccupied in arriving at the core Shaun-in-himself.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn321">  321  <i>Splosh</i> is a slang term for money. Throughout the <cite>Wake</cite> Shaun is approached by Shem with requests for money. There is a strong autobiographical element in this, as Joyce spent his life cadging money off people, including from his brother Stanislaus.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn322">  322  In I.7, Shem is surprised by Sigurdsen as he is bringing home the &lsquo;Christmas&rsquo; (the fowl for Christmas Day dinner).

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn323">  323  The I.2 version of the ballad begins, <i>Have you heard of one Humpty Dumpty</i>.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn325">  325  The statement ALP wishes to repudiate is, presumably, that regarding the dropping of drawers on HCE's part. Many of the fragments in this defence, for example regarding the rival grocer, are repeated and extended in her letter to the King in Book IV.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn327">  327  The Four recall that HCE was in the grocery trade, selling sugar, butter, sausages and the like, as well as being a publican who sold spirits. His &lsquo;fat-spitters&rsquo; (sausages) were particularly relished in the wider community.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn328">  328  Immediately prior to the period of silence the interrogators are busily trying to re-establish direct contact with Yawn's <i>pneuma</i>. They are picking up a lot of interference: mainly fragments of a lovers' dialogue. The lover, like Parnell, begs that if he is to be sold, let the sellers at least get his price. The Four cannot identify the speakers (the lines being crossed as it were) and call down into Yawn, by now transformed into a radio receiver or transceiver, to let them know the <i>title</i> (the name) of the speakers, seemingly here as elsewhere their primary concern. The last words they manage to wedge in before finally losing connection is <i>Tit! What is the ti?</i> This is of course a pun on <i>time</i>, recalling the cad's asking for the right time that set everything in motion.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn329">  329  The Four are attempting to ascertain, as they did earlier in I.4, the exact details of the alleged assault(s) upon HCE. The place Yawn describes as the scene of the crime is, clearly, Kate's midden with its partly putrefied parsnips. As it is out in the park, it is, naturally, open and unprotected and generally wind-swept. The Wellington Memorial is re-described here as a huge, magical tree: the legendary triple-rooted Yggdrasil. The signpost really indicates topographical distances, though Yawn argues that it was a sign to warn trespassers off.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn330">  330  The original (alleged) assault between HCE and the cad took place as the bell tolled out twelve.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn331">  331  This is a curious account of the incident of the Continental lodger earlier recounted, itself a typical HCE-cad encounter.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn332">  332  This is perhaps the most convolute version of the assault in the <cite>Wake</cite>. We note that all of the different assaults, self-reflexive as they are, are misremembered. At this stage no hope remains of actually reaching the truth about any of them.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn333">  333  Yawn is speaking at this point in the lisping voice of Sylvia Silence, the girl detective, who earlier commented on HCE's guilt during the street interview.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn334">  334  This (408.25 [525.21]) is the fourth and final version of the rann; the others are found at 287.11 (371.06) and 381.25 (491.16). The original is at 35.19ff (44.20ff).

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn335">  335  As they proceed with their questions, the Four seem to be delving deeper and deeper into the past.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn339">  339  HCE's actual encounter with the king is detailed in I.2. He has again somewhat exaggerated his role.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn340">  340  The children only appeared in the first draft of the picture gallery; the others were added later (levels 2 and 2+, respectively).

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn341">  341  This can be surmised from the evidence that though <font face="wake">H</font> (HCE) ejaculates (at the moment of cockcrow) he &lsquo;never wet the tea.&rsquo; This last must mean that <font face="wake">A</font> (ALP) either fails to reach a sexual climax or (like Molly) fails to conceive.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn342">  342  The bedposts' positions are: Say! Eh? Ha! (435.21 [559.21]) &mdash; the meseedo (439.06 ]564.04]) &mdash; Sidome (453.36 [582.29]) &mdash; Two me see (459.35 [590.24]).

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn343">  343  <i>Quartan</i> is said of a fever or ague characterized by the occurrence of a paroxysm every fourth day.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn344">  344  A tumbrel (or tumbril) is a tip-cart for carting and shooting dung, sand, stones, etc. Sigurdsson with his dung-cart is here duplicating Kate's role as town scavenger. The text suggests Sigurdsson has a bottle of ale stashed in the bole of a tree.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn345">  345  These are mostly Danish words. Sigurdsson's haul includes binoculars (<i>kikkert</i>), eyeglasses (<i>briller</i>), buttons (<i>knapper</i>) and ribbons (<i>baand</i>), gloves (<i>handsker</i>) and stockings (<i>stomper</i>), lipsticks (<i>sminke</i>: rouge, makeup) and vinegar bottles (<i>eddiketflasker</i>).

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn346">  346  It would appear to be HCE she sees, though the text suggests it is perhaps King O'Toole himself or perhaps only his legendary goose, magically rejuvenated by Saint Kevin, or a ghost.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn347">  347  Cf. I.2, 27.28 (34.26): &lsquo;a first offence in vert or venison which was admittedly an incautious but, at its wildest, a partial exposure with such attenuating circumstances as an abnormal Saint Swithin's summer and a ripe occasion to provoke it.&rsquo;

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn348">  348  Cf. I.4, 62.29ff (78.16ff): &lsquo;Foughtarundser &hrllip; had not been three monads in his watery grave.&rsquo;

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn352">  352  We find very many allusions to different games in this chapter, with &lsquo;play&rsquo; being interpreted in two of its senses, beginning here &lsquo;Check action. Matt!&rsquo; (checkmate), &lsquo;move,&rsquo; &lsquo;gambit,&rsquo; &lsquo;eight and eight, sixtyfour&rsquo; (squares on the playing board in chess), &lsquo;knight,&rsquo; &lsquo;queen,&rsquo; &lsquo;huff&rsquo; (a move in the game of draughts), &lsquo;rake&rsquo; (the chess piece, a rook), &lsquo;pieces,&rsquo; &lsquo;pawn,&rsquo; &lsquo;castle,&rsquo; &lsquo;chequered,&rsquo; &lsquo;stalemating backgammoner,&rsquo; &lsquo;whist,&rsquo; &lsquo;game,&rsquo; and so on. <font face="wake">H</font> (HCE) and <font face="wake">A</font> (ALP) are portrayed as two chess pieces, the king and queen, that are moving/being moved across a board (the floor of the bedroom).

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn353">  353  <big><font face="wake">N</font></big> (the book, the pub, the letter) as a step. the one square in the king's direct control (chess).

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn354">  354  The text reads: &lsquo;Nogen, of imperial measure, is begraved beneadher&rsquo;, there is first-class whiskey below, but also suggesting (considering the Danish <i>nogen er begravet</i>: someone is buried) that <i>a king is buried hereunder</i>. This casts the tavern (<big><font face="wake">N</font></big>) as HCE's tumulus or mound, and associates it with Howth Head (Irish <i>Binn Eadair</i>). This reinforces the HCE/Finn cross-identity.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn355">  355  The two rooms face one another and are separated by a tiny landing. The right/left opposition is repeated several times, here in Spanish, <i>derecho</i>/<i>izquierdo</i>, and Danish, <i>tilhojre</i>/<i>til venste</i>: thus &lsquo;to reachy a skeer do! Still hoyhra, till vensta!&rsquo;

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn356">  356  &lsquo;Biddles&rsquo; is probably Issy's pussy, though it may equally be a doll. At a different level Tiddles is Issy's alter-ego.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn357">  357  We are back in a period predating the rest of the book where the children are of school-going age or older; here, <font face="wake">C</font>, <font face="wake">D</font>, and <font face="wake">I</font> (Shem, Shaun and Issy) are infants. We peer into the past, perhaps at HCE's final act of sexual intercourse.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn358">  358  This is the Irish expression for Christ's staff. Shaun will become a bode (postman). This staff reappears many times and in many forms in the text, for example at 123.34 (155.23) as the &lsquo;jewelled pederect&rsquo; the Mookse uplifts &lsquo;to the allmysty cielung.&rsquo; By the time we reach 368.03 (474.01) it has become a mere walking stick, a &lsquo;staff of citron briar, tradition stick-pass-on,&rsquo; lying by Yawn's side.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn359">  359  It is possible that the four watchers are actually in the children's rooms and peering into their beds; this would explain the striking sense of immediacy of vision. The Four fear, then, not alone that their whispers but also that their footfalls may wake the sleepers.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn360">  360  The heel belongs to Shaun. At 438.30 (563.24) the brothers are named &lsquo;Jerkoff and Eatsup.&rsquo; That is, Jacob and Esau. Shem's spilled &lsquo;ink&rsquo; may be semen. Consider in this context <i>Genesis</i> 25.24-26: &lsquo;And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb. And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau. And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel: and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac <i>was</i> threescore years old when she bore him.&rsquo;

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn369">  369  This extended description of the king's arrival and the ensuing celebrations parodies that of King George IV's arrival in Dublin. The then Lord Mayor, Abraham Bradley King, presented to the king on his arrival in the centre of the city the keys of the City of Dublin, kissing his hand as he did so. The king, royally pleased at this obsequiousness, knighted (the appropriately named) King on the spot. </p><p> The promised arrival of a king, of course, is also that which has already happened: that of the king and retinue outside Humphrey's tavern in I.2. As then, HCE carries here a pole or stick of some sort. The present version, however, is greatly altered. HCE is no longer a mere gardener or gatekeeper. The king's conferring on him the name <i>Earwicker</i>, which was in I.2 no more than a jest on the spur of the moment, is here associated with great formality and a knighthood. And whereas in the earlier version Humphrey did no more than stutter out an apology for his strange get-up, in an intervening account of the famous meeting &mdash; III.3: 416.14 (535.11) &mdash; he claims to have addressed the king with the unforgettable words: </p><p>&mdash; Handshakey Congrandyoulikethems, Ecclesency!</i>

Most of the references, which derive from lists in notebooks N53 (VI.B.46) and N56 (VI.B.41, pages 118-11), are to placenames (see ***), but not all: &lsquo;from the picalava present in the maramara melma&rsquo; at 465.05 (595.27) derives from &lsquo;Maramara&rsquo; and &lsquo;Pikalaba&rsquo; two terms specifying the &lsquo;classes&rsquo; into which the islanders (and all of their possessions) are divided: a <i>maramara</i> man must marry a <i>pikalaba</i> woman and vice versa, and their children will be <i>pikalaba</i> who cannot inherit <i>maramara</i> property, and so on.

Finally, three versions of &lsquo;Meath&rsquo; are listed (though there are in Ireland actually only two, Meath and Westmeath): &lsquo;for larksmathes, for homdsmeethes, for quailsmeathes&rsquo; (the last of these brings us back to the beginning with supper (<i>kvallsmat</i>). The county names omitted from the list are: Dublin, Cork, Kilkenny, Mayo, Derry, Tyrone, Down, and Tipperary.

This is because the allusions fall into groups of twos, threes, fives, sevens, and nines of associated elements. If all these pattern-words are removed from the text nothing is left behind.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn391">  391  The version given here is based on the first draft dictated to Nora Joyce in notebook N03 VI.B.3.042-5.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn392">  392  Regarding this, Joyce wrote to Frank Budgen in August 1939: &lsquo;Reread the second paragraph in the hagiographic triptych in Part IV (S. L. O'Toole is only adumbrated). Much more is intended in the colloquy between Berkeley the arch druid and his pidgin speech and Patrick the arch priest and his Nippon English. It is also the defence and indictment of the book itself, B's theory of colours, and Patrick's practical solution of the problem. Hence the phrase in the preceding Mutt and Jeff banter &ldquo;Dies is dorminus master&rdquo; = <i>Deus est Dominus noster</i> plus the day is Lord over sleep, i.e. when it days&rsquo; (<cite>Letters</cite> I, 406; <cite>Selected Letters</cite>, 398). </p><p> The confrontation takes place somewhere between the hills of Tara and Slane, nine miles to the north-east. In this connection consider also Joyce's explication (translated from the original Italian): &lsquo;Tara was the Mecca and the Jerusalem of the ancient Irish. The island was a pentarchy = 5 kings. One for each of the four provinces, Ulster, Munster, Leinster, Connaught and the fifth, the high king (<i>ard ri</i>) was crowned at Tara. Saint Patrick went there to confront the druid priests, just like Moses in Egypt. He performed every kind of miracle, too. Every fire in Ireland was supposed to be extinguished except the royal fire at Slane, I think. Patrick roused the druids' ire by lighting the Paschal fire. It was Holy Saturday.&rsquo; (<cite>Letters</cite> III, 345).

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn393">  393  Muta, we are reminded, may actually be seeing the English planter (the gardener, Porter/HCE) with his carts and cannons marching through the blood and filth of the Cabra battlefield in Dublin.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn394">  394  The king, in I.2, on his arrival at HCE's abode slakes his thirst with water, as he does here. Tar water was Bishop Berkeley's panacea and baptismal water Patrick's spiritual tonic. Hence the coming antagonism is a battle of waters.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn395">  395  Thomas Cowan (in a private communication) suggests that the piece is a simple conventional contrast of the philosophies of Idealism and Realism (modern style) in a religious setting. The druid he sees as a form of Duns Scotus, reading &lsquo;Entis-onton&rsquo; as &lsquo;Being of being&rsquo; or God. (In this context see <a name="n03095b" href="../fnbs/n03all.htm#n03095b">N3 (VI.B.3):095(b)</a> and <a name="n12048b" href="../fnbs/n12all.htm#n12048b">N12 (VI.B.14):048(b)</a>). &lsquo;Balenoarch&rsquo; he reads as another God symbol, Melville's great white whale. &lsquo;And,&rsquo; he writes, &lsquo;of course <cite>FW</cite> accepts them all: the day (sun) religions and the night (northern forest) religions. The theme is that <cite>FW</cite> bets on all of them. The volume must be saved though Paradise is lost.&rsquo;

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn396">  396  Compare N3 (VI.B.3).064: &lsquo;Culter of the thing in itself see the grass (r + o + y + b + I + v),&rsquo; that is, the spectral colours absent green.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn397">  397  For another version (appropriately Japanese) of this argument see Masanobu Fukuoka, <i>The One-Straw Revolution</i> (Rodale Press, Emmaus 1978): &lsquo;In the world there are seven basic colours. But if these seven colours are combined, they become white. When split by a prism the white light becomes seven colours. When man views the world with &lsquo;no-mind&rsquo; the colour in the colour vanishes. It is no colour. Only when they are viewed by the seven-coloured mind of discrimination do the seven colours appear.&rsquo;

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn398">  398  Compare the Russian General who wipes his backside with a sod of green grass. The other priests meanwhile are neutralised between the &lsquo;possible viriditude&rsquo; of the druid and the &lsquo;probable eruberuption&rsquo; of the saint. This would posit a Berkeley green v. Patrick red antipathy (see in this context <a name="n05141m" href="../fnbs/n05all.htm#n05141m">N5 (VI.B.2):141(m)</a>).

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn399">  399  Patrick employs the rainbow and not the shamrock to get his point across to the Gaels. His practicality remains the same. The sage professes a form of mysticism candidly incomprehensible to the common folk whereas he, the saint, provides them with an immediate and sensible concept. Patrick equates solar light with the integrated godhead and the rainbow, &lsquo;the firethere the sun in his halo cast&rsquo;, with the three divine persons Father, Son and Holy Ghost.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn400">  400  In so doing he shoves his four fingers and thumb up Pat's arse.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn402">  402  St. Laurence O&apos;Toole, the city&apos;s patron saint, was born in Dublin in the year 1100 and canonised in 1225. His feast day is 14 November. He was consecrated Bishop of Glendalough, and was thence, the first native-born bishop to do so, translated to the Archiepiscopal See of Dublin. When a young man, Laurence was held captive by Dermot MacMurrough, King of Leinster, after the saint&apos;s father was suspected of treachery. He later found refuge at Glendaloch monastery. O&apos;Toole signed the capitulation of the city with Earl Strongbow, but while the treaty was completing the Anglo-Normans, led on by Miles and Raymond de Cogan, forced an entrance and sacked and plundered the town. O&apos;Toole&apos;s property alone was spared, as a mark of respect. He died in 1180 in Eu, northern France. His body was buried in Normandy, but his heart (physically) returned to Ireland. This heart was held as a relic in Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin, but, now some 800 years old, was stolen in 2012. The box in which it was kept was a wooden one, protected by an iron cage. And displayed in the cathedral&apos;s Chapel of St Laud. The thief prised the cage open and took off with the box. Nothing more was heard or seen of the missing heart until April 2018 when, mysteriously, the sacred relic was discovered in the Phoenix Park and restored to the cathedral.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn403">  403  This &lsquo;second Adam&rsquo; (so-called by Joyce in conversation with Jacques Mercanton) is no other than Carolus Linnaeus, the great Swedish botanist and taxonomist. He invented the modern system of nomenclature in the life sciences. Many of the terms used in this passage derive from his work on the sexual system of the plants; see John O'Hanlon, &lsquo;In the Language of Flowers,&rsquo; <cite>A Wake Newslitter</cite> 16 (February 1979) 9-12.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn404">  404  I.5 had around this time been extended to include an exhaustive investigation of a second, much less decipherable missive and doubts were cast upon the letter's (fictive) authenticity.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn405">  405  These questions originally formed part of the Letter itself but were extracted by Joyce when he reassembled the piece for Part IV.

It is true of course that in times past it was quite common in Ireland to find pubs combined with groceries (indeed pubs combined with funeral shops), the same premises selling food by day and drink by night. More relevant is the fact that as a &lsquo;spiritual breakfast&rsquo; the letter should be full of allusions to HCE's morning fare (milk, bacon, butter, sausages, pudding, mushrooms, cups of tea, followed by a drink and a smoke and even, perhaps, a purgative: a kingly meal indeed!).

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn411">  411  This the first of ALP's verbal assaults on her enemies conjures up the image of Humpty Dumpty falling off his wall and consequently an image of the fall of HCE.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn418">  418  Much can be read into this extraordinarily complex metaphor. The &lsquo;urogynal pan&rsquo; refers to Original Sin and to bread baked using woman's urine (lant). &lsquo;Adam&rsquo; and &lsquo;Finn&rsquo; relate to the continuity of the paradigm of paternity. The &lsquo;crossmess parzel&rsquo; is both Christmas parcel and crossword puzzle. Finally, the term unifies the allusions in the Letter to Christmas and its pantomimes, to Paradise, to Eve who was tempted by the serpent, provoking the Fall, and the enmity put by God between snake and woman and between its seed and her seed. ALP in writing the Letter combines the roles of Eve and Mary (the &lsquo;second Eve&rsquo; destined to crush the serpent's head underfoot). She (Mary) accomplished this by presenting to mankind its Christmas parcel, Jesus Christ, so that her seed by his crucifixion (the &lsquo;crossmess&rsquo;) and resurrection could undo the evil of Original Sin. Anna's overriding emotion is &lsquo;thanks&rsquo; (gratitude, akin to Augustine's <i>O felix culpa</i>, Happy the fault!) that the event occurred, as it alone made possible glorious and uncertain future events.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn419">  419  In mediaeval Ireland the newly elected chief took on the clan name; thus, for example, becoming known as &lsquo;the O'Reilly.&rsquo;

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn420">  420  Rollo (historically) was the leader of a gang of Northmen who, in return for accepting the rite of baptism, were granted land in Northern France. This resulted in the formation of Normandy, the Normans, and, ultimately, the conquests of England (in 1066) and Ireland (in 1172). Rollo is a Shaun/HCE figure.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn421">  421  The weather worsens. By the end of her monologue (and of <cite>Finnegans Wake</cite>) rain is lashing down on the cold, indifferent waters of Dublin bay.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn422">  422  <i>I am leafy, your goolden, so you called me, may me life, yea your goolden.</i> What Anna is referring to here is the scene mentioned in the letter where HCE woke up beside her in a sweat and called her &lsquo;goldylocks.&rsquo; One can discern in this Joyce's sole direct use of the name May Goulding, the maiden name of Mrs Simon Dedalus (representing Joyce's own mother). It is perhaps appropriate that old Joyce remembers his mother in old ALP remembering her father.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn423">  423  These are the two gossip-mongering washerwomen allied to tree (quicken) and stone (pebble) who spun their yarns about ALP over their scrubbing in I.8.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn424">  424  ALP does not seem to realise that breakfast has already been served. Perhaps she slept through it, or, as Clive Hart suggests, time stands still through Part IV.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn425">  425  ALP means not only visiting the church with HCE, but also calling on the Earl of Howth as she did (as the Prankquean) in I.1.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn426">  426  ALP is repeating the Prankquean's riddle to the Jarl of Howth from I.1. This version also echo the cad's asking HCE for a light for his pipe.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn427">  427  ALP is &lsquo;exquisitely pleased about the loveleavest dress&rsquo; she has. As the chapter draws to a close, the dress gradually disintegrates. Joyce spoke of it to Jacques Mercanton (&lsquo;The Hours of James Joyce,&rsquo; <i>Portrait of the Artist in Exile</i>), who writes, </p><p> &lsquo;With angelic tenderness so moving in that rebellious angel, and on a tone of confidence and wonder, Joyce evoked the last voyage of his heroine. She wears her beautiful gown, all leafy; but, behold, little by little her fianc&eacute;e's moving dress is coming apart: one leaf and then another flees towards the sea on the fugitive waters; one leaf glides on a wave that goes to mingle its foam with eternal waves.&rsquo; </p><p> <i>A leaf, just a leaf, and then leaves</i>. Here she murmurs again. <i>I only hope whole the heavens sees us. For I feel I could near to faint away. Into the deeps. Annamores leep.</i> </p><p> She carries one last leaf with her to remind her of life. And all things are reflected in their opposites; for the leaf is the leaf she first took to herself in the Garden of Eden. ALP does not ever renounce that original sin.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn429">  429  There is a strange balance here with ALP's being replaced, much as HCE-Finnegan was replaced at the opening of the book, in I.1.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn430">  430  This is the first draft reading as entered in N57 (VI.B.47).040-41.

</div></p> <p class="spbr"><div class="nbunit" id="edn431">  431  Discussing the conclusion of his book, Joyce told Louis Gillet: </p><p> In <cite>Ulysses</cite>, to depict the babbling of a woman going to sleep, I had sought to end with the least forceful word I could possibly find. I had found the word &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, which is barely pronounced, which denotes acquiescence, self-abandon, relaxation, the end of all resistance. In <cite>Work in Progress</cite> I've tried to do better if I could. This time, I found the word which is the most slippery, the least accented, the weakest word in English, a word which is not even a word, which is scarcely sounded between the teeth, a breath, a nothing, the article &ldquo;the.&rdquo; (See Louis Gillet, <cite>Claybook for James Joyce</cite>, translated by Geo. Markow-Totevy [Abelard-Schuman, London and New York, 1958], page 111].) </p><p> We might add that the large blank space on the last page (which, perhaps symbolises moisture-laden air and reflects the large black flea-sized dot of &lsquo;Ithaca&rsquo;, another sleep symbol) between &lsquo;the<i>&rsquo;</i> and &lsquo;Paris, 1922-1939,&rsquo; <i>also forms part of the book</i>. The very <i>last</i> correction he made to his exhaustingly corrected text before it was published concerned it: </p><p> Page 628: Please print the Place and Date much lower approximately where I indicated or lower (BL Add. MS 47488 240).
